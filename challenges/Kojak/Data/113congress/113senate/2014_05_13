Mr. President, we have seen in the last week or two \nRepublicans just throwing things at the wall hoping something will \nstick. They brought down the energy efficiency bill as a result of \nthat. They rescinded informally an agreement that I was convinced we \nhad. Here is why this happened. One need only look at why we have not \nheard these endless speeches in the House or the Senate on ObamaCare, \nthe Affordable Care Act. That has dissipated. It has been several \nweeks--it is hard to believe but several weeks--since we have had a \nvote in the House on doing away with ObamaCare, repealing it. Why is \nthat? There is no better illustration of why that is happening than \nsomething called ``The Plum Line'' in the Washington Post today. It is \nshort, but I would like to read it. The headline is ``Going quiet on \nhealth care.''\n\n       As Benghazi fever rises among Republicans--\n\n  This is an editorial comment. That is another thing they threw at the \nwall to see if it would stick--\n\n     the Hill reported yesterday that the House GOP has ``gone \n     quiet'' on Obamacare. There are no scheduled votes or \n     hearings on the Affordable Care Act. When contacted by the \n     Hill newspaper, most GOP campaign committees wouldn't say \n     whether they would launch any new attacks on the law.\n       As the Hill put it: ``The lack of action highlights the \n     GOP's struggle to adjust its message now that enrollment in \n     the exchanges beat projections and the uninsured rate is \n     going down.''\n\n  They have tried a number of things since ObamaCare is no longer very \nhigh on the radar screen. A couple of weeks ago they said they would \nchange direction and go after me. One of my friends--a Democratic \nSenator--said: I wish they would do that in my State. Nobody knows who \nyou are.\n  The point is that they are getting desperate for something to change \ntheir tune. Benghazi is one. There will be other things that will come \nout in the next few weeks.\n  I carry on reading this article:\n\n       At the same time, it noted that GOP operatives overseeing \n     Senate races remain ``conscious of the need to keep a \n     drumbeat going against the law.'' The question now: If \n     Republican officials really are backing off on Obamacare, \n     will the base go along?\n       A new CNN poll illustrates the situation nicely: It finds \n     that far more Americans want to keep Obamacare than repeal \n     it. At the same time, only a majority of Republicans want \n     repeal and only a majority of Republicans think the law is \n     already a failure.\n       The poll finds that 49 percent of Americans want to keep \n     the law with some changes, while another 12 percent want to \n     keep it as-is--a total of 61 percent. Meanwhile, only 18 \n     percent want to repeal and replace the law, and another 20 \n     percent want to repeal it, full stop--a total of 38 percent. \n     That's 61 percent for keeping the law and 38 percent for \n     repealing it. Among independents, that's 55 percent to 44 \n     percent.\n       How is it possible that Americans can disapprove of \n     Obamacare but support keeping it? Part of the answer lies in \n     the another question CNN asked. It finds that a total of 61 \n     percent say that it's a success or it's too soon to tell \n     whether it's a success. By contrast, 39 percent say it's \n     already a failure. Among independents, that's 58 percent to \n     42\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\n     percent in favor of those who would give the law a chance to \n     work over time.\n       All this is a reminder that at this point, attacks on the \n     law--such as they are, anyway--are all about keeping the base \n     lathered up in advance of the midterm elections. But there \n     are six months to go, and already even some Republican \n     officials appear to be realizing that the anti-Obamacare \n     energy is draining away.\n\n  Remember, 61 to 38.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. President, it was not all that long ago the economy was in the \nthroes of the great recession. Less than 6 years ago the world economy \nwas taken to the brink of collapse before beginning a gradual recovery. \nWhile American markets have returned to their prerecession levels, the \nrecovery for millions of workers and their families has been slower in \ncoming. In Nevada, we continue to dig our way out of the recession. \nAlthough things are better, we still have a long way to go.\n  Today the Senate begins debate on legislation that continues to help \nmany Nevadans and countless Americans as they recover from the \nrecession. This bill before us extends current tax provisions that have \nbolstered American families and businesses, saving money and growing \nour economy. For example, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act is \nsomething the State of New Jersey depended on significantly and Nevada \nand virtually every State.\n  Nevada's home market was greatly damaged by the economic downturn. \nMany of my State's homeowners succumbed to foreclosure. For many years \nNevada had the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation. For struggling \nNevadans battling to keep their homes, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt \nRelief Act offers much needed help.\n  This provision provides relief to homeowners who otherwise would owe \ntaxes on the debt forgiven through a mortgage loan modification. Here \nis why we did it. The IRS had a rule which said that if you bought a \nhome for $10,000 and the recession hit and you had to sell it for \n$6,000, you would be taxed at the $10,000 rate. It is hard to believe, \nbut that was the rule. That is why we passed this law. We are now \ntrying to extend that. It is very important. It allows underwater \nNevadans and those in other States around the Nation to get a measure \nof financial relief, while giving a much needed boost to the State's \nhousing market.\n  In addition to mortgage relief, this tax extenders legislation also \nincludes an extension of the State and local sales tax deduction. No \none has worked harder on that than Senator Cantwell from Washington. \nThis deduction provides working middle-class families, many of whom are \nalready pinching pennies, with a fair shot at providing for their \nfamilies. It allows them to deduct local and State sales taxes, helping \nthem keep more money in their pockets.\n  The tax extenders bill is not only helping our constituents who have \nbeen victims of the economic downturn, it is also spurring job growth \nand local economies.\n  The renewable energy tax credit has played an important role in \nNevada's economy. This tax credit has helped attract investments of \nover $5.5 billion into Nevada's clean energy economy. So people who \nhave never seen, for example, solar panels, come to Searchlight and you \nwill see almost 4 miles of solar panels--millions and millions of them \nwith no break for miles. It is amazing. It looks like--I remember when \nI was a kid we would drive the Las Vegas highway and we would see \nmirages. That is what it looks like. It looks like water, but it is \nnot. It is solar panels covering miles and miles.\n  The tax credit dealing with energy has been important. Through clean \nenergy tax incentives, loan guarantees, and the State's renewable \nenergy standard, Nevada is fast becoming a leader in the renewable \nenergy world. As renewable energy grows in Nevada, jobs multiply. All \nNevadans deserve a fair shot at a good stable job. An extension of the \nrenewable energy tax credit is important to the State's energy \nconsumers, local economies, and working families. That is the same all \nover the country, not only Nevada.\n  There is something called the theater tax credit. The movie industry \nhas had it for a long time, but that is a provision in this bill that \nboosts Nevada's economy and virtually every economy around the country. \nFor example, Las Vegas and Reno are home to many theatrical productions \nthat benefit from the extension of the film tax credit. The theater tax \ncredit allows hotels and resorts in Nevada--and around the country--to \ninvest in high-quality productions which draw tourists from around the \nglobe.\n  While the examples I just mentioned are especially important to \nNevada, this legislation has many more provisions that benefit millions \nof people all across the country. For example, the research and \nexperimentation tax credit promotes innovative development by some of \nAmerica's best companies and requires that global companies receive \nthis assistance to locate research and development centers in the \nUnited States.\n  The work opportunity tax credit is important and provides an \nincentive to businesses to hire under- or unemployed Americans. There \nare also education benefits in this bill, such as the deduction for \nelementary and secondary teachers' out-of-pocket expenses. This \ndeduction ensures that teachers who are going the extra mile for our \nchildren are not being punished financially.\n  These are just a few examples of the beneficial credits and \ndeductions that comprise this tax extenders legislation, but there are \nmany others. Our constituents are depending on us to extend these \nprovisions, many of which expired at the end of 2013. We will not pull \nthe plug before our Nation's recovery is complete. By passing this tax \nextenders package, we will build our Nation's economy more quickly. We \nwill continue to promote innovation, encourage industry, and create \njobs.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in passing this \nlegislation. Let's work together to bring American families and the \neconomy a fair shot.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Senate Diminished\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Many years ago, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge called the \nSenate ``the most powerful single chamber in any legislative body in \nthe world.''\n  Imagine making that kind of statement about today's Senate. Instead \nof a strong, independent voice at the vanguard of American \npolicymaking, what has the Democratic-run Senate become? It has become \na campaign studio, a late-night punch line, the place where the far \nleft gets its way and the middle class gets left behind.\n  We saw this again yesterday when the majority leader was so \ndetermined to prevent the consideration of Republican amendments that \nhe killed every Democratic Senator's amendment in the process. He \ndidn't seem to care about letting the more than 4 million people in my \nState have a say on one of the most important issues affecting their \nlivelihoods--coal. He didn't seem to think the millions of Americans \nrepresented by his own Democrats deserved a meaningful say on energy \neither.\n  Even after Senate Democrats from States such as Alaska, Maine, \nColorado, and Arkansas put out press releases touting the kinds of \nideas contained within their amendments, no amendments were allowed.\n  The fact that some of these same Senators are now trying to convince \nothers of how moderate and influential they are, it is ridiculous. By \nbacking the majority leader's power play instead of standing up for \ntheir constituents, they show where their loyalties lie.\n  Let's remember. The majority leader apparently thought the American \npeople didn't deserve a say on energy, at a time when many in the \nmiddle class are struggling with high energy bills, a lack of jobs, and \nstagnant wages, the kinds of things that could be helped with smarter \nenergy policy. He also blocked this debate at a time of growing global \nenergy crises that demand American leadership.\n  Moments such as those were when our country used to come together in \nthe Senate, when we used to have a serious discussion and actually pass \nserious legislation to solve serious problems, but not today, not in \nthe Senate anymore. Today it is a place where the majority leader seems \nto deliver a daily monologue about almost anything but jobs, where \nDemocrats obstruct serious ideas and where they have shut down \nmeaningful debate on so many major issues.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  Think back to last week when Senate Democrats declared that \naddressing global warming was the moral crusade of our time and then \nrefused to even debate or consider legislative measures to actually \naddress it or when the American people were calling out for us to pass \njobs legislation and Senate Democrats put forward legislation that \ncould actually cost up to 1 million jobs, all while they continued to \nblock serious, House-passed job-creation bills.\n  Meanwhile, Washington Democrats' repeated attempts to pass the buck \non gridlock are now bordering on absolute farce, just a complete farce. \nLast week we saw a fact-checker from a major leftwing paper debunk one \nof their favorite talking points about filibusters, giving it the \nhighest possible rating for dishonesty.\n  The charges that have been made about Republican filibusters were \ngiven the highest rating for dishonesty by a left-leaning newspaper. \nThis is what the fact-checker said: ``On just about every level, this \nclaim is ridiculous.'' This is the fact-checker for a left-leaning \nnewspaper responding to these daily charges about Republican \nfilibusters: ``On just about every level, this claim is ridiculous.''\n  So let's be clear. It is time for Senate Democrats to look in the \nmirror. Under Democratic rule, the Senate has become the place where \nserious legislation comes to die, the graveyard for good ideas. That is \nthe main reason President Obama wants so badly to keep his Senate \nmajority this November. It is his castle moat--the moat around the \ncastle--the last thing standing between him and signing the serious \nlegislation the middle class deserves but the far left hates. It is his \nbuffer against having to approve things such as Keystone Pipeline.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is a project almost everyone knows will create \nthousands of good jobs at a time when we need them very badly. It is a \nproject the American people support overwhelmingly, but of course the \nfar left hates it, and the far left controls today's Washington \nDemocratic Party.\n  I will tell you one thing the far left does like, though--seeing \nheadlines such as this last week from the AP: ``Democratic Leader \nBlocks Senate Vote On Keystone.'' This is the President's majority \nleader they are talking about. Both he and they are hoping to keep \ntheir Senate majority this November so they can see even more headlines \nsimilar to that one.\n  The American people are going to have their say. In the meantime, it \nis time for the majority leader to start worrying about today's Senate. \nThe American people are tired of waiting for this body to act on the \njobs bills Senate Democrats continue to blockade. They are tired of all \nthe show votes.\n  Our constituents already know the Senate Democratic agenda for the \nrest of the year was drafted by campaign staffers anyway. They would \nhave been able to figure that out even if our Democratic friends hadn't \njust said it; that the agenda was drafted over at the Democratic \nsenatorial committee. But enough is enough. The American people sent us \nto the Senate to do something about jobs and address the issues that \nactually matter to their daily lives. It is time the Democrats, who run \nthe Senate, drop the diversions and finally work with us to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:10 a.m. will be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week the Wall Street Journal published \nan article entitled: ``Obama Team Crafts President's Midterm-Election \nPitch.'' I want to read from the article's opening. This is what the \narticle said:\n\n       The White House is carving out a role for President Barack \n     Obama in this fall's midterm elections, which he will try to \n     pose as a choice between the parties' economic visions. . . . \n     The driving theory in the White House is that this election, \n     like every one since the 2007 recession, is foremost about \n     the economy. Mr. Obama already has been drawing contrasts \n     between his economic program and that of Republicans.\n\n  That is from a Wall Street Journal article of last week.\n  All I can say is that Republicans welcome this debate. We agree this \nelection will be first and foremost about the economy, and we look \nforward to discussing the contrast between our economic program and the \nPresident's. I am just surprised the President wants to discuss it \nbecause even many Democrats realize the Democrats' economic record over \nthe past 5 years isn't going to win them any elections.\n  The Wall Street Journal article quoted Democratic pollster Mark \nMellman, who said:\n\n     . . . the key for Democrats is to frame the election as a \n     choice between governing philosophies. ``If it's a referendum \n     on whether you like the way Democrats have governed . . . \n     that's a harder election for us to win.''\n\n  So since they can't run on their record, Democrats are going to make \nthe case their philosophy offers the best hope for working Americans.\n  The Journal goes on to quote Joel Benenson, a pollster for the 2008 \nand 2012 Obama campaign, who says:\n\n       The fundamental question here that the country faces is: \n     Which party has a philosophy and an approach that puts \n     average, hard-working Americans front and center? . . . We \n     ought to be making that the centerpiece of the campaign.\n\n  Democrats have had 5\\1/2\\ years to take an approach that puts average \nhardworking Americans front and center, but their record has not been \npretty. Despite the fact the recession technically ended almost 5 years \nago, our economy continues to limp along. In the last quarter, growth \naveraged a miniscule one-tenth of 1 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment \nhas remained at recession-level highs for the past several years.\n  Last month 806,000 Americans gave up hope of getting work and dropped \nout of the labor force entirely. Currently, nearly 10 million Americans \nare unemployed, 3\\1/2\\ million of them for 6 months or longer. Over the \n5\\1/2\\ years the President has been in office, 6.7 million additional \nAmericans have fallen into poverty.\n  Household income has declined by $3,500. The poverty rate for women \nhas increased to 16.3 percent, income for women has fallen, and 19.4 \nmillion Americans have been forced to join the food stamp program.\n  Meanwhile, prices have risen. Gas prices are 99 percent higher per \ngallon today than they were when the President took office. Health care \npremiums are more than $3,600 higher. College tuition has soared.\n  Basically, thanks to the failed policies of the President and \ncongressional Democrats, American families today are paying more and \nmaking less.\n  It is all very well and good to talk about the concern for the \naverage hardworking American, but what really matters is not what you \nsay but how you govern by what you do. Democrats seem to think their \nspeeches and good intentions and the ``philosophy'' should give them a \nfree pass, even if their policies are making it harder and harder for \nworking families to achieve economic security and stability.\n  They want to coast on the fact that their party has historically been \nthought of as the party of working men and women, while ignoring the \nfact that the Democrat party today looks more like the party of \nbillionaires and special interests than the party of hardworking \nAmericans.\n  Take the Keystone Pipeline. Blue collar unions strongly support the \npipeline and the more than 42,000 jobs it would support. The Washington \nExaminer reported yesterday morning the 750,000-member-strong \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is, as the paper notes, \nthe latest of the growing number of traditional blue-collar unions \ntaking an aggressive pro-Keystone position.\n  In a letter to Senate Democrats, the IBEW's president writes:\n\n       At a time when job creation should be a top priority, the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline project would put Americans back to work \n     and have ripple benefits throughout the economy. . . . From \n     pipe manufactured in Arkansas, to pump motors assembled in \n     Ohio\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\n     and transformers built in Pennsylvania, workers from all over \n     the United States will benefit from the project.\n\n  That is from the president of the IBEW.\n  So given the jobs and benefits the pipeline would create, how do you \nthink the President and the party of so-called average hardworking \nAmericans has responded? Has he approved the pipeline and the jobs it \nwould create for American workers throughout the country? No.\n  Despite five separate environmental reviews from his own State \nDepartment, testifying to the minimal impact the pipeline would have on \nthe environment, the President has aligned himself instead with far-\nleft environmental special interests like billionaire Tom Steyer, who \nis pouring money into anti-Keystone campaigns. So much for being the \nparty of working men and women.\n  Democrats may talk about putting hardworking Americans front and \ncenter, but over the past few years hardworking Americans have often \ncome in last. Take ObamaCare. It is hard to even know where to start \nwhen talking about the negative impacts ObamaCare has had on American \nworkers.\n  There is the 30-hour workweek rule, which has forced businesses to \neliminate full-time positions and cut workers' hours below 30 hours per \nweek.\n  There is the employer mandate, which has made it difficult or \nimpossible for many businesses to expand and hire new workers.\n  There is the tax on lifesaving medical devices, such as pacemakers \nand insulin pumps, which has already cost thousands of jobs in the \nmedical device industry and which will eliminate many more if it isn't \nrepealed.\n  Then, of course, there are the numerous burdens placed on small \nbusinesses, the higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and the fact \nthat the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the law will \nshrink the full-time workforce by 2\\1/2\\ million workers and lower \nwages by more than $1 trillion.\n  Who suffers the most from all those provisions? Average, hardworking \nAmericans, the small business owner who can no longer afford to hire \nnew employees, the middle-class family suddenly faced with a $10,000 \ndeductible, the low-income worker whose hours are suddenly slashed from \n35 to 25 hours a week, and the out-of-work American who can't find a \njob because businesses are too reluctant to hire.\n  One would think the supposed party of average, hardworking Americans \nmight sit back and rethink things a little bit after seeing the \ndevastating economic impact of ObamaCare. But the Democrats and the \nPresident are pushing again with more job-killing policies.\n  Recently, the Democrats and the President have been pushing for a \nmassive 40-percent minimum-wage hike--a measure the Congressional \nBudget Office says could eliminate up to 1 million jobs. Even the \nPresident's own Federal Reserve Chair recently testified before \nCongress that a minimum wage hike would negatively affect jobs.\n  Once again, the people most likely to lose their jobs as a result of \nthis policy are those least able to afford it: Namely, low-income \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, Democrats can talk all they want about their \ncommitment to ordinary Americans, but actions speak louder than words. \nIt is going to be hard to convince people to believe, when their \nactions over the past 5 years have made things harder for working \nAmericans, that they are actually on their side.\n  If Democrats really wanted to provide permanent relief to the \nmillions of Americans who are struggling to get by, they would focus on \nmeasures that would create jobs, improve wages, and expand opportunity.\n  Instead of spending their time on far-left liberal policies and \npriorities, such as government-run health care and extreme \nenvironmental regulations, they would be supporting bills that have \nbeen offered by some of my colleagues here on our side of the aisle to \nprovide one-time, low-interest loans to out-of-work Americans to enable \nthem to relocate to cities and States with more job opportunities. That \nis a piece of legislation I have introduced. Or they could support the \nbill put forth by Senator Lee to improve workplace flexibility for \nworking families; or the bill of Senator Hoeven, to approve the \nKeystone Pipeline and open up the 42,000- plus jobs it would support; \nor the bill of Senator Collins to fix the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek \nprovision so we don't have so many part-time employees in this country \nand put more people to work on a full-time basis; or the numerous \nRepublican proposals that have been offered by our colleagues to check \nEPA's overreach and to protect the millions of jobs EPA's proposed \nregulations could destroy; or the Democratic majority could allow an \nopen amendment process to the tax extender bill we are going to be \nconsidering here soon to allow for the consideration of permanent tax \nrelief measures for American families and small businesses.\n  Because Americans deserve tax certainty and not more short-term \nmeasures, I intend to file amendments to the tax extenders bill this \nweek to make a number of important progrowth provisions permanent, such \nas the ability for small businesses and farmers to expense more of \ntheir business investments. I intend to work with Senator Cantwell and \nothers on an amendment to make permanent the ability of taxpayers to \ndeduct State and local sales taxes against their Federal income tax--a \nmeasure that is important for States without income taxes like South \nDakota. And I intend to work with my colleagues to make permanent the \nexisting moratorium on State and local taxes on Internet access before \nthat moratorium expires on November 1 of this year. Failure to act is \ngoing to mean a tax increase on the many millions of Americans who use \nthe Internet.\n  This week's tax debate also provides the Senate an opportunity to \naddress the job-destroying taxes in ObamaCare. Several of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Hatch, Toomey, and Coats, have been \nfighting for repeal, or at least delay, of the ObamaCare medical device \ntax. Repeal of this tax has the support of over 70 Senators, and it is \ntime for a vote on this proposal.\n  However, the ObamaCare taxes don't stop there. This year, millions of \nyoung, middle-class families will face a tax penalty for failing to \npurchase government-approved health care. Many of these individuals and \nfamilies may not be able to afford ObamaCare and cannot afford to pay \nthe tax either. I will be filing an amendment to the tax extenders bill \nthat would prohibit the IRS from ever collecting this penalty.\n  Considering this administration has already delayed the mandate for \nemployers, it is only fair to waive this penalty for families and \nindividuals as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment to exempt the \nlong-term unemployed from the ObamaCare employer mandate head count. If \nyou are a business in this country and you hire somebody who has been \nunemployed for 6 months or longer, then you wouldn't be subject to the \nObamaCare employer mandate, which is so devastating to employers across \nthis country.\n  The tax extender package on the floor today will reportedly retain \nthe Hire Our Heroes Act, which is championed in the Senate by Senator \nBlunt. If that is the case, I am pleased to see the majority has \nfinally realized the employer mandate is hurting the job prospects of \nveterans who have proudly served this country. We should expand this \nexemption to the 3\\1/2\\ million long-term unemployed as well, and that \nis what my amendment seeks to do.\n  Mr. President, Democrats may claim to be the party of average \nAmericans, but their record over the past 5 years says some things \nentirely different. Ordinary Americans are suffering as a result of \nDemocratic policies, and they are not getting any relief. It is time \nfor Democrats to stop talking about helping Americans and to start \nactually helping them.\n\n  We have an opportunity with this tax extenders bill on the floor this \nweek to do some things that are for jobs and the economy. If we can get \na chance to get these amendments in front of the Senate and allow the \nvoices of the American people to be heard and to get votes, we can \nstart moving this country in a different direction--a direction that \nwill lead to better paying jobs for middle-class families, a better \nstandard of living for people in this country, and a brighter and more \nprosperous future\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nfor future generations of Americans. I hope that will be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today having heard \nthe majority leader open this morning's session by talking somewhat \nabout the health care law. He was referring to a headline that said \nRepublicans were going quiet on health care. He then went on to say \nthat ObamaCare is no longer very high on their radar screen.\n  I will say, as a doctor and someone who goes home every weekend to \nWyoming, this issue of people's health care--something very important \nto them--continues to be high on my screen and high on the radar screen \nof Americans all across the country because we are seeing all across \nthe country that the President's promises have been broken. People \ncan't keep what they had if they liked it. People are losing their \ndoctors.\n  There are many ObamaCare side effects, and one doesn't have to go \nvery far today to see on the front page of the New York Times this \nmorning an article related to the President's promises. He said: If you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your hospital, \nyou can keep your hospital. But in this front-page article, the first \nparagraph says:\n\n       In the midst of all the turmoil in health care these days, \n     one thing is becoming clear: No matter what kind of health \n     plan consumers choose, they will find fewer doctors and \n     hospitals in their network--or pay much more for the \n     privilege of going to any provider they want.\n\n  So the Senate majority leader may not want this to be a major issue \nin the minds of the American public, but it is because their health \ncare is so personal.\n  Americans hate to see taxpayer dollars wasted, but they are seeing it \nall across the country.\n  I would note an article in Politico: ``474M for 4 failed Obamacare \nexchanges.'' Money completely wasted--taxpayer dollars--and didn't help \npatients needing care.\n  The other day, The Hill: Cover Oregon flops. ``FBI looking into \nOregon's O-Care rollout.''\n  There are huge problems with waste.\n  There is another article about problems in Colorado and problems with \ntheir exchange, and yet the story out today--what happened with the \nexchange in Colorado? ``Outrage over raise for Colorado health exchange \nCEO.''\n  So the impacts are felt all around the country. And it is interesting \nto hear the Senate majority leader make his comments at a time when his \nhometown newspaper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, had a headline story \non May 4, 2014: ``Own a small business? Brace for Obamacare Pain.''\n\n       Local business owners might be hoping the Affordable Care \n     Act's insurance mandates cover sticker shock. The law's \n     employer coverage mandate doesn't take effect until 2015, but \n     early plan renewals are starting to roll in. And for some \n     businesses, the premium jumps are positively painful.\n\n  So I come to the floor having heard the majority leader's comments. I \nwill have more to say about this later, as I see my colleague from the \nother side of the aisle has come to speak. But as one Senator and a \nphysician and someone intimately concerned about the care the American \npublic receives, their ability to get care--not empty coverage but \nquality, available care--this Senator, in spite of what the majority \nleader may say, is not going quiet on health care. It continues to be \nvery high on my radar screen, as it is high on the radar screen of \nAmericans who have been told many things by the President of the United \nStates that turned out not to be true.\n  That is why week after week I am going to continue coming to the \nfloor to talk about the side effects of a health care law that is \nhurting patients in terms of keeping their doctor, lower costs--they \nare seeing higher costs--not being able to keep their hospital, and \npaychecks shrinking because of the health care law.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from Oregon, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to make reference to the majority leader's \ncomments. Republicans--and certainly this Senator--are not going quiet \non health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                               EXPIRE Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning the Senate begins \nconsideration of a tax cut bill. The Finance Committee agreed to call \nit the EXPIRE Act, and I am going to take a few minutes to talk about \nwhy it is so important that this bill be passed--and passed now. Here \nare a few of the key reasons:\n  First, if the Senate doesn't act, veterans who are now packing job \nfairs across this country are going to face an even tougher struggle to \nget good jobs.\n  Second, because the jobs most essential to our economy--the good-\npaying, innovation-driven jobs needed to underpin a growing middle \nclass--will be harder to create.\n  Third, because just when underwater homeowners get hold of a life \nraft that keeps them in their homes, a big tax hike could yank it away.\n  Fourth, because millions of students are already up to their eyeballs \nin debt, and without this they will go even deeper.\n  In addition, producing clean energy will grow more expensive, risking \nthe high-tech jobs every Member of Congress wants to protect.\n  The EXPIRE Act addresses all of these issues and more.\n  The second question that I think is going to be relevant to this \ndebate is, What are the implications for the cycle of stop-and-go \npolicies that have made the Tax Code in this country so unnecessarily \ncomplicated and uncertain? The EXPIRE Act ends that and builds a bridge \nto comprehensive tax reform. Many of these stop-and-go incentives are \ngood policy, and they ought to be extended permanently. The EXPIRE Act \ngives the Finance Committee and the Congress the room to work on reform \nand decide which provisions to keep.\n  For now, this is about balancing short-term needs and long-term \ngoals. In the coming months, the Finance Committee is going to pursue a \ntax reform plan on a bipartisan basis that gives all Americans the \nopportunity to get ahead. But right now, what is needed is to protect \njobs and deliver more certainty.\n  On April 3 the Finance Committee passed the Expiring Provisions \nImprovement Reform and Efficiency--EXPIRE--Act. There was a strong \nbipartisan vote in the committee. We called the bill the EXPIRE Act for \none reason: It is supposed to expire. I stated this morning that, on my \nwatch, this is going to be the last time--the last time--the Finance \nCommittee considers a tax extenders bill. Once this piece of \nlegislation is enacted and behind us, the committee will move on to the \ncritical next challenge; that is, comprehensive bipartisan tax reform.\n  I will talk for a minute about how this package is going to help \nmiddle-class individuals and families.\n  We all understand that a prosperous middle class is the key to long-\nterm economic growth for the country. This legislation boosts that \ncause by extending incentives that help workers get back on their feet, \nsuch as the work opportunity tax credit. This provision is a lifeline \nfor our veterans in every State in the country because it encourages \nemployers to hire the vets when they come home from overseas. Veteran \nunemployment is still at crisis levels. This bill is going to help \naddress that.\n  Thanks to work by Senators Portman and Cardin--again, on a bipartisan \nbasis--the work opportunity tax credit is now going to be available to \nbusinesses that hire the long-term unemployed. They are the Americans \nwho have been hit the hardest by the recession, and, without help, we \nare going to see them fall between the cracks. This legislation can be \nan important role in helping those Americans find good jobs.\n  The EXPIRE Act also extends and expands the credit for research and \nexperimentation. The reason this is so important is this is the \nlifeblood of innovation that is so important for our economy. Not only \ndoes this credit incentivize research and innovation, but thanks to \ngood, bipartisan work--I heard that mentioned a couple times this \nmorning, and we are going to hear it again--in this case, Senator \nRoberts, Senator Schumer, and others made adjustments to the credit to\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nmake it work better for small businesses and for startup firms. Many of \nthese firms just getting out of the gate can't really use the research \ncredit in its current form, so the EXPIRE Act says to all of those \nstartups that if they want to use the credit, we are going to make it \neasier to hire and pay workers. We are going to help them do that.\n  Congress also needs to keep pushing business investments in \ninnovation. That is why the EXPIRE Act extends incentives such as bonus \ndepreciation and expanded business expenses. This makes it easier for \ncompanies to invest in new equipment and property and grow their \noperation and create more jobs.\n  We know many of our communities are hurting. They have been battered \nover the past decade by the financial crisis and by an exodus of \nmanufacturing jobs. So it is critical to drive investment to those \ncommunities to help promote growth and create good-paying jobs.\n  The people in those communities hit--and hit hard--by this economy \ndeserve a chance to achieve the American dream just like everybody \nelse. That is why the EXPIRE Act extends provisions such as the new \nmarkets tax credit, which drives private investment to these hard-hit \nareas. The new markets tax credit leverages private funds to create new \nbusinesses in economically depressed communities. And thanks to efforts \nby my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, these credits are going to be \navailable to boost manufacturing--areas that have lost some of their \ngood-paying, blue-collar industrial jobs. Through this, we will see \nmore private investment head their way.\n  With the recent news of the economy's first quarter, the challenge of \ngrowing the economy--it is obvious our families and businesses need all \nthe help they can get. That is why the EXPIRE Act allows families to \ncontinue to deduct their State and local taxes. Americans can already \ndeduct their State income taxes thanks to a permanent part of the Tax \nCode. But families in States such as Texas, Florida, Washington, and \nAlaska don't pay State income taxes; they pay higher sales taxes. This \nlegislation levels the field and lets families deduct their State and \nlocal taxes whether they are income or sales.\n  As the housing market continues to come back from the great \nrecession, we know millions of Americans are still struggling to stay \nin their homes. Many of our homeowners found themselves underwater, \nowing more in mortgage debt than their houses were worth. To make \nmatters worse, just when they caught a break and had their mortgage \npayments lowered or their debt forgiven, they got hit by a giant tax \nliability. Imagine that. Once you get your head above water, a huge tax \nbill pushes you right back underwater.\n  This legislation contains a provision to prevent exactly that \nsituation from happening and to help keep American families in their \nhomes by exempting their forgiven mortgage debt from taxation. And I \nfeel particularly strongly about this because that is really phantom \nincome, and middle-class Americans shouldn't get hit that way.\n  Over the past several years, States throughout the country have been \nforced to make a lot of painful fiscal choices. Over the past several \nyears, States throughout the country have been forced to make a lot of \npainful fiscal choices in many communities. The budget ax has fallen on \neducation. Teachers routinely face classrooms of 30 to 40 students, \noften even more. Too often those teachers run short on supplies and \nthen they reach into their own pockets--into their own pockets--to make \nup the difference. These are hard-working, middle-class professionals. \nWhat this legislation does is help those teachers just a little bit by \nletting them deduct up to $250 of those out-of-pocket expenses from \ntheir taxes. Oregon teachers deduct more than $9 million in classroom \nexpenses each year.\n\n  A college education is absolutely vital in our competitive, modern \neconomy. For families and students paying for college, trying to deal \nwith those skyrocketing costs and the mountains of debt they incur, \nthis legislation extends the $4,000 deduction for tuition expenses. \nOregon families use it to deduct more than $61 million in tuition and \nfees annually. It gets harder each year to maintain a middle-class life \nwithout a college degree. That is why this deduction is so important \nand why it is in this legislation.\n  There is one last part of the bill I would like to touch on; that is, \nthe incentive for clean energy. Previously I chaired the energy \ncommittee, and I saw how essential it was to generate investment in \nclean energy. It is an area of our economy that has been plagued by the \nstop-and-go nature of tax policy. Now is the time our country should be \ninvesting in low-carbon and energy-diverse alternatives. Some of the \nprovisions in the EXPIRE Act have been extraordinarily successful in \ndoing just that. The production tax credit for renewable energy that \nincludes wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass has helped drive \nmajor growth in renewable clean energy. Wind in particular has boomed \nover the past 5 years. It now accounts for more than 60,000 megawatts \nof wind generation across the country. Wind energy production has more \nthan doubled since 2008. That is enough to power more than 15 million \nhomes and the energy supports more than 50,000 jobs. The growth of this \nindustry has been a boon to manufacturing, supporting more than 500 \nmanufacturing facilities.\n  Still, the wind industry is not immune to the stop-and-go nature of \ntax extenders. Growth has leveled off over the past 2 years, mostly due \nto the expiration and late retroactive renewal of provisions such as \nthe production tax credit. It is critical, in my view, to provide \ncertainty to these businesses. In the energy sector, electricity \ngenerating stations and refineries are major investments that can take \nyears to plan and to finance and construct. That is why tax reform is \nso vital. Our country needs a long-term, stable energy policy.\n  There are a lot of fresh ideas on how to improve energy policy in the \nTax Code. As chairman of the Finance Committee, now-Ambassador Baucus \nput out a number of innovative, technology-neutral ideas that in my \nview deserve a significant amount of attention, but while working out \nthose ideas in a transparent, bipartisan way, it is important Congress \nnot let our domestic clean energy industry fall off the cliff, which is \nthe reason this bill extends provisions such as the production tax \ncredit through 2015.\n  Clean energy is not just about generating more low-carbon \nelectricity; it is also about using energy more efficiently in reducing \nour overall consumption. That is why the EXPIRE Act extends and updates \nthe credit that helps out homeowners who want to improve their houses \nand make them more energy efficient. Whether it is through better \nwindows, installing insulation, perhaps replacing a water heater or a \nfurnace, this provision helps those homeowners. These improvements can \ndramatically reduce the amount of energy used to heat and cool American \nhomes, resulting in lower electricity bills.\n  The legislation improves this provision by cleaning up what has been \ncurrent law and updating its standards. It will be easier to use and \nhelp push the boundaries on energy efficiency by allowing only the most \nenergy-efficient improvements to qualify. Even in pushing for \nefficiency in how we use energy, it is important to make smart use of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Commercial buildings use a tremendous amount of energy--20 percent of \nall electricity consumed in the United States powers the places we \nwork. By reducing this consumption, the United States can drastically \ncut emissions and lower costs for businesses. It is obvious the areas I \nhave outlined make sense for our economy and they have bipartisan \nsupport. They are going to help spur investment and innovation, boost \nour communities, help disadvantaged workers, and continue to drive \ninvestments in clean energy and energy efficiency.\n  A number of these provisions I have indicated should be made \npermanent, and it would be a mistake to simply let them disappear. In \nwrapping up, I wish to address the question: Why not make these \nprovisions permanent now? Why not pass tax reform today? That would be \nmy first choice.\n  Everybody knows our Tax Code is in bad shape. It is complicated. I \nthink calling it opaque would be a compliment. It desperately needs \nfixing.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nWe want a code that promotes economic growth and treats everyone \nfairly. A lot of Members have worked hard to develop ideas, but the \nreality is tax reform is not happening tomorrow. Reaching a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan plan is going to take time, focus, and hard \nwork.\n  I know something about that because I have put as much sweat equity \ninto bipartisan tax reform as any Member of this body, starting with \nour former colleague Senator Gregg. We sat next to each other on a sofa \nevery week for 2 years to write the first bipartisan Federal income tax \nreform plan in 30 years. Senator Coats has joined Senator Begich and I \nin this effort and we are not alone. Chairman Camp has put forward an \nambitious tax reform draft that lays out several ideas as well on how \nto make the Tax Code simpler. All of these proposals contain the kinds \nof ideas we ought to examine as we look to reform our Tax Code. Once \nthe issue of these extenders is settled, I look forward to working with \nSenator Hatch and all our colleagues on a broad-based tax reform plan \nthat will grow our entire economy.\n  In the meantime, it would be a mistake to leave American families and \nAmerican businesses out in the cold. Temporary provisions of the Tax \nCode continue to expire, leaving jobs, innovation, investment, and \npeople's homes in limbo. By providing certainty to businesses and \nfamilies for the next 2 years, the EXPIRE Act creates the space needed \nfor true tax reform. I don't want us to lose sight of that during this \ndebate. These extenders are important, but we are also going to talk on \nthe floor about building a bridge to reform that this country \ndesperately needs. We know there are inequities in the Tax Code. The \ninability to have the certainty and predictability we need is holding \nus back.\n  We need to make sure we have a Tax Code that gives everybody in \nAmerica the opportunity to get ahead, especially our hard-working, \nmiddle-class citizens, our entrepreneurs and businesses. Our people \nwork hard for the money they earn each and every day. They want to pay \ntheir fair share, but when they are asked to contribute part of their \npaycheck each month, they deserve a tax system that is transparent and \nequitable. We need to simplify the code. We need to level the playing \nfield. We need to get rid of the disparities between different types of \nincome that elevates some workers over others.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues today to, first, back this \nlegislation so we don't see, for example, innovation and our veterans \nand teachers suffer as we work toward bipartisan tax reform; second, to \nbe open about sharing their ideas with the Finance Committee and all \nMembers about innovative bipartisan reforms that can improve our entire \nTax Code. Voters send us to work. They are looking for results. They \ndon't want to hear excuses about why families pay more for college or \nwhy homeowners face a huge tax bill after getting out from under a \nmountain of debt. Simply dropping those tax incentives sacrifices \nvaluable priorities without getting the real job of comprehensive \nreform done. Let us pass the EXPIRE Act and let us move on to urgently \nneeded bipartisan comprehensive tax reform.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2930-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2930-S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                       Remembering Harlan Mathews\n\n  Mr. President, a few days ago we lost a prominent Tennessean, Harlan \nMathews. He was 87 years old, and he lived a long and distinguished \nlife.\n  Harlan Mathews served in the Senate seat in which I now have the \nprivilege of serving. When Senator Al Gore was elected Vice President \nmore than 20 years ago--Harlan Mathews took his seat and then retired \nfrom the Senate after serving two years of his appointment.\n  But that was, by a long shot, not a description of his public \nservice. Yesterday Senator Corker and I were at his funeral and \nmemorial service in Nashville, which was a beautiful service, a simple \nservice, as he would have imagined. The theme that kept coming through \nagain and again was what a fine mentor and unselfish public servant \nHarlan Mathews had been in our State for 60 years. He was a World War \nII veteran, came to Vanderbilt University, and in 1950 met a young \nGovernor whose name was Frank Clement--a rising star in national \npolitics. He became his assistant and served in a variety of State \ngovernment positions with very\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nlittle interruption until he was appointed by Governor McWherter to \nserve for 2 years in Al Gore's seat. Twenty years ago Harlan Mathews \ndecided not to run for reelection and has lived the past 20 years in \nNashville. We were there with his wife Pat, his sons, and a host of \nfriends.\n  What I think about Harlan Mathews is that other than his great friend \nformer Governor Ned McWherter, no one had more friends around the State \ncapitol than Harlan Mathews did.\n  So today we pay tribute to him and to his family for a life well \nlived, for his service to the State of Tennessee, and for being a man \nwho has mentored as many young public servants of our State as anyone I \ncan think of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I too rise to talk about our friend and former colleague \nto many in this body, Senator Harlan Mathews.\n  It was touching yesterday to be at a funeral service where so many \npeople he had mentored stood and talked in conversation around the \ngathering we attended about the great mentorship he provided. There is \nno greater legacy any of us can provide than to set an example for \nother people and to create opportunities for other people coming along.\n  I want to join the senior Senator, who I know served with him while \nhe was Governor. I had the great opportunity to get to know him as a \nnew and young commissioner of finance in our State, an appointed job, \nand no one--no one--was kinder to me than former Senator Harlan \nMathews, who has been involved in so many great things that have \nhappened in our State.\n  His wife Pat complimented him in an extraordinary way, saying I think \none of his greatest attributes was his constantly saying: You know, so \nmuch can happen in this world if no one cares who takes the credit.\n  I think he was a quiet force for good in our State and a quiet force \nfor good in our country. So many of the things that caused him to be \nthe kind of person he was are things that many of us could emulate and \ncause the Senate and our country to function much better than it does \nnow.\n  I join the senior Senator, for whom I have so much respect, in making \nsure the Senate record records the great work of Harlan Mathews--\nSenator, Deputy Governor, treasury leader in our State but also \ncommissioner of finance. He is someone who provided years of great \npublic service, years of great mentorship, and someone who has a legacy \nof people who served with him and under him who have gone on to do \nwonderful work for our State and country.\n  I yield the floor with great gratitude toward a wonderful public \nservant, Harlan Mathews.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. Harlan was known \nfor working quietly, and being modest. The service was only about 40 or \n45 minutes to reflect that.\n  He would have been a terrific Senator if he had been here for 25 \nyears because of what we know about him. He wasn't out front. He was \nbehind the scenes. He worked to get things done. He was always results-\noriented, and he didn't mind who got the credit. Sometimes there is a \nshortage of that in the Senate--then and now today. He had those rare \nskills of the public servant that are always valuable and always \nneeded.\n  I know his wife Pat, his sons Stan and Les, and his granddaughters \nKatie and Emily miss him deeply. We do as well, and we join them in \nadmiring his life and his example.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the obituary of \nHarlan Mathews detailing his public service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                obituary\n\n       Harlan Mathews, an accidental Tennessean born in Sumiton, \n     Alabama, who advised five Tennessee governors and served in \n     the U.S. Senate, died today at the age of 87, his family \n     confirmed.\n       Mathews, who recently was diagnosed with a brain tumor, \n     died peacefully at Alive Hospice today at 6 a.m. with his \n     wife Pat at his side.\n       Services honoring Mathews and celebrating his life are \n     being scheduled at this time.\n       After serving in the U.S. Navy in WWII, Mathews received \n     his B.A. degree from Jacksonville State University under the \n     G.I. Bill. He arrived in Nashville in 1949 to attended \n     Vanderbilt University. He would subsequently obtain a \n     master's degree in public administration. Shortly after \n     enrolling at Vanderbilt, Mathews took an entry level job with \n     the State Planning Office, not knowing that serving the \n     people of Tennessee would become his life's work.\n       In 1950, the 24 year-old Mathews met 30 year-old Frank \n     Clement. Two years later, Mathews was the top assistant to \n     the new Governor, a close friendship that continued until \n     Clement's death in 1969. In 1961 Mathews was appointed \n     Commissioner of Finance by Governor Buford Ellington. He held \n     the post for 10 years, one of the longest tenures in state \n     history.\n       In 1971, Mathews briefly left state government to work in \n     the private sector in Memphis, but returned in 1973 to serve \n     as the legislative assistant to longtime state comptroller \n     William Snodgrass. The Tennessee General Assembly elected \n     Mathews state treasurer in 1974 when his predecessor, Tom \n     Wiseman, opted to run for governor.\n       Mathews remained state treasurer until January 1987 when he \n     resigned to become deputy governor to Ned McWherter.\n       As deputy governor, Mathews was a low key yet forceful \n     advocate of McWherter's legislative agenda and continued, as \n     he had done as state treasurer and finance and administration \n     commissioner, to protect the state's sound financial footing.\n       Upon U.S. Senator Al Gore's election to the vice \n     presidency, McWherter appointed the most dedicated public \n     servant he knew to fill the vacancy. Harlan Mathews was sworn \n     in on Jan. 3, 1993, to represent Tennessee in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Mathews never sought election to political office, \n     preferring to serve the people of this state behind the \n     scenes as a frugal manager and mentor to dozens over the four \n     decades of his public career.\n       Upon leaving the U.S. Senate in December of 1994, Mathews \n     joined the Nashville office of the law firm of Farris, \n     Mathews, Bobango PLC. He remained active in the legislature \n     and politics, serving as an informal advisor and fundraiser \n     for Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n       Throughout Mathews' career, he never took for granted the \n     people he served and the responsibility he held. He was known \n     as a soft spoken but tough negotiator who made sure state \n     employees were paid good wages, and that the state's \n     retirement system was sound, the debt low and the bond rating \n     strong. He was a demanding boss who also made sure that his \n     employees had a warm coat in cold weather. He was a leader, a \n     statesman and a friend to all that knew him and to all of \n     Tennessee.\n       Mathews is survived by his wife Pat, sons Stan Mathews \n     (Sandy) and Les Mathews (Pam) and granddaughters Katie Zipper \n     and Emily Mathews. He was preceded in death by his son Rick \n     Mathews.\n       Honorary pallbearers include Steve Adams, Tom Benson, Carl \n     Brown, Tom Cone, Nancy-Ann DeParle, John Faber, Jim Hall, Don \n     Holt, Carl Johnson, Dr. Joe Johnson, Jeremy Kane, David \n     Lillard, JW Luna, David Manning, Raymond Marston, Mike \n     McWherter, Clayton McWhorter, John Morgan, William Nichols, \n     Roy Nix, Parker Sherrill, Arnold Tackett, Bo Roberts, Pete \n     Sain, Dale Sims, Captain Bobby Trotter, David Welles, Bill \n     Whitson, and ``Harlan's Girls''--Estie Harris, Adrienne \n     Knestrick, Katy Varney and Beth Winstead.\n       The family would like to give special thanks to his caring \n     doctors--Dr. Craig Weirum, Dr. Chris Hill, Dr. Rentz Dunn, \n     Dr. John Thompson and Dr. Robert Faber.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I seek recognition to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                        Energy and Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, two things happened yesterday:\n  First, the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill collapsed--at least \nfor now. It would have created 190,000 new jobs. It would have cut \ncarbon pollution by 22 million automobiles on the roads of the United \nStates in equivalency. That is a big deal. It is something that was \nagreed upon by Democrats and Republicans.\n  What happened? Well, too many Republicans wanted to vote on the \nKeystone Pipeline issue. They knew the vote on the Keystone Pipeline \nwas going to fail because they don't have the votes in order to be \nsuccessful, so they took a bill that would cut carbon emissions and \nsaid they wouldn't pass it unless they got a vote on three additional \namendments to increase global warming emissions:\n  No. 1. Stop EPA from cutting emissions on powerplants. They wanted to \nvote to take away EPA authority on that.\n  No. 2. Allow massive export of natural gas that will actually \nincrease costs to consumers in the United States and move us back to \ncoal because the higher the price of natural\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\ngas, the more people are going to go back to burning goal. They all \nunderstand that. That is what the game is all about.\n  No. 3. Prevent the Senate from considering global warming pollution \ncontrols in the future. That is right--just have a vote that prohibits \nthe Senate from considering global warming pollution levels.\n  Obviously, this is a debate about pollution, not about energy \nefficiency, from the perspective of the Republican Party--although I \ngive credit to the many Republicans who were working on a bipartisan \nbasis with Jeanne Shaheen in order to put together a bill that actually \naccomplished something and showed this institution can work.\n  A second event actually happened yesterday as well. Two new climate \nstudies were released saying that the West Antarctic ice sheet is \ncollapsing and the melting of the West Antarctic is unstoppable. Twelve \nfeet of sea level rise is coming.\n  Did you hear that? The West Antarctic ice sheet is collapsing, the \nmelting is unstoppable, and 12 feet of sea level rise is coming.\n  What does that mean? That means Boston, underwater; South Florida, \nunderwater; New Orleans, underwater.\n  In the Senate, we are moving at a glacial pace on climate change. We \nare frozen. But while we do nothing, the pace of glacial collapse is \naccelerating. The world's ice is melting.\n  The Senate has been called the cooling saucer of democracy. But when \nit comes to climate change, it is the warming plate, cooking the Earth \nas we continue our slide into an ocean of dysfunction.\n  The next major piece of the West Antarctic glacier that breaks off \ninto the ocean should be reserved as an island for all of the climate \ndeniers. We will just call it the Island of Deniers. They can all live \nthere because there will be plenty of room on this huge, massive body \nof ice that keeps breaking off and heading into the ocean.\n  Secondly, we are about to take up tax extenders, and we have a \nfantastic chance to extend the production tax credit for wind in our \ncountry. Unfortunately, because of the unpredictability of the tax \nbreaks for the wind industry, 30,000 people in the wind industry were \nlaid off last year. That is not because the wind industry didn't prove \nit could increase the amount of electricity in our country generated \nfrom wind; it is because--unlike the oil industry, unlike the gas \nindustry, unlike the nuclear industry, unlike the coal industry--the \nwind industry has to come in, hat in hand, to beg to continue their tax \nbreaks year after year. There is no predictability for that \nmarketplace. This gives us a chance to extend those tax breaks.\n  So it is a big challenge, but ultimately if the oil and gas industry \nis going to receive $7 billion in tax breaks per year, the wind \nindustry should receive the tax breaks it needs. We need a level \nplaying field. We need a way to ensure that there is, in fact, a \nfighting chance for these new renewable energy industries. The existing \nindustries have received tax breaks going back 100 years. These newer \nindustries are there. They are creating jobs at a massive pace, but we \nneed to ensure that the tax breaks are there.\n  My hope is that we will be able to pass these tax extenders. Again, \nthere are extensions for tax breaks that are in there for many \nindustries across the board. It is the kind of bipartisan effort that \ndeserves support, like the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill. My \nhope is that the institution can work in order to accomplish that goal. \nCivility on matters such as these should not melt away. We need to make \nsure we are, in fact, protected for generations yet to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish to take a moment to say a few words in honor of \nNational Police Week. I would like to take this opportunity to honor \nthe brave men and women of law enforcement who made the ultimate \nsacrifice and gave their lives in the line of duty while safeguarding \nour communities.\n  Since the first recorded police death in 1791, there have been 21,742 \nlaw enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. This year 112 \nnames will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \nin Washington. We should remember that there are 112 families who \ngrieve the loss of a loved one who gave his or her life to protect \ntheir community and to keep their fellow citizens safe.\n  Today I recognize two Utah law enforcement officers who recently gave \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Derek Johnson\n\n  Sergeant Derek Johnson had served with the Draper Police Department \nfor 9 years when he was shot and killed while on uniformed patrol in \nthe early morning hours of September 1, 2013.\n  During his service, Sergeant Johnson was the recipient of many \nawards, including a Life Saving Award and a Distinguished Service \nAward. He was also honored as the 2012 Community Policing Officer of \nthe Year.\n  We take this time to think about the friends and family who mourn the \nloss of Sergeant Johnson and keep his wife Shante and his 7-year-old \nson Bensen Ray Johnson in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                          Sergeant Cory Wride\n\n  Another recent tragic loss to the Utah law enforcement community was \nUtah County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Cory Wride.\n  Sergeant Wride was shot and killed while on duty on January 30, 2014, \nas he was assisting a stranded motorist.\n  Sergeant Wride served with the Utah County Sheriff's Office for \nnearly 20 years and served his community in various roles, including \npatrol and as a member of the department's special operations teams, K-\n9 and SWAT.\n  Sergeant Wride was married to Nanette, his wife of 18 years. He was \nthe father of four boys and one daughter: Nathan, Chance, Shea, Tyesun, \nand KylieAnne. He also had eight grandchildren.\n  I wish to extend my sympathy to his family and recognize Sergeant \nWride for his service, selflessness, and his courage.\n  I urge my colleagues to take some time this week to think about these \nmen and pay respect to the numerous other fallen heroes who have served \nour communities with professionalism, integrity, and compassion, as \nwell as all members of the law enforcement community who watch over and \nguard our streets, protect us, our families, and our communities.\n\n\n                             Tax Inversions\n\n  Last week I came to the floor to talk briefly about the news reports \nwe have all been seeing about the proposed merger between Pfizer and \nAstraZeneca and the legislative proposals we are seeing from Members of \nCongress in response to the merger.\n  As you know, one of the key details in this merger is that when \nPfizer--a large American company--acquires AstraZeneca--another large, \nbut somewhat smaller UK company--they plan to incorporate the new \nmerged company in the United Kingdom, not here in the United States.\n  As I said last week, I was as concerned to learn of these plans as \nwere many of us here in Congress. After all, Pfizer is an iconic \nAmerican company, with over 100,000 employees. It ranks in the top 200 \nof global companies by revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 \nlist. It would be a great loss to our country to see it incorporated \noffshore.\n  Still, it is difficult to blame them for this decision. According to \nsources, a desire to escape the high U.S. corporate tax is part of the \nmotivation for this merger. This type of transaction, where a U.S. \ncorporation merges with a foreign entity and incorporates elsewhere to \nescape the U.S. tax net, is sometimes referred to as an inversion.\n  Inversions are a growing problem here in the United States. Indeed, \nlarge companies are leaving our country at an alarming rate. If you \ncount the number of American corporations in the worldwide list of \nFortune 500 companies, you will see the number has declined \ndramatically over the past decade, which is very unfortunate. This \ndecline means less capital and less investment in the United States. It \nmeans a smaller U.S. tax base. Most importantly, it means more jobs \nthat could be created--that should be created--here in America are \nbeing created elsewhere. So make no mistake. Inversions are a big \nproblem, and the problem seems to be growing every day.\n  As I mentioned on the floor last week, there are, broadly speaking, \ntwo\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\ndifferent ways Congress could act to address this problem. The first \nway would be to make it more difficult for a U.S. corporation to \ninvert. That is the approach my friend the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee endorsed a few days ago in an op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  As the chairman noted in his opinion piece, current law requires \ncompanies moving overseas to have at least 20 percent new ownership to \navoid some very bad tax consequences. His proposal--the one he outlined \nin this article--would be to increase that benchmark to 50 percent for \nall inversions taking place after May 8 of this year. That means his \nproposed restriction would be retroactive for all inversions that \nhappened between last Thursday and the date his proposal may be signed \ninto law.\n  Of course, this is hardly a new idea. President Obama included a \nsimilar proposal in his budget. Given the amount of hand-wringing we \nhave seen over just the Pfizer-AstraZeneca merger and the subsequent \nerosion of the U.S. tax base from my friends on the other side, you \nwould think a proposal like the one the chairman floated in his op-ed \nwould raise a significant amount of revenue. However, if you think \nthat, you would be wrong.\n  All told, his proposal would raise roughly $17 billion over 10 years. \nThat is about $1.7 billion a year. That is not really an insignificant \nsum, but it does demonstrate the scope of the problem is hardly worth \nthe draconian solution some of my friends want to impose in order to \nsolve it.\n  Let me be clear. I share my colleagues' concerns about the number of \ninversions that have taken place over the last few years. However, I do \nnot believe that imposing confusing and arbitrary retroactive \nrestrictions on U.S. companies is the answer. There is an alternative \napproach which brings us to the second way Congress could act to \nprevent more inversions.\n  The second way to address the problem of inversions is to make the \nUnited States a more desirable location to headquarter businesses. \nWhile it would require a lot of work and compromise, this is by far the \nbetter approach.\n  This approach, of course, means lowering the corporate tax rate. It \nalso means replacing our antiquated worldwide taxation system. Under \ncurrent law, U.S. corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, but \nforeign corporations are subject to tax only on income arising from the \nUnited States. In other words, we subject our corporations to a \nworldwide tax system, while subjecting foreign corporations to a \nterritorial tax system. On top of that, most of our major trading \npartners tax companies domiciled in their own countries on a \nterritorial basis as well, unlike our country.\n  Long story short: Our system of worldwide taxation places us at a \ncompetitive disadvantage and makes the United States a less than \noptimal place for companies to locate their businesses. That being the \ncase, as important as it is to get the corporate tax rate down, no \nmatter how low we get that rate, we still need to scrap and replace our \noutdated worldwide tax system.\n  That is why tax reform is so important. It is just one of the \nreasons, of course, but it is a really important reason. Tax reform, if \nit is done right, will get at the root problem rather than simply \ndealing with symptoms.\n  I should note that inversions are only one symptom of our \ndysfunctional international tax rules. Other types of transactions \nfurther illustrate why the entire system we have is problematic.\n  For example, there are strong incentives currently for a U.S. parent \ncompany to sell its foreign subsidiaries to foreign corporations in \norder to escape the U.S. tax net. There are strong incentives to set up \na startup business as a foreign corporation. Neither of these \ntransactions are inversions, but they do show the point that it is, for \ntax purposes, often better not to be a U.S. corporation or to be \ncontrolled by one. While these other sorts of transactions don't grab \nthe headlines, as inversions do, they are nonetheless indicative of \nreal problems in our Tax Code.\n  That being the case, a proposal to restrict or eliminate inversions \nwould really only go after one particular type of problem, leaving the \nrest of the fundamental flaws in our tax system firmly in place.\n  Proposals to restrict inversions or to impose some sort of management \nand control test are like trying to plug the dyke with your finger to \nkeep capital and jobs from flowing overseas. These proposals are not \nlong-term solutions. They are not even good short-term fixes.\n  Another example of business activity flowing overseas that really \ncomes to mind is the problem we are facing with the medical device \nindustry. We are losing our innovative medical device companies because \nof our stupid tax system and the 2.3 percent tax on sales or gross \nincome of our medical device companies--many of which haven't made a \nprofit yet. They would be taxed, even though they are not making \nprofits, but will make profits if they can keep going with their \ninnovative and good ideas.\n  We know, thanks to ObamaCare's medical device tax, that some of \nAmerica's most innovative companies in an industry that is vital to our \nhealth care system are moving jobs overseas. Yet where is the call from \nthe leadership on the other side to do something about this? In fact, \nthere is nothing but stalling of legislation to solve this problem, \nwhich I think almost any intelligent person would want to do.\n\n  As it stands, it appears not to alarm my friends on the other side \nwhen business activity flees the country as a result of punitive taxes \nunder ObamaCare. Yet, if a company with a large revenue base takes \ntaxes into account when considering mergers and acquisitions, the alarm \nbells sound and legislation is put forward in no time. I would say \nthere is a bit of inconsistency on the part of some of my colleagues \nwho claim they want to keep jobs and business in the United States. If \nthey do, why aren't they doing something about this stupid tax on \nmedical device companies?\n  We had a vote on this earlier in the year, on a bill that didn't go \nthrough both Houses--and the leadership knew it wouldn't go through--\nwhere we had 79 votes in favor of abolishing this tax. There is wide \nbipartisan support to get rid of it. What is wrong with the other side \nthat we have to continue to fight to get rid of something that 79 \npeople in the Senate voted to get rid of? And by the way, I believe if \nwe brought it up true blue, in and of itself, it would pass here with \nprobably 95 votes, if people give any consideration to American \nbusiness, American ingenuity, solving the problems of health care, \nbringing health care costs down, which medical devices can do, and \nsaving lives. It is no small reason why some of these medical device \ncompanies are moving overseas where they are treated far better than we \ntreat them here. We had 79 people who voted to get rid of that stupid \ntax. Yet the leadership of this body won't allow it to be brought up \nfreestanding or on some bill that basically has a chance of passage \nthrough both Houses of Congress.\n  Now, there is, of course, bipartisan legislation that would correct \nthe problems we face with the medical device tax; namely, a bill \nintroduced by Senator Klobuchar and myself. And I commend Senator \nKlobuchar. She has had a lot of guts plus a lot of ability in working \non this bill. Sadly, the Senate Democratic leadership has thus far \nrefused to allow an up-or-down vote on the measure, even though we know \nit has broad bipartisan support, as I have heretofore mentioned.\n  My hope is this will change with the upcoming debate over tax \nextenders, but I am not holding my breath. Given our ongoing experience \nwith the medical device tax, I have to say I am a little skeptical when \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are concerned \nabout American companies moving addresses and operations out of the \ncountry. Indeed, if they were really so bothered by this, we would have \nrepealed this medical device tax a long time ago.\n  Finally, I would just like to give a brief aside on the topic of \nretroactive changes to our tax laws. In my view, stability and \npredictability are bedrock principles of the law. When it comes to our \ntax code, we have gotten away from that over the years. Restoring these \nprinciples to our tax system should be one of our main goals of tax \nreform.\n  Put simply, retroactive changes to the law--the kind envisioned by my \ncolleague's op-ed--are the antithesis of stability and predictability \nand will\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\nonly make tax reform that much harder. No matter how well intentioned, \nand no matter how large the short-run revenue gains are to be had from \nretroactive changes, I believe the long-term affects are harmful and, \nin my opinion, such proposals should be viewed with a healthy dose of \nskepticism. I know my colleague is very sincere in making the points \nthat he has, but I have to rebut those points, and I believe I have \ndone so effectively.\n  Once again, the effort to prevent tax-motivated inversions can be \nboiled down and separated into two basic camps: One side would have us \nsimply address the problem and impose arbitrary and perhaps costly \nrestrictions on American businesses to prevent them from leaving the \ncountry.\n  The other side would make the United States a better place to do \nbusiness, preventing companies from wanting to leave in the first place \nand inviting new ones to form and prosper here.\n  Only one of these approaches will actually fix the problem. Only one \nof these approaches will help create jobs and grow the economy, and \nonly one of these approaches will put our Nation on a path to greater \nprosperity. That approach is, of course, comprehensive tax reform. That \nis what is needed, and that is where our focus should be.\n  As I said last week, as the ranking member of the Senate's tax-\nwriting committee, my focus, when it comes to the problem of \ninversions, is to fix the underlying problems, not to tinker on the \nedges, focusing on the symptoms. I hope eventually that is the approach \nwe take.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first I want to thank Senator Hatch. I \ndeeply respect his views. He is one of the most effective Members of \nthe Senate. He has deep views and reaches across party lines to try to \nget things done, which I think is very important, and I respect him \ngreatly.\n  I want to agree with the conclusion of Senator Hatch. The problem \nwith corporate inversion is best fixed if we do comprehensive tax \nreform. I believe he is right. We have two paths we can take. One is to \ntry and reform our current tax structure, which I think will not work, \nand I will give my reasons why; or we can look for a competitive tax \nstructure that is fairer to the American people and makes measures such \nas corporate inversions something that would not be happening in our \ncommunities.\n  Pfizer and AstraZeneca are looking at a merger. AstraZeneca is a \nBritish company. They own major operations in my State of Maryland, \naffecting thousands of workers. We would think a merger between a \nBritish company and an American company would mean more jobs in \nAmerica, but we know Pfizer has made certain commitments to the British \nGovernment about maintaining and expanding jobs in Great Britain, which \nwe worry is at the cost of American jobs and jobs in my home State of \nMaryland.\n  We have heard one of the reasons for the merger is corporate \ninversion. What do we mean by that? It means Pfizer, an American \ncompany, will merge with a British company and then use that to \ntransfer its revenues, which are legitimately earned in America, many \nas the result of intellectual property developed in America, and then \nattribute that income to foreign sourced, rather than to domestic \nsourced, trying to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Our Tax Code should not encourage that action. Several Members of the \nSenate and I are working within our current Tax Code to make sure that \ndoesn't happen here in America. Our Tax Code should not encourage \ncompanies to take their income offshore. They should pay their fair \nshare of taxes in the United States.\n  But as Senator Hatch pointed out, and I agree, we need a more \ncompetitive Tax Code. We need a Tax Code that would allow for better \ncompetition for American companies, for our manufacturers, for our \nproducers, for our farmers, that will allow easier capital formations \nso we could raise in America more of the capital we need and be less \ndependent upon foreign-sourced investment, although foreign-sourced \ninvestment is certainly helpful to our country and something we \nencourage.\n  We need a Tax Code that is fair, that people believe they are being \ntreated fairly with their neighbor, which is not the current situation. \nMost Americans cannot figure out the income tax code and don't know \nwhether they are being treated fairly with other taxpayers, and we need \na code that is much more efficient.\n  So one path we could pursue and that Senator Hatch was alluding to is \nto try to reform our current income tax codes--our corporate income tax \ncode and our personal income tax code.\n  We have an example of that. Congressman Camp has come up with a \ncomprehensive proposal in the House of Representatives. I must say I \ndon't think Congressman Camp's proposal adds up from the point of view \nof producing the revenue we produce today, let alone the revenue we \nneed in order to pay our bills and not be dependent upon borrowing \nmoney from other countries. But putting that aside, I think we see the \ndifficulty in the Camp proposal, which causes major disruptions among \ndifferent industries, and we are hearing from those industries that it \nwould create major problems for competitiveness for the United States.\n  I think the most fundamental flaw with trying to reform our current \nTax Code is we tried that once before in 1986, and it was comprehensive \nand it did spread the burden and it did reduce the rate. It lasted for \nless than 1 year before Congress continued to change the Tax Code.\n  Today we have tens of thousands of changes since the 1986 tax reform \nand we have many temporary provisions. That is why we have the bill \nbefore us right now to deal with these expiring tax provisions. I don't \nthink there is any way of getting around these types of problems moving \nforward under our current Tax Code.\n  I will point out a fact I don't think most Americans have understood. \nIf we look at all the OECD countries--the industrial countries of the \nworld, countries that we like to compare ourselves to, countries that \nwe want to be competitive with--of all the industrial nations of the \nworld, the United States is near the bottom in regard to their reliance \nupon government services. In Europe they have much stronger government \nservices in health care and housing and income support-type programs \nthan we do in the United States.\n  If we rely less on governmental services, wouldn't that mean we \nshould have the lowest competitive tax rates among the industrial \nnations? Instead, as Senator Hatch pointed out, we have the highest \nmarginal tax rates among the industrial nations, and the reason is \nquite simple. Of all the industrial nations in the world, only the \nUnited States does not have a national consumption tax. We rely on \nincome tax revenues. Why? Because we thought that was the right way to \ngo, and we didn't have to worry about international competition. After \nall, we are America.\n  Guess what. We are in global competition today, and the tax rates of \nthis country matter in regard to our manufacturers being able to sell \nproducts overseas.\n  One other fact about international competition. International \ncompetition rules at the WTO were developed based upon consumption \ntaxes. So if a company manufactures an automobile in Germany and wants \nto bring it into the United States, the taxes they pay--the consumption \ntaxes--are taken off of that product. So basically their autos sell in \nAmerica tax free; whereas, U.S. auto manufacturers that have to pay \ntaxes, those taxes still apply to the cost of the product because it is \nnot border adjusted.\n  Then, to make matters worse, if they manufacture a car in the United \nStates and try to sell it in Germany, they not only have to pay the \ncorporate taxes here, the income taxes--because they are not taken off \nat the border, they are not border adjusted--when they go into Germany, \nthey have to pay the value-added tax, the consumption tax. How do we \ncompete under those circumstances? The answer is it is very difficult. \nIn global competition today, we have to be smart.\n  This is why we should have the lowest marginal tax rates in the \nworld. If we did, corporate inversion would not be an issue because we \nwouldn't find a Pfizer trying to pay British taxes when the U.S. taxes \nare the lowest taxes among the industrial nations of the world.\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\n  So I have a proposal called the progressive consumption tax. \n``Progressive,'' what do I mean by that? It means the taxes paid at the \nFederal level will be more reflective of a person's ability to pay than \nour current income tax code is. We make it progressive so it is fair, \nin that they pay according to their ability to pay a progressive \nconsumption tax. That consumption tax rate will be the lowest among the \nindustrial nations of the world.\n  I will give some examples. I will be the first to acknowledge we have \nto get these scored and these numbers can change as we go along, but we \nare looking at a consumption tax rate of about 10 percent. This would \nput us at the bottom of the consumption taxes among industrial nations. \nIndividuals who earn under $25,000 and families up to $50,000 would pay \nno consumption taxes. They would get a credit for the consumption taxes \nthey otherwise would pay.\n  Similar to the current income tax code where they do not pay income \ntaxes, they would not pay consumption taxes. It would be immediately \nrebated to them. If they work, it would be rebated under the payroll \ntax payments. If they don't work, they would get a debit card to get \ninstant rebates and use it as people use debit cards.\n\n  So we would make it progressive. We would then be able to start the \nincome tax rates at $100,000, approximately, of taxable income, and 90 \npercent of Americans would pay no income taxes. It would start at 15 \npercent. There would be an additional bracket of 25 percent, starting \nat $40,000 of taxable income. So a progressive income tax, simplified, \nwith only four deductions, not this complexity today as we figure out \nwhether something is deductible and all the complications.\n  We would have four deductions for State and local--with respect to \nfederalism--State and local taxes: for charitable deductions because \nour charities are critically important to carrying out the important \nwork of our country, for real estate and the needs for the real estate \nto reflect--so we don't see destruction of the real estate market, and \nwe also allow deductions for employer-provided health benefits and \nretirement benefits. It is simplified, it rewards simplicity, and \nallows for the progressiveness of fairness in our Tax Code that does \nnot exist today.\n  The corporate tax rate would get down to 15 percent. That is what \ncorporate America tells us we need to be competitive in the industrial \nworld. This adds up.\n  Some say: Gee. Consumption taxes raise a lot of revenue. We put in \nour proposal an automatic adjustment of the rate to make sure it \ndoesn't bring in more revenue than we say. So we are fair on the \nprogressive side to make sure it is fair from the point of view of the \nability of middle-class families to pay, and it is fair from the point \nof view of those who are concerned about government growing, in that it \nhas a circuit break as to the rate based upon the revenue that you \nneed.\n  What have we accomplished by this? We have accomplished a much \nsimpler Tax Code that people can understand, a fairer Tax Code, one \nthat rewards savings. Savings are not taxed. There is a greater ability \nto raise capital in the United States. It is border adjusted, which \nmeans the taxes come off our exported products so we can compete \nglobally in a much easier way. This is what we accomplish.\n  So when people talk about fundamental reform, to me, this is what we \nneed to do.\n  I am going to move this proposal as quickly as I can, but obviously \nit is going to take some discussion and debate. We are hopeful we will \nbe able to answer anyone's questions on it. We are very optimistic, but \nin the meantime what do we do? We can't just stand by and allow Pfizer \nto take American jobs overseas because of corporate inversion. So I \nhope we will stand for what is right in our Tax Code, that we have the \ncapacity to improve our current Tax Code to avoid the loss of jobs and \nshipping jobs overseas, as well as working to reform our Tax Code and \nprovide the type of structure so the country that relies the least on \ngovernment among the industrial nations has the lowest tax rate and has \na fairer system for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2935-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1670 and S. 1696\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I \nwill make in a moment to kind of set the stage for what I am asking the \nSenate to consider. We will be asking that we schedule a vote on two \npieces of legislation: the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, S. \n1670, which is my legislation; and S. 1696, the Women's Health \nProtection Act, by Senator Blumenthal.\n  Very briefly, what I am trying to do is to have an opportunity for \nthe body to talk about two pieces of legislation that relate to the \nabortion issue, the role of the Federal Government. Very quickly, my \nlegislation would ban abortion at the 20-week period--the fifth month \nof pregnancy--based on the theory that the child can feel pain at that \npoint in the pregnancy and that the standard of care for the medical \ncommunity is that you cannot operate on an unborn fetus at the 20-week \nperiod without administering anesthesia, and the reason for that is \nbecause the child can feel pain.\n  There have been individuals born at the 20-week period who have \nsurvived. But the theory of the case is not based on the medical \nviability under Roe vs. Wade; it is a new theory that the State has a \ncompelling interest in protecting an unborn child at this stage of \npregnancy. The partial-birth abortion ban, which applies at 24 weeks, \nis backed up to 20 weeks.\n  Here is what medical journals tell parents to do at 20 weeks: An \nunborn child can hear and respond to sounds. Talk or sing. The unborn \nchild enjoys hearing your voice.\n  It is a whole list of things about the unborn child in the 20-week \nperiod.\n  We are one of seven countries that allow abortions at this stage in \nthe pregnancy, along with China, North Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, \nCanada, and the Netherlands.\n  So I would ask the body to consider having a debate on my legislation \nabout whether we should limit elective abortions at the 20-week period \nand also a debate on Senator Blumenthal's legislation that basically \nwould allow the courts to set aside several State restrictions on \nabortion. We are going to present a series of actions at the State \nlevel. I think his legislation would allow the courts to have a literal \nconstruction in terms of being able to strike down these provisions. I \ndisagree with my good friend. We are good friends, although we have a \ndifferent view. The Senator from Connecticut made a statement when he \nintroduced the bill that every Senator should be on the record when it \ncomes to this legislation. I agree. I hope every Senator would be on \nthe record when it comes to my legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican \nleader, the Senate proceed to consideration of S. 1670, the Pain-\nCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, and S. 1696, the Women's Health \nProtection Act; that there be up to 8 hours of debate equally divided \nin the usual form, to run concurrently; that there be no amendments, \npoints of order, or motions in order; that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on S. 1670; that following \nthe disposition of S. 1670, the Senate proceed to vote on S. 1696; and \nthat both bills be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Reserving my right to object, and I will object, I respect my friend \nand colleague from South Carolina. We are friends, and we agree on a \nlot of issues.\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nOn this issue we fundamentally disagree.\n  I am here to remind the American people and my colleagues that this \nproposal to ban abortion after 20 weeks, in my view, is irresponsible \nand should not be before the Senate. But I am more than happy to cast a \nvote on it, along with the Women's Health Protection Act, and I hope \nthey will be considered. This issue deserves to be before this body.\n  Neither of these proposals has yet been considered in committee. The \nminority leader of this body has recently spoken about the need for ``a \nvigorous committee process'' in handling bills. This bill should not be \nconsidered in this way.\n  This bill would prohibit the medical profession from performing an \nabortion when a fetus is older than 20 weeks and would do nothing, \nfrankly, to help women protect their health and the health of their \nfamilies as well as their right to have control over their health care \nneeds. This bill leaves the vast majority of women who may need an \nabortion for health reasons after 20 weeks of pregnancy with no \noptions, and it punishes doctors with up to 5 years in prison for \nproviding a service that the doctor believes in his or her professional \nmedical opinion is best for the woman and her family. Our \nconstitutional right to privacy tells us unequivocally and emphatically \nthat these choices should be between the doctor and her family or her \nadvisers, including her clergy.\n  The proponents of this bill would have us believe the bill would \nreduce the number of abortions in this country. In fact, the statistic \nthat matters in this debate shows there are a mere 1.5 percent of \nabortions that occur 20 weeks after conception, and the majority of \nthese medical procedures occur due to a health issue that would put the \nfetus or mother or both at risk.\n  Take for example a young woman I am going to call Laura. She is a \nyoung mother from Connecticut. She became ill at 22 weeks into her \nfirst pregnancy with early onset of severe preeclampsia. Laura's blood \npressure rose dangerously, her kidneys stopped, and she was at risk. \nHer pregnancy was wanted. She wanted a baby and she planned for it, but \nshe needed to end it to protect her health. Her physician was able to \nprovide her with a timely and safe abortion. Although Laura felt a \nfuture pregnancy would be too risky, she went on to adopt three \nchildren.\n  Facing such severe medical risk, women such as Laura need the safest \ncare modern medicine can offer. With all due respect, Senator Graham's \nbill ignores the health realities of women, the realities they face \nevery day in Connecticut and around the country. Had this bill been \nlaw, a doctor would have had to wait for Laura to be facing death \nbefore protecting her with the abortion she needed.\n  The Women's Health Protection Act would put women's rights first. The \nWomen's Health Protection Act seeks full and thorough consideration of \nthese issues, and I seek it through the regular order. Let's have \nhearings, let's consider these measures in committee, and let's bring \nthem to the floor in a way that they can be debated insightfully and \nthoughtfully, not this way. The Women's Health Protection Act protects \na woman's health and her ability to make her own decisions and her \nconstitutional rights.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We already have laws in this country banning elective \nabortions at the 24-week period. It is called the partial-birth \nabortion ban. It has been through the Supreme Court, it went through \nthis body, it went through the House, and it got overwhelming support. \nThat bill has exceptions for rape and incest and cases that involve the \nlife of the mother; so would this. We are just backing it up 4 weeks, \nand the reason we are backing it up 4 weeks is because at 20 weeks \npeople have been born and survived. I know twins who were born at 20 \nweeks.\n  But the theory of the case is that the government should have the \nright to protect an unborn child, and most of the abortions are so far \nalong that the medical science requires anesthesia before you operate. \nThe question is, If we are going to require a doctor to provide \nanesthesia to the baby before they operate to save its life, should we \nauthorize abortions at that point?\n  The Washington Post poll showed just a few months ago that by 56 to \n27 percent, people supported the 20-week pain-capable bill--60 percent \nwomen.\n  At the end of the day I hope we can have a debate on this issue. The \nreason I brought it up today is because this is the anniversary of the \nDr. Gosnell case, which was one of the most horrendous cases in \nAmerican jurisprudence, where a doctor received life sentences for \nthree counts of murder. He was an abortion doctor aborting babies at \nthe latest stage of pregnancy. If the babies survived the abortion, he \nwould cut the spinal cord. Three women died as a result of the care \ngiven by him. It was a chamber of horrors. It was a year ago today.\n  I hope people will not forget what Dr. Gosnell did, and if we can \nprevent occurrences such as that, we should, and that is what this bill \nis designed to do--to make sure the unborn child at this stage of the \npregnancy has a chance to continue on. There are only seven countries \nin the world that allow abortions at this stage, and I hope that when \nthis debate is over, the United States will not be in the seven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I respect the sincerity of my \ncolleague from South Carolina. The fact of one instance of possible \nmedical malpractice does not justify this kind of sweeping abrogation \nof women's reproductive rights or women's health care. The principle is \nthe same whether it is 4 weeks back or 4 weeks forward. The principle \nis that a woman has constitutional rights to choose health care and has \na constitutional right to privacy that would be negated by this \nmeasure. And we are siding with improving women's health care, \nenhancing and upgrading it, and giving women choices and protecting \nthose choices, not cutting back by 4 weeks or in any way infringing on \nthat fundamental right.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Boxer be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today the senior Senator from South \nCarolina and his Republican colleagues have proposed a measure which \namounts, in my opinion, to an attack on the freedom of American women \nto make their own personal health care decisions. Instead of focusing \non improving access to health care for women, these Senators are \npursuing divisive policies that jeopardize women's health and put \npoliticians and government between a woman and her doctor.\n  I object to this dangerous political game. Women's access to quality \nhealth care is not a political game for me and some of my colleagues \nwho join me here today, nor is it a game for women and families across \nthe country and in my home State of Wisconsin. Too many States have \nenacted record numbers of laws that restrict women's access to \nreproductive health services and the freedom to make their own health \ncare decisions. These restrictions, such as the one we heard proposed \nearlier this afternoon, have real and serious consequences for American \nfamilies.\n  I recently heard from a mother in Middleton, WI, who at 20 weeks of \npregnancy was devastated to find out that her baby would not survive \ndelivery. She had to undergo an emergency termination. A clinic in \nMilwaukee, WI, was the only place that would do the procedure, but \nbecause our Republican Governor was preparing to sign a law imposing \nsome incredible requirements and burdens on providers, this particular \nclinic was preparing to close its doors and they wouldn't schedule her \nfor an appointment. She and her husband were forced to find childcare \nfor their two sons and travel to another State in order to get the \nmedical care she needed.\n  The threat in Wisconsin and in States across the country is clear: \nWhen politicians play doctor, American families suffer. This is why my \ngood friend from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal and I have introduced a \nserious proposal--the Women's Health\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nProtection Act. It would put a stop to these attacks on women's \nfreedom. Our bill creates Federal protections against restrictions such \nas the Republican proposal we were hearing about today, proposals that \nunduly limit access to reproductive health care, that do nothing to \nfurther women's health or safety, and that intrude upon personal \ndecisionmaking. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance \nthis important legislation through the committee process and through \nregular order.\n  We know today's spectacle is not meant to produce a serious debate \nabout protecting women's reproductive health; it is about the narrow \nRepublican agenda to take our country backward and to roll back \nimportant health benefits for American families.\n  We have seen this with the numerous failed attempts by Republicans to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act that have empowered millions of women \nwith more choices and stronger health care coverage. Today, women can \nfinally rest assured that they will not be charged more for their \ncoverage just because they are women, and someone's mother can get a \nlifesaving mammogram without the fear of high medical bills.\n  Over 50 times congressional Republicans have tried to roll back this \neconomic security for millions of American families. Republicans, it \nseems, would gladly go back to the days where being a woman was \nconsidered a preexisting condition and insurance companies could drop \nyour coverage because you get sick, get older or have a baby. But we \nare not going to go back to those days just as we are not going to \ncreate a future where politicians in Washington take away the freedom \nof women to make their own personal health care decisions.\n  I am committed to putting a stop to the relentless and ideological \nattacks on American families and will continue to fight to ensure that \nboth men and women have the freedom to access the health care services \nthey need. In the United States of America, health care should be a \nright guaranteed to all. That is why I and so many of us have fought \nand we will continue to fight as we move our country forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask to add 10 minutes to the 10 minutes \nI have already requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened carefully to Senator Lindsey \nGraham, who put forward a very dangerous bill for women and their \nfamilies in this country. I will explain in a moment why I think it is \ndangerous, but what was interesting is that I believe he said he \nbrought it forward today because it is the anniversary that Dr. Gosnell \nwas convicted and sent to prison. This is a rogue doctor who committed \ndespicable and illegal acts and is now serving life in prison without \nthe possibility of parole for what he did--abusing the trust of being a \nreproductive health care doctor. Dr. Gosnell is away, as he should be.\n  How does my friend from North Carolina commemorate this? By putting \nforward a bill that will drive more women to rogue doctors. If we make \nit illegal for a woman, regardless of her circumstance, she is going to \nfind a way to save her health, her life, and her family.\n  Women deserve to have protections. The bill that my friend proposed \nsimply says that after a certain number of weeks, an abortion will not \nbe allowed no matter what a woman's health situation is, and that is \nvery dangerous.\n  I ask--just rhetorically--how can a Senator say he is doing something \nright for women and their families when there is not a health \nexception? If a woman goes to the doctor and finds out she is facing \ncancer, kidney failure, blood clots or some other tragic complication, \nwhy should the government step into the middle of her family? Why \nshould the government and U.S. Senators be allowed to step between the \nwoman, her doctor, her God, and her family? It is a disgrace, \nespecially from a party that is known for saying: Get Government off \nour backs.\n  This is horrible. There is no exception for rape or incest victims \nwho are unable to report those heinous crimes. Let's say initially they \nwere too frightened and then suddenly they get their courage. Well, too \nbad. Have your rapist's child. This is not a government that cares \nabout families. This is a government that steps into our business at \nthe most tragic moments of our lives.\n  The bill is so extreme that the American Congress of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, which represents thousands of OB/GYNs, said these \nrestrictions are ``dangerous to patients' safety and health.'' Who do \nyou think stands up for the health of the women in this country? U.S. \nSenators or doctors who know the women, the family, and the \ncircumstances of her health?\n  I have a letter from Christie, who lives in Central Virginia, and she \nsaid:\n\n       My husband and I were confronted with two equally horrible \n     options--carry the pregnancy to term and watch our baby girl \n     suffocate to death upon birth, or terminate the pregnancy \n     early and say good-bye to our much-wanted and much-loved baby \n     girl.\n\n  Why should a Senator tell her what to do? It is a war on women. When \nyou tell a woman in that type of circumstance what to do and take away \nher right to use her mind, her brain, and the love she has for her \nfamily, her husband, and her children to make that decision, it is a \nwar on women.\n  Christie was pregnant with her second child when that happened. She \nwanted this baby, but it was not until a 20-week ultrasound that she \nfound out her daughter would suffocate to death at birth. What U.S. \nSenator has a right to make her watch that baby child suffocate to \ndeath? I am sorry, but that is not life-affirming.\n  Then there is Judy from Wisconsin. She says:\n\n       I know what it is like to live without a mother. My mother \n     died when I was only 4 years old, and it changed my life \n     forever.\n\n  Four months into her pregnancy, Judy developed a pregnancy-induced \nblood clot in her arm. The only guarantee she would not die and leave \nbehind her 5-year-old son was for Judy to terminate the pregnancy. She \nand her husband made the very difficult decision to terminate that \npregnancy.\n  What right does a U.S. Senator--who doesn't know her, doesn't know \nher husband, doesn't know her family history and how she lost her \nmother when she was young--have to step into that world at that moment \nand tell her what she has to do. Do we think so little of the women of \nthis Nation?\n  We just had Mother's Day. We lauded our mothers. We are crying out \nfor the girls who were taken by terrorists. If we all care, then why \nwould we support legislation such as this?\n  Then there is Bridget's story. At the time, she was a 25-year-old mom \nlooking forward to the birth of her third child. She initially had a \nnormal ultrasound at 13 weeks. Her second ultrasound showed a major, \ncomplex fetal cardiac malformation, a fatal problem. Because tests \ncould only confirm this fatal defect later in the pregnancy, she could \nnot make a decision until after the 20 weeks.\n  What right does a U.S. Senator have to get in the middle of her most \npersonal, most private, most difficult decisions? There is a place for \ngovernment. It is to make life better for people. It is to say: We are \nwith you. We have your back. We understand what you are going through. \nIt is not to make life so difficult for people.\n  In Missouri, Julie and her husband were told relatively early in her \npregnancy that the baby they were expecting had multiple abnormalities \nand would not survive outside the womb, but it took her 3 weeks to \nlocate an abortion provider because they had shut down so many \nproviders. They found out, under Missouri's restrictive laws, she would \nhave to travel 2 hours to a facility on two separate occasions to \ncomply with the State's 24-hour waiting period. When they were finally \nable to get the care they needed, her pregnancy was just over 20 weeks.\n\n  What right does any U.S. Senator have to step out there and tell the \nAmerican people that we know better than their families know, that we \nknow better than their doctors know, and that we know better than their \nclergy knows?\n  This bill targets doctors who risk their lives to help women who are \nat risk for paralysis, infertility, have cancer, and whose lives would \nbe in danger if they continued the pregnancy. This bill would throw \nthose doctors in prison for 5 years just for providing needed health \ncare to their patients.\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n  I don't know what kind of country people envision when we have the \ngovernment policing the private health care decisions of women and \ntheir families. Why would we want to go back to the last century and \nopen battles that have long been fought? Those battles were fought in \n1973 when Roe v. Wade was the decision of the Supreme Court, and do you \nknow what that court said? They balanced all the rights--the rights of \nthe fetus with the rights of the mother--and they said early in the \npregnancy, a woman has the right to choose. It is her decision, but as \nshe goes along with the pregnancy, then later, yes, there will be \nrestrictions, and that is fine as long as the health and the life of \nthe mother are in the forefront.\n  This legislation that Senator Graham wants to vote on--before it goes \nto any committee as Senator Blumenthal was saying--it is not what is \nbest for women and their families or our communities, it is about an \nextreme rightwing agenda that needs to stop. This is a moderate \ncountry. We work together. I don't get everything I want, you don't get \neverything you want, but we work it out.\n  To come and offer legislation that is extremely dangerous to women \nis, in my opinion--I don't know what to call it. It is out of sync with \nwhat we ought to be doing. As Senator Baldwin said, we ought to be \nfighting, and she used that word ``fighting.'' We should be fighting \nfor health care for women, fighting for the rights of our families, so \nthey can have decent health care, and not putting rules in the books \nthat are so onerous that a woman is desperate. I don't understand it.\n  I believe the Republican Party has moved so far to the right, it is \nunrecognizable to me. When I started out in politics--which was a long \ntime ago--Republicans and Democrats worked together on the environment. \nNow we can't get a vote from them so we can ensure that the Clean Air \nAct is protecting our people. We can't get them to address climate \nchange. We cannot get a vote from them. Maybe once in a blue moon we \nget a vote from one or two. George Herbert Walker Bush was the \nPresident who worked hard at Planned Parenthood, and that is where \nRepublicans used to be. We would come together on protecting a woman's \nright to choose. There were more Republicans in Planned Parenthood than \nRepublicans when I got started in politics. Now the Republicans want to \nrun Planned Parenthood out. They want to shut down their clinics and \nstop all the good they are doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n  I call it a war on women. We heard people say: Well, maybe there is \nsuch a thing as legitimate rape. Have you ever heard of anything so \noutrageous? We can't even get anyone to move forward on equal pay for \nequal work around here.\n  I am sad to say that I think this bill is part of the war on women. \nClearly, they are the ones who will suffer, along with their \ndoctors. We don't put women in grave danger. We don't put up \nlegislation without a health exception. We don't step in the middle of \nour families' most difficult decisions.\n\n  Americans want us to focus on making life better for our families. \nThey don't want us to create new health risks. God knows we have enough \nhealth stressors just breathing the air out there, getting the flu and \neverything else. We don't need legislation that restricts a woman's \nrights when she needs to have us at her back, helping her, making her \nsafe. Let's not go back to the last century.\n  If somebody has a bill such as this, I hope they will let it go \nthrough the whole committee process. We need these women who I quoted \ntoday to look Senators in the eye and say: Senator, please stay out of \nmy life. These decisions are difficult enough, but I know I can handle \nthem with my family, with my God, with my support system.\n  Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. In the early stages, a woman has \na pretty much unfettered right. As we go along, there are more \nrestrictions. But we never, ever turn our back on a woman's health or \nher life. That is what Roe says.\n  Frankly, I hope this bill and others like it will not see the light \nof day because it could only make life very difficult for many of our \nfamilies.\n  I thank the Chair. It is an honor to work with the Presiding Officer \non this issue.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Remembering Officer Stephen Arkell\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to honor the memory of Brentwood Police Officer Stephen Arkell.\n  Officer Arkell's life was tragically cut short yesterday while \nresponding to the call of duty--the same call of duty he courageously \nanswered countless times over the course of his career. A 15-year \nveteran of the Brentwood Police Department, Arkell served as a part-\ntime officer as well as an animal control officer for the town of \nBrentwood where he was born and raised. As is the case with all of our \nfirst responders, his commitment to protecting our communities was \nunparalleled. That commitment was integral to keeping our families, our \nchildren, and our community safe every day. That same commitment, and \nOfficer Arkell's sacrifice, is something New Hampshire will never \nforget.\n  Stephen Arkell's life and career epitomized the heroism of our first \nresponders, and all of us, every day, will be forever grateful for \nthat. Today my thoughts and prayers are with his family--his wife and \nhis two teenage daughters, his loved ones, the Brentwood Police \nDepartment, and the entire Brentwood community, as well as New \nHampshire's entire law enforcement community. I hope they can all take \nsome solace in knowing that New Hampshire joins them in both mourning \nOfficer Arkell's loss as well as celebrating his selfless sacrifice and \nhis service on behalf of Brentwood and our beloved State.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Being in the Majority\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, shortly after I arrived in the Senate, in \n2002, Republicans--my political party--became the majority party, and I \nquickly learned a few important lessons. First of all, being in the \nmajority is better than being in the minority. But part of the price of \nbeing in the majority is that sometimes you have to take some tough \nvotes via the amendment process. In other words, when the Senate is \noperating the way it was originally intended--and which it always has \nuntil recently--any Senator has the right to seek recognition and offer \nan amendment on almost any topic on almost any bill. My colleagues told \nme at the time--they said: It has always been that way, and it is the \nway it always should be, if we are serious about protecting minority \nrights.\n  So why should I care, being a Member of the majority, about \nprotecting minority rights in the Senate? Well, in the intervening \nyears, my political party has gone from being in the majority in the \nSenate to being in the minority. That is one reason to care. The other \nreason to care is because every Senator was elected by their \nconstituents in their State to represent their State, and when any \nSenator--whether they are in the majority or the minority--is shut out \nof the process, their constituents are shut out of the process. That is \nnot what the Constitution contemplates when it says that each State has \na right to send two Senators to Washington. If you can tell one of \nthose or both of those Senators to sit down and be quiet, you cannot \noffer any amendments, you cannot get any votes on your amendments, you \nare effectively shutting out, in my case, the 26 million people I \nrepresent in the State of Texas.\n  So the message is this: If you do not want to take tough votes, you \nare in the wrong line of work--you are in the wrong line of work. The \nway the Senate should operate is that each of us is\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\naccountable to our constituents, and when they disagree with us about a \nvote, then they have a right to tell us. That is called petitioning \nyour government for the redress of grievances.\n  Accountability, which is the way this Congress is supposed to work, \ncan only work when we have an open process, where the minority gets to \nparticipate in the process and the majority gets to participate in the \nprocess. And guess what. If you are in the majority on a given subject, \nyou are going to win. But that is no justification for shutting down \nthe minority and saying: Sit down; shut up; forget about the fact that \nyou have an election certificate from your secretary of State saying \nyou were duly and regularly chosen by the voters in your State to \nrepresent them in what used to be the world's greatest deliberative \nbody.\n  Here is something else I learned when I came to the Senate--something \nthat does not happen as much now--but what I learned is this place \nworks best when individual bills are drafted by Senators and move \nthrough the committee process. That is because usually the committees \nthat have jurisdiction over those pieces of legislation have some \nexperience and some expertise in the subject matter, and sometimes the \nsubject matter gets pretty complicated. And it is good for the Senate, \nit is good for the United States to have a committee look at the \nlegislation. People will have a chance to offer amendments and have \nthem voted up or down before they then come to the Senate floor. Then \nevery Senator gets to participate whether they know very much about the \ntopic. Hopefully, all of us get to be smart pretty quickly when a bill \ncomes to the floor because that is our chance to have a say on behalf \nof our constituents, whether we are in the majority or whether we are \nin the minority. We do not have a right to win--the minority does not--\nbut we do have a right to a voice and a vote and to participate in the \nlegislative process, which is what has been denied under the current \nmajority leader.\n  More than a decade after I came to the Senate, I hardly recognize it; \nit is so dramatically different. Indeed, in some ways it is \ndiametrically opposite from what it was when I got here and, frankly, \nthe way the Senate has operated for a couple hundred years since the \nfounding of our country. Only in the last few years under the current \nmajority leader has the Senate become completely dysfunctional, where \nthe majority leader becomes, in essence, a dictator who says: No, \nSenator, your amendment cannot be considered, it cannot be voted on. In \nother words, it is not up to the Senator to offer an amendment to try \nto shape legislation on behalf of our constituents, to engage in robust \ndebate; it is the majority leader who basically becomes the traffic cop \nwho says who stops, who goes. Of course, that is one reason why the \nSenate has become so dysfunctional.\n  Under the current majority leader, an unprecedented number of bills \nhave come directly to the floor from his conference room, from his \noffice, and bypassed the committee process. In fact, many of my \ncolleagues, including many of my Democratic colleagues, have been left \nwondering: Why in the world have committees in the Senate if we are not \ngoing to use them, if we are not going to use the committees for the \nexperience and the expertise those Members serving on those committees \nhave before it comes to the Senate floor.\n  In addition to bypassing the committee process in an unprecedented \nsort of way, once the Senate legislation comes to the Senate floor out \nof the majority leader's conference room--or wherever it is it comes \nfrom--Senators from both parties, representing hundreds of millions of \nAmerican citizens, are routinely denied the opportunity to offer \namendments and engage in meaningful debate. We just saw that yesterday \nas a direct result of the majority leader's denying anyone--the \nPresiding Officer, one of our Democratic colleagues, or anyone--an \nopportunity to offer amendments and to get votes on those amendments on \nan energy bill, which is the first time we have had an energy bill on \nthe floor since 2007. The majority leader shuts down the process and \nsays, in essence: Sit down; shut up; good luck.\n  During the 109th Congress, when Republicans controlled this Chamber, \nDemocrats were allowed to offer--that is the minority party was allowed \nto offer--1,043 separate amendments--1,043 separate amendments during \nthe 109th Congress. Do you know how many amendments Republicans have \nbeen able to offer since July of last year in the Senate? Nine--nine \nRepublican amendments in 10 months.\n\n  Majority Leader Reid has filled the amendment tree--that is the \ntechnical jargon; someone has called it basically that it is the gag \nrule of the majority leader, but it is technically blocking the \namendment process--more than twice as much as majority leaders Bill \nFrist, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, Bob Dole, George Mitchell, and Robert \nByrd combined; that is one, two, three, four, five, six--six previous \nmajority leaders did not do it as much as the current majority leader, \nSenator Reid; that is, block out any amendments from the minority.\n  I know because we have talked about this so much before most \nAmericans really are not focused on Senate procedure and they think: \nWell, maybe this is just one Senator who is a little sore at being \nfrozen out of the process and losing on a particular piece of \nlegislation. But, again, this is not about the prerogatives of an \nindividual U.S. Senator; this is about the people's prerogative, the \npeople's right to participate in the process. The very legitimacy of \nour form of government depends upon consent of the governed. How can \nthe people the Presiding Officer represents and I represent consent \nwhen they have been shut out? Is this what the Founding Fathers had in \nmind when they created our great system of government--to shut our \nfellow citizens out of the process, to trample on minority rights? \nHardly.\n  Before I conclude, I want to say a quick word about some of the \nmajority leader's most recent comments when we have had a discussion \nabout this problem.\n  When Americans ponder the root causes of Washington dysfunction and \ngridlock, I hope they remember the majority leader of the Senate, who \nleads this great institution and has referred to the minority party in \nthe Senate as ``greased pigs.'' He has accused us of wanting to \nsuppress voting rights. He has claimed we have tried to ``dump on'' \nwomen and minorities. He describes Senators representing their \nconstituents with amendments as ``screwing around,'' and he demonizes \nprivate citizens exercising their rights under the Constitution of the \nUnited States as ``un-American.'' I have to confess, I find these \ncomments insulting, I find these comments disrespectful, and I find \nthem embarrassing.\n  How can we ever expect to reach compromise, which is the only way \nthings happen here? Neither party can dictate on their own what the \noutcomes legislatively will be, so the only way we can do it is to try \nto find common ground and work together, without sacrificing our \nprinciples, of course. But how are we ever going to solve some of the \nmost complex legislative challenges that confront us--such as tax \nreform?\n  We have a bill on the floor where we are being asked to extend 55 \nexpiring temporary tax provisions. For how long? Well, through 2015. Is \nthat a good way to do business? Well, no. What kind of uncertainty is \nthere when we do not even know what the Tax Code is going to say for \nmore than a year and a half?\n  Then there is entitlement reform. I mentioned this before. We have \nthese pages here who are serving in the Senate. They are in high \nschool. Someday the $17 trillion the Federal Government owes to our \ncreditors is going to have to be paid back--someday. When that happens, \nI daresay interest rates are not going to be at zero, which is what \nthey are now thanks to the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve \nis trying to juice the economy, doing the best it can to get the \neconomy back on track, although we do not have a lot to show for it. \nThe economy grew at 0.1 percent last quarter.\n  How are we going to fix our broken immigration system if the majority \nleader is going to routinely slander Members of this body and our \nconstituents? How are we going to fix what is broken if the majority \nleader wants to trash talk folks on this side of the aisle and people \nhe disagrees with. He even called them un-American. For what? For \nparticipating in the political process. Well, of course, he would like \nto\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nshut them up and make them sit down so he could do what he wants \nwithout any resistance or without anybody questioning his actions.\n  Recently in Austin President Obama and others gathered for a historic \ncelebration. It was the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Civil \nRights Act. Do you know how many amendments were voted on by the Senate \nwhen the Civil Rights Act was passed? There were 117 amendments.\n  Do you think this Congress and this Senate today, under this majority \nleader, would have any opportunity to pass historic legislation to heal \nthe wounds of our country that date back to the very founding of this \nNation, given the fact that the minority is shut out of the process, no \namendments are allowed, and no votes on those amendments? There is no \nway. What a tragedy--the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.\n  Then for more mundane matters, when the Panama Canal treaties were \ndebated in this body, there were 75 rollcall votes. That was a very \ncontroversial issue at the time. But there are nine rollcall votes in \nthis body coming from the Republican side since July, with no prospect \nof allowing any amendments on the current tax bill that is on the \nfloor.\n  Just like the energy bill that we concluded yesterday, there is no \nprospect in sight for a better outcome and better behavior by the \npeople who should know better. How can we expect to achieve comity in \nthis Chamber when its most powerful Member has done so much to poison \nthe atmosphere.\n  The Senate of 2014 is certainly not the Senate that our Founding \nFathers envisioned, nor is it the Senate that my former colleague, \nSenator Chris Dodd, described in his 2010 farewell speech. Let me quote \njust a small portion. Senator Dodd reminded us that:\n\n       The Senate was designed to be different, not simply for the \n     sake of variety, but because the Framers believed the Senate \n     could and should be the venue in which statesmen would lift \n     America up to meet its unique challenges.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Senate will never be able to play that unique role \nin American government and American history until the majority leader \nshows greater respect for the constituents we represent and for this \ninstitution.\n  As I said, this debate is not about procedural niceties, it is not \nabout the prerogatives of the Senator because they think they are so \nimportant. When Republicans offer amendments to pending legislation, we \nare trying to give our constituents the voice that they are guaranteed \nby the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  When the majority leader refuses to let us vote on amendments and \nrefuses to let us have a real discussion about America's biggest \nchallenges, he is effectively gagging millions of Americans who don't \nshare his particular views. That is why the Senate has become so \ndysfunctional, because of the majority leader and his conduct.\n  I can only hope--indeed, I can only pray--that the majority leader \nwill change his mind and act as the genuine leader the Senate deserves \nand less as an angry dictator.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. At the outset, let me express my sympathy to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia on the tragedy that took place in his state. Our \nhearts and minds are with you and your citizens.\n\n\n                       Remembering Clisby Clarke\n\n  Mr. President, one of the sad occasions from time to time of a \nSenator is to rise to pay tribute to a friend and a citizen in one's \nState who passes away. It is now that occasion for me.\n  This past week a great hero of Georgia--both the University of \nGeorgia and the State of Georgia--Clisby Clarke passed away in his \nsleep in Highlands, NC. He will be laid to rest in Atlanta, GA, on this \ncoming Thursday at a ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. at Peachtree Road \nUnited Methodist Church.\n  Clisby was not just a citizen of my State, he was an extraordinary \ncitizen of my State, a University of Georgia graduate who was the hit \nof the University of Georgia as one of the great songwriters on our \ncampus. He wrote most of the fight songs that are played today for the \nUniversity of Georgia football team and could tear up the piano by \nplaying by ear like no one you have ever seen.\n  He was a talented pitchman who could make things sound good at the \ndrop of a hat, which is why he went to work for McCann-Erickson, one of \nthe great public relations firms in the history of our city. He led \nthat firm to unparalleled heights, and for a while, when I ran my \ncompany, I hired Clisby Clarke to do all the public relations for our \ncompany.\n  He married Bunny. From our days at the University of Georgia I \nremember Bunny and Clisby at the SAE House many nights, Clisby sitting \naround playing the piano, entertaining us, my wife Dianne and I--who \nthen wasn't my wife, but I was dating her--enjoying it, just enjoying \nour friendship and his great talent.\n  Clisby, when he retired from McCann-Erickson, didn't quit working; he \nvolunteered his time for others. In fact, when he passed away this week \nlate at night in his sleep, it was after having a successful planning \nsession for a dinner that is going to be held June 1 in Atlanta, GA, \nwhere over 750 people are coming to a black-tie event which will raise \nover half a million dollars for veterans who have been injured with \ntraumatic brain injury or PTSD.\n  Clisby never stopped working for those less fortunate or those who \nneeded help. His commitment to that project is unparalleled in our \ncity's history. When we all go to that dinner on this coming June 1, on \nthat evening, and celebrate the victory from raising money for those \nwith TBI and PTSD, we will also dedicate that evening to Clisby Clarke, \na great Georgian and a great American who from the day he was born \nuntil the day he passed away was always paying tribute and doing his \nloving work for those who were less fortunate and in need.\n  To his wife Bunny, to his family, and to his many friends, to all of \nus who were together fraternity brothers at the SAE House at the \nUniversity of Georgia in Athens, we pay our tribute to Clisby Clarke, a \ngreat American. May God bless his soul.\n  I yield back the time, Mr. President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Officer Stephen Arkell\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and legacy of Officer Stephen Arkell, a member of the \nBrentwood Police Department who was tragically killed last night in the \nline of duty.\n  Citizens across New Hampshire are mourning the loss of Officer \nArkell, whose bravery and courage represented the very best of our \nState's law enforcement community. Our hearts go out to his grieving \nfamily, friends, and fellow officers, as well as the people of the town \nof Brentwood, where he served so well. We are holding them close to our \nhearts and keeping them all in our thoughts and prayers during this \nvery difficult time for not only the Brentwood community but for the \nentire State of New Hampshire.\n  Officer Arkell was an unsung hero. He went about his extraordinary \nwork in a quiet, humble way, going above and beyond the call of duty to \nserve and protect the people of Brentwood and New Hampshire. During his \n15-year career as a police officer, he touched countless lives through \nhis selfless service to the people of Brentwood--proudly carrying on a \nnoble profession.\n  First and foremost, Officer Arkell was devoted to his family. Our \nhearts are broken for his wife Heather and their two teenaged \ndaughters. They are forced to cope with an unimaginable loss that no \nfamily should ever have to endure. We share in their sadness. We will \nbe there to comfort them as they mourn--the entire State of New \nHampshire--and we will always stand by their side.\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\n  We are grateful to them for the sacrifice they have made for us to be \nsafe and for everything they have done and for what they have endured. \nThere is no way we can repay them for the sacrifice they have made for \nthe State of New Hampshire to be safe. They lost a great dad.\n  I especially want to recognize Officer Arkell for the selfless time \nhe took to be a great coach. He coached lacrosse, teaching a new \ngeneration about teamwork and competition. He was exactly the kind of \nrole model that any parent would want for their son or daughter.\n  Officer Arkell was also someone whose friendship could be counted on. \nHe has been described as a friend who would ``give you the shirt off \nhis back''--a man who was ``kind'' and ``ethical'' and ``very caring.'' \nHe was well liked and well respected in the community that he served.\n  Sadly, this is not the first tragedy we have seen in Rockingham \nCounty. Just last year we added Greenland Police Chief Mike Maloney's \nname to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in \nWashington, DC. Our State continues to grieve for Chief Maloney.\n  Unfortunately, Chief Maloney's death and the death last night of \nOfficer Arkell remind us of the dangerous work our police officers do \nevery single day on our behalf. When they go out at night, on weekends \nand holidays--and we are all safe at home with our families--they don't \nknow whether that next stop or next response they have to make will be \ntheir last.\n  We are grateful for the service of all of the police officers in New \nHampshire and across this country who go out every day and serve our \nNation and keep us safe. Officer Arkell certainly represented the very \nbest of our law enforcement community, and we are so sad today as we \nmourn his loss.\n  As we mourn the loss of Officer Arkell, I am reminded of a quote that \ncan be found at the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington. \nThe quote really sums it up: ``It is not how these officers died that \nmade them heroes, it is how they lived.'' That is certainly true of \nOfficer Stephen Arkell. He was a special man who gave generously to his \nfamily, his friends, and his community. It is a tragedy that he was \ntaken from us far too soon. This is a tragedy no family should have to \nendure.\n  As we mourn his loss, we will pledge to forever honor his memory, his \nsacrifice, and the work he did every single day on behalf of the people \nof Brentwood and New Hampshire to keep us safe. We are grateful for his \nsacrifice. We can never repay the loss his family has endured nor can \nwe ever repay the sacrifices that are our police officers make every \nsingle day on our behalf to keep this country safe.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Squarely Focused\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, one would think, now more than ever, our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would recognize the American \npeople really want us focused squarely on jobs and the economy. It is \nwhat every poll says. It is what the vast majority of all of our \nconstituents say, and it is absolutely what is needed at a time when \nfamilies, especially working women, continue to struggle to make ends \nmeet. But instead of working with us across the aisle to give every \nAmerican a fair shot, it seems as though Republicans are focused on \nsomething else entirely: Politics.\n  Today, the senior Senator from South Carolina came to the floor and \nattempted to pass a bill that not only undermines women's access to \ntheir doctors but restricts their rights to access reproductive health \nservices. I am not sure what our colleagues think has changed since \nthey last introduced this bill in November, but just as it was back \nthen, this extreme, unconstitutional abortion ban is an absolute \nnonstarter. It is not going anywhere in the Senate and, as they know, \nit is a cheap political ploy. I would like to think that over the last \n41 years, since the historic decision of Roe v. Wade, we have moved on \nfrom debating this issue. I would like to think that after four \ndecades, many of those who want to make women's health care decisions \nfor them have come to grips with the fact that Roe v. Wade is settled \nlaw. After all, many of the signs of progress are all around us.\n  In this Congress there is a record 20 women serving in this body. In \n2012 women's power and voice at the ballot box was heard pretty loudly \nand clearly. In fact, when Republican candidates for office thought \nthat rape was a political talking point, that idea and their \ncandidacies were swiftly rejected, thanks in large part to the voices \nof women.\n  So sometimes it is tempting to think that times indeed have changed \nand that maybe, just maybe, politicians have finally realized that \ngetting between a woman and her doctor is not their job, that it is \npossible rightwing legislators have a newfound respect for women. But \nthe truth is that the drumbeat of politically-driven, extreme, and \nunconstitutional laws continues to get louder.\n  In 2013 our Nation saw yet another record-breaking year of State \nlegislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women's access to \nabortion services. In fact, in the past 3 years, more of these \nrestrictions have been enacted across this country than in the previous \n10 years combined. And anti-choice lawmakers here in our Nation's \ncapital have filed 50 legislative attacks on reproductive rights in \nthis Congress alone.\n  By the way, these haven't just been attacks on a woman's right to \nchoose, they have been an all-out assault on everything from shaming \npregnant women to drafting politically-driven legislation intended to \ncreate geographical roadblocks for low-income and racial minorities \nwishing to access safe reproductive services.\n  Not surprisingly, these States that have enacted some of the most \nextreme and archaic restrictions are also the same States that fail to \nachieve even mediocre standards when it comes to critical issues such \nas education and the economy. But despite these shortcomings, some \nMembers of this body refuse to work with us to address those critical \nissues and instead want to distract the American public with these \npurely political bills until the small pocket of their extreme audience \nis satisfied.\n  In fact, according to the Senator from South Carolina, debating a \nwoman's access to her own doctor is a ``debate worthy of a great \ndemocracy.'' The fact is it is a debate we have already had. This is a \ndirected attack on Roe v. Wade, and it is attack on what is already \nsettled law.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues today that real women's lives and the \nmost difficult health care decisions they could ever possibly make are \nat stake.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the story of Judy Nicastro. She is \nfrom my home State of Washington. She bravely shared her story publicly \nin the New York Times. I have told her story before, but it bears \nrepeating now because we are under attack again. In an op-ed she wrote, \njust days before the House passed a bill that was virtually identical \nto the one that was introduced today, Judy talked about being faced \nwith every pregnant woman's worst nightmare.\n  In describing the news that one of the twins she was carrying was \nfacing a condition where only one lung chamber had formed and that it \nwas only 20 percent complete, Judy captured the anguish countless other \nwomen in similar positions have faced. ``My world stopped,'' she wrote.\n\n       I loved being pregnant with twins and trying to figure out \n     which one was where in my uterus. Sometimes it felt like a \n     party in there, with eight limbs moving. The thought of \n     losing one child was unbearable.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       The MRI at Seattle Children's Hospital confirmed our worst \n     fears: The organs were pushed up into our boy's chest and not \n     developing properly. We were in the 22nd week.\n\n  Under the bill proposed today, the decision Judy ultimately made, \nthrough very painful conversations with her family and with \nconsultation with her\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\ndoctors, would be illegal. The decision to make sure, as she put it, \nthat ``our son was not born only to suffer'' would be taken from her \nand given to politicians.\n  I am here today to provide a simple reality check. We are not going \nback. We are not going back on settled law such as Roe v. Wade or the \nAffordable Care Act. We are not going to take away a woman's ability to \nmake her own decisions about her own health care and her own body.\n  Just as with the many attempts before this bill, there are those who \nwould like the American public to believe that all of these efforts are \nanything but an attack on women's health care. They try to say it is a \ndebate about freedom, except, of course, the freedom for women to \naccess care.\n  It is no different than when we were told attacks on abortion rights \nare not an infringement on a woman's right to choose; they are about \nreligion or States rights. Or when we are told that restricting \nemergency contraception isn't about limiting women's ability to make \ntheir own family planning decisions, but it is somehow about protecting \npharmacists. Or as demonstrated last month when a Republican State \nlawmaker in Missouri introduced legislation to triple the State's \nmandatory waiting period for abortion services, claiming it would give \nwomen more time to do their ``research.''\n  Not that we should be surprised, he went on then to compare this \ndeeply personal and difficult choice to that of purchasing an \nautomobile saying: ``In making a decision to buy a car, I put research \nin there to find out what to do.''\n  The truth is this is an attempt to limit a woman's ability to access \ncare. This is about women. Instead of playing a game of political \nfootball with women and their health, Republicans should instead \nconsider joining with us in working on what women truly want.\n  Women today want to have a fair shot at success. First and foremost, \nthat means not rolling back the clock or eroding the gains we have \nmade. We took a very good step forward with the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich now prevents insurance companies from charging women more than \nmen for coverage, ensuring preventive services such as mammograms and \ncontraception coverage is covered and increasing access to \ncomprehensive health coverage, thanks to the Medicaid expansion and the \nexchanges. There is no doubt we need to make sure women have access in \nthis country to opportunities such as getting equal pay for equal work \nor giving the millions of women earning the minimum wage a raise, which \nwould go a long way towards that effort. We need to update our Tax Code \nso that mothers who are returning to the workforce do not face a \nmarriage penalty.\n  There is much more we could be doing to address the issues of \nconcerned women. Those are the issues we ought to be focused on--how to \nmove our country forward, not backward.\n  So if it wasn't clear the last time the senior Senator from South \nCarolina made this attempt, it ought to be clear now. Senators such as \nmyself are not going anywhere. Advocates and doctors who treat those \nwomen every day and know their health must be protected are not going \nanywhere. And women who continue to believe their health care decisions \nare theirs and theirs alone are not going to go anywhere. By the way, \nthe Constitution is not going to go anywhere. Therefore, this extreme \nbill that was offered today is not going anywhere.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                       Boone County Mine Tragedy\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, on Monday night a tragic mining incident \noccurred in my home State of West Virginia where the lives of two \ndedicated and courageous miners were lost at the Brody No. 1 mine in \nBoone County.\n  My greatest and deepest thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones \nof the miners impacted by this tragedy. Gayle and I join them and all \nWest Virginians in mourning the loss of these heroic men. We grieve for \nthe entire community as they bear this most heartbreaking and sorrowful \nhardship.\n  Our hearts especially go out to the families of the following miners: \nEric Legg of Twilight and Gary Hensley of Chapmanville.\n  These men will be remembered forever as heroes to their community, \ntheir State, and their Nation for their unparalleled courage and \nunsurpassable sacrifice. They will live on forever in our hearts.\n  As families and friends struggle to deal with the tragedy that took \nplace, we are reminded as a country that we must consistently search \nfor ways to improve safety conditions because our miners' safety is of \nthe utmost importance and remains our No. 1 priority. We say in West \nVirginia: If it can't be mined safely, don't mine it.\n  Our coal miners are some of the hardest working people in America, \nand the loss of even one miner's life is one life too many. We need to \ncontinue to improve mine safety efforts so that our miners' lives are \nnever in jeopardy. We owe this to the families of the victims and to \nall of our loyal mining families across our country. It is our \nresponsibility to be absolutely and totally committed to the safety of \nevery worker, which means that every worker should be able to get up in \nthe morning and expect to come home safely to their loved ones at \nnight. This is their right, not a privilege.\n  My staff and I will do everything humanly possible to assist the \nfamilies through this difficult time. Again, we extend our deepest \nsympathy and most profound condolences to the families and loved ones, \nand we pray for their peace and comfort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Smarter Sentencing Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are new reports that the majority \nleader is considering bringing to the floor the so-called Smarter \nSentencing Act, and to bring it to finality.\n  I rise again today to express my strong opposition to this bill and \nto argue against taking up the Senate's time to consider it. I will \nlist several reasons.\n  This country has experienced a tremendous drop in crime over the past \n30 years. We have achieved hard-won gains in reducing victimization. \nMore effective police tactics played a very significant role.\n  Congress assisted with funds for law enforcement and mandatory \nsentencing guidelines to make dangerous offenders serve longer \nsentences. But after the Supreme Court applied novel constitutional \ntheory, those mandatory guidelines were made advisory only. Federal \njudges then used their discretion to sentence defendants more leniently \nthan the guidelines had called for.\n  Today, the only tool Congress has to make sure Federal judges do not \nabuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum \nsentences. So bringing this bill would cut a wide range of mandatory \nminimum sentences by half or more. Those sentences include people \nconvicted of manufacture, sale, possession with intent to distribute, \nand importation of a wide range of drugs, including heroin, cocaine, \nPCP, LSD, ecstasy, and methamphetamines.\n  When supporters of this bill discuss how it increases discretion for \njudges and keeps current maximum sentences, what they really mean is \nthat judges will gain discretion only to be more lenient. The bill does \nnot increase discretion for judges to be more punitive.\n  When supporters of this bill say that the bill only applies to \nnonviolent offenders, don't be misled into thinking it applies to \npeople in Federal prison for simple possession of marijuana. It \ndoesn't. The offenses covered in this bill are violent.\n  Importing cocaine is violent. The whole operation turns on violence.\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nDealing heroin also involves violence or threats of violence, and the \noffense for which the offender is sentenced may have even been violent. \nThe defendant's codefendant might have used a gun.\n  While the bill does not apply to a drug crime for which the defendant \nused violence, it does apply to criminals where the defendant has a \nhistory of committing violent crimes. Supporters have failed to \nrecognize that it would apply to drug dealers with a history of violent \ncrimes.\n  Supporters of the bill also raise the argument of prison \novercrowding. But prison populations in this country are decreasing and \nhave been in fact decreasing for several years. States have been able \nto reduce prison construction and sentencing as crime has thus fallen.\n  Charles Lane wrote in the Washington Post that one reason States \ncould do this is the reduction in the fear of crime that has \naccompanied falling crime rates.\n  The rate of increase in Federal prison populations has fallen a great \ndeal. In recent years, the number of new Federal prisoners receiving \nprison sentences has declined. New policies the Department has adopted \nwith respect to clemency and its unwillingness to charge defendants for \nthe crimes they have committed will only further reduce overcrowding \nand prison expenses.\n  It is also important to recognize that drug offenders are an \nincreasingly small proportion of the new offenders who are being \nsentenced to Federal prison as Federal law enforcement shifts more \nresources away from drugs and toward immigration and weapons offenses.\n  The reduction in prison populations is not really so much about the \ncost saving as cost shifting from prison budgets to victim suffering. \nThis is happening as the number of State and Federal prisoners has \ndropped.\n  In 2012, the last year for which statistics are available, the FBI's \nUniform Crime Report recorded an increase in the number of violent \ncrimes for the first time in many years. Now, it is only 1 year and the \nincrease was less than 1 percent, but it represents a dramatic change \nin the past downward trend of crime, and it bears a vigilant watch, not \nsupport for a reckless, wholesale, and arbitrary reduction in mandatory \nminimum sentences.\n  The bill represents a particularly misguided effort in light of \ncurrent conditions concerning drug use. We are in the midst of a heroin \nepidemic right now. Deaths from heroin overdoses in Pennsylvania are \nway up. The Governor of Vermont devoted the entirety of his State of \nthe State address this year to the heroin problem.\n  Marijuana decriminalization is leading to the greater availability of \nmarijuana at a lower price. This is causing Mexican growers who \nformerly produced marijuana to grow opium for heroin importation into \nthis country instead of marijuana.\n  The Obama administration says it is concerned about the heroin \nepidemic, but it supports a bill that cuts penalties for heroin \nimportation and dealing.\n  The administration says it wants to fight sexual assaults on \ncampuses--and I think that is the right thing to do and I applaud them \nfor doing that. But they are also supporting this bill, which cuts in \nhalf the mandatory minimum sentence for dealing in ecstasy, the ``date \nrape'' drug.\n  The administration's support for this bill, then, makes no sense, and \nat least some administration officials understand that.\n  We had the privilege of having the Director of the Drug Enforcement \nAgency before our committee a little while ago. Michelle Leonhart said:\n\n       Having been in law enforcement as an agent for 33 years, \n     [and] a Baltimore City police officer before that, I can tell \n     you that for me and for the agents that work for DEA, \n     mandatory minimums have been very important to our \n     investigations. . . . We depend on those as a way to ensure \n     that the right sentences are going to the . . . level of \n     violator we are going after.\n\n  Current mandatory minimum sentences play a vital role in reducing \ncrime. They do more than keep serious offenders in jail so that they \ncannot prey upon innocent citizens. They also induce lower-level drug \noffenders to avoid receiving mandatory minimum sentences by implicating \nhigher-ups in the drug trade.\n  As FBI Director Comey recently stated:\n\n       I know from my experience . . . that the mandatory minimums \n     are an important tool in developing cooperators.\n\n  Recently, a bipartisan group of former Justice Department officials \nwrote to Leaders Reid and McConnell. Their letter expressed strong \nopposition to cutting mandatory minimums for drug trafficking by half \nor more. They warned:\n\n       We are deeply concerned about the impact of sentencing \n     reductions of this magnitude on public safety.\n       We believe the American people will be ill-served by the \n     significant reduction of sentences for federal drug \n     trafficking crimes that involve the sale and distribution of \n     dangerous drugs like heroin, methamphetamines, and PCP.\n       We are aware of little public support for lowering the \n     minimum required sentences for these extremely dangerous and \n     sometimes lethal drugs.\n\n  We are all going to be supporting National Police Week. Officers from \nall over the country have traveled to Washington to make their concerns \nknown. We salute them for the work that they do and the dangers they \nface. If we really respect these law enforcement people and want to \nsupport them, then we ought to listen to what they have to say.\n  The National Narcotics Officers' Association has written:\n\n       As the men and women in law enforcement who confront \n     considerable risks daily to stand between poisoned sellers \n     and their victims, we cannot find a single good reason to \n     weaken federal consequences for the worst offenders who are \n     directly responsible for an egregious amount of political \n     despair, community decay, family destruction, and the \n     expenditure of vast amounts of taxpayer dollars to clean up \n     the messes they create.\n\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Association has also come out \nagainst the bill. They have stated:\n\n       It is with great concern that FLEOA views any action or \n     attempt . . . that would alter or eliminate the current \n     federal sentencing policy regarding mandatory minimum \n     sentence sentencing.\n       The mandatory minimum sentencing standard currently in \n     place is essential to public safety and that of our \n     membership.\n\n  Many of us will rightfully praise our law enforcement officers as \nthey are in town for National Police Week. But what we really ought to \ndo is listen to them. They are telling us that taking up this bill \nwould be a slap in the face of all our brave police officers who \nprotect us from harm every day. They deserve better than that.\n  Citizens who are finally less likely to become crime victims deserve \nit. The respect that is due those on the front line against wrongdoers \ndemands that the Senate neither take up nor pass the mislabeled so-\ncalled Smarter Sentencing Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the \ngallery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and I be allowed to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2330 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Senate Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                            Time to Wake Up\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for the 67th time to urge my \ncolleagues to wake up to the growing threat of climate change, and \ntoday I am joined by my friend and colleague Senator Nelson of Florida, \nwho is a true leader in this fight.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be able to engage in a \ncolloquy for the next 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Florida is about 1,000 miles from Rhode Island, and \nit is slightly larger than my home State, but Florida and Rhode Island \nhave a great deal in common, such as a beautiful coastline, an economy \nand a way\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nof life that is tied to the sea, and as a result risk from the ocean in \na changing climate.\n  On my recent trip down the southeast coast, I spent 2 days in Florida \nand heard firsthand about the unprecedented changes taking place there. \nLike the folks I met in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, \nFloridians are worried about the coastal communities they love. They \nare getting serious about protecting their homes and their livelihoods, \nand they want their representatives in Congress to get serious.\n  Senator Nelson hears them. He recently took the Senate commerce \ncommittee to the Miami Beach townhall to examine the dangers posed by \nrising seas. Here is what the Miami Herald said about his effort:\n\n       South Florida owes Senator Nelson its thanks for shining a \n     bright light on this issue. Everyone from local residents to \n     elected officials should follow his lead, turning awareness \n     of this major environmental issue into action. It is critical \n     to saving our region.\n\n  Senator Nelson and I also held a press conference at Jacksonville's \nFriendship Fountain with Representative Corrine Brown to highlight \nthese serious implications of climate change. So I am grateful for \nSenator Nelson's bringing his passion and expertise to the floor today.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank my dear personal friend the \nSenator from Rhode Island for his kind comments, but I especially thank \nhim for his passion and his leadership on this issue. There are parts \nof America where it is time to wake up, and especially one part of that \nis the State of Florida.\n  Because of the nature of our State being a peninsula that sticks down \ninto water surrounding it on most sides, you would not be surprised \nthat we have by far the longest coastline of any State, save for \nAlaska.\n  When it comes to beaches, the State of Florida by far has more \nbeaches than any other State, but because we have so much exposure to \nthe oceans--the Atlantic on the east and the Gulf of Mexico on the \nwest--we are particularly subject to climate change and the fact that \nthe Earth is heating up.\n  Why is the Earth heating up? Well, there is the effect known as the \ngreenhouse effect. If you put certain gasses into the atmosphere that \nare a result of manmade efforts--when we burn things such as oil and \ncoal and we don't scrub out a lot of the stuff, it goes into the \natmosphere. Well, one of the things that goes into the atmosphere is \ncarbon dioxide. What carbon dioxide does is go into the upper \natmosphere and it forms this greenhouse effect by creating an invisible \nshield, and when the Sun's rays come and strike the Earth at daylight, \nthose rays then reflect off the Earth's surface. Under normal \ncircumstances, those rays bounce back out and radiate back into space \nbut not if you have a lot of gasses up at the very beginning of space, \nat the top of the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide.\n  When the Earth's surface radiates the Sun's heat, it goes back up as \nif it wants to go out into space, and it is trapped. What happens is \nthe entire atmosphere of the Earth then contains that heat, and slowly \nover time it builds up the temperature.\n  When you look at a globe, what do you mostly see? You don't see land; \nyou see water. So what happens is that most of that heating of the \nEarth's atmosphere is absorbed into the temperature of the ocean. \nBecause of the rise of the ocean temperature and the temperature of the \nair, what starts to happen? What is happening up toward the northern \nclimes as well as the southern climes? Have you heard the report that \ncame out a couple of days ago about how big chunks of Antarctica are \nnow falling off? Have you heard about how all of the glaciers on top of \nGreenland, which used to be nothing but one big glacier, are now \nfalling off into the sea, thus causing the sea rise?\n  I will flip it back to the Senator from Rhode Island with this \ncomment: In the hearing we had of the commerce subcommittee in Miami \nBeach--why did I choose Miami Beach? Because it is ground zero. At high \ntide they are already having flooding in the streets of Miami Beach. At \na seasonally high tide that they expect coming up in October of this \nyear, they expect constant flooding. As a result, we had the mayor of \nMiami Beach tell us about the effort of them trying to redo the \ninfrastructure to get rid of the water when the high tides come in.\n  We also had a scientist at NASA testify. He is a fellow who is a \nfour-time space flier. He left the astronaut office, and now he is back \nat the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He is a scientist. What \nhe testified to us was not a forecast, not a projection; he testified \nas to the measurements of sea level rise over the last 50 years. And \nfor Florida, the sea level rise, as measured by NASA--these are \nindisputable measurements--is 5 to 8 inches. In another 20 to 30 years, \nhe projects that the sea level rise will be a foot, 12 inches more, and \nby the end of the decade, it will rise 2 to 3 feet.\n  I hasten to add that 75 percent of Florida's population of 20 million \npeople lives on the coast. Can you imagine what a 2- to 3-foot sea \nlevel rise on Florida would be? It would inundate unbelievable amounts \nof the urban community of our State of Florida. So the question is, Are \nwe going to do something about it?\n  I will flip it back to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. On my trip through Senator Nelson's State, the Army \nCorps of Engineers officials in Jacksonville gave me some pretty dire \nwarnings about what the sea level rise portends for Florida, both the \npunch from storms that will bring the higher seas ashore and the steady \nencroachment of saltwater.\n  This is a scene from western Boynton Beach after Tropical Storm Isaac \nin 2012. I don't know if you can see it on the screen, but this sign \nsays ``no wake zone.'' The family put up a ``no wake zone'' sign in \ntheir front yard because the cars going by would cause wakes and more \ndamage.\n  The Corps also showed me what 2 feet of sea level rise would do to \nthe Everglades National Park. I went down to the Everglades later on \nduring my visit. This is what it would look like. You can see the green \nin the Everglades here and all the development up here. Basically, if \nyou add 60 centimeters of sea level rise, or 2 feet, and that is all \nocean again, that is a pretty serious change.\n  The Southeast Florida Regional Compact, which is a bipartisan \ncoalition of four South Florida counties, predicts that the water \naround southeast Florida could surge up to 2 feet in less than 50 \nyears.\n  So that is a preview of the coming attractions ``Everglades Under \nWater.''\n  What was interesting was that the local officials, both Republicans \nand Democrats, were working together. The division that exists in this \nbody doesn't exist down there. Mayor Silva Murphy of Monroe County is a \nRepublican and former Mayor Kristin Jacobs of Broward County is a \nDemocrat. They both know that flooding and access to drinking water are \nnot partisan issues in the way that it divides us here.\n  Here are a couple more examples from my visit. This is Castillo San \nMarcos, which Senator Nelson will recognize as being in St. Augustine. \nIt is a famous and very beautiful ancient fort. It sits along the water \nthere. If you add 3 feet of sea level rise, it turns from being part of \nthe coast to being its own tiny little peninsula surrounded by \nflooding. It is the oldest masonry fort in the United States.\n  This is what Fort Matanzas would look like. This is a little fort \nbuilt by Spanish colonists in 1742. It is right here on this inlet. If \nyou add 3 feet of sea level rise, suddenly it is in the water. It has \nnothing to stand on. As it is, they have built a wall to protect it \nfrom the sea level rise that has already happened, and from time to \ntime the high tides lap over that wall.\n  The Senator said there is the potential for an enormous amount of \nharm here that could happen to people. One of the scientists I met in \nFlorida said that if we don't do something about this, ``people are \ngoing to get hurt and it's going to cost a lot of money.'' That is \ntrue.\n  One topic I would like to discuss is how the seawater will affect the \nfreshwater supply of Florida. Senator Nelson is an expert on the \ngeology of Florida and why it is different from my rocky New England \ncoast.\n  I will yield back to Senator Nelson so he can discuss the limestone \nbedrock problem.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, one would naturally ask the question,\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\ncould we solve this problem in the United States the way the Dutch have \nsolved a lot of the coastal areas of the Netherlands by building dikes? \nA lot of their land is actually below sea level.\n  You can't do that in a place such as Florida because the substrate \nunderneath the surface soil is a porous limestone, much like Swiss \ncheese. So that if you try to put up a dike, it is not going to hold \nany water back because the pressure of the water as it rises is merely \ngoing to go underneath the dike into the porous limestone, which is the \nsource under the surface of a lot of Florida's drinking water because \nthat water in that honeycomb limestone is fresh.\n  What happens as a result of the sea level rise? More water and higher \nwater will create more pressure. The pressure then starts to push \nunderneath the surface as well as over the surface of the land, and \nthat causes the intrusion of saltwater into the fresh drinking water.\n  Because Florida is so low--believe it or not, our highest point is \nright near the Alabama-Florida line, which is actually 356 feet high. \nBut when you get into portions of South Florida, it is very low. \nObviously, sea level rise is going to cover a lot of land, but another \nconsequence is that a lot of flood control is now regulated by gravity. \nYou go from a higher position of flood and you flow by gravity through \ncanals to a lower position of the sea level. When the sea level rises, \nthe water during floods--hurricane, rainstorm, whatever--can't flow. \nThe only way to correct that is to install very expensive pumping \nequipment.\n  Finally, in this segment of the exchange with the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, I ask what is another consequence of the temperature of the \nocean's rising? Remember the greenhouse effect? Most of that heat is \nabsorbed in the oceans.\n  What is the fuel for a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere? What is \nthe fuel for it? It is the temperature of the water. Hurricanes in the \nNorthern Hemisphere go counterclockwise. Hurricanes in the Southern \nHemisphere go clockwise. What happens to the intensity of the \nhurricane? It goes up as the waters get hotter. That is why usually, as \nthe hurricanes are forming into these massive storms over the South \nAtlantic and the Caribbean, they start going north. They start to \ndissipate because the waters are cooler. It doesn't provide the fuel \nfor the ferocity of the hurricane. Likewise, higher water temperatures, \nmore frequency of hurricanes.\n\n  In our State, we live on a peninsula that sticks down into the middle \nof ``Hurricane Highway.'' It is a way of life. We understand that, and \nwe have handled it pretty well, especially after the disaster of 1992, \nthe monster hurricane, Hurricane Andrew. Our building codes are up and \nso forth, but we can't withstand a lot of Hurricane Andrews. Part of \nthat hurricane was considered to be a category 5--something in excess \nof 160 mile-per-hour winds. We know what 160 mile-an-hour tornadoes do \nwithin a small, confined, tight-knit cyclone-type activity. Imagine \nwhat those wind speeds do in a massive hurricane covering hundreds of \nmiles.\n  We start to see then the effects. The insurance industry cannot \nwithstand insuring structures that are going to sustain that kind of \ndamage. What is going to happen to the cost of insurance? It is going \nto go through the roof. What is going to happen to the cost of flood \ninsurance? In the Senate, we agonized over the Federal Flood Insurance \nProgram--what is going to happen to the actual structures and the \npeople who not only are subject to being flooded because of the rise of \nsea level but of having their whole dwellings and city torn up, as \nHurricane Andrew did to downtown Homestead, a relatively small \npopulation of Florida and it absolutely tore it up. That is what we are \nfacing unless we do something about climate change.\n  The first thing we have to do is we have to stop this denial that \nthis is not real. The scientists are telling us it is real. The NASA \nastronaut scientists say it is measurements. They have flooding in \nMiami Beach. The local governments have banded together in southeastern \nFlorida to try to get ahead of it.\n  Why can't we get some of the Senators here, who because it is not \npolitically correct in their politics, to recognize what the truth is \nso we can start planning for this--not as a protection but to plan for \nthe protection of planet Earth, and see if we can stop some of the \ncauses of the climate change. Then, once we do it in the Nation that \nstands as the role model to the rest of the countries, we are going to \nhave to get them to do it too; otherwise, we are going to see what has \njust happened over the last couple of days: Large chunks of Antarctica \nare beyond saving, and the consequences are grave.\n  I appreciate the leadership of my friend from Rhode Island and \nSenator Boxer of California. They have been the ones who have been at \nthe point of the spear. I thank them very much.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here with the \nSenator from Florida, and his leadership is truly remarkable.\n  Here is another example on this picture from my tour. This is Broward \nCounty. People say it is not real. Ask the owner of this house with the \nfor sale sign. Good luck selling that house with the ocean running \nthrough it. That was in 2010.\n  Another Broward County photograph. Commissioner Kristin Jacobs, who \nwas the mayor at that time, gave me these pictures. Again, this is \ntide. Look at the sky. It is a beautiful day. This isn't rain. This is \nthe tide flooding in, showing what it does to the cars. It is a mess.\n  As Senator Nelson described, because Florida is this limestone, kind \nof hard sponge, what keeps the saltwater out is the pressure of the \nfreshwater holding it at bay. There is no wall. There is no structure \nthat keeps the water, salt, and fresh balance. It is a hydraulic \nsystem. They have built a very complex system of canals, where they \nhave raised the water so they have pressure, so they can push it back. \nAs the sea level comes up, they are losing that fight. So here is a \nline through Broward County of how far the saltwater has already \nintruded into the water supply. If we drilled wells on this side of the \nred line, the water is no good, and all of these wells, the little \ngreen spots, all of these water areas are in the way because this line \nis moving.\n  As one Army Corps engineer in Jacksonville said, Florida is in a box, \nbecause as the sea level rises, the way we keep the freshwater \navailable to people is by raising the fresh water, and that keeps what \nthe engineers call the hydraulic head that pushes the sea water back \nand allows us to maintain freshwater for drinking water purposes, for \nagriculture, for Florida oranges and grapefruits and all the things we \ncount on. If what we are worried about is flooding, we could only raise \nthe freshwater so far, because if we raise it enough, we have \nfreshwater flooding. There is no way out of that conundrum. There is no \nway out of that conundrum in Florida. He said, whether it happens in \n100 years or whether it happens after the next bad hurricane, that is \nwhat is going to happen. That is a terrible predicament. It is not \ngoing to get better by pretending it is not real. It is not going to \nget better by denying it.\n  If we go offshore, we get to the problem of acidification, which \nhappens from the carbon. This is not a theory. People say climate \nchange is a theory. No. The acidification of the ocean from the type of \ncarbon dioxide is something we can do in a lab. It is a scientific \nfact. It is a law of chemistry. So it happens, and it is starting to \nhit the reefs and the fisheries as the ocean warms and turns more acid.\n  Mayor Murphy is the mayor of Monroe County. I met her in Key Largo, \nwhich is one of the famous world destinations. I said: What is the \nacidification of the warm air? What does that do to your reefs?\n  She said: Well, the reefs are still beautiful unless you had been out \nto see them 10, 15 years ago. The reefs are still beautiful unless you \nhad been out to see them 10 or 15 years ago. People see the change.\n  I met with the Snook and Gamefish Foundation in Florida and the \nmarine industry folks, and they are concerned about what is happening \nthere. In fact, the problem goes all the way up the coast. When I came \ndown from North Carolina and South Carolina, the fishermen there told \nme they are starting to catch snook off the Carolinas. It is one thing \nwhen we are catching grouper and tarpon up in Rhode Island, but what \nthey are seeing on the South Atlantic coast is the same thing that a\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nRhode Islander fisherman said to me about the fishing off our coast. He \nsaid: It is getting weird out there. We are catching fish our fathers \nnever saw in their nets in their lives. So when a snook comes up on the \nline off the Carolinas, that is a sign that something is dramatically \nchanging, and these reefs are changing as well.\n\n  Last story: Mike Shirley works at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas \nNational Estuarine Research Reserve on the south side of St. Augustine. \nHe moved up there from South Florida. He moved there 7 years ago. When \nhe got there, he said there was one thing noticeable: There were no \nmangroves. South Florida is covered in mangroves, but there weren't any \nhere. Now, 7 years later, the place is covered in mangroves. All that \nhabitat migrating northward as the oceans and the water warms and it is \nchanging things.\n  He said one other thing. He said: Do you know what we ought to look \nout for? There is going to be another migration north. It is going to \nbe the people leaving flooded South Florida who can't get freshwater, \nwhose homes are flooded, who can't deal with their car going hubcap \ndeep in saltwater every high tide. They are going to be moving up. It \nis not just the people from the cold North coming to Florida now, it is \npeople coming from the flooding South who are going to be coming North \nagain.\n  I will say one last thing. The mayors were terrific. Sylvia Murphy, \nthe mayor of Monroe County, is putting climate and energy policy at the \nvery forefront of her 20-year growth plan for the county. Mayor Philip \nLevine of Miami Beach is hard at work. He says:\n\n       Sea-level rise is our reality in Miami Beach. We are past \n     the point of debating the existence of climate change. We are \n     now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.\n\n  Mayor Levine is pushing a $400 million plan to try to make the city's \ndrainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides.\n  From Mayor Joe Riley in Charleston to Mayor Edna Jackson in Savannah, \nto Mayor Alvin Brown in Jacksonville, to the mayors in South Florida I \nmentioned, council members, mayors from Pinecrest, South Miami, \nSurfside, Miami Shores, Cutler Bay, Palmetto Bay, the Seminole Tribe, \nthe local officials, they are all serious about tackling climate \nchange. It is real. They see it in their neighborhoods. They see it in \ntheir districts. They see it in their towns. They are away from this \npoisonous place where the polluters control what people are allowed to \nthink and see and do something about.\n  We have to start listening to the American people. We have to start \nlistening to the mayors who inhabit real life and not the political \nfantasy in this Senate. We have to start dealing with this.\n  Lee Thomas worked for President Ronald Reagan. He was a member of the \nReagan Cabinet. He ran the Environmental Protection Agency for Ronald \nReagan. Last week he wrote an op-ed--and I know the Senator from \nFlorida saw it--in the Tampa Bay Times urging Florida's leaders to wake \nup to the changes taking place in the Sunshine State. Here is what he \nsaid: ``Whether Democrat or Republican, Florida residents cannot afford \nto ignore the evidence of climate change.'' That is a Reagan official \nsaying those words.\n  Come on, Republican mayors, Reagan officials. At some point we have \nto wake up. This is real.\n  Just last year, Thomas joined all the other former Republican EPA \nheads--four of them--and they wrote this:\n\n       The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of \n     scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous, and \n     the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay \n     could mean that warming becomes locked in. A market-based \n     approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to \n     reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  Bob Samuelson just said the same thing in his editorial over the \nweekend.\n  I will say that the citizens of Florida and the people of the United \nStates are very fortunate to have a Senator such as Bill Nelson, who is \naware of this problem, who is fighting hard to solve it, who is \nlistening to his mayors, Republican and Democratic alike, who are \ntelling him what is happening in their home State, and who was willing \nto bring the Commerce Committee of the U.S. Senate down to a Miami \nBeach townhall to make sure everybody understands what is going on. He \nhelped bring that message back to Washington and it was a terrific \nthing.\n  So we will continue working together to get this body to wake up out \nof its polluter-induced slumber and face the realities that people all \nacross this country are seeing in their daily lives. It is indeed time \nto wake up.\n  I yield the floor for any final comments the Senator from Florida may \nwish to make.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island has stated \nin one of the more eloquent fashions details about my State of Florida \nbecause he was so passionate about the subject and so unselfish that he \nwanted to start in other States--North Carolina, South Carolina, \nGeorgia--and several places on the east coast of Florida. It is \nextraordinary.\n\n  I will leave you with this thought: Every time I hear a Senator such \nas Senator Whitehouse speak about this subject, and every time I look \nat a picture of the planet as he has on the poster that says ``Time To \nWake Up,'' my mind's eye goes back 28 years ago to the window of our \nspacecraft on the 24th flight of the space shuttle 203 nautical miles \nabove the Earth, circumnavigating the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour, \nwith a complete revolution of the Earth in 90 minutes.\n  You look back at our planet--which is so beautiful, so colorful, so \nalive, so creative--and yet when you look at the rim of the Earth, as \nit falls off into the deep blackness of space, there is a thin, little \nblue band, and upon closer examination out the window, you can actually \nsee the thin film of what sustains all of our life, the atmosphere.\n  Then, with the naked eye, you can see points on the Earth where we \nare messing it up. You can see the color contrast of the destruction of \nthe trees in the Amazon, upriver in the Amazon. You can see the result \nof cutting down all the trees on an island nation such as Madagascar, \nwhich fortunately has started planting trees in the last quarter \ncentury. Therefore, the result of that tree cutting, in this hemisphere \nas well, in the island nation of Haiti, is that when the rains come, \nthere are no trees to hold the topsoil and it all flows down the rivers \nand out the mouths of the rivers and you can see it from space in the \ndiscoloration of the water. That is for miles and miles out into the \nbrilliant blues of the ocean.\n  If we do not do what people like Senators Boxer and Whitehouse are \nsaying and wake up to the reality of climate change and try to get \nahead of it by changing policies that will stop the greenhouse effect \nor at least slow it down, then what we are going to have for future \nspace fliers is that they are going to look back at the planet and the \ncoastline of those States Senator Whitehouse visited--all being in the \nSoutheastern United States--that coastline is not going to look the \nsame. It is not going to be as distinct a coastline, with a white beach \nalong it that outlines it from the blue waters of the Atlantic. It is \ngoing to be much different and to the great detriment of the people who \nlive there and call that home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 150 years ago--on May 4, 1864, to be \nexact--the Village of Ramsey, IL, was incorporated. The village was \nnamed after an early settler named William Ramsey, who built his home \non what is now known as Ramsey Creek.\n  Ramsey was just getting started when Abraham Lincoln was traveling \nfrom his home in Springfield to Vandalia, which was then the State \nCapital where Lincoln was a member of the Illinois House of \nRepresentatives. The Illinois Central Railroad, completed on January 1, \n1855, made Ramsey a local trading and shipping point for nearby \ntownships.\n  To put the anniversary of Ramsey's incorporation in perspective, \nthink about what the Midwest was like in 1864. The Civil War was coming \nto an end and a new America was being born. It was long before planes \nand cars--and trains were not yet common.\n  By 1878, the people of Ramsey could support six dry goods and grocery \nstores, a drug store, a hardware store, two saloons, a boot shop, a \nhotel, and a harness factory. It was the second largest town in Fayette \nCounty. Ramsey even had its own newspaper in the 1880s, The Ramsey \nDemocrat. Another publication, the Ramsey News-Journal, started in \n1911. It was purchased in 1912 by Julius Mueller and remained with that \nfamily for 100 years.\n  The first women to vote in Illinois cast their vote in Ramsey. Mrs. \nAthilla Stoddard was the first female in the State to vote publicly. \nShe was 83 years old when she voted in Ramsey on July 10, 1891.\n  Ramsey is small--just over 1,000 people live there today--but it has \nits share of famous residents. Glen Hobbie, who played for both the \nChicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals, called Ramsey home for a \ntime. H.L. Hunt, an oil tycoon who inspired the TV series Dallas, was \nfrom Ramsey; and so was Tex Williams, a country music singer, \nsongwriter and actor.\n  One day each year, when the Lions Club hosts its annual auction, the \npopulation grows from 1,000 people to 5,000 people.\n  The Village of Ramsey was in my district when I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. I have been to the town many times and have \nenjoyed its famous chicken dinners. I camped out at Ramsey Lake State \nPark with my kids many years before going off to Congress. Today I \nextend congratulations to Mayor Claude Willis, the citizens of Ramsey, \nand the 4,000 people who spend a day in Ramsey each year as the village \ncelebrates its 150th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2947-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2947-S2948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY SAVINGS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 2262. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation, which would build on previous energy \nefficiency legislation and proposes cost-effective mechanisms to \nsupport the adoption of off-the-shelf efficiency technologies for \nbuildings, manufacturers, and the Federal Government.\n  As honorary vice-chair of the Alliance to Save Energy, I have been a \nlong-time proponent of efforts to improve energy efficiency. \nEncouraging the adoption of energy efficiency measures is one of the \neasiest yet most effective mechanisms for reducing energy consumption, \nlessening pollution, and ultimately saving families, businesses, and \nthe Federal Government money.\n  Legislation to improve the Nation's energy policy is long overdue. I \nwould like to congratulate the bill sponsors, Senators Shaheen and \nPortman, for crafting this bipartisan, commonsense bill and for their \ntireless efforts in working with the leadership of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee to bring this bill to the Senate floor \nonce again. This has not been an easy feat. After an earlier version of \nthe bill was left unfinished last year, the bill sponsors did not give \nup and have continued to work diligently to build additional support by \nincorporating several previously filed amendments. While I share the \ngeneral frustration expressed by some that Congress should be \nconsidering a more comprehensive energy policy, we must not use this as \na reason to impede passage of this energy efficiency bill.\n  The provisions in S. 2262 will kick-start the use of energy \nefficiency technologies that are commercially available now and can be \ndeployed by residential, commercial, and industrial energy users. The \nbill will also improve the energy efficiency of the Federal Government, \nwhich is the largest energy consumer in the country. Given today's \nchallenging fiscal environment, it is notable that all authorizations \nincluded in S. 2262 are fully offset.\n  I am pleased to have co-authored two provisions that are incorporated \ninto the base bill. First, I joined my colleague, the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Udall, in authoring a provision that would provide a \nstreamlined, coordinating structure for schools to help them better \nnavigate existing Federal energy efficiency programs and financing \noptions. This would be particularly helpful for rural schools in States \nsuch as Maine and would help these institutions save money in the face \nof rising energy costs. Decisions about how best to meet the energy \nneeds of their schools, however, would still appropriately be made by \nthe States, school boards, and local officials.\n  The second provision that I am pleased to have authored with my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, would authorize a pay-\nfor-success pilot program allowing the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, to enter into agreements with private investors \nfor energy and water efficiency improvements to project-based rental \nassistance and housing for the elderly and disabled. This budget-\nneutral approach would leverage private investment to finance energy \nefficiency retrofits for certain HUD-assisted properties and help cut \nutility costs for the Federal Government.\n  I would have liked an open amendment process. One amendment I am \npleased to have worked on with my colleagues from Delaware, Senator \nCoons, and Rhode Island, Senator Reed, would reauthorize and extend the \ncore Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program \nactivities at the Department of Energy through 2018, develop a \ncompetitive grant program for non-profits to carry out weatherization \nprojects, and require minimum professional standards for weatherization \ncontractors and workers. I am a long-time supporter of weatherization, \nwhich plays an important role in permanently reducing home energy costs \nfor low-income families and seniors in all States, lessening our \ndependence on foreign oil, and training a skilled workforce. \nWeatherizing homes and reducing energy costs are particularly important \nfor a State like Maine, which has the oldest housing stock in the \nNation and a high dependence on home heating oil. Our amendment, had we \nbeen allowed to offer it, would have further increased the energy \nsavings from this bill.\n  Nevertheless, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy \nhas released new analysis demonstrating that S. 2262 would save \nconsumers and businesses and the government with a cumulative net \nsavings of nearly $100 billion by 2030, support thousands of new jobs \nby cutting government and industrial energy waste and assisting \nhomeowners in financing energy efficiency improvements, and reduce \nemissions significantly.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n  S. 2262 has the support of a broad coalition of stakeholders, \nincluding energy efficiency, business, and environmental organizations, \nsmall and large businesses, utilities, and public interest groups. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of S. 2262 and urge its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2948-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2014.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding S. 357, National \n     Blue Alert Act of 2013.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe \n     suspects who seriously injure or kill federal, state or local \n     law enforcement officers in the line of duty should be \n     apprehended as quickly as possible. However, I believe the \n     responsibility to address this issue, as it relates to state \n     and local law enforcement officers, lies with the states and \n     local communities that these brave law enforcement officers \n     serve. Furthermore, while I do not believe this issue is the \n     responsibility of the federal government, if Congress does \n     act, we can and must do so in a fiscally responsible manner. \n     My concerns are included in, but not limited to, those \n     outlined in this letter.\n       While this bill is well-intentioned, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO), it will cost the American \n     people $1 million dollars every year without corresponding \n     offsets. I recognize this bill does not contain the \n     authorization of appropriations included in prior versions of \n     this legislation; however, establishing a new program which \n     requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to carry out \n     additional responsibilities, even if implemented by existing \n     staff, is not free of future costs, as recognized by CBO. \n     Furthermore, there is no sunset provision contained in this \n     legislation. Thus, once enacted, the annual $1 million price \n     tag for this program will continue in perpetuity.\n       It is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future \n     standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $17.4 \n     trillion. That means approximately $55,000 in debt for each \n     man, woman and child in the United States. A year ago, the \n     national debt was $16.7 trillion. Despite pledges to control \n     spending, Washington adds billions to the national debt every \n     single day. In just one year, our national debt has grown by \n     $700 billion or 4.19%.\n       In addition to these fiscal concerns, there are several \n     problems specific to this legislation. First, there is no \n     need to establish a national Blue Alert system because many \n     states have already developed their own Blue Alert programs \n     for the same purposes outlined in this bill, including alerts \n     issued for the injury or death of federal, as well as state \n     and local law enforcement officers. In 2008, Florida and \n     Texas were the first states to establish these programs. \n     Seventeen additional states soon followed--Oklahoma, \n     Maryland, Georgia, Delaware, California, Virginia, \n     Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, Colorado, South Carolina, \n     Washington, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Connecticut, and \n     Illinois. The last three states to initiate a Blue Alert \n     system did so in the 1-year period since the House passed its \n     version of this bill in May 2012. Arizona and Kansas will \n     likely begin their systems this summer and fall, \n     respectively. Several state legislatures currently have \n     legislation pending that would establish a Blue Alert system, \n     including Minnesota, Alabama, and Missouri.\n       Furthermore, there is no data to support the success of the \n     existing state Blue Alert programs. Oklahoma established its \n     Blue Alert system in 2009, but it is not yet fully \n     functional. The last three states to establish an alert \n     system did so just within the last year. As a result, not \n     only have states already established their own programs, but \n     from the limited use of the existing systems, there is no \n     clear evidence of a substantial need for a Blue Alert system, \n     or of the consistent, successful apprehension of suspects as \n     a direct result of a Blue Alert. If anything, we should wait \n     for these programs to produce results that can be examined \n     and determine whether this type of system is useful before \n     instituting a federal, one-size-fits-all program.\n       Second, while the bill's supporters likely envision \n     pursuing suspects who have injured or killed a law \n     enforcement officer in a routine traffic stop or while \n     fleeing a crime scene, for example, the bill's definition of \n     ``law enforcement officer'' is much broader. The bill \n     incorporates the definition in Section 1204 of the Omnibus \n     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which includes \n     ``an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency \n     control or reduction, or enforcement of the criminal laws \n     (including juvenile delinquency), including, but not limited \n     to, police, corrections, probation, parole, and judicial \n     officers.'' As a result, a Blue Alert could be issued for a \n     state court bailiff; a state parole officer, or an officer \n     within a state's juvenile corrections facility, if injured in \n     the line of duty.\n       Finally, I do not believe the federal government has the \n     authority under the Constitution to provide federal funds to \n     coordinate the tracking of state and local fugitives or to \n     establish national protocols to apprehend suspects accused of \n     injuring or killing state and local law enforcement officers. \n     Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates the \n     limited powers of Congress, and nowhere are we tasked with \n     funding or becoming involved with state and local criminal \n     issues.\n       There is no question those suspected of injuring or killing \n     a state or local law enforcement officer in the line of duty \n     should be aggressively pursued and prosecuted. However, I \n     believe this issue is the responsibility of the states and \n     not the federal government. Despite these Constitutional \n     limitations, if Congress does act in this area, like most \n     American individuals and companies must do with their own \n     resources, we should evaluate current programs, determine any \n     needs that may exist, and prioritize those needs for funding \n     by cutting from the federal budget programs fraught with \n     waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2948-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LINDA PAPP\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I wish to \npay special tribute to an invaluable public servant, Mrs. Linda Papp. \nCoast Guard first lady, career educator, mother, and grandmother--Linda \nhas tirelessly worked for more than 39 years to improve the lives of \nCoast Guard military families.\n  Linda is a native of East Lyme, CT, and is the oldest of Frank and \nDoris Kapral's six daughters. Her father, Frank, is a retired Coast \nGuard captain and fondly known throughout the service as ``Coach \nKapral'' for his two decades leading the Coast Guard Academy football \nteam. Linda holds a bachelor's and master's degree in education, and is \nthe proud mother of three children, Lindsay, Caitlin and Jillian, and \ntwo granddaughters, Penelope and Ruby.\n  As the wife of the 24th Commandant, ADM Robert J. Papp, Linda serves \nas the Coast Guard's Ombudsman-at-Large and regularly travels to meet \nwith Coast Guard families. She advocates on behalf of families to the \nFirst Lady of the United States, Members of Congress, Department of \nDefense, and other Federal, State and local leaders to improve the \nquality of life for thousands of servicemembers. She relentlessly \nfocuses on improving military housing, member and family access to \nquality health care, and the Coast Guard's Ombudsman Program.\n  Of her 39 years as a military spouse, she spent 14 of those years \nwatching six different Coast Guard cutters pull away from the pier. She \nunderstands that the strength and resilience of family members on the \nhome front provides critical support to all of our Coast Guard men and \nwomen who stand the watch. She supports our men and women in uniform \nand those who keep the home fires burning and who every day face the \nunique challenges of a military lifestyle. They will always have a \nspecial place in her life, and in her heart.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Mrs. \nLinda Papp. Our Coast Guard and our country are served well by \nhonorable and giving military spouses like Linda who truly care about \nthe health and well being of those who serve. We wish Linda, Admiral \nPapp, and their family all the best as we honor one of our dear \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2948-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2948-S2949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          O'BRIEN COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nmy work across four decades representing Iowa in Congress. I take pride \nin accomplishments that have been national in scope--for instance, \npassing the Americans with Disabilities Act and spearheading successful \nfarm bills. But I take a very special pride in projects that have made \na big difference in local communities across my State.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of O'Brien County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$9.4 million to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be our shared \ncommitment to improving firefighter safety.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, O'Brien County has received $711,622 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in O'Brien County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $112,952.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, O'Brien County has received more than $3.7 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, O'Brien \nCounty's fire departments have received over $996,000 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nO'Brien County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically O'Brien County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in O'Brien \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Pocahontas County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Pocahontas County worth over \n$225,000 and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $5.4 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be their \ntremendous use of farm bill funds that I authorized for a variety of \nlocal projects, including construction of a daycare, fire department \nimprovements, sewer improvements, courthouse improvements, and \nconservation.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Pocahontas County has received $225,000 in Harkin grants.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Pocahontas County has received more than $3.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Pocahontas \nCounty's fire departments have received over $390,245 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Virginian, Leland Devon Melvin, who retired as Associate \nAdministrator for Education of NASA on February 28, 2014 after 24 years \nof service to our Nation.\n  Leland's career began on a different path, on the football field at \nthe University of Richmond. Leland was a phenomenal wide receiver for \nthe Spiders from 1982-1985 and still leads Richmond's career lists with \n198 receptions for 2,669 yards. He scored the fourth-most touchdowns in \nRichmond history, 16, and was inducted into the university's Athletics \nHall of Fame in 1996-1997. Leland was drafted to play in the NFL by the \nDetroit Lions in 1986. He also trained with the Dallas Cowboys and the \nToronto Argonauts.\n  Hindered by injuries, Leland was unable to continue pursuing \nathletics and switched gears by earning his master of science degree in \nmaterials science engineering from the University of Virginia. Leland \nstarted his career at NASA in 1989 as an aerospace research engineer at \nNASA Langley Research Center in Hampton. He entered NASA's astronaut \ncorps in 1998 and served on board the space shuttle Atlantis on two \nmissions to the International Space Station in 2008 and 2009. Leland is \none of only 14 African Americans to travel to space.\n  Leland will finish his tenure at NASA as Associate Administrator for \nEducation, a position he was appointed to in 2010. In this role, Leland \nhas led NASA's efforts to teach young Americans the importance of \nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, with a \nparticular passion for underserved communities. Leland also serves on \nthe White House National Science and Technology Council's Committee on \nSTEM, which coordinates and oversees the STEM education activities and \nprograms within the Federal government. On the global level, Leland \nserves as our Nation's representative to the International Space \nEducation Board, which develops and coordinates worldwide efforts to \neducate students on space, science and technology.\n  I commend Leland for his commitment to science and education, as well \nas public service. At a time when STEM education is becoming a priority \nfor the United States, Leland's work has been beneficial to developing \nthe skilled workforce necessary to drive our Nation's world-class \ninnovations. Moreover, as an athlete who found a second passion at \nNASA, Leland serves as an iconic example of the opportunities young \npeople can seize in science and technology. Leland's hard work, \nachievements and inspiring life story will undoubtedly leave a lasting \nimpact on our Nation.\n  On behalf of the Senate and the people of Virginia, I thank Leland \nfor his invaluable service to NASA and the Nation. Although he may be \nleaving NASA, he will continue to educate and inspire long after his \nwork is done. I wish him the best of luck in the months and years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2951-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING ANGLERS HABITAT\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, my home State of Idaho is blessed \nwith abundance of natural beauty. Idaho natives and visitors from all \nover the world enjoy the beauty, the peace, and the excitement of the \nlakes, ponds, rivers, and streams that cover over 800 square miles of \nmy State. With summer fast approaching, the minds of many Idahoans are \nturning to a pastime thousands of years old: fishing. When anglers want \nto get serious about snagging a steelhead, they turn to the \nprofessionals. With that in mind, it gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize Anglers Habitat, located in Caldwell, ID.\n  Owned by Wayne Johnson, Anglers Habitat has been selling a wide \nvariety of fishing and outdoors gear since 1994. Mr. Johnson and his \nemployees are careful to only stock the best, most reliable fishing \ntools. From rods and reels to dog beds, they offer hundreds of items \nfrom dozens of product lines. The selection is so good, many of their \ncustomers hail from outside the United States. Trust me, the folks at \nAnglers Habitat know what they are doing. At 5,760 square feet, theirs \nis the largest fly fishing store in the region.\n  Anglers Habitat goes the extra mile to make sure that customers find \nwhat they need. Their products are available for purchase in person at \ntheir flagship location, on the official company Web site or through \ntheir eBay site. Anglers Habitat also offers a trade-in program where \ncustomers can bring in used equipment that still in working condition \nin exchange for a discount on newer items. Not only does this create a \ngood deal for the customer, but it also reduces waste and recycles \nstill useable equipment.\n  Good service is also integral to the success of Anglers Habitat. \nExpanding customer knowledge is something they take seriously. Through \ntheir YouTube channel, the company promotes products and provides \nproduct reviews so that consumers may make an informed decision while \nshopping for equipment. They also offer free Saturday clinics on how to \nbuild a custom rod. High-end equipment can cost hundreds of dollars, \nand it is important to know how to best take advantage of modern \nfishing technology.\n  My home State of Idaho is blessed to be home to so much natural \nsplendor and abundant outdoor recreational opportunities. Companies \nlike Anglers Habitat recognize this beauty and provide a way for \ncountless others to enjoy a pastime to which we Idahoans are already so \naccustomed. As we celebrate National Small Business Week, I want to \ncongratulate Mr. Johnson and the team at Anglers Habitat on their two \ndecades of achievement and wish them continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2951-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2951-S2952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               47TH STREET BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize New York City's 47th Street Business Improvement District, \n47th Street BID. The 47th Street BID is a not-for-profit organization \nformed in 1997 by the merchants and landlords of the Diamond District, \none of New York City's best known and most vibrant economic areas. The \n47th Street BID has been instrumental in establishing the Diamond \nDistrict as a central hub for the world's diamond and jewelry \nindustries and has worked to cement its place as a powerhouse component \nof New York's economy.\n  The Diamond District, which consists of one block in midtown \nManhattan--located on West 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth \nAvenue--is home to a significant portion of New York's diamond \nmanufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers and serves as the home base \nfor two industries that hold a great deal of importance for New York: \nthe diamond industry, including both rough and wholesale diamonds, and \nthe finished-jewelry industry. These two industries are extremely \nimportant to New York's tourism sector and are responsible for \nemploying thousands of New Yorkers in highly-skilled jobs. New York \nCity's diamond industry is also home to high-quality jewelry \nmanufacturing, and aspiring artists come from all over the world to be \ntrained in New York in the art of creating this much sought-after \njewelry. The diamond and jewelry sector also supports a large number of \nhigh-profile, critical New York industries as well, including fashion, \nentertainment, and hospitality.\n  It is estimated that over half of the diamonds that come to the \nUnited States enter through New York, and the Diamond District is known \nall over the world as the international center for the diamond and \njewelry trade. The Diamond District is also home to two foreign-trade \nzones--the International Gem Tower at 50 W. 47th Street and the World \nDiamond Tower at 580 Fifth Avenue, which also houses the 47th Street \nBID headquarters. People flock from all over the world to buy and sell \ndiamonds and other gems in these free trade zones. The 47th Street BID \nhas also been instrumental in enhancing the economic development \nactivities of the Diamond District and making the area safer and more \nbeautiful for merchants and consumers who work and shop there. The 47th \nStreet BID also\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\ninstalled flowers, holiday decorations, and banners in the Diamond \nDistrict. It also recently undertook an initiative to keep the district \nclean--an initiative which is now one of the highest-rated sanitation \nprograms in all of New York City. Additionally, the 47th Street BID \ndeveloped and operates the Diamond District's website, which has become \na key resource for shoppers and merchants alike, who rely on the site \nfor referrals.\n  New York's Diamond District is an incredible example of how an \nindustry can continuously grow and thrive in a competitive economic \nclimate, and the 47th Street BID has played a large role in helping to \nmake the Diamond District--and the people who work there--a tremendous \nsuccess. By promoting the Diamond District, facilitating trade, and \nkeeping the district clean and safe for customers, merchants, and \ntraders alike, the 47th Street BID has ensured that this critical New \nYork industry remains a power house within New York, a major economic \nengine for the city and State, and an international hub for this global \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/13/senate-section/article/S2952-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2952-S2953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-5700.

I rise to speak about a bill that I am introducing \ntoday which is an amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act and it is \nentitled the End-User Protection Act. During the debate on Dodd-Frank a \ncouple years ago, a constant concern for me and others in this Chamber \nwas how best to protect end users, the individuals and businesses that \nuse futures markets both to purchase commodities and use derivatives to \nhedge their risk. The legislation that ultimately passed was not what I \nhad desired, but it did specify that end users should not be treated \nthe same as banks, and in many instances should not be subject to the \nsame registration and margin requirements as other market participants. \nBut that simply has not been the case as the CFTC has gone through the \nrulemaking process.\n  I have seen many instances where the Commission in its zeal to \nfinalize rules has not given due consideration to those farmers, \nranchers, and other end users who depend on our futures markets to \nhedge their risks. Time and again end users brought their concerns to \nthe Commission, and the end-user exemption I helped to author was not \nhonored. In other instances Dodd-Frank created unintended consequences \nthat must be fixed. It is for these reasons that I am introducing the \nEnd-User Protection Act.\n  As commodities end users have struggled through an increasing burden \nof reforms that were never designed for them, the effect has been an \nincrease in their cost of doing business and, for some, making the \nalready high risks associated with farming even higher.\n  The bill I am introducing clarifies that unlike banks, true \nderivative end users are exempt from the margin requirements applied by \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to many \nof the derivatives contracts that they enter into.\n  Let me highlight a few of the other reforms that are included in this \nbill. One of the most egregious abuses by the Commodities Futures \nTrading Commission has been with their cost-benefit analysis. While the \nCEA instructed the Commission to weigh the cost and benefits of \nregulations, it is only recently we have seen misgivings in this \nprocess. Throughout the Dodd-Frank rulemaking process industry \nparticipants have relayed concerns about the cost-benefit analyses \nperformed by the CFTC. Commissioners as well have vocalized concerns \nthat the model the CFTC has used is deficient in several areas. For \ninstance, in a letter to the Wall Street Journal in August of 2011, \nCommissioner Scott O'Malia stated:\n\n       With respect to our proposed rule makings, our own \n     inspector general has called into question the quality of the \n     cost-benefit analysis. Nevertheless, during the course of our \n     final rule makings, I have continued to see indications that \n     the CFTC intends to persist with a one-size-fits-all, \n     qualitative approach. This approach contradicts two recent \n     executive orders from President Obama and justifiably renders \n     our rule makings vulnerable to legal challenge.\n       . . . We need to be more cognizant of the effects that our \n     rule makings may have on the food and energy costs of average \n     Americans. If the CFTC needs to re-propose a rule making, \n     then so be it. Given the stakes for Main Street and Wall \n     Street, it is more important to get a rule making right than \n     to finish it fast.\n\n  As Commissioner O'Malia notes, getting it right is the most important \npart for the average American--but not, it seems, for the Commission. \nEven the CFTC's Inspector General detailed insufficient cost-benefit \nmethodology in rulemakings. In some instances the Commission has even \nreleased ``interpretive guidance'' in order to subvert the cost-benefit \nprocess altogether.\n  President Obama has made clear that he expects a thorough analysis, \nand the Commission should be held to the same standard as other \nagencies. Therefore, my bill amends the Commodities Exchange Act to \nrequire a real cost-benefit analysis be performed before rulemaking. I \nam asking for the Commission as a rulemaking body to play fair, to do \nthe right thing, and ensure when they pass a rule they know how it will \naffect market participants and the industry as a whole first.\n  We know some companies pass risk from their affiliates to one central \nhedging unit in order to consolidate their combined market risk. Then \nthey hedge that risk with the market. Often the affiliate that houses \nthe central desk is deemed a ``financial entity'' and therefore not \nable to utilize the end-user exception to mandatory clearing. Simply \nput, when one company with multiple units trades with itself, it \nshouldn't face the same regulatory burden as when it trades in the \nmarket.\n  We have also seen instances where transparency has had unintended \nconsequences for some market participants. As their trading data was \nmade available, some savvy market participants have been able to track \ntheir trades without even knowing the name of the company. It is \nimportant these entities not face a disadvantage in the market, \nresulting in millions of dollars in additional costs simply because \ntheir positions can be identified. This bill fixes that issue and ends \nthat disadvantage.\n  Another reform this bill makes is allowances for utilities' \nvolumetric optionality. Many utilities that are purchasers of natural \ngas for both electricity and home heating often are unable to detail \nexactly how much demand they will have during a particular timeframe. \nAlthough they previously were able to utilize contracts that allowed \nthis ``optionality'' to determine when and how much electricity they \ncould purchase, these types of contracts are now effectively \nprohibited. By barring these utilities from being able to employ market \nstrategies to keep costs low and ensure stability, the cost rises not \nonly for the end-user company but for the consumer as well. We should \nmake allowances for this volumetric optionality and the bill before us \ndoes just that.\n  In summary, this bill clarifies the existing end-user exemption that \nthe Congress provided during the Dodd-Frank debate. Further, it ensures \nthat market participants who do not pose systemic risks and use our \nfutures markets to decrease their cost of business and increase their \nefficiencies are able to continue those practices, ultimately to the \nbenefit of the consumer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Whereas there were approximately 252,000 youth that entered \n     the foster care system in 2012, while nearly 102,000 youth \n     were eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2012;\n

peers, such as sports or extracurricular activities;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are more susceptible to being \n     trafficked, and more needs to be done to prevent, identify, \n     and intervene when a child becomes a victim of the crime;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children that are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 23,400 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     annually without a legal permanent connection to an adult or \n     family;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas nearly half of children in foster care for five or \n     more years experience 7 or more different foster care \n     placements, which often leads to disruption of routines and \n     the need to change schools and move away from siblings, \n     extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in \n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and post-permanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation over the past three decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96-272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34), and the Uninterrupted \n     Scholars Act (Public Law 112-278) provided new investments \n     and services to improve the outcomes of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas the Children's Bureau of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services has designated May as National Foster Care \n     Month under the theme ``to help build blocks toward permanent \n     families for foster youth'';\n       Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as \n     National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare \n     workforce, foster parents, advocacy community, and mentors \n     for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive impact \n     they have on the lives of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges that children face in \n     the foster-care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system and maximize the \n     number children exiting foster care to the protection of \n     safe, loving, and permanent families;\n       (3) supports the designation of National Foster Care Month;\n       (4) acknowledges the unique needs of children in the \n     foster-care system;\n       (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States \n     for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while \n     facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster-care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster-care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster-care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--\n       (A) support vulnerable families;\n       (B) invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) promote guardianship, adoption, and other permanent \n     placement opportunities in cases where reunification is not \n     in the best interests of the child;\n       (D) adequately serve those children brought into the \n     foster-care system; and\n       (E) facilitate the successful transition into adulthood for \n     children that ``age out'' of the foster-care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url":
