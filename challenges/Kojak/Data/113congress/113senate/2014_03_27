The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 333, H.R. 3979, a bill to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that \n     emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as \n     employees under the shared responsibility requirements \n     contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Peter D. Robinson\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said often that people who work here \nin the Capitol are some of the most intelligent men and women anyplace \nin the world. They come here--as I explained to a group of people from \nNevada this morning--dedicated to public service. They are not here to \nsee how much money they can make. They are here to change people's \nlives. Today, the Senate is losing one of its brightest and most \nseasoned minds.\n  A lawyer by trade, Pete Robinson came to the Senate in 2002. I knew \nPete because he had worked in the House previously, when I served over \nthere. I knew him as someone I always admired--people who are good \nrunners. I saw Pete out running and I was amazed at his gracefulness \nand speed. I did a lot of running. I wasn't very graceful and didn't \nhave a lot of speed, but I did a lot of running. Pete was the captain \nof his high school cross-country team. He was a good athlete, which I \nadmire very much.\n  From the moment he came to the Senate, the Office of Parliamentarian \nbecame a better place. He was as close to being indispensable as \nanyone. He has an incredible work ethic and tremendous experience--\nhaving been the Parliamentarian in the House and here and having been \nin the private sector. He has a great memory and has made the Senate \nfunction as it should. Not many people can make that claim, especially \ntoday. So he will be missed. I will miss him personally.\n  I love to joke with him and talk to him about his running days, like \nI talk about my running days, as if we were both still out running. But \nthat is what life is all about. We look back at the things that we did. \nI am sure, just as the Presiding Officer knows, things you do as a \nyounger man become better every day, and that is the way I look back on \nmy athletic endeavors in that regard. Of course, talking just about \nmyself, maybe I wasn't as good as I thought I was, but that didn't \nmatter at the time. It made me feel good, and that is what athletics is \nall about--trying to build character.\n  So Pete is going to be missed in his retirement, but he is going to \nhave plenty to do. He has lots of hobbies: an avid gardener, a good \ncook--some say an amateur chef. I won't go that far, but he is a good \ncook, as I understand it. He can make his own furniture. So he is going \nto keep busy feeding and furnishing his wife Connie, their daughter \nTara, son-in-law Ethan, and grandson Milo with the good things he has \ndone.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\n  We will truly miss him. I appreciate his courtesies all the time to \nme, and, as far as I know, to everyone else.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican \nleader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30, \nwith the Republicans controlling the first half and the majority the \nfinal half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to H.R. 4152. At \nnoon there will be up to three rollcall votes: the Menendez-Corker \nsubstitute, passage of the Ukraine bill, and confirmation of Maria \nContreras-Sweet to be Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Last night I filed cloture on John Owens to be a U.S. circuit judge, \nand on the motion to proceed to the legislative vehicle for the \nunemployment insurance bill. Under the rule the first cloture vote will \nbe tomorrow morning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Peter D. Robinson\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a word about our longtime \ncolleague Peter Robinson, who is retiring this week.\n  Peter joined the Office of the Senate Parliamentarian in 2002 and \nquickly distinguished himself as a standout talent. He brought a \nremarkable breadth of knowledge to a job that really requires it and a \nlegendary facility for reading and digesting complex legislation in \nrecord time. His colleagues describe him as kind of a genius, \nactually--somebody who can remember not only where he read something \nbut the exact page on which he read it. According to Senate legend, one \nstaffer actually showed up one day asking for the software program that \nhe just assumed Peter had been using to analyze complex bills. He was \nthat fast. He was that good.\n  Peter has all sorts of interests and hobbies, so I am sure he will \nmake very good use of his retirement, but he will be missed around \nhere. Pete's colleagues will miss his professional skill and mastery of \nprecedent and procedure, but they will also miss the good humor and the \nequanimity which have made him such a great colleague and such a \nvaluable and respected member of the Senate family over the years. We \nwish Peter all the best.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today is an important day for Ukraine and \nfor all nations supporting international law, democracy, and decency. \nLater today the Senate will pass a bipartisan bill that provides much \nneeded aid to stabilize Ukraine's economy.\n  For those Russian leaders who have played a role in the \ndestabilization of Ukraine, this legislation contains much needed \nrepercussions against them. Remember, Russia is run by an oligarchy. \nOne of the oligarchs is the President of that country--Putin. This bill \nis a reality check to him that the United States will not stand idly by \nwhile Russia plays the role of schoolyard bully.\n  It seems to me that President Putin does not understand the way the \nworld works today. It is almost as if Putin yearns for the days of \nJoseph Stalin. Times have changed since Stalin was around, the world \nhas changed since Stalin was around, and it has changed for the better. \nThe Cold War is over, along with fixtures such as the Iron Curtain, \ndueling superpowers, and brinksmanship. Yet it is almost as if Putin is \nliving in a time warp. Russia's place in the world has transformed. It \ndoes not wield the global power it once did. The rest of the world has \nchanged since Stalin's era, with other countries in leading roles.\n  But the United States of America remains a beacon of hope to the \nwhole world. Our economic, our military, our political power, and our \ninfluence are strong because we stand for freedom, democracy, and \neconomic prosperity. Russia, on the other hand, led by this man who \nyearns for Stalin, is a nation of immense resources and potential for \ngood. Yet they have chosen to wield its influence solely for self-\ninterests.\n  Earlier this week President Obama said the following about Russia:\n\n       Russia is a regional power that is threatening some of its \n     immediate neighbors--not out of strength, but out of \n     weakness. The fact that Russia felt compelled to go in \n     militarily and lay bare these violations of international law \n     indicates less influence, not more.\n\n  President Obama is absolutely correct. Instead of using its influence \nto bring stability to neighboring countries, Putin has instead played \nthe role of an antagonist. Look at what has taken place in Crimea and \nthe country of Georgia. For what does Russia stand? For what does \nPresident Putin stand?\n  As the world gets closer and closer to looking at Putin, it doesn't \nlike what it sees. The product of Putin's two decades in leadership \nseems to be a disregard for national law, more corruption, and \nincreased suppression of basic human rights. While countless of his own \ncitizens have rallied in the streets pleading for more freedom, Putin \nand his cronies have concerned themselves with getting richer--not only \nwith power but with money. These oligarchs have been ruthless in \nprotecting their power and their money.\n  Inside and outside of Russia, the President of Russia has displayed a \npenchant for being a bully. He imprisons political rivals and locks \nthem up. He seizes the wealth from Russians who have displeased him. If \nthey don't say or do exactly what he wants, he puts them in jail and \ntakes their wealth. He has singlehandedly rolled back years of progress \non equality. He has endorsed the persecution of his own country's gay \nand lesbian community. And once again he has invaded and occupied a \nnation for choosing democracy. Are these acts of a statesman? No. They \nare acts of a bully.\n  As billions tuned in to the Olympics, I believe few were deluded by \nthe fake veneer of Putin's Sochi show. In fact, all we saw was that \nPutin's Russia isn't working.\n  I say every time I get on the floor that if he so likes the vote that \ntook place in Crimea, why doesn't he have a vote of the people in \nChechnya? Everyone knows why.\n  I say to Mr. Putin: Operating by intimidation and belligerence will \nnot work. In today's world, nations should work together through \ndiplomacy and the rule of law.\n  He has a choice to come back into the international community and \nhonor international law or to continue to isolate Russia.\n  Russian troops continue to mass at the border of Ukraine, but he \nshould understand this: The consequences for his continued bullying \nwill not end today and certainly not with this bill. His chest-thumping \naggression is leading Russia only to isolation and irrelevance.\n  My colleagues and I will continue to work to strengthen Ukraine's \nGovernment and its 46 million people. The bill before the Senate today \nsanctions and further isolates Putin and his inner circle. What we are \ndoing here today is just the beginning.\n  I support this legislation, and I am proud of my Senate colleagues \nwho join in standing for the people of Ukraine. This is what we are \ndoing.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Real Solutions\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will start by acknowledging the \nmajority leader's candor yesterday in outlining his party's agenda for \nthe rest of the year--in admitting he actually asked his party's \n``political arm,'' the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to \ncome up with it. Maybe he didn't intend to admit that his party's so-\ncalled agenda is actually a political gambit or that it basically has \none intent--to bail out imperiled Democrats, Democrats desperate to \ndistract from how ObamaCare is devastating the middle class--but it \nslipped out anyway.\n  But that wasn't the only Freudian slip we heard at yesterday's press \nconference. Here is a quote from one of the majority leader's top \nlieutenants:\n\n       When we play the political games that we're playing here, \n     [middle-class families] feel that we are detached from their \n     priorities.\n\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\n\n  Boy, I couldn't agree more with that. Maybe that is why even the \npress isn't taking this ``agenda'' seriously. The New York Times \nreported that helping struggling Americans is ``not really the point'' \nof Democrats' agenda and that a main goal is actually just ``to \nmotivate the Democratic base'' and drive turnout in places they need to \nwin in November. The Times also noted that the show votes associated \nwith the Democratic agenda ``will be timed to coincide with campaign-\nstyle trips [by the President].'' According to the Washington Post, \n``Democrats hope to use the votes . . . as fodder . . . in hopes of \nstaving off potential losses in several states.''\n  Look, it doesn't get any more cynical than that--to demonstrate such \na total lack of seriousness in such troubling times for the middle \nclass.\n  At this point Washington Democrats are in the sixth year of trying to \nfix the economy, and the middle class continues to suffer. It is just \nnot working.\n  As I have been saying for months now, this presents Washington \nDemocrats with a choice. One option they have is to try something \ndifferent. This means coming to the middle and working with us on \nbipartisan solutions that can create jobs, increase take-home pay, and \ngive a leg up to the middle class. The other option is to double down \non failed ideology and political gimmicks--the kinds of things that get \nthe Democrats' leftwing base all excited.\n  In short, Washington Democrats have a choice between helping the \nmiddle class and pleasing the left. So when they release a poll-tested, \ncampaign-crafted ObamaCare distraction ``agenda'' packed to the brim \nwith ``lefty show votes,'' I think middle-class families can tell whose \nside Washington Democrats are really on. It is certainly not their \nside.\n  The people we represent all deserve better than this. They are \nhurting, really hurting, and all Washington Democrats seem to have for \nthem is a bunch of show votes. I mean, how will show votes help our \nconstituents? How will they help the people who have been writing to me \nabout the impact of ObamaCare on themselves and their families?\n  One woman who wrote me from Louisville had been enrolled in \nKentucky's high-risk pool for people with preexisting conditions. She \nsaid she had been battling cancer for years and that in 2012 her cancer \nmetastasized and moved into her liver, pelvis, lung, and diaphragm. \nJust imagine hearing devastating news like that. Now imagine hearing a \nyear or so later that you are going to lose the insurance you liked \ntoo, insurance that had helped you manage your cancer treatment, and, \nworse, that your new ObamaCare plan was going to classify your chemo \nmedicine as a specialty drug that costs more than $1,000 for a 3-week \nsupply. ObamaCare, this constituent wrote, ``is about as helpful in \nsaving my life as a wet paper sack to help cover me from the rain.''\n  I would note she contacted me because she wanted me to know that \nObamaCare stories like hers are anything but ``lies,'' despite what \nsome in this Chamber might imply.\n  Does anyone really think constituents like her care about some show \nvote? No. What she needs is relief from ObamaCare.\n  So does another Kentuckian, who wrote me from Henderson County, whose \npremium will jump $400 a month to over $1,100 a month under ObamaCare. \nHe wrote:\n\n       Americans were told that we could . . . keep our existing \n     policy [if we chose]. . . . Not only was [this] a lie--[it's] \n     a lie that will cost me an additional $700 per month!\n\n  How is a political show vote going to help him? Of course it isn't. \nAnd there is not a thing the Democratic Party's ``political arm'' can \ndo to fix these problems.\n  Kentuckians and countless Americans suffering under ObamaCare need \nreal solutions--not gimmicks, not base-pleasing ideology. Solutions are \nwhat is needed. Look, Washington Democrats forced America's middle \nclass into this impossible situation. They basically blocked every \nreasonable attempt to reform this law or to change it in any meaningful \nway. Yet now ObamaCare is becoming politically difficult for them. They \nare deflecting blame. Just this morning we saw several imperiled Obama \nDemocrats spin an op-ed that underscores the point, but Americans are \nnot going to be fooled by any of this. Americans agree it is time for \nWashington Democrats to work with us to remedy the mess they created, \nand that means repealing this law and replacing it with real reform.\n\n  It is time for them to work with us on a real jobs agenda too, and to \ntake up the numerous bills the House has already sent over and get them \nonto the President's desk.\n  Americans are fed up with the games and the tricks. They want serious \nsolutions. They don't need a campaign poster to figure that out, and \nRepublicans believe it is about time the American people got those \nsolutions.\n\n\n                 Remembering sergeant Michael C. Cable\n\n  Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a Kentucky soldier who \ntragically has been lost while serving his country. SGT Michael C. \nCable of Philpot, KY, was killed by the enemy while guarding American \nand Afghan officials in Afghanistan on March 27, 2013, exactly 1 year \nago today. He was 26 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Sergeant Cable received several awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \nBronze Service Star, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Noncommissioned Officers \nProfessional Development Ribbon, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas \nService Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat Action Badge, and the Air \nAssault Badge.\n  A decade ago as a high school student, Michael was a star on the \nDaviess County High School cross-country team, and they won many races. \n``I sent out an e-mail this morning with this Bible verse,'' says Tony \nRowe, Michael's former high school coach.\n\n       ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down \n     his life for his friends.'' He is a hero. He died fighting \n     for us and trying to make life better for the people of \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  What Tony Rowe says about Michael is absolutely true, and in fact the \nmost important thing that Michael's family wants the world to \nunderstand is that Michael was performing a mission at the time he was \nattacked, and this important mission was protecting others. It was not \nonly highly important work but highly dangerous.\n  Before leaving on his final deployment, Michael pulled his family \nmembers aside to warn them his mission would be dangerous. ``He was \nprepared before he left for anything that happened,'' said Raymond \nJohnston, Michael's older brother. In that conversation Michael \ndescribed his sisters and a close family friend as the most important \npeople in his life, and he asked his family to take care of them if \nanything happened to him.\n  It is very hard. He was my little buddy. He wanted to make sure that \nno matter what, we continued to enjoy life. And we are trying to do \nthat.\n  Michael's tragic loss was the first combat death for the 101st \nAirborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY, for that deployment to \nAfghanistan. He joined the Army in August 2007 and arrived at Fort \nCampbell in December of 2010. He served as a fire support specialist.\n  In his family Michael was known as a prankster. His last big prank \nwas pulled on his younger sister Idalis. Michael promised he would buy \nIdalis a car. He had his older sister Wendy tell Idalis that Michael \nwas determined to make good on his word but that he had bought her a \nreally old and ugly car. Wendy told Idalis she would have to act \nexcited so as not to hurt Michael's feelings. Far from a beat-up \nclunker, Michael gave his sister his own Jeep Cherokee just before he \ndeployed to Afghanistan.\n  Michael loved sports of all kinds. He played golf to relax and won a \ngolf tournament at Fort Campbell. His favorite professional sports team \nwas the Green Bay Packers.\n  Michael had planned to leave the Army after his tour in Afghanistan \nto open his own home remodeling business. His family remembers Michael \nas always busy spending time with friends.\n  We are thinking about Michael's family today, including his parents, \nVickie and Raymond Johnston, his siblings Raymond, Lisa, Wendy, \nKennedy,\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nand Idalis, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  I would like the family of SGT Michael C. Cable to know this Senate \nrecognizes that Sergeant Cable was doing his job, and we are filled \nwith gratitude. Without the men and women brave enough to wear our \ncountry's uniform and do the jobs our country asks them to do, I fear \nfor what would become of our Nation.\n  I know my colleagues join me in honoring Sergeant Cable for his life \nof service and for his tragic sacrifice, and I extend my deepest \ncondolences to Michael's family for their loss 1 year ago today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday the Democrats in the Senate held \na news conference in which they rolled out their agenda, which has been \ndescribed differently by different news organizations. The headline \nfrom the Washington Examiner said: ``Majority threatened, Democrats \ntake up populace agenda to distract from ObamaCare.'' The Wall Street \nJournal headline said: ``Senate Democrats try to change subject from \nObamaCare.'' The New York Times in reporting on that story, their \nheadline was: ``Democrats, as Part of Midterm Strategy to Schedule \nVotes on Pocketbook Issues.'' So that was a little more, perhaps, \nflattering headline.\n  In the story in the New York Times, it goes on to say:\n\n       The proposals have little chance of passing. But Democrats \n     concede that making new laws is not really the point. Rather, \n     they are trying to force Republicans to vote against them.\n\n  Later on in the story, the New York Times goes on to say:\n\n       Part of the goal is to energize the Democratic base, which \n     will be crucial to turnout in the more conservative states \n     where the party needs to win this year.\n\n  So everybody kind of gets the joke that this is really about the \nmidterm elections. The agenda the Democrats are now rolling out is \ndesigned to try to create a distraction away from their economic record \nand from ObamaCare.\n  It is interesting to me because the Democrats have been the majority \nin the Senate now for 8 years. So you would think by now this sort of \nan agenda would have been inactive. In fact, for a few years they had a \nfilibuster-proof majority in the Senate. They had 60 votes and could do \nliterally anything they wanted. Most of these items now are being \nrolled out because it is, as I said, an election year, and they are \nsaying: These are things that we can do for the American people.\n  Well, I think the American people are saying enough already. You have \ndone enough to us. Please don't do any more.\n  The agenda is being described as a fair shot for everyone. Well, I \nthink the American people, perhaps, don't see it as a shot for them as \nthey do a shot at them.\n  If you look at the last several years as any indication of that, it \nhasn't worked very well. The agenda that has been advanced by the \nDemocrats here in the Senate and by the President of the United States \nhas left us with a sluggish economy, chronic high unemployment, massive \namounts of debt, the lowest labor participation rate, literally, that \nwe have seen in 35 years. In fact, last year the economy grew at 0.9 \npercent. So you have this sluggish economy sputtering along, and the \nAmerican people are asking: Where are the jobs? Where is the take-home \npay?\n  Since the President took office, household income in this country has \ngone down--not up--by $3,700 per family. If you look at all the \npolicies put in place by the Democratic majority, there isn't really \nanything that you could point to that helps create jobs mainly because \nit is heavy handed, top-down management from Washington, DC.\n  The American people need policies that will unleash the American free \nenterprise system and unleash the entrepreneurs and small businesses \nthat would allow them to grow this economy and expand this economy. \nThat is better for everyone. Every middle-class American in this \ncountry wants a better quality of life, a better standard of life for \ntheir children and grandchildren than what they have experienced. This \nmay be the first generation of Americans where this is not true. Why? \nBecause policies in Washington, DC, make it more difficult, more \nexpensive, to create jobs.\n  You can go down the list. If you look at ObamaCare, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, ObamaCare is going to result in 2.5 \nmillion fewer full-time workers. According to the CBO, there will be \n2.5 million fewer full-time workers over the next decade and $1 \ntrillion in lower wages. Fewer jobs and lower take-home pay is what we \nare seeing as a result of the policies that have been put in place by \nthe Democratic majority in the Senate and by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Yesterday there was another announcement about yet another delay of \nObamaCare--which will be, I think, the 30th delay that we have seen so \nfar with regard to that legislation. In speaking about that delay, the \nmajority leader of the Senate said yesterday that he thought the delay \nwas necessary because people weren't educated enough about how to use \nthe Internet. Only in Washington, DC--only in Washington, DC--do you \nsee politicians blaming the American people for their failures because \nthat is essentially what the ObamaCare legislation is. By and large I \nthink most people would conclude it just isn't working. It didn't add \nup in the first place, and it is not working.\n  It is creating fewer jobs, higher premiums, higher deductibles, lower \ntake-home pay for the American people, fewer choices for doctors and \nhospitals, and the idea that it is the fault of the American people \nbecause they are not educated enough to use the Internet--my dad is 94 \nyears old. He lives in my hometown of Myrtle, SD, a town of about 500 \npeople. He uses the Internet every single day.\n  I don't think the problem is the Internet or that people in this \ncountry aren't educated enough to use the Internet. I think it has a \nlot more to do with the fact that incompetence here in Washington, DC, \nled to a failed rollout that confused millions of Americans. That is \nnot the responsibility of, nor should we blame, the American people for \nthat. That is government trying to do big things and not doing them \nwell. The government doesn't do complicated things very well.\n  So when you hear of the new agenda coming out from the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, that we are going to do this for the American \npeople; we are going to do that for the American people and talk about \na minimum wage increase--again, you have a Congressional Budget Office \nsaying that raising the minimum wage by 40 percent, which is what is \nbeing proposed, would, in fact, cost the economy up to a million jobs \nand also would raise prices.\n  It is going to raise prices on the people that will be hurt the most \nby price increases--lower-income Americans. Instead of putting policies \nin place that cost the American economy jobs, we ought to be looking at \nthings that actually create jobs.\n  We have a proposal called the Keystone Pipeline which the President's \nown State Department has said would create 42,000 jobs. So those are \nreal jobs, shovel-ready jobs that would be available today. Instead we \nwant to put policies in place that are actually going to cost the \neconomy jobs. If you're an American citizen out there and you hear \nWashington, DC, is going to do more for you, yet again, you have got to \nbe saying: Whoa, you know, hold the phone. We have seen enough of that \nalready. We have seen this picture before, and we have seen what \nresults when the government tries to do big and complicated things. It \njust doesn't work very well.\n  The Web site rollout is a perfect example of that, as is the 2,700-\npage\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nObamaCare legislation followed by about 25,000 pages of regulations, \nwhich people in this country have to try and discern and figure out.\n  I would submit that there are things that will create jobs. We know \nthe Keystone Pipeline will create jobs. Passing trade promotion \nauthority and allowing our trade negotiators to create more market \nopportunities for small businesses and farmers and ranchers and \nentrepreneurs in this country and around the world will create jobs. \nPassing trade promotion authority and getting the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership and the European trade agreement enacted they say will \nexpose American businesses to 1 billion new consumers worldwide. Those \nare the types of things that do create jobs, and we know that.\n  Instead of having an election year agenda that is transparently \nstated to be that, why don't we actually talk about things that will \ncreate jobs and will improve the overall standard of living for people \nin this country?\n  I would make one other observation, and that is another thing coming \nout of the administration right now, which will be incredibly harmful \nto the economy and make it very difficult for lower income and middle-\nclass Americans to make ends meet, are policies coming out of the EPA \nthat are going to drive the cost of energy. Energy is an important \ninput. It is a huge factor in places such as South Dakota where we have \na cold-weather climate and an agricultural-based economy. We travel \nlong distances to get places. When you talk about raising the cost of \nenergy in a State such as South Dakota, you are significantly \nincreasing the cost of doing business in a way that will make it more \ndifficult and more expensive to create the jobs we need, get people \nback to work, and get the economy growing at a faster rate. These \nthings are harmful to job growth.\n  I talked to a bunch of small businesses in my State last week and \nasked them about some of these policies. I asked them: What are the \nbiggest obstacles right now to your success and what are things that \ncould be done that would actually be helpful?\n  Of course, ObamaCare is something that immediately comes up, but also \nthe whole issue of the minimum wage. The smallest business owner I \ntalked to I believe had 30 employees and the largest had maybe a little \nover 200 employees. They said, look, this is a job killer. What that \nmeans is we are not going to be able to hire as many people. It adds \nsignificant higher operating costs every year to our businesses and \nmakes it more difficult to create the jobs for the people who actually \nneed those jobs, most of whom, in a lot of these places, are going to \nbe young people who are trying to get that first job and make their way \nup the economic ladder.\n  There are lots of things we could talk about that do address the \nproblem rather than just addressing the symptoms, and we want to vote \non an extension. We are going to vote on an extension of unemployment \ninsurance, which will be the thirteenth time we have done that. When \nyou go through an economic downturn, obviously there is a need to help \npeople who have lost jobs and been displaced in the economy. But when \nare we going to start focusing on the problem rather than the symptom?\n  The problem is we have almost 4 million Americans who have been \nunemployed for more than 6 months. We ought to be looking at what we \ncan do to create jobs for the people who don't have jobs in our \neconomy. I have introduced an amendment to the unemployment insurance \nlegislation, which I don't think is going to get voted on, that has \nsome simple solutions.\n  One of those things is to waive the employer mandate for any employer \nwho hires somebody who has been unemployed for more than 6 months. So \nif you are a long-term unemployed person and an employer hires that \nperson, you get a waiver from the employer mandate which could save an \nemployer several thousand dollars a year. It also calls for a 6-month \npayroll tax holiday for employers, which if you have a $40,000-a-year \nemployee on your payroll, you would save about $2,400. You could save \n$4,000, $5,000, or $6,000 a year in the cost of hiring someone with \nthose two suggestions. Another suggestion is to allow people to have \naccess to low-interest loans--up to $10,000--to relocate to places \nwhere there is lower unemployment.\n  My State of South Dakota is looking for workers. When I travel \nthrough my communities, we can't find workers. One of the biggest \nobstacles for people to get to jobs is to relocate. If we gave them a \nlow-interest loan that would allow them to move to places where there \nis low unemployment and where there are jobs, it would make a lot of \nsense.\n  Finally, it adopts the SKILLS Act that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives, which consolidates 35 Federal programs into 9 programs \nso you don't have all of this duplication and overlap in all of these \nFederal programs for worker training and shifts that resource out to \nthe States where States can design programs that actually prepare and \nequip the people in their States for the jobs that are available.\n  Those are the types of solutions we ought to be talking about rather \nthan top-down, heavyhanded, government-driven solutions that make it \nmore difficult to create jobs and is equivalent to throwing a big wet \nblanket on the American economy at the time we can least afford it.\n  My State of South Dakota is a good example. We have balanced our \nbudget every year since 1889. We have zero personal income tax, zero \ncorporate income tax, and we have a very well-trained, hard-working, \neducated workforce. We have a good climate for doing business with a \nlight regulatory touch. We have a low unemployment rate and a vibrant \neconomy mainly because we understand that it isn't the government that \ncreates jobs.\n  When the Senate Democrats and the President come out with the \nelection-year, poll-tested agenda, which is clearly driven simply to \ntry to generate votes in the midterm elections rather than actually \nsolve the problems--and it says that in the stories. The stories are \nvery transparent about what they are trying to do. We ought to be \nfocused on things that actually create jobs, such as passing the \nKeystone Pipeline, passing trade promotion authority, and looking at \nreal solutions that do more than just treat symptoms, and actually get \nat the problems.\n  The problem is we have too many people in this economy who have been \nunemployed for a long period of time. We need to get them back to work \nand get the economy growing faster than 1.9 percent a year. If we get \ngrowth back up to 3 or 4 percent a year, it will dramatically change \nthe future for middle-class families in this country, and that is what \nwe ought to be focused on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \nbipartisan agreement I have reached with five of our colleagues from \nacross the aisle Senators Heller, Collins, Portman, Murkowski, and Kirk \nto provide emergency unemployment insurance to 2.7 million Americans. \nThis commonsense, bipartisan agreement is one of the many things the \nSenate should do to help create jobs and strengthen our Nation's \neconomy so it works for every American, so everyone has a fair shot. So \nI hope my colleagues will join with us and pass this bill quickly so it \ncan be taken up for a vote in the House.\n  The individual and economic consequences of a lapse of these \nunemployment insurance funds are very clear. I have described many \ntimes, and my colleagues have come to the floor many times, and \nindicated the individual cases where people who have worked for years \nfound themselves without a job, through no fault of their own, \ndesperately needing some modest assistance--and these benefits are \nabout $300 to $350 a week--just to keep going, to keep looking for \nwork, to keep trying to be part of the workforce, which they \ndesperately want to do. We have shared these stories. These individual \nhardships ripple across our entire economy.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office and other economists looking \nat this, not from the individual perspective but from the overall \neconomy, find this is one of the most effective ways to keep the \neconomy moving forward. The CBO has indeed estimated our failure so far \nto extend benefits through 2014 would cost the economy 200,000 jobs. \nThat is simply as a result of these payments to individuals going right \nback into the economy. It stimulates other workers who have work and \ncreates demand.\n  So restoring economic assistance for Americans who have lost their \njobs and who are trying to find new ones is not only the right thing to \ndo, but it is also the smart thing to do for our economy. That is why I \nhave been pressing for an extension of these benefits over a longer \nperiod of time. But, we have reached a principled compromise--and I \nhave to underscore the word ``compromise''--to do it over a 5-month \nperiod, with some retroactive and some, if we move quickly enough, \nprospective. But it is frustrating to realize that some in Congress \ndon't want to do this. I think that is unfortunate not only because of \nthe effect it has on individual constituents but also because it is \ngoing to adversely affect our economy. It is not going to add jobs. In \nfact, as CBO suggests, it could indeed take away jobs.\n  Let me take a few moments to address some of the arguments being \nraised, particularly in the House of Representatives, as to why they \ncan't support this. Basically, it comes from the notion that: Well, \nthis is too hard to implement. Even if you concede these benefits are \nabsolutely important, they would provide economic stimulus, we just \ncan't implement them.\n\n  These concerns were highlighted by a letter from the National \nAssociation of State Workforce Agencies. But all of these concerns are \naddressable. Indeed, the Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, has addressed \nthese concerns point by point in a recent letter, and he has, \nimportantly, committed to work collaboratively with the States--as has \nbeen the case in all of the 12 extensions or expansions of this program \nsince the great recession--to do this.\n  We have repeatedly extended this program. There have been periods of \ntime where there has been a gap between extensions, and they have had \nto look backwards, these State administrators. Secretary Perez is \ncommitted to do all he can and have all the efforts of the Department \nso this can be implemented successfully, and I am confident it can and \nhe is confident it can.\n  But there were four basic assertions that were made that I want to \naddress.\n  First, NASWA indicated that, well, States are struggling with \nantiquated computer systems that make it hard to implement changes \nquickly. Well, the States have received over the past 5 years $345 \nmillion to modernize their unemployment insurance systems. That is \nFederal money going to States so they can fix their computer systems. \nSo this is not exactly an area we have neglected in terms of helping \nthem modernize their computer systems. Complex program changes we have \nmade in the past--I was part of the effort in 2012 to extend \nunemployment compensation benefits--and we made some significant \nchanges. We reduced the total number of weeks from 99 to 73.\n  So we are not talking today about some complicated new system; we are \nsimply extending the existing system. We are not changing the tiers. We \nare not changing any of the calculations they have to make. Indeed, \nthat is one of the reasons why I have been arguing consistently for a \nstraight extension--not altering the number of weeks you qualify for \ntier 1 or tier 2 or tier 3, but simply taking the system that was in \nplace on December 28, and fund it retroactively to benefit those who \nhave lost their benefits unexpectedly, and then prospectively as far \nforward as we could go.\n  Let me also point out that I was making this request before December \n28. I would have hoped we could have moved in December or at least \nearly in January to go ahead and extend this program so there would be \nabsolutely no disruption whatsoever to the States or for the \nrecipients. But it has been a difficult and long process to get here. \nFrankly, without the collaboration and efforts of many of my \ncolleagues, and particularly, as I have indicated, my Republican \ncolleagues--Senators Heller, Collins, Portman, Murkowski, and Kirk--and \nmy Democratic colleagues, including Senator Booker, who is here, we \nwould not be at this point. So I am glad we are here. But we would not \nhave any of these implementation problems had we acted in December.\n  Second, there was a concern that one provision relating to Federal \nfunding for the administration of the program could be read in an \noverly broad fashion so that the State agencies would be so confused \nand it would be so complicated they could not function. So out of an \nabundance of caution, we have worked to address this. We have revised \nthe legislation we had proposed to clarify the particular provision so \nit could not be misconstrued.\n  In so doing, we make it crystal clear that the prohibition on the use \nof Federal funding is limited solely to eligibility determinations \nrelating to ensuring millionaires do not receive emergency unemployment \ninsurance benefits.\n  Third--and this is a related issue to the whole millionaire issue--\nthere was some concern it would be difficult to administer this \nprohibition. Well, in our legislation, we have a pretty straightforward \nrequirement that individuals certify their income in the preceding year \nwas not more than $1 million. This is a simple certification that I \nthink could be accomplished rather efficiently and quickly by the \nagencies. And the Secretary of Labor has committed to issuing guidance \nto help States with implementation, as the Department does when any new \nstatutory provision is enacted.\n  As I said before, the Secretary has assured all of the States that he \nis going to work to expeditiously and efficiently give them the tools \nto implement this program as soon as the Congress passes it and the \nPresident signs it.\n  Finally, there was a concern about the retroactivity. That challenge, \nas I said before, is why I and others pressed so hard to get this done \nprior to December 28 of last year. But even so, States were able to \nsuccessfully work with the Department of Labor during previous lapses \nto provide this aid to unemployed workers. We have had these situations \nbefore where there has been a disruption of benefits, and then we have \nrenewed the program several weeks later. And the Department of Labor is \nconfident these challenges can be overcome.\n  Frankly, all of these administrative challenges for the States seem \nto me to pale in comparison to the challenges\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nbeing faced by our constituents, who are in a job market where in some \nplaces there are three applicants for every job, in a job market where, \nif you have worked for 25 years, you are about 50 years old and you are \ncompeting with 25- and 30-year-olds who have gotten recent education. \nMaybe they have more high-tech skills and computer skills than you have \nin a market that is rapidly becoming more technologically oriented in \nterms of labor demand.\n  They are facing severe challenges. These resources are not lavish. \nThe idea that someone would not work because they are getting $300 a \nweek is difficult, I think, to imagine for many people, particularly \nthe people who have records of work for 10, 20, and 30 years. And what \nthey are doing with this money is putting it right back in our economy. \nMany are trying to hold on to their homes, and we have heard stories \nabout that. They are trying to put gas in the car. People have \ncontacted me indicating that they use it to keep their phones working \nbecause without a phone they cannot get the callback for the job \ninterview to go and find a job.\n  So this is something that I think has to be considered and, in my \nbook, weighs much more heavily than administrative issues, which the \nSecretary of Labor assures us will be dealt with, can be dealt with, \nand he will work with the States to make sure it is done effectively.\n  Let me conclude by thanking our Republican colleagues who have joined \nwith us. They have been extraordinarily thoughtful and collaborative. \nThey have really contributed in an atmosphere of exchanging ideas of \nthoughtful consideration. It is a model, I think, of how this Senate \nshould work more frequently, and I thank them and commend them. They \nhave done a great service for their constituents and for the economy \nand the country. Indeed, ultimately, many Americans will benefit \nthrough their great contribution.\n  So I will hope, as we come up to these procedural votes, that we can \nmove forward, and then we could move this expeditiously. Then we would \nhope the House would respond appropriately, and we can give some hope \nand give some confidence to people who are struggling to find jobs in \nthis very difficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nlegislation before the body. I urge the vote of all of my colleagues. \nThis legislation is a bipartisan effort led by Senators Menendez and \nCorker, the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It is very important.\n  Today the people of Ukraine will be watching the Senate and later the \nHouse as to whether we are going to give them initially the support \nthey need after their country has been dismembered by Vladimir Putin in \na blatant act of aggression that cannot go unresponded to.\n  A long time ago, 15 March 1938, Adolph Hitler made a speech to the \nViennese people from a balcony of the Hofburg Palace, in the background \nof the heroic statue of Archduke Karl. The crowd in the square \nHeldenplatz numbered several hundred thousand. Hitler's words on that \nday about the obligation he had to take care of the German-speaking \npeople and the German population in Austria is eerily reminiscent when \nwe look at the speech Vladimir Putin made as he announced the \nabsorption of Crimea into Russia.\n  I am not predicting we will have a World War III. I am predicting \nthat unless we act and act vigorously--and a lot more than this \nlegislation today--Vladimir Putin will be dramatically encouraged to \ntake further aggressive actions, whether it be in Eastern Ukraine, \nwhether it be Moldova, whether it be the Baltic countries, where he has \nalready put significant pressures. Or will we send a message to \nVladimir Putin that the cost of further aggression will not be matched \nwith the benefit?\n  Have no doubt about the ambitions of Vladimir Putin; that is, to \nrestore the Russian Empire. All of the illusions we had about him \nshould have finally been dispelled. He must be treated for what he is, \na KGB colonel who repeatedly stated the worst thing that happened in \nthe 20th century was the dismemberment of the then-Soviet Union.\n  What Vladimir Putin understands is strength. In the words of Ronald \nReagan, we can achieve ``peace through strength.'' This legislation is \na good start. It is important we get it done as quickly as possible, \nbut we have to understand he will never be our partner. He will always \ninsist on being our adversary, and he will continue, if unchecked, to \ncontinue that vision of his expansion of the old Russian Empire.\n  I predicted that Vladimir Putin would go into Ukraine because he \ncould not give up the Sevastopol naval base and access to the \nMediterranean. I do not know exactly what Vladimir Putin will do in \nEastern Ukraine as we speak, but there has been a buildup of Russian \nforces on the border of Ukraine and Russia.\n  This should disturb all of us. All of us should be disturbed. All of \nus should recognize that the kind of signal he gets in response to his \nlatest aggression will, in many ways, dictate his future behavior in \nthe coming days and weeks. There are many steps we need to take. We \nhave to support Ukraine. We have to give them the economic assistance \nthey need. We have to ensure that the March elections in Ukraine occur \non time, freely, and fairly.\n  We have to meet Ukraine's request for immediate military assistance. \nMilitary assistance is their first priority. What did this \nadministration do in response to their plea for the ability to defend \nthemselves? Send them MREs. That is the same thing we did in Syria. We \nnow have an MRE doctrine; that when a country is under threat, such as \nUkraine and other countries are, we send them MREs.\n  We need to send them defensive weapons, which we should have done \nwith Georgia back in the Bush administration when Vladimir Putin \nannexed South Ossetia and Abkhazia. His troops are there today.\n  We have to give them the military assistance, short term, and a long-\nterm military assistance program of training and equipping which, by \nthe way, we do with about 50 other countries in the world. It is not a \nbreakthrough.\n  When my friends and colleagues in the administration say it would be \nprovocative, what does it take to be further--the next time we provoke \nVladimir Putin, is it going to be Alaska? We have to support countries \nsuch as Moldova and Georgia. Moldova is not a member of NATO. \nTransnistria is occupied by 1,500 Russian troops as we speak.\n  We can see the same scenario taking place in Moldova as we have seen \ntake place in Crimea. The Baltic countries are under pressure, and \ncontinuing and increasing pressure from Russia, particularly where the \n``Russian-speaking'' population is, especially in Latvia and Estonia. \nWe have to expand sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, increase sanctions \nagainst Putin's sources of power, especially for corruption, target \ncorrupt people, push for an arms embargo against Russia, prevent \ndefense technology transfers, use the upcoming NATO summit to enlarge \nthe alliance, move the process for Georgia into a membership action \nplan, expand NATO cooperation with Ukraine, conduct significant \ncontingency plans within NATO to deter aggression, defend alliance \nmembers, especially along the eastern flank, strategically shift NATO \nmilitary assets eastward to support deterrence. All of these things and \nmore need to be done.\n\n  I wish to emphasize that does not mean American boots on the ground. \nI repeat. It does not mean American boots on the ground. So the \nresponse by some of my colleagues and those in the commentary community \nis that the American people do not want us to do it. Sixty-three \npercent of the American people say leave it alone. Sixty-one percent \nsay do not get involved in any way.\n  I understand that. There have been previous times in history where \nthe American people did not want to be involved. Yet leaders stepped \nforward.\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nLeaders explained to the American people why the United States has to \nbe involved. I notice that the President's approval rating on the \nhandling of foreign policy is sinking. I also understand the \ncontradiction that over 60 percent of the American people do not want \nthe United States engaged. That is because the American people have not \nbeen told what is at stake.\n  Neville Chamberlain, in 1938, when talking about Czechoslovakia, \nsaid: We are not going to send our young men to a country that they do \nnot speak our language and we do not know. Again, I am not predicting \nWorld War III, but I am predicting that Vladimir Putin will go as far \nas he thinks he can in order to realize his ambition, which he has \nstated on numerous occasions, to restore the Russian Empire.\n  What does Vladimir Putin understand? Strong alliances, reprisals, \nconsequences for misbehavior. That is what he would understand. This \nlegislation before us, which I hope is passed 100 to 0, will indicate \nthe first steps we are taking in response. I wish the President of the \nUnited States had not stated so clearly that we have now acquiesced to \nthe absorption of Crimea into Ukraine.\n  My message to the people of Ukraine is that in the Cold War it took a \nlong time. But we will never give up. We will never give up in our \nefforts to see that their country is fully restored, as guaranteed by a \nsolemn agreement when Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons inventory. \nAt the time they were the world's third largest nuclear power.\n  In return for giving that up, their security and territory integrity, \nincluding Crimea, was maintained. There are other countries that may \nhave nuclear weapons. What lesson do they take from this? Would \nVladimir Putin have invaded Crimea if Ukraine still had nuclear \nweapons? That is an interesting question. So the point is that we have \nseen a blatant act of aggression.\n  Sometimes I am astounded at the media reporting. An overwhelming \nmajority, 96 percent, voted for Crimea to be part of Russia. My \nfriends, 12 percent of the population of Ukraine are Tatars who were \ndeported by Joseph Stalin; half of them killed, and they were allowed \nto come back. I can guarantee you there is no one in that 12 percent of \nthe population who would ever vote to be part of Russia. It was a phony \nelection. There were no observers. I know of a poll taken a few months \nago that showed 53 percent of the people in Crimea wanted to be part of \nthe Ukraine. But the point is, here today, I hope we are beginning a \npath to, one, recognizing Vladimir Putin for what he is and what his \nambitions are; two, dedicating ourselves to supporting these countries, \nthese fledgling democracies--it has not been that long since the end of \nthe Cold War--to help them on the path as they move forward to \ndemocracy, particularly Ukraine, so we can help them rid that country \nof corruption, rid it of its dependency, long term, on energy supplies \nfrom Russia.\n  We can, over a relatively short period of time, months if not years--\nbut probably months--arrange it so we can supply Ukraine and other \nEuropean countries with energy to have them become independent of \nRussia.\n  Finally, I have no illusions about what the Europeans are going to \ndo. Very little, if anything. I have very little confidence in what \nthis administration is going to do. So it is up to the Congress. It is \nup to us to act and to act decisively and send a clear message. By \npassing this bill today, hopefully with the House getting it done as \nquickly as possible, we send a message to the people of Ukraine: We \nstand with you. We will help you. We will do everything we can to see, \nover time, the restoration of your nation, as we have in times of old. \nWe stand with you and we stand for freedom.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today the Senate will \nfinally adopt, after some unfortunate delays, urgent bipartisan aid and \nsanctions legislation on Ukraine developed with the cooperation of a \nnumber of committees here in the Senate, and constructed by Foreign \nRelations Committee Chairman Menendez and his ranking member, Senator \nCorker. Both are also distinguished senior members of the Banking \nCommittee, which I chair, and which has jurisdiction over the economic \nsanctions provided for in the bill. I am pleased to have been able to \nwork closely with them to ensure this sound result, including \nprovisions to impose targeted asset freeze sanctions against \nindividuals and businesses found by the President to have been \nresponsible for threats to the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and \nfor certain acts of corruption in Russia.\n  Once we pass this bill, I hope the House will act quickly to approve \nit and send it to the President for his signature. With this \nlegislation, Congress is providing the President with flexible new \ntools to make clear to President Putin and his allies that Russia's \nrecent moves against Ukraine are unacceptable, and that there will be \nan increasingly painful economic and political price to pay for these \nactions.\n  Economic sanctions are an important tool of American diplomacy. In \nIran, years of tough, comprehensive economic sanctions have helped \nfinally to bring Iran's leaders to the nuclear negotiating table. \nSanctions have been wielded effectively against Sudan, North Korea, \nYemen, former military and security officials in Burma, warlords in the \nCongo, and elsewhere. If developed in close consultation with \nadministration officials at Treasury and the State Department who are \nresponsible for implementing them, appropriately targeted, and applied \nmultilaterally, sanctions can be a potent tool in the President's \nforeign policy arsenal. In the case of Ukraine, they will serve both to \npunish former Ukrainian officials and others responsible for the \nviolence there, and to punish Russian officials for irresponsible \nbehavior. If wielded effectively, as part of a larger diplomatic and \npolitical strategy, they can also help to deter future aggressive \nactions by Russia against Ukraine.\n  That is why I support this legislation to provide critical economic \nand security assistance to Ukraine, and to provide new sanctions \nauthority to the President. I support it even though I am deeply \ndisappointed that opposition from some of my Republican colleagues here \nand in the House forced the removal of important International Monetary \nFund, IMF, reforms that had been included in earlier versions of the \nbill. Those reforms would have enabled the IMF to better implement the \neconomic aid and reform package it has developed with the new Ukrainian \nGovernment's leadership in recent weeks, which it announced yesterday. \nWe must get those reforms enacted as soon as possible, by other means.\n  This measure, along with the steps already taken by the President, \nthe multilateral aid and sanctions measures adopted by our allies, and \nthe economic stabilization package offered by the IMF should help to \nreduce tensions as this situation moves forward. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues not only to ensure Ukraine's stability but \nalso the security of all our allies in Europe and beyond.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member \nCorker for working so hard to perfect this legislation and move it \nquickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it and deliver on the promises this \nbody and this country have made to support the people of Ukraine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Russian invasion and annexation of \nCrimea is an affront to decent standards of international conduct. It \nis a violation of international law and of Russia's explicit commitment \nunder the 1994 Bucharest Memorandum to respect Ukraine's territorial \nintegrity. It has undermined the international order that has been put \nin place over the last 60 years to promote peace and stability.\n  President Putin and his advisers in Russia have resorted to these \nillegitimate actions in order to seize 10,000 square miles of Ukrainian \nterritory. Perhaps the Kremlin believes its robbery has paid off. If \nso, Putin and his advisers have miscalculated. And we will aid in the \ntask of making clear the costs of Russia's actions today with passage \nof this legislation.\n  This bill sends a message to the people of Ukraine and all those in \nEurope concerned about Russia's aggressive provocations. We provide \nimportant loan guarantees that will help stabilize a Ukrainian economy \nthat was struggling even before Russia's aggression. We authorize \nfunding to help the Ukrainian government provide the fundamental \nnecessities of democratic\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\ngovernance, including free and fair elections, strong civic \ninstitutions and protections against corruption. It will aid the \nUkrainian government in recovering assets stolen by its disgraced \nformer prime minister and other kleptocratic public officials. It will \nsupport Ukraine's efforts to free itself from captivity to Russian \nenergy supplies. And it provides for increased security cooperation \nwith Ukraine and with other nations in Central and Eastern Europe, \nincluding military assistance, training, and advice.\n  Passage of this bill would also send a strong message to Russia. It \nmandates sanctions and asset freezes that target Russian and Ukrainian \nindividuals responsible for the human rights abuses against peaceful \nprotesters in Kiev under the previous Ukrainian government. It also \ntargets those Russians or Ukrainians whose actions have undermined \nUkraine's territorial integrity.\n  By demonstrating our support for Ukraine and the other democratic \nnations of Central and Eastern Europe, and by taking action against the \nindividuals who have participated in Russia's aggression against \nUkraine, Congress can provide a key element in the broad, sustained, \nand energetic diplomatic approach this situation requires. The United \nStates must act together with our European allies and other nations \naround the world who have an interest in maintaining respect for \nestablished borders and international law. Key to exacting a high price \nfor Russia's actions is isolating Russia in the international \ncommunity.\n  While this legislation is important to accomplishing our goals, it \nmust be part of a sustained and, if necessary, intensifying effort in \nCongress, by the administration, and internationally. President Obama \nhas wisely refrained from responding to Russian provocation with \nactions that would further destabilize matters or work against \nUkraine's interests or our own. One important step in de-escalating the \ntension in Ukraine is the dispatch of international observers to \neastern Ukraine to monitor the ground truth and hopefully discourage \nfurther provocations. But, along with NATO, we have made clear that \nRussia's actions will not go without response. President Obama has \nstated that Russia will face an escalating diplomatic and economic \nresponse if it does not reverse its course. Russia should be under no \nillusion that the U.S. response to its actions ends today with the \npassage of this legislation. We must remain prepared to take additional \nsteps to ratchet up the pressure on Russia and to help stabilize \nEastern Europe.\n  Russia also should have no doubt that the United States and our NATO \nallies take seriously our responsibilities under article 5 of the NATO \ntreaty. Under article 5, an armed attack against any NATO ally is \nconsidered an attack against all members, and will draw any actions \ndeemed necessary to assist the ally under attack, which may include the \nuse of military force. Actions such as redeployment of military assets, \nadding aircraft to the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission and \nsurveillance flights over Poland and Romania are evidence that we take \nthose article 5 responsibilities seriously. And, as our NATO commander \nin Europe, General Breedlove, has said, if Russia continues such \nprovocative actions, ``we need to think about our allies, the \npositioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those \nforces in the alliance, such that we can be there to defend against \nit.''\n  And as this legislation makes clear, we will continue to enhance our \nsecurity cooperation with Ukraine and other Eastern European nations. \nOne important step will be for our uniformed military professionals to \nexpand their relationships with counterparts in Ukraine and other \nEastern European nations to help build the kind of capable, \nprofessional forces that can improve their security.\n  Some may wonder what these events in a distant land involving old \nterritorial disputes have to do with us as a nation. But Russia's \nblatant flouting of its commitments, of the territorial integrity of \nits European neighbors, and its trampling on the international order is \ndamaging to our security and to the values that define us.\n  By passing this legislation, supporting U.S. and international \nactions to impose consequences on Russia and reassure the nations of \nEastern Europe, and standing ready to take additional actions if \nrequired, we protect our interests and the interests of those who value \npeace and stability.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I rise today to speak about the bill we are going to vote \non at 12:15 p.m. relative to Ukraine.\n  First, I wish to say it speaks to the best of the Senate, where by \nworking together we are going to end with a bill that sends a very \nstrong signal to Russia but also to Ukraine in support and to the \nworld. I believe it will be done in an overwhelming fashion in the \nSenate today and hopefully later today or tomorrow in the House. It is \nexactly what we should be doing at this time.\n  First, I thank Senator Menendez for the way he marshaled this through \nthe committee. I was pleased to work with him as ranking member.\n  I know our original piece of legislation had in it the IMF reforms \nthat I strongly support. It was evident that the IMF reforms were not \ngoing to make it through the House and actually become law.\n  We all felt it was incredibly important that all of us speak in a \nunited voice to push back on Russia's illegal actions in Crimea and \npotentially in Ukraine but also to do what we really need to do to \nsupport our friends in Ukraine and in the region. This bill does that. \nIt passed out of committee with strong bipartisan support. My sense is \ntoday it will pass out of the Senate with incredibly strong bipartisan \nsupport. It will become law soon and will tremendously reinforce the \nway our Nation feels about what Russia is doing in such an illegal \nfashion--that was outmoded centuries ago--and support the people of \nUkraine.\n  All of us know this bill provides economic support for Ukraine. We \nall know they are entering into an agreement with the IMF. The IMF is \ngoing to be providing some loans to help move them through the problems \nthey have had. They have tremendous corruption in their country. They \nuse far too much energy. They have massive deficits. Through working \nwith the IMF and signing on to agreements, ultimately they will be \nforced as a nation to move ahead and to orient themselves toward \nstronger countries or toward the West and operate in a more \ndemocratically free manner and certainly in a way that would allow them \nto economically sustain themselves over time.\n  In this bill we also provide additional loan guarantee support, which \nthey will need. They are facing extreme difficulties. I believe people \nknow that recently they have agreed to charge their citizens twice as \nmuch for natural gas usage there to try to get their budgets back in \nbalance. But it is very important that we send this signal and this \nstrength of economic health through this $1 billion loan guarantee, \nwhich is a part of this bill today.\n  Another important part is sending a strong signal to Putin and to \nRussia. If they feel they have no price to pay for the activities they \nhave already undertaken, they will continue to do more.\n  What this bill allows us to do is show strong support for what the \nadministration has already done but, in addition to that, to make these \nsanctions mandatory and actually add additional elements should Russia \ncontinue to do the things they are doing in such a terrible way.\n  I do want to say relative to the sanctions--I appreciate the \nExecutive order the President signed the other day that gave them the \nability to put sectoral sanctions in place. The energy sector, the \nbanking sector, and other sectors of the economy can now be targeted \nwith sanctions.\n  I understand the balance that has to be put in place with sanctions \nwhere if we throw in everything but the kitchen sink on the front end, \nthen Russia really has nothing to lose by going on into Ukraine. So we \nwant to calibrate those in a way that deters their behavior but also \ngives them the ability to de-escalate.\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\n  I will say that I do think the President's comments over the past \nseveral days in Europe have seemed cautious, have seemed timid. What I \nhope the administration will do very soon is turn up the volume \ndramatically and actually send some strong sanctions into some of these \nsectors--into the energy and banking sectors. We don't have to do all \nof the companies in those areas, but if we were to do that especially \nwith three or four additional banks in Russia, it would send a strong \nsignal to their economy, continue to weaken their economy and to show \nPutin there is a heavy price to pay for the activities he is engaged in \nand may engage in further relative to Ukraine itself.\n  I encourage the administration to step ahead stronger. The European \nUnion follows our lead, let's face it. If we act in a timid, cautious \nway, they are going to do the same. I think everybody in this body \nknows we do about $40 billion worth of trade annually with Russia, but \nthe European Union community does $450 billion worth of trade. \nGenerally, we are trying to work in unison, but if we as a nation act \nin a timid way, it encourages them as multiple countries to do the \nsame.\n  Again, I do hope we will turn up the volume, and I do hope we will go \nahead and sanction some additional entities in Russia. There are many \nstate-owned enterprises there. We all know that. That is one problem \nwith the Russian economy right now. I think we all know they are really \nan autocratic petrostate. We know that they are not doing well, that \ntheir budget is based on the fact that oil sells at $110 per barrel, \nand that really that is mostly their economy.\n  Again, what we need to do as a nation--we are supporting the \nadministration in this bill. We are supporting Ukraine with this bill. \nWe are also authorizing some assistance to some of our allies in the \nregion. We are also authorizing some democracy assistance. The bill has \nno fiscal areas that are not paid for. This is a great piece of \nlegislation.\n  I do hope that over time Senator Reid will allow us to revisit the \nissue because, let's face it, we created this piece of legislation \nabout 2 weeks ago. The events in Ukraine continue to unfold. So I hope \nwe will come back again as changes occur. I know there are many people \nin this body who are actually trying to put additional pieces of \nlegislation into place not only to sanction Russia even more fully, not \nonly to assist Ukraine in other than economic ways, but also to use \nsome of the strategic assets we have as a nation not only to benefit \nour economy but also to help our allies in the region so that they are \nnot really subject to the economic extortion we have seen Russia try to \ncarry out with our friends and also try to carry out with Ukraine, \nwhich this bill is all about.\n  I close by thanking Senator Menendez.\n  I thank Senator Reid for filing cloture on a bill that came out of \nthe committee immediately so we would be in a place today to deal with \nthis.\n  I thank Senator McConnell, who was able to work with Senator Reid and \nthe House to deal with this legislatively in a very creative way, using \na vehicle that came from the House and sending something back to the \nHouse so that this can become law very quickly.\n  I thank the House for cooperating with us on this bill because to \nhave a piece of legislation go out of the Senate today and likely \nbecome law very soon is something that takes a lot of coordination. I \nthank the leadership in the House for helping us make this happen.\n  I again thank the administration for their focus on this issue. I \nhope this bill will show strong support for some of the efforts that \nhave already taken place, and I do hope the administration will not \nundercalculate. I think that right now Putin doesn't yet know what he \nis going to do relative to South and Eastern Ukraine. I don't think he \nknows, and I think he is watching us and he is calibrating what his \nsteps are going to be based on the pain his own country will receive if \nthey take the wrong steps. It is very important that the President send \nadditional sanctions into Russia, send additional signals, and that we \nsend shock waves into their economy now--not everything we have to \nthrow at them but some of it--so they know that if they take additional \nsteps, real pain is on the way.\n  This bill supports those efforts of the administration, it supports \nUkraine, it pushes back on Russia, and it shows support for allies in \nthe region. It is a great piece of legislation. It is the first step. \nMore should come.\n  I am pleased we are at this point today. I thank all those involved, \nand I look forward to a very strong vote in the Senate at 12:15 p.m.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor as we are at a \nmoment of truth and a moment of incredible importance, and I wish to \nstart off by acknowledging the distinguished Republican ranking member \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, for the \nspirit in which we have worked together to marshal forces to bring \ncritical legislation to the floor at a critical time in history. This \nis the type of relationship we have had for the last 15 months, during \nwhich time we have often seen such partisanship, where on every major \npiece of legislation that has passed out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, it has passed on a strong bipartisan vote, and I \nappreciate his leadership and his working with us.\n  Let me reiterate what I have said on the Senate floor. President \nPutin is watching. He is waiting to see what we will do, waiting to see \nif we have the resolve to act, waiting to see if he has a green light \nto take the next step. I believe we need to act now and pass this \nlegislation, and I welcome the flexibility the House has shown in its \nresolve to move this quickly upon receipt.\n  Although I believe our response to Russia's annexation of Crimea \nshould have included IMF reforms to strengthen the U.S. role in the \ninternational community, that will not be the case, but we still need \nto act on this issue today. So I hope, in short order, we can have the \nIMF reform legislation on the floor and take a responsible vote on an \nimportant issue.\n  But let us be clear where we are at this moment. Let us be clear \nabout what happened in Ukraine over the last several years and what is \nhappening now as Ukraine simply looks westward. Former Ukrainian \nPresident Viktor Yanukovych was elected on a platform that advocated \ncloser ties to Europe. In fact, his first trip abroad was not to Moscow \nbut to Brussels to meet with European Union officials. For 3 years \nUkraine officials voted in good faith with their European counterparts. \nThey believed they did so with their President's support. Ukrainian \npublic opinion polls favored the conclusion of an agreement between the \nEU and the Ukraine that would increase trade and cooperation, allowing \nmore people, goods, services, and ideas to cross the border from the \nWest.\n  On November 21, Yanukovych flipped 180 degrees. He announced an end \nto talks with the European Union, and Ukrainians felt bitterly \nbetrayed. For 20 years, Ukraine has struggled to economically develop. \nThey have struggled to establish representative government. They have \nstruggled to achieve a stable way forward, a path of economic security \nand political democracy. The association agreement with the European \nUnion had promised a path toward those goals. So people were furious, \nand they took to the streets. They knew from personal experience what \nthe world now knows--that Yanukovych and his government and his family \nhad stolen tens of billions of dollars from Ukrainian taxpayers, \njeopardizing the solvency and independence of their country to support \na lavish lifestyle while the public went without.\n  The people who took to the Maidan Square in the freezing cold were \nsimply looking westward. They believed the European Union was their \nlast best hope to break the cycle of corruption. They knew their future \nwas being stolen. So they marched and they took beatings from \nYanukovych's paramilitary forces, not for a treaty but for the hope of \na better, more honest and free Ukraine that it promised.\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n  Putin resorted to outright extortion to keep Ukraine in his sphere of \ninfluence, essentially offering to buy Ukraine by offering Yanukovych \n$15 billion, and it would have worked but for the uprising of the \nUkrainian people who realized this was a Faustian bargain and that \nPutin was the devil, not their savior.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians demonstrated for 3 months to call \nfor the President's resignation. On February 22 of this year, President \nYanukovych fled to Russia and an interim government was installed in \nUkraine.\n  Almost immediately, Russian forces took control of the Crimean \nPeninsula, a clear violation of international law and Russia's own \ncommitments under the Budapest agreement and the Helsinki Final Act. \nThis demands a swift and coordinated and powerful response from the \ninternational community and from this Congress. It demands a message to \nPutin of our resolve and to the Ukrainian people of our support.\n  That message came, in part, on March 13, when the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee passed, by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 3, the \nSupport for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic \nStability of Ukraine Act of 2014.\n  In addition to providing $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine to \nprovide crucial support to stabilize Ukraine's economy, this \nlegislation authorizes assistance for democracy, governance, and civil \nsociety programs as well as for enhanced security cooperation. It \nprovides support to the Ukrainian Government to help recover access \nlinked to corruption by former President Yanukovych, his family, and \nother government officials.\n  It imposes sanctions against those who are responsible for violent \nhuman rights abuses against antigovernment protesters as well as those \nresponsible for undermining the peace, security, stability, sovereignty \nor territorial integrity of the Ukraine. It imposes asset freezes and \nvisa revocations on Russian officials and their associates who are \ncomplicit in or responsible for significant corruption in Ukraine and \nauthorizes sanctions against any Russian official engaged in corruption \nin the Ukraine or in Russia. Putin's cronies should recognize that \nPutin may not be the right horse to be betting on any longer. Finally, \nit sends a powerful message to Russia that there are consequences for \nusing force to annex sovereign territory against the established norms \nof the international community.\n\n  I will take one other moment to say that I have read some editorials \nsuggesting that Ukraine is not that important to us; that it is more \nimportant to Europe than it is to us, so what could be our interest. \nLet me offer a few observations of what the interest of the United \nStates is.\n  For some time we have been working to see Ukraine move to a \ndemocratic, stable government, looking westward, and in doing so \nstrengthening a big part of Eastern Europe at the end of the day in a \nway that strengthens the security of that region and the fiscal \nopportunities of that region.\n  We look at the Ukraine and we say to ourselves, well, they are not a \nNATO member. But other NATO allies--some of which I met with when I was \nin Brussels this past week--who are NATO members are watching and \nasking: What will Europe and the United States do in the face of \nRussian aggression? What is our ultimate security going to depend on? \nWe are a NATO member. We are, under article 5 of NATO's treaty, \nultimately supposed to be protected because we are committed to the \nprotection of all our other neighbors under NATO. Some of those \ncountries actually meet the full responsibility they have under NATO to \npay their quota for the collective defense.\n  So Ukraine is not a NATO member, but they are looking at what the \nWest's resolve is in the face of this aggression and the possibility of \nRussian forces moving further west, asking: Is NATO going to stand up \nfor me? That agreement is one of the fundamental institutions that has \ncreated security on the European Continent and for which America \ntwice--twice--sent its sons and daughters abroad to ultimately \nguarantee that security. We need to ensure that NATO continues to be a \nvibrant entity for the collective security of the United States and of \nEurope. This is another reason we are interested.\n  Thirdly, I would just simply say, as I have said on the Senate floor \nbefore, the world is watching. China is watching, and they are \nwondering what America and the West will do as they look at territories \nthey dispute with our allies--Japan and South Korea in the South China \nSea. They say: The West let Putin get away with this. Why should we not \ntake those territories? There will be no consequence. Or as we are \nnegotiating with Iran across the table to stop their nuclear weapons \nprogram, the Iranians look and ask: How much will the West punish \nRussia for this aggression, because if there isn't much consequence, \nthen why should I not try to get the maximum of this deal or not accept \nthe deal at all. Or North Korea, which wants to advance even further \nits missile program, which already possesses nuclear capability, what \nis their calculation?\n  I could go around the globe describing at this moment, beyond the \nUkraine, how the European Union and the United States acts will send a \nvery clear message to world actors, and that message hopefully will be \none of strength, because in doing so we may avert the consequences of \nsecurity challenges around the globe, avert the possibility we will \nhave to send our sons and daughters into harm's way if we act \ndecisively, if we act with strength.\n  That is the opportunity we have. The world is watching, and we must \nrise to the challenge. Passing this legislation goes a long way toward \nthat goal, and that is both the opportunity and the responsibility \nbefore the Senate. I urge my colleagues to speak with one voice.\n  I hope we get as near to unanimity as possible, as we have done at \nother times; for example, on the question of sanctions on Iran. This is \nsuch a moment. If the Senate speaks with one voice, I think President \nPutin will understand the consequences of miscalculating further. I \nhope that is the opportunity of which we will avail ourselves and, in \ndoing so, send a message beyond Putin to the rest of the world that we \nhave the resolve necessary to rise to such challenges.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask to be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I understand that this will be a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you Madam President. I want to thank my Senate \ncolleagues and Senator Risch for helping us get the next Administrator \nof the U.S. Small Business Administration to the floor.\n  First, I want to recognize everybody's thoughts and prayers here for \nOso and Darrington, WA, and for the people who have been hit by an \nunbelievable tragedy. Our hearts go out to this community and I want to \nsay that this has been a tremendous effort by first responders.\n  There are hundreds of volunteers, thousands of dollars of \ncontributions. And Darrington High School students made 1,300 \nsandwiches to try to support the research and recovery effort. I thank \nthem for all of their hard work.\n  One of the reasons I want to get a Small Business Administrator is \nbecause this agency is going to play a role in this recovery. I thank \nmy colleague, Senator Murray, for her help and support.\n  The Small Business Administration plays an important role for \ncommunities in disasters and the woman we have before us is a well-\nqualified woman who can help us with this crisis and continued small \nbusiness lending.\n  The SBA has been without an Administrator for 8 months, and it is \ncritical that we get this position filled today. We cannot forget that \nsmall businesses create two out of three new jobs in our country--and \nthe SBA provide $28 million small business assistance that helps them \ncreate more jobs.\n  So every single day we need to think about small businesses in our \ncommunity and how much we need to help and support them. Businesses, \nfrom Chobani Yogurt to Ben & Jerry's ice cream to Federal Express, have \nbenefited from the SBA program. To have somebody like Maria Contreras-\nSweet to be this person is critical for us.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support her in this nomination and to move \nforward on an SBA agenda. Everything from making sure we approve the \n504 program, to the STEP export assistance program, and to make sure \nthat we continue to make ground on exporting small business products--\nmade in the United States of America--to the growing middle-class \naround the globe.\n  I thank my colleagues and I urge them to support this nominee.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor Maria Contreras-Sweet--a woman eminently qualified to serve our \ncountry as the next administrator of the Small Business Administration.\n  Maria Contreras-Sweet is the right person to lead the SBA given her \ndistinguished record of public service and her deep understanding of \nthe challenges and needs facing small businesses today.\n  As the founder of ProAmerica Bank, the first Latino-owned business \nbank in California in over 30 years and a leading financial services \nprovider and SBA lender, she successfully expanded access to capital \nfor small- and medium-sized businesses that often lacked access to \nlarger, traditional financial institutions.\n  Just yesterday, my colleagues in the Hispanic Task Force and I met \nwith Latino business leaders from across the Nation, and the No. 1 \nissue that was raised by nearly everyone in the room was the need to \nassist minority entrepreneurs and small business owners with obtaining \nfinancing and access to capital--an essential function of the SBA, and \none that Maria-Contreras Sweet understands first-hand.\n  Her commitment to supporting small businesses owners embodies the \nentrepreneurial spirit that makes our country great--and is exactly the \nkind of leadership the SBA needs.\n  Maria Contreras-Sweet also has a proven track record as a dedicated \npublic servant. She previously served as secretary of the California \nBusiness, Transportation, and Housing Agency, where she was the driving \nforce behind major job creation and public investments in \ninfrastructure and housing.\n  As the first Latina to serve as a cabinet secretary in the state, she \nmanaged a budget of $14 billion and oversaw more than 40,000 employees. \nThis is truly a remarkable nominee who brings a wealth of knowledge and \nleadership to the Small Business Administration, as well as a \ncompelling personal story.\n  Maria Contreras-Sweet, like me, has humble beginnings. As a young \nchild, she immigrated to the United States from Guadalajara, Mexico. \nShe settled in California, where her mother worked long hours at a \nchicken packaging plant to support her and her five siblings. Her \nfamily did not speak any English when they arrived, and Maria has said \nthat it was precisely hearing no' so many times and seeing so many \ndoors close for them that prompted her to speak up for others, to fight \nto level the playing field for all, and to find a way to say yes' to \npeople with good ideas who can drive innovation who are all too often \noverlooked for the wrong reasons.\n  Maria Contreras-Sweet represents the promise of America, the \nfulfillment of the American Dream, and the expansion of this dream to \nmillions more entrepreneurs and small business owners across the \nNation. She is building wealth for American families and communities, \nand building pathways to growth and prosperity that extend far beyond \nthe business sector.\n  Maria Contreras-Sweet is the right nominee for the job. I applaud \nPresident Obama for selecting her to be our nation's next SBA \nadministrator, and I thank Leader Reid for moving quickly to confirm \nher nomination without delay. I'm very pleased the time has finally \ncome for good people like Maria Contreras-Sweet to get the up-or-down \nvote they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this qualified, competent \nnominee without hesitation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nMaria Contreras-Sweet to be Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration. The SBA Administrator plays an important role in \nhelping small businesses create jobs, mainly by making sure small \nbusinesses have access to capital. Ms. Contreras-Sweet is remarkably \nqualified for this position,\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nhaving founded and run a bank that focuses on making small and mid-size \nloans. She also served as the head of California's Business, \nTransportation and Housing Agency. The SBA will benefit from the \nvaluable insight Ms. Contreras-Sweet gained from this combination of \nexperience working directly with small businesses and administering a \nlarge government agency. The experience will serve her well as SBA \nAdministrator.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship I had the opportunity to engage Ms. Contreras-Sweet \nduring her confirmation hearing. She impressed me with her \nunderstanding of all that it takes to launch and run a successful small \nbusiness. She has the skills and the enthusiasm to help entrepreneurs \ndrive our economic growth and create jobs.\n  I am happy to support Ms. Contreras-Sweet's nomination and I look \nforward to working with her as the SBA Administrator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Maria Contreras-Sweet, of California, to be Administrator of the \nSmall Business Administration?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

No one can \nhear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is correct. The \nSenate is not in order. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \nbring their conversations to a close.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Twenty minutes ago the House passed by voice vote the 13-\nmonth patch of the SGR.\n  There was work done on a bipartisan basis by all Senators to get a \npermanent fix. We can only do what we can do. I have had a number of my \nRepublican colleagues come to me and say: We will do this, but you have \nto get the assurance of the Speaker that he would accept this, and the \nSpeaker would not accept what was being proposed. The original plan was \nmy idea and I am very disappointed it didn't work out, but I have been \ntrying to do it for 4 years, so I am not surprised. But it is no one's \nfault in the Senate.\n  We have a new chair of the Finance Committee. He has worked very hard \non a bipartisan basis to come up with a way to get rid of this SGR once \nand for all. We weren't able to do that.\n  So the patch we have is imperfect, but it is something that will take \ncare of things. I don't mean to be mean-spirited, but I am tired of \npeople saying you are taking care of the doctors but no one else. We \nare taking care of patients for the next 13 months--patients--and I \nthink that is extremely important. We have millions of people who have \ndoctors who take Medicare patients. For us not to do this would have \nbeen truly unfortunate.\n  I am disappointed we aren't able to get a permanent fix, but we have \nbeen able to do that. We should be very happy we have been able to do \nas well as we have done. I personally am not overjoyed about what is in \nthe bill, but I am satisfied with what is in the bill. I hope we can \nexpeditiously move and get this done today.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1793-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1793-S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VENEZUELA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, the reason I come to the floor is to call \nattention to a crisis that has fallen off the front pages over the last \nfew weeks; that is, the situation in our own hemisphere that is \noccurring in Venezuela. I recognize there have been news stories about \nan airplane that has been tragically potentially lost--or has been \nlost. We don't know the full outcome of that yet. I know the situation \nin Ukraine has captivated the attention of the public--and rightfully \nso--and I am pleased to see the Senate has taken important steps today \ntoward addressing that issue.\n  I wish to speak about something that is happening in our own \nbackyard, in our own hemisphere; in fact, something that is impacting \nhundreds of thousands of people who live in Florida because they have \nfamily members who still live in the country of Venezuela.\n  Since February 4 of this year, Venezuelans have been taking to the \nstreets to complain about their government. These Venezuelans are from \nall walks of life, but they have truly been motivated by young people, \nby students.\n  The origins of this public discontent are important to understand \nbecause they are not just purely political. It in fact has to do with \nthe dysfunction and the failures of the government that is currently in \ncharge of that country. The statistics bear out that dysfunction and \ntheir failures. For example, violence and insecurity is among the \nhighest in the entire Western Hemisphere. The murder rate in Venezuela \nwas 79 per 100,000 people in 2013.\n  In the city of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, the murder rate is \nactually almost double that. It is 122 per 100,000, making it one of \nthe most dangerous cities on Earth. The unbridled corruption that \nexists in terms of how State assets are used--Venezuela is an oil-rich \ncountry. There are individuals in that government who have empowered \nthemselves of Venezuela's oil, not their oil, and are basically giving \nit away to countries such as Cuba and others and using it as their own \npersonal piggy bank for personal enrichment and to fund their \ngovernmental operations at the expense of the people of Venezuela.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\n  Their inflation rate is 57 percent. In fact, this week Fitch ratings \nlowered Venezuela's sovereign debt rating into junk territory from B-\nplus to B. They warned, by the way, that further downgrades are on the \nway.\n  There is also this unprecedented scarcity of basic goods, including \nfood staples; even things such as toilet paper there is a shortage of. \nI will show some graphics. This is a line of people waiting in the city \nof San Cristobal to go into a supermarket. We are talking about a rich \ncountry. This is not a Third World country. This is not a nation that \nis poor. This is a revenue-rich nation, among the most resource rich on \nthe planet. Here is a line of people waiting to go into a grocery \nstore, reminiscent of Cuba, for example, a country whose model this \ngovernment follows, and we will talk about that more in a moment.\n  Let me show my colleagues a picture of some store shelves inside a \nVenezuelan supermarket: completely empty, nothing on the shelves. This \nis the economic reality of the failure of the Maduro-Chavez government \nin Venezuela today, and this is why, among other reasons, people have \ntaken to the streets to demonstrate.\n  There was another catalyst: a sexual assault that occurred on a \ncollege campus, and students were protesting against law enforcement's \nunwillingness to address that assault. The government cracked down--but \nnot on the sexual assaulters, not on the perpetrators, on the \ndemonstrators.\n  All of these things we have talked about--the failure of that State, \nthe lack of democratic opening, the political abuses, the corruption, \nand the economic disaster of the Venezuelan Government--led to \ndemonstrations that began on February 4 and continue throughout the \ncountry.\n  I want to show you a picture of what those demonstrations looked \nlike. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people took to the \nstreets to protest, and they were protesting the things I have outlined \nalready: the insecurity, the violence, the scarcity of basic goods, the \nlack of opportunity, the political repression.\n  Meanwhile, Nicolas Maduro, the President of that country, and all of \nhis cronies live a life of luxury--and we are going to talk about that \nmore in a moment--because this government is surrounded by individuals \nwho are living lives of luxury not just in Venezuela but in Florida.\n  While the people take to the streets--and you saw the empty store \nshelves--there are people tied to the Government in Venezuela buying \ngold-plated iPads--I did not even know there was such a thing--in Miami \nand investing in enormous properties and mansions, with the money they \nare stealing, with the help of the Maduro government, from the people \nof Venezuela, leading to these protests.\n  So what has been the response of the Maduro government? What has been \nthe response to these legitimate complaints about what is happening in \nVenezuela?\n  I am going to show you some images of what the response has been from \nthe government.\n  Here is the first. Here is their national guard. Here is their \nnational guard battling with students in the streets, fully equipped \nwith riot gear, ready to battle against them. This has been their \nresponse: repression at every turn in multiple cities.\n  Here is the other response: teargas--teargas by a fully armored \nindividual, firing teargas canisters into the crowd.\n  Let me talk about the teargas for a moment. Let me show you this \ncanister. This canister that was used against peaceful protesters \nactually has a marking. It says: ``HECHO EN BRASIL''--``MADE IN \nBRAZIL.'' And there have been reports, in fact, that there has been \nsome U.S.-manufactured teargas being used against protesters in the \nstreets in Venezuela.\n  But if it stopped at teargas, it would be one thing. But it has not \nstopped at teargas. In fact, it is now known that the Interior Ministry \nof Venezuela authorized snipers to travel to Tachira State and fire on \ndemonstrators.\n  Here is a picture of a government official, of a law enforcement or \narmy or national guard individual, or an Interior Ministry individual \non a rooftop with a rifle and a scope aiming into a crowd.\n  Here is a picture of a sniper. It does not end there. Those are not \nthe only pictures we have.\n  Here are more pictures of more snipers on rooftops.\n  Here is another sniper aiming into the crowd, with a spotter next to \nhim.\n  Here is another blown-up picture of the same sniper.\n  These are government-sponsored individuals. What civilized planet on \nEarth sends the national guard and the interior ministry of their own \ngovernment, of their own country, with snipers to fire on their own \npeople who are demonstrating because of the lack of freedoms and \nopportunity and economic degradation that exists in a country?\n  They cannot deny this. Here are pictures, taken by demonstrators \nthemselves, of the snipers ready to shoot down people. In fact, 36 \npeople have lost their lives.\n  But it does not end just with the government snipers. Because what \nthe government is trying to do here to hide their involvement is they \nhave organized these progovernment militia groups, basically--these \nmilitant groups that they hide behind. These groups do not wear \nuniforms. They are called ``colectivos.'' They drive around the city on \nmotorcycles, and they assault protesters. They break in and vandalize \ntheir homes. They have weapons that they use to shoot into the crowds \nand kill or harm people.\n  There are three main groups. By the way, these groups began under \nHugo Chavez's reign, and these groups are actually organized around a \nconcept that has existed for years in Cuba--these committees to defend \nthe revolution. These are neighborhood groups, so they know your \nfamily, they know who you are, they are always watching, and they \norganize themselves into armed militias. The government's claim is: \nWell, these groups are on their own. We are not coordinating with them. \nBut, in fact, there have been multiple reports that these groups \ncoordinate with the national guard to take down barricades set up by \nprotesters, to break into the homes of protesters, to vandalize homes, \nto terrorize people, and to kill.\n  There are three main groups that I want to point out, these \ncolectivos.\n  La Piedrita is one of them. It is based in a working-class \nneighborhood of Caracas. It has a far-left ideology. It is armed. It is \ncomprised of radicals who claim to be willing to die for their \nrevolutionary ideals--whatever those are.\n  In January, this group, by the way, tweeted that Henrique Capriles--\nthe opposition party's nominee for President in the last elections--is \na racist and a fascist and accused him of intending to launch attacks \non the poor and on impoverished neighborhoods.\n  Another colectivo: the Patriotic Force of National Liberation. This \ngroup bases its beliefs on the teachings of a leftist revolutionary and \nmurderer by the name of Che Guevara.\n  A third group is the Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement. This is an \narmed communist political and militant organization that also operates \nout of Caracas.\n  These are just three of these armed, un-uniformed, thuggish, criminal \ngroups that operate under the auspices and at the direction of the \ngovernment of Nicolas Maduro and the people who surround him.\n  So what is the result?\n  The result is there have been over 1,800 people detained in Venezuela \nsince this began last month. Over 450 people have been injured. Over 50 \npeople have been tortured while detained--that we have reports on. And \nover 36 people have been killed.\n  This is not happening on a continent halfway around the world. This \nis happening in our hemisphere, right now, in real time. And these \nnumbers, they just summarize the depth and the scope and the breadth of \nwhat is happening in the regime's brutality in Venezuela.\n  But these are not just statistics. Behind every single one of these--\nbehind the 36 who have been killed, behind the 1,800 who have been \ndetained, behind the 450 who have been injured--are real people, with \nnames and families and fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and \nchildren. I want to tell you the story of a couple of them.\n  The first is Marvinia Jimenez. Here in this picture you see her on \nher knees as part of a peaceful protest. And here you see an armed \nindividual with a pistol pointed at her. She is on her knees\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nand poses no threat. She has given herself up as a peaceful protester, \nas she confronts an armed individual associated with the government \nholding a pistol.\n  What happened next in these pictures is these armed individuals from \nthe Interior Ministry grabbed her by the wrist and head. They \nsubsequently throw her to the ground. And here is what they do when she \nis on the ground. This individual here--a female, a member of the \nInterior Ministry--takes off her helmet and proceeds to beat her in the \nhead with that helmet.\n  Here is the picture. This is real. This is not a movie. This is \nhappening. This is happening now.\n  This happened to Marvinia Jimenez, and luckily someone caught it on \ntheir phone and was able to capture these images.\n  These are uniformed individuals associated with the government. You \nsaw she had given herself up and was on her knees. And this is what \nhappens: She gets beaten in the face with a helmet.\n  She lived to tell her story. But there are others who have not been \nso fortunate.\n  Here is Geraldine Moreno. She was a college student in the city of \nValencia.\n  On February 19, she stepped outside of her home to see what was going \non during an antigovernment protest. Six national guard members--six \nnational guard members of the Maduro government--came by on motorcycles \nto break up the protest.\n  As the demonstrators fled, they fired into the crowd, and she was hit \nby gunfire and fell to the ground. She struggled to get up, and just \nthen one of the national guard members came up and shot her in the face \nat point blank range and killed her.\n  Geraldine was someone's daughter. In fact, she was not just anyone's \ndaughter, she was Rosa Orozco's daughter, and Rosa has lost her \ndaughter forever.\n  This is the youth of Venezuela. This is supposed to be Venezuela's \nfuture, and they are being indiscriminately mowed down in the street by \nthe government of their own country.\n  There are some inspiring stories too.\n  As shown in this picture, this is Maria Corina Machado, a member of \nthe Venezuelan opposition party in Parliament. She was here in \nWashington this week. She has bravely spoken out against these things \ngoing on in Venezuela, and bravely, the Government of Panama gave her \nthe space to speak out on behalf of the people of Venezuela at a recent \nOAS meeting. But, shamefully, the rest of the countries that are \nmembers of the OAS--not the United States or Canada but every other \ncountry did nothing to defend her right to speak, and she was denied \nthe right to tell the world the truth about what is happening.\n  She could have stayed in exile and asked for political asylum, but do \nyou know what this brave young woman did? She got on an airplane and \nflew back to Venezuela--to her country--to continue the fight there, \npeacefully, as a member of their Parliament, as a member of the \nopposition party.\n  Well, when she arrived, she was immediately detained at the airport \nin Caracas. She was questioned by the thugs you just saw, who no doubt \ntried to intimidate her in that questioning. She was verbally attacked \nby government supporters at the airport. And then she got in her car to \nleave, to go to her destination, and these same thugs tried to run her \ncar off the road. They are so incompetent that they could not even \ncarry that out, thankfully. She finally made it to her destination.\n  And then guess what happens this week. The speaker of their so-called \nNational Assembly--an individual by the name of Diosdado Cabello--a \nMaduro loyalist, a criminal--decided to remove her, to basically just \nexpel her from the National Assembly. She is no longer a member of the \nNational Assembly--unilaterally dismissed by the equivalent of their \nAssembly's president, their speaker.\n  The OAS's response to this has been shameful. The Organization of \nAmerican States has been downright embarrassing and shameful. I thought \nit was best summarized by the opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who \nwrote in the New York Times on March 25:\n\n       The outspoken response from human rights organizations is \n     in sharp contrast to the shameful silence from many of \n     Venezuela's neighbors in Latin America. The Organization of \n     American States, which represents nations in the Western \n     Hemisphere, has abstained from any real leadership on the \n     current crisis of human rights and the looming specter of a \n     failed state, even though it was formed precisely to address \n     issues like these.\n\n  Why do we even need an OAS--an organization of democratically elected \ngovernments--why do we even need it, why are we even members of it, why \ndo we even contribute funds of American taxpayers towards it, if it \ncannot meet and address systemic human rights abuses such as these?\n  I am less than pleased, by the way, with our own government's \nreaction. This is not a partisan issue, but I have to say this. \nPresident Obama has expressed he is concerned about this. To his \ncredit, the Vice President was stronger in condemning the Maduro \nregime.\n  We are not just concerned about this. We should be outraged about \nthis. Just as we are outraged when things go wrong in other parts of \nthe world and weigh in with sanctions--and we should--and our voices--\nand we should--this is happening in our own hemisphere, right \nunderneath our nose. And it is shameful that the leadership of our \ngovernment has so far not done more to address this. But we can change \nthat, and I am hoping that we will.\n  What I hope to do over the next few days is to propose specific \nsanctions against individuals and companies associated with the Maduro \nregime so they know there are consequences for what is happening here. \nAnd you think our sanctions have an impact on Russia in its violations \nof Ukrainian sovereignty? Sanctions against Maduro and his government \nwould have a dramatic impact. Because all those people who are around \nhim who are getting rich off this regime, who are supporting these \nabuses so they can stay in power and keep making money, they all have \nbank accounts and property and restaurants and businesses and mansions \nin the United States of America. And if you support this, this \ngovernment should sanction you.\n  I ask what I did a few weeks ago in a speech on this subject: If the \nUnited States of America will not stand up and be a strong voice on \nbehalf of people who all they seek is freedom and liberty that our own \nfounding documents say belong to all people--rights given to them by \ntheir Creator--if the United States of America will not be a forceful \nvoice, what nation on Earth will? They look to us. Our own model of \nfreedom and our Republic inspires people. We say we stand for these \nprinciples. We need to defend them when they are threatened, especially \nin our own backyard.\n  So I hope in the weeks to come we can pursue these targeted sanctions \nagainst some of these individuals associated with the government, like \nthe Assembly president Diosdado Cabello, and others such as these \nindividuals who we will come on the floor in the next few weeks and \nidentify by name, those who benefit from the systematic violation of \nhuman rights in Venezuela, who are stealing money from the Venezuelan \npeople, who are using the resources of that nation to enrich \nthemselves. In the next few weeks, we will identify them by name and \nthe properties they own and the assets they hold in our own Nation.\n  But I implore my colleagues not to ignore this issue. This is \nhappening right now, right in our own backyard, in our own hemisphere, \nand it is impacting real people at an extraordinary price.\n  So I hope in the weeks to come that I--along with Senator Menendez \nand others who have united behind us and with us--will be able to \nconvince enough of my colleagues to take the next step.\n  We have already unanimously passed the resolution condemning all of \nthis. I thank my colleagues in the Senate for that. The next step is to \nbuild in real consequences for being a part of this. My colleagues will \nhave an opportunity to be a part of this in the next few days, \nespecially when we return next week.\n  I hope we can get a hearing on these sanctions in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and I hope we can get passage of it on the floor, \nso we can send a clear signal to the people of Venezuela: The people of \nthe United States of America are on your side. We support your cause. \nWe will not forget what you are going through. We will not abandon your \naspirations. We stand for the liberty and the freedom of all people, \nincluding those who do not live here with us.\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\n  This is what we are going to have a chance to do in the next few \ndays. I hope we can successfully take action.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I was not planning this today, but as \nmany of my colleagues do, I do a morning coffee where anybody from my \nState of Ohio--as Senator Durbin does in Illinois, Senator Udall in New \nMexico, and others--and my colleague from Ohio does one too, Senator \nPortman--people can come in from around the State and talk about what \nthey want.\n  A couple came in today, a father and a mother and two children. One \nlooked to be maybe 10 and the other looked to be maybe 15. They came \nand wanted to talk to me about their private school. They have sort of \na home school association, it sounded like, from a conservative part of \nOhio, Southwest Ohio. We talked about what we could do to help them in \nterms of educating their children.\n  Then, right before we parted--and I was going to see other people at \nthis coffee; we had maybe 75 people there--the mother of these two \nchildren said: By the way, thank you for the Affordable Care Act.\n  I said: How is that?\n  She pointed to her son. She said: My son--I think he was 15. She \nsaid: My son is diabetic. As I learned later, he was diagnosed at the \nage of 6 and has injected insulin into his arm and his leg for 8 or 9 \nyears. She said: My son who is diabetic, we could not get insurance \nbecause of my son's preexisting condition, diabetes. We were turned \ndown--I counted them. We were turned down 34 times for insurance. My \nfamily was turned down 34 times for insurance. Because of the \nAffordable Care Act we now have health insurance.\n  She smiled. That is one of the most poignant stories I have heard \nabout the importance of this new law. There are 160,000 people in my \nState who now have insurance that did not have it in December. But this \nfamily--you think about what this is all about. This family's peace of \nmind, this family's ability to focus on other things now, because they \nhave insurance that they could not get, even though he had a job--the \nfather had a job--I am not sure where the mother worked.\n  But the point is, they were turned down, she said, 34 times because \ntheir son cost the insurance more money because he had a preexisting \ncondition with diabetes. So I guess my question to my colleagues is, \nwhy do we want to repeal this? How do my colleagues, including many, \nmany elected officials in my State who before have been resistant to \nthe Affordable Care Act to win elections, saying: Repeal the Affordable \nCare Act--how do they explain that to this family--if they met this \nfamily and the mother said: We have insurance; we were turned down 34 \ntimes. Why do you want to repeal this law? Why do you want to take it \naway from the 160,000 Ohioans who have insurance? Why do you want to do \nthat to the 100,000 25-, 22-, and 19-year-olds in Ohio--in my State \nalone, one State of the 50 where 100,000 young people have insurance \nand they are on their parent's plan because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Some 900,000 Ohio seniors have gotten check-ups, no copay, no \ndeductibles, free checkups, free osteoporosis screenings, and free \nphysicals because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  How do you take that away from those seniors? How do you take away \nthe $900 in savings that the average senior in my State, who is on \nthis--President Bush's, initially--drug plan, the Medicare drug plan? \nHow do you take away that $900 savings? You are going to repeal \nObamaCare? You are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take \nthose away? How do you face the people like the family I met today? \nThirty-four times she was turned down for insurance. I did not make \nthis up. That is her number. She said: I counted; 34 times they turned \nour family down for insurance because my child has diabetes. How do you \nthink that makes him feel, first of all. But equally importantly, she \nhas the comfort and safety in her mind now of having insurance.\n  I do not even understand. What do my colleagues do? Do they wake up \nevery morning thinking: I want to take that insurance from 150,000 Ohio \nfamilies; I do not want them to have it; I want to take those benefits \nfrom those 900,000 Ohio seniors. I want to make them pay $900 more.\n  That is what they are saying: Repeal ObamaCare.\n  We lose all of that, if they want to keep talking about taking these \nbenefits away. Let's live with this law. Let's make it work well. It is \nstarting to work really well in Ohio. We are having thousands of sign-\nups every single day. I know in the Presiding Officer's State of \nHawaii, they are getting lots of people to sign up. Lots of young \npeople are signing up. Let's move on. Let's stop debating this. Help \nmake it work better. Let's talk about how we create jobs, not how you \nare going to repeal some health care law that you did not like because \nit did not fit with your ideology or you did not like the President--\nwhatever the reason my colleagues seem to not like the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  History is going to say over and over: Why do you want to take these \nbenefits away? This is working. Remember back with Medicare in 1965. \nThey were not the tea party. They were called the John Birch Society \nback then. They did not like it. Insurance companies did not like it. \nBut everybody liked it 5 years later.\n  Social Security--the same forces, the same far right forces opposed \nit. Five years later, people liked it. This stuff works. It is going to \nmake such a difference in people's lives. Forget about the 150,000. \nForget about the numbers. Focus on that family--34 times turned down \nfor insurance. She has insurance now. Her diabetic son can get the care \nhe needs. That is such a wonderful thing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering Petty Officer Mark Mayo\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I rise to speak about the tragic death of a fellow \nMarylander, PO2 Mark Mayo. His heroic sacrifice is the truest display \nof the U.S. Navy's core values of honor, courage, and commitment. The \nU.S. Navy confirmed yesterday that PO2 Mark Mayo put himself in harm's \nway to save his shipmate. On behalf of a grateful nation and on behalf \nof my fellow Senators, I offer condolences to the families, friends, \nand shipmates of Petty Officer Mayo.\n  The tragic events this past Monday evening are still under \ninvestigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, but what we \nknow so far is that at approximately 11:20 p.m. there was a shooting on \nboard the destroyer Mahan.\n  A civilian who was behaving erratically approached the Mahan's \nquarterdeck and was confronted by the ship's petty officer of the \nwatch. The two engaged in a struggle and the civilian was able to \ndisarm the sailor.\n  Petty Officer Mayo, serving as the chief of the guard, witnessed the \nfight and ran to the quarterdeck and placed himself between the \ncivilian and his shipmate, the petty officer of the watch. The civilian \nopened fire and fatally wounded Petty Officer Mayo.\n  U.S. Navy CAPT Robert Clark, Norfolk Naval Station's commanding \nofficer, said:\n\n       Petty Officer Mayo's actions were nothing less than heroic; \n     he selflessly gave his own life to ensure the safety of the \n     sailors on board.\n\n  Petty Officer Mayo's parents, Sharon Blair and Decondi Mayo, said \ntheir son's actions reflected his strong, caring nature. As his mother \nput it: ``He protected people. He was a protector.''\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n  Petty Officer Mayo was born in Washington, DC, and moved with his \nfamily to Hagerstown, MD, in 1998. He enlisted in the Navy in 2007, 4 \nmonths after graduating from Williamsport High School, where he was a \nWashington County wrestling champion, because he wanted to serve his \ncountry and because the Navy offers educational opportunities. He \nenlisted in the Navy, and he reported to Naval Station Norfolk in May \nof 2011. Petty Officer Mayo's mother, who is a geriatric nursing \nassistant, said he always wanted to work in law enforcement.\n  Randy Longnecker, Petty Officer Mayo's former guidance counselor at \nWilliamsport High School, recalled him as a kind and easygoing student \nwho earned good grades, saying:\n\n       He always wanted to make sure he was doing the right thing. \n     He liked athletics and being part of a team. He must have \n     fallen in love with the Navy.\n\n  Petty Officer Mayo served tours of duty in Rota, Spain, and in \nBahrain. He earned the Good Conduct Award, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas \nService Ribbon. He was a distinguished member of the Navy.\n  Americans are privileged and fortunate to have such brave and \noutstanding young men and women serving in our Armed Forces. We must \nnever forget the sacrifices they and their families make on our behalf \nin defense of freedom.\n  Petty Officer Mayo has made the ultimate sacrifice. While his death \nis tragic, we should remember and honor the way he lived and how he \nvoluntarily chose to save a fellow sailor from harm. He is an American \nhero.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Owens Nomination\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I rise to discuss the nomination of John Owens to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Owens, who currently works as a lawyer in California, has been \nnominated to fill the seat that has been held for the last 25 years by \nJudge Stephen Trott of Idaho.\n  Judge Trott took senior status on December 31, 2004, making the Trott \nseat the longest current vacancy of any seat on the Federal circuit \ncourts.\n  That doesn't mean that there haven't been previous attempts to fill \nthis seat. In a letter to the Idaho Senate delegation in 2003, then \nWhite House Counsel Alberto Gonzales stated:\n\n       I also want to make clear the President's commitment to \n     nominate an Idahoan for a second Ninth Circuit seat if Judge \n     Trott retires or assumes senior status while President Bush \n     is still in office. Idaho has had two Ninth Circuit seats for \n     more than a decade, and that allotment is appropriate.\n\n  As such, when Judge Trott did take senior status the following year, \nPresident Bush nominated Judge Randy Smith of Idaho to the Trott seat. \nAt the same time another nominee was pending in the Senate to fill \nanother Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Regrettably, Senate Democrats used the longstanding Senate rules that \nwere available at that time to block the confirmation of both Idaho \nnominees. The reason given by the California delegation for blocking \nthe Randy Smith nomination to the Trott seat made clear that the \nobjections had nothing to do with Judge Smith's qualifications and that \nthey were willing to support his confirmation to the other Idaho seat, \nthe Nelson seat, which is ultimately what happened.\n  As such, the California delegation blocked Randy Smith's nomination \nto the Trott seat, not because they believed he was not qualified but \nbecause they wanted the seat moved to California--and he was not a \nCalifornian.\n  The so-called Trott seat on the Ninth Circuit has been held by five \ndifferent judges, including Judge Trott, since it was first created in \n1935.\n  The first judge to hold that seat was from Oregon. The next two \njudges to hold that seat were from Washington State. Judge Sneed of \nCalifornia, the only judge in that seat to maintain his chambers in \nCalifornia, was the next to hold the seat. Finally, as I mentioned \nearlier, Judge Trott was the next to hold that seat, and he has \nmaintained his chambers in Idaho for his entire 25 years on the bench.\n  Despite the fact that California already has more than 20--that is \nright, more than 20--active and senior judges on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the California delegation apparently believes that \nCalifornians have been denied justice for the past 25 years and that \nthe only remedy is to add yet another California judge, leaving the \nState of Idaho with only one, single active judgeship on the Ninth \nCircuit. Senator Risch and I had multiple conversations with the White \nHouse counsel in President Obama's first term where we expressed our \ninterest in working with the White House and the California delegation \nto reach a resolution to this long-standing dispute in a way that would \nsatisfy both delegations.\n  Clearly, the Idaho delegation and the Idaho people are disappointed \nby the President's decision to decline to nominate an Idahoan to fill \nthe Trott seat.\n  It is even more disappointing that declining to submit any nominee \nfor the Trott seat in his entire first term, the President has chosen \nto wait until the Senate Democrats unilaterally broke the longstanding \nSenate rules regarding the consideration of nominees in order to push \nthrough this nomination, rather than working with the Idaho and \nCalifornia delegations to develop a mutually agreeable solution.\n  If these new Senate rules had been in place when Judge Trott first \ntook senior status, the California delegation would not have had the \nopportunity it took advantage of to block the appointment of Idaho \nnominees to this seat.\n  This dispute is not about the qualifications of Mr. Owens. He has \nbeen rated unanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association, \nand I would be happy to work with the California delegation to support \nhis nomination for the next California vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\n  But I cannot support a process that is the result of an unfair \nbreaking of the Senate's rules in order to push through a nominee that \ntakes away a seat that has been an Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit for \n25 years, leaving Idaho with only one seat on the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Sadly, because of the Senate Democrats' rule change, the Idaho \ndelegation will not have the opportunity to stop this effort.\n  Therefore, I will vote no on this nomination, and my hope is that, if \nconfirmed, Mr. Owens will make the same decision that Judge Trott did \n25 years ago by also choosing to maintain his chambers in Idaho.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I have come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of John Owens to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. This was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee without dissent.\n  I would like to quickly mention his qualifications. He received his \nbachelor's with high distinction from the University of California in \n1993 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated first in his \nclass at Stanford Law School in 1996.\n  From 1996 to 1997 he was law clerk to Judge J. Clifford Wallace, a \nnoted conservative jurist appointed by President Nixon to the Ninth \nCircuit. He then went on to serve as a law clerk to Supreme Court \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  In 2001 John Owens became a Federal prosecutor, joining the U.S. \nAttorney's Office in Los Angeles, California. He began in the general \ncrimes section, prosecuting a wide variety of violent crimes--drug \ncrimes. He also served in the public corruption and government fraud \nsection.\n  From 2004 to 2012, he served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in San \nDiego.\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\nThere, primarily his focus was prosecuting complex crimes, including \nfraud, health care, money laundering, public corruption, and national \nsecurity.\n  He has had occasion to receive more than one award, among them the \nDirector's Award for Superior Performance from the Justice Department. \nMr. Owens has broad support, and the American Bar Association has given \nhim their highest rating of ``well qualified.''\n  The problem that has arisen around this nomination, though, is not \nreally his qualifications because the record will bear those \nqualifications out. It is the longstanding discussion over the seat \nvacated by Judge Stephen Trott. There is a history here, and I would \nlike to explain it.\n  This seat has been vacant for over 9 years--since Judge Trott took \nsenior status in December 2004. It is the longest running vacancy in \nthe entire Federal judiciary. The Ninth Circuit has the greatest number \nof pending appeals per panel. It takes longer than other circuits to \nresolve an appeal. It makes no sense for this seat on the busiest \ncircuit to stay vacant any longer.\n  My colleagues from Idaho have asserted that this is a vacancy which \nshould be filled by someone from their State. Let me explain why that \nis not the case.\n  Judge Trott, whom Mr. Owens would replace, spent his entire legal \ncareer in California before joining the Justice Department under \nPresident Reagan. Throughout his career he was licensed to practice law \nin one State--California. Beginning in 1965 he served as county \nprosecutor in Los Angeles. In 1975 he sought the position of DA from \nthe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors after then-district \nattorney Joseph Busch passed away. When John Van De Kamp was named \ndistrict attorney, Trott was chosen as his chief deputy, the second in \ncommand in the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. In 1981 \nPresident Reagan appointed Mr. Trott to be U.S. attorney for the \nCentral District of California.\n  All these things are happening in California. He was recommended for \nthe U.S. attorney position by Senator S.I. Hayakawa of California.\n  In 1982, while serving as U.S. attorney, he again submitted an \napplication to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to become DA \nafter the DA, John Van De Kamp, was elected to be California's attorney \ngeneral.\n  Trott was nominated by President Reagan in 1983 to serve as Assistant \nAttorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of \nJustice. At his confirmation hearing for that position, Senator Pete \nWilson of California introduced him. Judge Trott's official Judiciary \nCommittee biography states that his legal residence at the time was \nCalifornia.\n  Now, this is all about whether Trott occupies an Idaho seat or a \nCalifornia seat.\n  In 1986 he was nominated by President Reagan to be Associate Attorney \nGeneral. Once again Senator Wilson of California introduced him at his \nconfirmation hearing, and once again his official Judiciary Committee \nbiography states that his legal residence at the time was California.\n  In 1987 President Reagan nominated Trott to the Ninth Circuit. The \nJudiciary Committee sent blue slips to Senators Wilson and Cranston of \nCalifornia. That is the point. The point is that historically Judge \nTrott has occupied a California seat. He stated in his committee \nquestionnaire that his ``two clients have been the People of the State \nof California and the Government of the United States.''\n  Judge Trott was confirmed in 1988 to a seat previously held by Judge \nJoseph Sneed, a California nominee. That judge's connection to the \nNinth Circuit prior to his appointment was his 9-year tenure as \nprofessor at Stanford Law School. Judge Sneed established his chambers \nin San Francisco. These are the facts.\n  Judge Trott was a California nominee to a California seat on the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, as was his predecessor. Once confirmed, \nhowever, Judge Trott made a personal choice to establish his chambers \nin Idaho. This personal choice--essentially an arbitrary occurrence--\ncannot result in a State losing a judgeship to another State.\n  As we all know, the overwhelming practice of administrations and \nSenates of both parties has been to retain each State's representation \non its respective circuit. Just look at the makeup of the circuits \nrepresented by the members of the Judiciary Committee. Both Iowans on \nthe Eighth Circuit occupy Iowa seats. Three Alabamians on the Eleventh \nCircuit occupy Alabama seats. All of the Texas judges on the Fifth \nCircuit, who are not the first occupants of their seats, were preceded \nby Texans. The Senate recently confirmed Carolyn McHugh to the Tenth \nCircuit. Judge McHugh was strongly supported by Senators Hatch and Lee, \nand she replaced Michael Murphy, who had been a Utah nominee.\n  I could go through the history of each circuit, and the same pattern \nwould emerge time after time. This is not by accident. There is a \nreason for it. Presidents of either party must know which Senators to \nconsult, and Senators must know which vacancies to make recommendations \nfor.\n  This might sound like inside baseball to some, but it is fundamental \nto the Senate's advice and consent role, and no Senator of either party \nwould allow the arbitrary occurrence of a judge's personal choice of \nresidence to remove a judgeship from the Senator's home State. This is \na precedent this body cannot allow to be set.\n  Some might accuse California of trying to take more than its share of \nseats. This is simply not so. There is no objective reason for the \nTrott seat to be transferred to Idaho, where Judge N. Randy Smith \nalready occupies that State's seat on the circuit.\n  By every metric--population, appeals generated, district court \ncaseload--California has far less than its proportional share of \ncircuit judgeships and Idaho already has its fair share. In fact, if \nIdaho were to get an additional judgeship, its representation on the \nNinth Circuit would be 5\\1/2\\ times its share of caseload. That is \nridiculous. Idaho would have twice as many seats as Montana and the \nState of our Presiding Officer, Hawaii, have even though those States \ngenerate more Ninth Circuit cases than Idaho. Nothing supports removing \nthis seat from California to Idaho--not history, not population, not \ncaseload. Nothing.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: I don't begrudge the Senators from \nIdaho seeking additional Federal judicial resources for their State. \nSenators Crapo and Risch have introduced a bill to create a new \njudgeship on the Federal district court in Idaho. I represent four \njudicial districts that virtually always have caseloads at judicial \nemergency levels. One of them--the Eastern District of California--is \nthe most overburdened judicial district in the country and has a \ncaseload that is more than double the national average. So I understand \nthe desire of the Senators from Idaho to ensure that a sufficient \nnumber of Federal judges are present in their State to resolve the \ndisputes of their constituents. In fact, I am a cosponsor of the \nFederal Judgeship Act of 2013, which would create all the new \njudgeships recommended by the Judicial Conference, including one for \nIdaho. But the fact remains this seat on the Ninth Circuit was \npreviously held by two Californians and it should be filled by a \nCalifornian. I very much hope the Californian will be John Owens, who \nhas an impeccable record, bipartisan support, and whom I am proud to \nhave recommended to President Obama, and whom I would urge my \ncolleagues to support.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are once again spending unnecessary \nfloor time overcoming a procedural obstacle so we can move to an up-or-\ndown vote on a judicial nomination. John Owens is nominated to fill the \nlongest open vacancy on our Federal courts. For more than 9 years, the \nbusiest circuit court in our Nation--the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit--has been running at less than full strength. In 2013, \nthe Ninth Circuit had 12,761 appeals filed, several thousand more \nappeals than the next busiest circuit. It also had 14,171 appeals \npending, three times more than the next busiest circuit. Each judge in \nthat circuit has nearly 525 appeals pending per active judge. That is \nnearly 70 more appeals pending per active judge than the next busiest \ncircuit. These caseloads are not sustainable and the delay in resolving \nthese appeals hurts the American people. We should and must approve Mr.\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\nOwens's nomination, along with Michelle Friedland's nomination to the \nNinth Circuit, as soon as possible.\n  Mr. Owens was first nominated last August and his early October \nhearing date had to be moved after Republicans forced a shutdown of our \ngovernment. A hearing on his nomination was finally held in late \nOctober. Mr. Owens could and should have been confirmed before we \nadjourned last year. Instead, because Republicans refused to consent to \nhold any nominations in the Senate, every single one had to be returned \nto the President at the end of last year. They then had to be re-\nnominated and re-processed through committee this year and Mr. Owens \nwas voted out of committee on a voice vote, without dissent, on January \n16, 2014.\n  Mr. Owens is among six circuit nominees pending on the Senate floor. \nWe last voted on a circuit nominee during the last work period in early \nMarch and before that we voted on a circuit court nominee in early \nJanuary. If Republicans continue to obstruct the Senate from having up-\nor-down votes on uncontroversial judicial nominees, at our current pace \nof filing cloture petitions once every month or so, we will not have \ntime this year to vote on even those who are currently pending on the \nSenate floor.\n  We have not had a vote on a judicial nomination this year that was \nnot subject to a Republican filibuster. For all but two Republican \nSenators, I have started to notice a pattern of voting to end \nfilibusters only if a nominee is from a State with at least one \nRepublican home State Senator. Most recently this happened yesterday on \nthe cloture vote for Judge Edward Smith of Pennsylvania. It should not \nrequire a judicial nominee to be from a State with one or more \nRepublican home State Senators for some Senators to do the right thing. \nFilling vacancies so that our Federal judiciary can be fully \nfunctioning should not be a partisan issue.\n  Born in Washington, DC, Mr. Owens earned his B.A., with high \ndistinction, from the University of California, Berkeley, and his J.D., \nwith distinction, Order of the Coif, from Stanford Law School. At \nStanford, he was the Nathan Abbott Scholar, an award given to the \nstudent with the highest cumulative point average in the class. Mr. \nOwens served as executive editor of the Stanford Law Review where he \nearned the Stanford Law Review Board of Editors Award.\n  After law school, Mr. Owens served as a law clerk to Judge J. \nClifford Wallace of the Ninth Circuit and for Associate Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court. He has been a \nlitigator in both public and private practice. In 1998, he joined the \nU.S. Department of Justice, where he would later serve as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney for the Central District of California and the Southern \nDistrict of California. In 2008, Mr. Owens was promoted to serve as the \nDeputy Chief of Major Frauds in the Southern District office and later \nthe Chief of the Criminal Division. In 2012, he rejoined private \npractice as a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson where he presently \nworks. Over the course of his legal career, he has been counsel of \nrecord in more than 20 cases before the court on which he is nominated \nto serve.\n  Mr. Owens has the support of his home State Senators--Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer. I hope my fellow Senators will join me \ntoday to vote to end the filibuster of Mr. Owen's nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1799-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 400, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 400) recognizing the 50th anniversary \n     of the Great Alaska Earthquake, which struck the State of \n     Alaska at 5:36 p.m. on Good Friday, March 27, 1964, honoring \n     those who lost their lives in the Great Alaska Earthquake and \n     associated tsunamis, and expressing continued support for \n     research on earthquake and tsunami prediction and mitigation \n     strategies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, over the past several days we have \nall watched the news of the massive landslide in Washington State. We \nhave watched that with sadness, with shock--truly an awful, awful \nepisode. Our hearts, our prayers are certainly with all of those who \nhave been affected by this terrible tragedy. We continue to hope for \nthe best as rescue and recovery efforts continue.\n  Today I have come to the floor to speak about a different natural \ndisaster. This is a natural disaster that affected Alaska on Good \nFriday exactly 50 years ago today, in 1964. This is the Great Alaska \nEarthquake, the Good Friday Earthquake, the epic earthquake of 1964.\n  At the time that Alaska was struck by this massive earthquake, I was \na young child. I was living in the southeastern community of Wrangell, \nAK. I have a map here, a map of the State of Alaska. The epicenter of \nthe earthquake is here in the south central area. About a year prior to \nthe quake, my family and I moved down to the small southeastern \ncommunity of Wrangell, tucked safely in the inland passage waterways \nhere.\n  We were all looking forward to Easter. When the earthquake hit, I \ncertainly did not know that we had been struck by a massive, massive \n9.2 earthquake of the magnitude on the Richter scale that decimated \nsouthcentral Alaska. The earthquake struck at 5:36 in the evening. I \ndid not know that what had just occurred was the largest earthquake to \nstrike the United States in recorded history. It is the second largest \nearthquake ever recorded on modern instrumentation.\n  Those of us who lived in Alaska at the time have memories of what \nhappened on Good Friday 50 years ago. We have stories that will live \nwith us for generations and passed down from generation to generation. \nYou can talk to Alaskans about it: Where were you in the quake of 1964?\n  We had just moved, as I said, from Anchorage to Wrangell, AK. We did \nnot feel the shake in Wrangell. We waited\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nfor the big waves to come. We waited for the tsunami. We sat listening \nto the radio. But our home was situated directly on the beach. Everyone \nwas told to move up to higher ground. So we moved everybody in the \nfamily, five kids at the time, up the hill. We went to my first grade \nteacher's house, which was really quite exciting for me.\n  We were allowed to stay up late into the evening. As a small child, \nthere was a buzz. It was kind of exciting but kind of scary because we \ndid not know what was happening in other parts of the State. My mom had \nbasically packed some diapers for the smallest of the children in the \nfamily. She tells me that she brought along her silver tea set. That is \nthe only thing that she brought from the house, along with the five \nkids.\n  We also tell the story of the home that we lived in just before we \nhad moved to Wrangell. It was situated in a residential area called \nTurnagain. Turnagain was the area that was immediately and massively \nhit.\n  This is the Turnagain neighborhood. Our home that we lived in prior \nto moving to Wrangell was situated about two blocks back from the \nbluff. After the earthquake, the bluff slid down taking tens and tens \nof houses with it. The home that we were in then became bluff property. \nIt was condemned never to be lived in again.\n  We all have stories of the earthquake. We saw the news accounts as \nthey came slowly to us. We saw the photographs of the collapsed \nbuildings.\n  I am going to go back to the first picture here. This first one that \nwas up initially is downtown Anchorage, AK, 1964. This is on Fourth \nAvenue. You can see from the picture the ground just sunk, dropped--the \ncrumpled buildings, the cars cattywumpus.\n  The destruction and the devastation in the downtown area literally \ntook your breath away. One very photographed picture was the J.C. \nPenney building which had just recently been constructed. The whole \nfront facade of the J.C. Penney building just crashed down onto the \nstreets and onto the cars below.\n  This is a picture here of Government Hill Elementary School. I showed \nyou the previous picture where my family and I had lived in the \nneighborhood at Turnagain when I was a child. When my husband and I \nbought our home, where our sons were raised, it was directly across the \nstreet from this property where Government Hill Elementary literally \nslid down the hill.\n  As you can see from the picture there, the devastation to the school \nwas extraordinary. Fortunately, it was 5:36 in the evening on Good \nFriday, and there were no children at the school. But the devastation, \nthe visual impact that still remains as we look back 50 years now at \nwhat happened--the stories of loss of property, of damage to property, \nthe stories of loss of life and truly miraculous survival--slowly \nstarted to reveal the extent of the destruction from an earthquake that \nFederal scientists would tell us years later was roughly equivalent to \n100 million tons of TNT exploding--massive.\n  The Good Friday Earthquake reshaped the Alaska landscape. Land was \nlifted 33 feet in some places, and then in other places it sank in the \nground--sank as much as 6 feet in places. Cliffs and buildings \ncrumbled, forests and towns were flooded. Huge waves approximately 200 \nfeet high were measured near the community of Valdez. A 200-foot wall \nof water was coming into the community of Valdez. Communities were \nliterally washed off the map in Anchorage.\n  This is a picture here of Seward, which again is in Resurrection Bay \nalong the coast, but the waves literally came in and swept everything \nout with it. But it was not just one wave. It was a series of waves. \nAnchorage, which is our State's most populous city and really the \ncenter of infrastructure in the State, was just 74 miles from the \nepicenter of the quake.\n  That is where we see so many pictures of the tremendous damage there. \nThere has been a series of articles in our local newspaper, the \nAnchorage Daily News, leading up to this historic 50th anniversary. It \nis a series written by Mike Dunham. I ask unanimous consent that a \nportion of these series be printed in the Record.\n  But in the series discussing the tsunamis that hit Alaska, I would \nlike to share with my colleagues some of the information that Mike \noutlined. He said NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center puts the \ntotal number of deaths resulting from the Great Alaska Earthquake of \n1964 at 139. Fifteen of those deaths are attributed to falling \nbuildings or crumbling ground during the quake itself. The rest were \nkilled by the water. Thirty-two people died when a wave 30-feet high \nbuilt up in Valdez. Similar-sized waves took 12 lives in Seward, and 15 \nin Kodiak and its surrounding villages. Another dozen perished when a \nwall of water 40-feet high smashed into Whittier in the Prince William \nSound village of Chenega. One-third of the population, 23 people, were \nswept away by a 90-foot wave.\n  One thing that I found very fascinating in understanding some of the \nattributes of this earthquake and the tsunamis that came is that in \nmany places the ground was still shaking when the water hit. Keep in \nmind, this earthquake lasted 4\\1/2\\ minutes--4\\1/2\\ minutes where the \nearth is lurching and shuddering and shaking. That is a horribly long \ntime.\n  The first tsunami that hit Valdez, I am told, hit just 2 minutes \nafter the quake had begun. So imagine the terror. You have got the \nground moving all around you, up and down, lurching back and forth, and \n2 minutes into it, you have a tsunami at your doorstep.\n  The loss of life from the tsunamis did not stop at the Alaska border, \nthough. Four children died in Beverly Beach State Park in Oregon; 12 \npeople died in California, mostly in the waves that destroyed Crescent \nCity's harbor.\n  But we know that it could have been much worse. The death toll was \nlow for an earthquake of this magnitude. As I mentioned, it was after \nwork. It was on a holiday.\n  It occurred in an area with a small population that constructed \nbuildings from wood, not bricks or other heavier materials. But the \nGood Friday Earthquake and the subsequent tsunamis that followed caused \nsome $3.75 billion in damage and that is in today's dollars. This is 50 \nyears ago, so $3.75 billion is amazing.\n  Also, consider this was largely done to a State that was barely 5 \nyears old, but the impacts reached far beyond Alaska. Tsunamis also \ncaused damage to many of our Pacific neighbors, including Canada, \nWashington, Oregon, California, Washington, and Hawaii.\n  Those tsunamis destroyed everything in their path. They destroyed \nhouses, cars, boats, and fishing gear all along the Pacific coast. In \nOcean City, WA, a bridge over the Copalis River collapsed. In Crescent \nCity, CA, a dockside tavern was destroyed. In Hilo, HI, 12.5 foot waves \noverran the waterfront. Seiches, which are seismically induced water \nwaves in rivers, lakes, bayous, and harbors, caused minor damage. It \nwasn't extensive damage, but it caused damage along the gulf coasts of \nLouisiana and Texas. Think about how this massive earthquake \nreverberated around the world.\n  If we look again to the map that has the epicenter, we would think \nthe extent would only be where the epicenter lines, the falt limits go, \nbut in fact when we account for the tsunami effect, it truly was an \namazing instance where Mother Nature came together in a massive and a \nviolent way.\n  As we think about the devastation, the loss of life, the lost \nproperty, we have to ask the question whether anything good can come \nfrom a tragedy such as the Good Friday Earthquake, but I think the \nanswer is ultimately yes. We came together, Alaskans came together in \nthe aftermath of the quake and the tsunamis to help rebuild the worst \nhit communities. We rebuilt them to withstand earthquakes and in \nlocations that are hopefully protected from the ravages of future \ntsunamis. We set aside parks to remember the historic earthquake and to \nprevent future building on landslide-prone cliffs. Out of the \ndevastation we did gain a better understanding of what is happening \nbelow the surface in Alaska and other earthquake-prone areas.\n  In the 1960s we had very little information about what caused the \nmassive shifts in the Good Friday Earthquake. There was very little \nunderstanding of the giant tectonic plates that make up the surface of \nthe Earth and how their movement causes earthquakes. The 1964 \nearthquake resulted in greater seismic monitoring across the country\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nand has led scientists to have a far better understanding of how \nearthquakes occur and where they occur. We can now better protect our \ncitizens by implementing better building codes and preparing for \nearthquake disaster response in earthquake-prone regions, thereby \nreducing the chance that another earthquake would result in so many \ndeaths.\n  The tsunamis that were spawned by the Good Friday Earthquake provided \nscientists with a unique and important set of tsunami arrival times and \nheights that have been used to validate new models of tsunami \npropagation. These models have allowed our scientists and emergency \nauthorities to warn coastal populations of potential tsunamis, \nprotecting life and property.\n  We see these exercises and drills conducted certainly in my State, I \nknow in Hawaii, and in our coastal communities.\n  The science has come a long way in the past 50 years and Alaska has \ntoo. As we mark this historic anniversary, we remember those who \nperished in the Good Friday Earthquake.\n  We salute the men and women who help protect our safety by monitoring \nand researching earthquakes and tsunamis, both in our State and in \nothers. We thank the first responders who helped Alaskans in 1964, just \nas we thank those who are helping with the recovery in Washington \ntoday. Let us also use this occasion to consider whether we ourselves \nare prepared for the worst should we ever face a similar day of \nreckoning in the future.\n  To recognize this historic event, I have submitted a Senate \nresolution that commemorates the Great Alaska Earthquake. My colleague \nfrom Alaska, Senator Begich, and my colleagues from Oregon, California, \nand Hawaii have joined me.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Anchorage Daily News, Mar. 24, 2014]\n\n Tsunamis: Warning Systems Improved Since Great Alaska Earthquake but \n                            Unlikely To Help\n\n                            (By Mike Dunham)\n\n       NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center puts the total \n     number of deaths resulting from the Great Alaska Earthquake \n     of 1964 at 139. Fifteen of those deaths are attributed to \n     falling buildings or crumbling ground during the quake \n     itself.\n       The rest were killed by water.\n       Thirty-two people died when a wave 30 feet high boiled up \n     in Port Valdez. Similar sized waves took 12 lives in Seward \n     and 15 in Kodiak and its surrounding villages. Another dozen \n     perished when a wall of water 40 feet high smashed into \n     Whittier. In the Prince William Sound village of Chenega, a \n     third of the population--23 people--was swept away by a 90-\n     foot wave.\n       Smaller numbers of casualties were reported in scattered \n     settlements across the region, from Cape St. Elias to Port \n     Nellie Juan. One death took place at Shoup Bay on Valdez Arm, \n     where the wave may have splashed 220 feet up the Chugach \n     mountains.\n       In many places, the ground was still shaking as the water \n     hit.\n       ``We have this picture in our heads that first an \n     earthquake happens, then the tsunami comes,'' said Mike West, \n     State Seismologist at the Alaska Earthquake Information \n     Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ``But in \n     Alaska's fiords, something else happens.''\n       In the second biggest earthquake ever recorded, that \n     ``something else'' was massive.\n       ``The entire floor of Prince William Sound failed,'' said \n     Cindi Preller, Tsunami Program Manager for NOAA Alaska \n     Region. ``It was chaos.''\n\n\n                              WAVE TRAINS\n\n       There are different kinds of tsunamis and the 1964 \n     earthquake set off a variety of them.\n       One was a general global splashing generated by the \n     magnitude of the quake. The 1964 event was so strong that it \n     made the whole world ``ring like a bell,'' reads a U.S. \n     Geological Survey pamphlet. Vibrations shook the planet for \n     weeks and caused measurable sloshing as far away as Florida. \n     Shifts in water levels were recorded in 47 states, including \n     land-locked ones. Even in South Africa--about as far from \n     Alaska as one can get--fluctuations in well water were noted.\n       One type of tsunami produced by the earthquake, seiche \n     waves, caused no casualties, but they were violent enough to \n     sink boats in Louisiana. Seiche action refers to standing \n     waves in enclosed or confined water. They can be caused in \n     different ways. Those caused by seismic disruptions can occur \n     in places with no direct connection to bodies of water near \n     the source of an earthquake.\n       Tectonic tsunamis are created directly by the shock of a \n     fracture. They tend to come in a series of waves rather than \n     a single surge, like the ripples formed when you plunk a rock \n     into a calm pool and the displaced water spreads out in \n     rings.\n       In the case of an undersea fracture, the displacement of \n     the water comes from below. University of Alaska Anchorage \n     geology professor Kristine Crossen said the sudden upthrust \n     at one spot of Prince William Sound was so large that it took \n     two minutes for the water to run off it.\n       ``When the ocean bottom is moved, it sets up a wave \n     train,'' said Peter Haeussler, U.S. Geological Survey \n     research geologist.\n       These trains can travel thousands of miles at speeds of 500 \n     miles an hour. In the deep water of the open ocean they seem \n     small. But as they enter shallow water near shore, they grow \n     slower and taller.\n       Current thinking is that, in 1964, tectonic waves were \n     generated from two areas in the massive rupture, said \n     Preller. One was near the epicenter, where the quake began, \n     in northern Prince William Sound. The other was near Kodiak, \n     hundreds of miles away. These waves took lives and leveled \n     buildings from Alaska to California, often in concert with \n     the most lethal kind of wave to emanate from the 1964 quake, \n     landslide tsunamis.\n       These happen when the earthquake causes an avalanche. \n     That's what happened in Lituya Bay in Glacier Bay National \n     Park on July 9, 1958. Tumbling rock and ice sent up a \n     megatsunami 1,720 feet high, the largest wave recorded in \n     modern times.\n       The steep, mile-high mountains we see above ground \n     throughout the southern coast of Alaska are mirrored by a \n     similar submarine geography, where slopes can be further \n     encumbered by millions of years of volcanic residue, glacial \n     silt and other muck. A strong shake can send incalculable \n     tons of material tumbling underwater, unseen and undetected \n     until the displaced ocean shoots into the air.\n       ``Those are really devilish,'' West said. ``And they're not \n     currently predictable.''\n\n\n                              SUDDEN DEATH\n\n       Valdez was founded during the gold rush on glacial fill and \n     alluvial deposits surrounded by precipitous mountains. The \n     ground at the old townsite was flat and easy to build on and \n     ran right to the edge of a deep water port.\n       When the earthquake began, the delta deposits liquified. A \n     mile of waterfront slumped into the bottom of the harbor, \n     pushing water toward the open sea.\n       A home movie taken from the deck of the freighter Chena, \n     tied to the city dock at the time of the quake, shows the \n     400-foot ship sinking into a giant hole in the water, the \n     bottom of the harbor exposed. Then, with ferocious frothing, \n     the ocean crashes back.\n       Those on the dock--citizens, curious children and workers--\n     were killed in the first seconds of the quake. Amazingly, the \n     Chena rode out the surge that carried it into the town and \n     left it high and dry--temporarily. New waves hit, some after \n     midnight, and floated it out to sea again.\n       ``We think Valdez had two landslipping events,'' said \n     Preller--one in Valdez Arm, the other right under the dock.\n       Most Valdez businesses and half of the homes in town were \n     destroyed. Fuel tanks split open and their contents caught \n     fire, a catastrophe that would be repeated in the ports of \n     Whittier, Seward and Crescent City.\n       The fiords and coves throughout Prince William Sound, the \n     area nearest where the quake began, experienced similar \n     underwater landslides causing waves estimated to have \n     splashed as much as 220 feet above sea level. Most of these \n     places had few if any residents.\n       But there were people in Whittier and Seward. In those \n     towns, as in Valdez, the narrow harbors confined by steep \n     slopes channelized the water into a bore, amplifying the wave \n     action like a giant bathtub.\n       Arriving immediately after the quake, or even while it was \n     still rumbling, they gave residents no warning and little \n     chance to escape. ``The first tsunamis hit two minutes after \n     the earthquake started,'' said Preller. The quake lasted for \n     4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n       The island of Chenega, southwest of Valdez, is not a dead-\n     end inlet, like Whittier. But it is surrounded by precipitous \n     submarine channels. ``Prince William Sound is an environment \n     where the inlets are extremely deep,'' said Preller. The \n     underwater valleys had much the same effect as the above-\n     water fiords.\n       The first wave rose smoothly but with astonishing speed, \n     catching people trying to outrun it, trapping others in their \n     homes. A second wave struck more violently, smashing every \n     structure in the village except for the school. A third \n     scattered whatever was left.\n       Survivors huddled around a fire through the night with no \n     way to get word of their plight to the outside world.\n\n\n                               EVACUATION\n\n       Most people in Kodiak figured the big quake was shaking \n     only their neighborhood. The first inkling that it might be \n     more serious came when they noticed that long distance phone \n     service was out.\n       In the village of Kaguyak on the south end of Kodiak \n     island, however, residents observed the odd swell on the \n     ocean. They began moving away from the shore and sent radio \n     warnings to nearby communities. Warnings picked up elsewhere \n     on the island, alerting the people of Kodiak city 20 minutes \n     before the first wave arrived.\n       The city's fire trucks ran their sirens to warn the \n     population. Police went door to door urging evacuation and a \n     line of cars started driving up Pillar Mountain. The town's \n     taxi fleet used their CB radios to establish an ad hoc \n     communications network.\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\n       The first surge came into Kodiak harbor at low tide, about \n     half an hour after the quake. It didn't reach much past the \n     docks and is thought to have been a landslide tsunami. ``It \n     came much sooner than we would have expected from a tectonic \n     tsunami,'' said Preller. Most of the affected towns \n     experienced both types of wave, she said.\n       Thirty minutes later a second wave came into the city, \n     pushing boats into the city streets, floating cars away, \n     wrenching buildings from their foundations and causing walls \n     to collapse. It was not the towering breaker that swept up \n     the Chena in Valdez or wiped out a sawmill and its workers in \n     Whittier, but more on the lines of a large swell.\n       ``Survivors most often describe tsunamis as a rapidly \n     rising tide,'' said Haeussler. ``They're like a continuous \n     rise of the ocean that never stops. Often you cannot outrun \n     it. It just overwhelms everything in its path.''\n       At least three more waves ripped through the town in the \n     next few hours. It's presumed that the highest reached 26 \n     feet above mean low tide level. But no one saw it. It came in \n     pitch dark after midnight when most of the population had \n     moved up the hill. Kodiak fatalities tended to come not from \n     people on land, but from those who were in fishing boats \n     caught in the surge.\n\n\n                          LONG-DISTANCE KILLER\n\n       Kodiak was luckier than Crescent City, Calif. Residents \n     there received a warning three hours after the Alaska quake \n     began. Many evacuated before the tectonic wave came in, just \n     before midnight. Half an hour later a second wave, lower than \n     the first, rolled into the harbor.\n       ``People thought that was it,'' said Lori Dengler, a \n     professor of geology at Humboldt State University in Northern \n     California. ``They came back.''\n       At 1:20 a.m., a wave swirled into the waterfront that broke \n     the tide gauge. The fourth wave is estimated to have reached \n     22 feet, Dengler said. ``It was terribly timed. It came just \n     at the top of the tide.''\n       More than 100 homes were destroyed. Eleven people died. \n     Total damage was estimated at $23 million.\n       Others died in the rising waters at Newport, Ore. and \n     Klamath River, Calif. $600,000 in damage was sustained by \n     boats and harbor facilities in San Raphael, Calif.\n       In Hawaii, tsunamis from the Alaska earthquake caused about \n     $70,000 in damage. Waves in several places were as high as \n     the one that devastated Crescent City.\n       But no lives were lost. When the tsunami warning sirens \n     went off, the Hawaiians paid heed. They had learned their \n     lesson from another Alaska earthquake 18 years before.\n       On April 1, 1946, an Aleutian quake with a magnitude \n     perhaps as high as 8.1 set off a wave that wiped out the \n     concrete, five-story high Scotch Cap Lighthouse on Unimak \n     Island. Hours later, Hawaiians flocked to the shores to \n     observe the peculiar super-low tide. Curious crowds gathered \n     on the beach at Hilo. Children ran to explore the exposed sea \n     bottom. By the time they saw the wave coming it was too late \n     to get away; 165 people died, including six in Alaska.\n       As a result, a system of ocean-based alarms was established \n     to detect tsunami activity in areas particularly prone to \n     seismic shifts. A line of detectors follows the Alaska coast \n     where earthquake activity is particularly high.\n\n\n                             EARLY WARNING\n\n       The detectors do a good job of alerting populations far \n     from where the earthquakes take place, Dengler said. She \n     noted a tsunami that hit Crescent City following the 2011 \n     Japan quake was within inches of what the data predicted.\n       ``But near the source area, they're not helpful,'' she \n     said.\n       That's because a landslide tsunami will get to shore before \n     the warning does, if there's any warning at all.\n       ``We cannot detect when a landslide has happened,'' said \n     Preller. ``If you're near the ocean when there's an \n     earthquake, get to high ground and stay there. Don't wait for \n     a warning. The earthquake is your warning.''\n       Nonetheless, Dengler said, the progress in long-distance \n     tsunami warning has come a long way since 1964. ``Back then \n     it took three hours after the quake for Crescent City to get \n     the warning. Today it would be two or three minutes.''\n       Preller called the Japanese tsunami warning system ``the \n     best on the planet.'' That country has made some intriguing \n     progress in providing early warnings for earthquakes.\n       ``From the moment an earthquake initiates, you usually have \n     some period of time before the shaking reaches you,'' said \n     West. ``If you can nail down that earthquake immediately when \n     it happens, there's the potential of providing several tens \n     of seconds of warning. That's enough time to shut down \n     transit systems or have a surgeon put down his scalpel.''\n       West is impressed by Japan's combination of good \n     instrumentation and a warning notification system. ``It was \n     quite successful in the 2011 earthquake,'' he said. He sent a \n     link to a Youtube video that shows a computer screen just \n     before the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that \n     year. An automated voice is counting down from 29 seconds. At \n     the moment the countdown reaches zero, the rattling begins.\n       ``California, Oregon and Washington are in the process of \n     developing such systems,'' West said. ``Gov. Jerry Brown has \n     mandated that California will do this.\n       ``There's a legitimate discussion to be held as to whether \n     or not such an investment would be worth it here. But nothing \n     like it is currently in development for Alaska.''\n     Wednesday: Witness to destruction\n       Shortly after tsunamis destroyed much of Seward, school \n     students recorded their experiences with pictures.\n     Tidal wave vs. tsunami\n       In 1964 the phrase ``tidal wave'' was universally used by \n     both average Alaskans and experts quoted in the media to \n     describe the giant waves that wrought so much death and \n     damage. Today the preferred term for a wave generated by a \n     solid physical force such as an earthquake, landslide or \n     volcano is tsunami. Tidal waves refer to waves caused by \n     extreme tidal action or wind, including tidal bores or storm \n     surges.\n     Casualties\n       There are various numbers given for the number of deaths \n     caused by the Great Alaska Earthquake. The most recent \n     estimate is given by the National Geophysical Data Center as \n     139, 124 of which were due to tsunamis; however that database \n     does not break down the fatalities by location. ``The \n     casualties are still under discussion,'' said Cindi Preller, \n     Tsunami Program Manager, NOAA Alaska Region.\n     Is Anchorage in danger?\n       In theory, a tsunami is possible at any oceanside location. \n     But it's considered improbable in upper Cook Inlet. \n     ``Generally speaking, tsunamis travel better through deep \n     water,'' said Kristine Crossen, head of UAA's geology \n     department. ``Cook Inlet is fairly shallow. It creates a lot \n     of friction on the base of the wave.''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                        Antipersonnel Landmines\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Over the past 20 years I have spoken many times about the \ntoll inflicted on innocent civilians and U.S. soldiers from \nantipersonnel landmines. I have talked about it in the Senate, in \nOttawa, and in most parts of the world.\n  The reason I have done so is that landmines, like booby traps, are \ninherently indiscriminate. They are triggered by whomever comes in \ncontact with them, whether an unsuspecting child, a farmer, a refugee, \nor a soldier. They are the antithesis of a precision guided weapon.\n  One hundred sixty-one nations, including most of our allies and \nfriends and every European member of NATO, have signed a treaty banning \nthem. One hundred sixty-one nations had the courage to sign that \ntreaty.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is conspicuously not among them.\n  In 1994, 20 years ago, in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, \nPresident Bill Clinton called for the elimination of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  Two years later, in 1996, President Clinton said: ``Today I am \nlaunching an international effort to ban anti-personnel landmines.''\n  President Clinton went on to announce a U.S. plan to develop \nalternatives to landmines, with the goal that the United States would \nend its use of antipersonnel landmines by 2006.\n  We had a meeting in Ottawa where nations came together and Canada's \nForeign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, called for an antipersonnel landmine \ntreaty. But in 1997 the United States missed an opportunity to be a \nleader in the international effort to ban antipersonnel mines, when it \nfailed to sign the Mine Ban Treaty.\n  The year 2006 came and went. President Clinton's administration ended \nand President George W. Bush served for 8 years. President Obama was \nthen elected and then reelected. In the meantime, U.S. troops fought \ntwo long ground wars. They fought those wars without using \nantipersonnel landmines.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  In 2010, along with 67 other Senators, Democrats and Republicans, I \nsent a letter to President Obama. We commended him for agreeing to \nreview the U.S. Government's policy on antipersonnel mines, and we \nurged him to conform U.S. policy to the Mine Ban Treaty as a first \nstep. That was 5 years ago. Five years since the start of that review \nwe are still waiting for the results.\n  After 20 years and three U.S. Presidents, there is no evidence the \nUnited States is any closer to joining the treaty than when President \nClinton made that speech.\n  I find it disheartening as an American to think that my country is \nunwilling to stand with these 161 other countries, many of which real \nthreats, and yet we will not join them.\n  The Pentagon has long argued that landmines are needed to defend \nSouth Korea. In 1996, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry said the \nPentagon would ``move vigorously'' to achieve alternative ways to \nprevent a North Korean attack so they would no longer need landmines.\n  In the last century, in 1996, they pledged to vigorously. I don't \nknow what their definition of ``vigorous'' is, but after 20 years there \nis no evidence they have done anything to revise their Korea war plans \nwithout antipersonnel mines or that any President has told them to do \nso.\n  One could ask what difference it would make if the United States \njoins the Mine Ban Treaty. As I said, we have not used antipersonnel \nmines for 23 years. The United States has done more to support \nhumanitarian demining than any other country in the world. We have not \nexported antipersonnel mines since the Leahy law was passed in 1992, \nand we have spent many tens of millions of dollars through the Leahy \nWar Victims Fund to aid those injured by mines.\n  If we are not causing the problem, why bother signing the treaty? \nBecause antipersonnel mines continue to kill and cripple innocent \npeople and because indiscriminate, victim-activated weapons have no \nplace in the arsenal of a civilized country.\n  Countries as diverse as Afghanistan and Great Britain have signed it.\n  The United States has by far the most powerful military in the world, \nand this treaty needs the strong leadership of the United States.\n  As President Obama said in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace \nPrize:\n\n       I am convinced that adhering to standards, international \n     standards, strengthens those who do, and isolates and weakens \n     those who don't.\n\n  Twenty years after President Clinton's U.N. speech, President Obama \ncan give real meaning to his words by putting the United States on the \npath to join the treaty. That means destroying what remains of our \nstockpile of mines. We are never going to use them. Get rid of them. It \nmeans revising our Korea war plans to eliminate antipersonnel mines.\n  President Obama is the only one who could make that happen. Time is \nrunning out.\n  Let me tell a story. During the ill-fated contra war, during the time \nof the Reagan administration, I was visiting one of the contra camps \nalong the Nicaragua-Honduras border. As I looked from a helicopter, I \nsaw a clearing inside Nicaragua where there was a field hospital. So we \ndecided to land. I talked to the doctors who were treating victims. \nThere was a little boy, about 10 or 12 years old, who came out, and he \nhad a makeshift crutch. He had one leg.\n\n  He came from a family who survived from what they could hunt and \ngather in the jungle along the border. We talked to him, and it turned \nout he had lost his leg by stepping on an antipersonnel mine--mines \nthat were not going to stop any army, they were just there to terrorize \nand injure civilians.\n  This is not a picture of that little boy, but this is an example of \nwhat happens. I asked the boy which side put this mine there. He had \nonly a vague knowledge of what the two countries were, that there was a \nborder there. All he knew was that his life was changed forever. He \nwould not be able to earn a living as his parents and grandparents and \nothers had. He had a place to stay only because the doctors had put a \npile of rags and sheets in the corner on the dirt floor where other \npeople were recovering from their war wounds.\n  I became more and more interested in the horrifying toll of landmines \naround the world, and I met other innocent victims like this young girl \nher legs and a hand missing. I think of those in conflicts especially \nchildren--who saw what they thought was a pretty and shiny toy on the \nside of the road, and they touched it only to have their limbs blown \noff or their eyesight lost.\n  I think of the teenage girl I met in an area where there was a war. I \nmet her at a hospital where she was getting artificial legs through the \nLeahy War Victims Fund. Her parents had sent her away during the war, \nwhere she would be safe. The war ended and she was walking home and saw \nher parents and started running toward them, and in a flash a landmine \nexplodes and she both her legs were blown off.\n  After World War I, countries came together to ban poison gas. We had \ninternational negotiations to do that. The Pentagon was against it, \narguing that they might need to use poison gas sometime. We get the \nsame reaction today about antipersonnel landmines: we might need them \nsome day.\n  This photograph show one of the places supported by the Leahy War \nVictims Fund--where they make artificial legs. If any one of the \nSenators in this body were to lose a leg, our insurance would buy us a \nhigh-tech leg to replace it or we might be told: You can have an even \nbetter one but it will cost $500 or $1,000 more than your insurance \nwill pay. We would all take out our checkbook and pay it. Here, we are \ntalking about countries in which the per capita income is maybe $300 or \n$400 a year.\n  Signing a landmine treaty is not going to by itself stop everything. \nThere are millions of mines still littering countries where the wars \nended decades ago.\n  As I said earlier, the United States, to its credit, has spent \nhundreds of millions of dollars to clear mines and to help people who \nhave been injured. But why shouldn't the United States of America--the \ncountry that should be the moral leader--why shouldn't we step up and \nsign the treaty? How do we credibly tell others not to use them, when \nthey say: Yes, but you never signed the treaty. You have reserved the \nright to use them. You are the most powerful Nation on Earth; we are \nnot.\n  Why shouldn't we?\n  I am proud of the Leahy War Victims Fund, but I would give anything \nto think there was no need for it. Maybe that day will come.\n  I tell President Obama: Time is running out. You know what you should \ndo.\n  I think if he talked to President Clinton, he would find that \nPresident Clinton wishes he had signed it. Let's sign it now. Do that. \nThat can be part of his legacy.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Great Alaskan Earthquake\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise today to remember the Great \nAlaskan Earthquake, which struck 50 years ago today on Good Friday, \nMarch 27, 1964. Over 100 Alaskans died in the earthquake and the \nresulting tsunami. Entire coastal towns were literally wiped off the \nmap.\n  I was very young--only 2 years old--but I remember my family telling \nstories as I was growing up and showing pictures. In those days it was \nnot like we see today--pictures on a computer--because there was none \nof that existing. I remember in our family of six we always had \nslideshow night. We had these little slides my mother would put in this \ncarousel, and off it would go and we would be reminded of all the \nvacations and things we went on, but we would also see these slides \nabout what happened in the earthquake in 1964.\n  We were lucky. We lived in East Anchorage in half of a small \napartment complex, and the only things that broke in our house were \nthese three swinging lights that went back and forth because our house \nwas built on\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\ngravel soil and was very strong and sturdy, in many ways, in its \ndevelopment. But when you look back at the houses on Third Avenue that \nliterally disappeared or Fourth Avenue that collapsed downtown, it was \na different story, or around Turnagain, the community out in West \nAnchorage, that literally fell off and sank.\n  Today I am honored to join my colleague Senator Murkowski--who I know \nwas on the floor earlier--in cosponsoring a resolution marking the \ntragic yet important event in our history and thanking those who helped \nus survive and recover. In those days we had limited access anyway, but \nwhen there was an earthquake, especially in a small town or community, \nthe first responders sometimes couldn't get there because of the \nuniqueness of the situation from the earthquake. But every Alaskan, \nevery first responder, everybody who was available got down to the \nbusiness of doing everything they could to help people in need. We were \ncoming out of a winter--still cold and yet spring, what we would call a \nspring winter day.\n  Alaskans know the importance of tsunami preparedness and warnings and \nmaking sure we are prepared for what can happen. Today we are proud to \nhost NOAA's National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, AK. I have been \nthere, and it is the most amazing technology, to see what we can do and \nwhat we can see or sense through the sensors and other scientific \nequipment we have to tell us when a tsunami may be occurring or the \nmagnitude of the tsunami. We monitor on a 24-hour basis with \nscientists.\n  The tsunami's impact was felt, from our earthquake, as far away as \nHawaii, California, and Washington. That is why today I join Senator \nCantwell and Senator Schatz in introducing the Tsunami Warning and \nEducational Reauthorization Act for 2014. This bill would improve \nNOAA's Tsunami Warning Center, bringing supercomputing power to the \ntsunami modeling. It would ensure that all coastal weather forecast \noffices are better prepared to issue tsunami warnings.\n  The bill also ensures that coastal communities will be more tsunami-\nresilient through the National Tsunami Hazardous Mitigation Program. It \nensures that communities understand tsunami risks, planning to minimize \ndamages, and are ready to bounce back quickly after the damage occurs.\n  The bill also recognizes the critical role that advancing our \nunderstanding and technology through scientific research plays in \nmeeting the tsunami threat.\n  This bill was originally envisioned by the late Senator Inouye. I \nhave been proud to pick up where he was unable to continue on an issue \nI know is critical in his home State.\n  Fifty years ago Alaska was a young State with a bright but uncertain \nfuture. We still had foreign fishing vessels coming in and taking our \nfish just a few miles off the coast. The trans-Alaska oil pipeline and \nthe energy it delivers was just a dream. After the damage from the \nquake and tsunami, there were serious questions from outside whether \nAlaska could survive. Keep in mind that this was only a few years after \nbecoming a State. But Alaskans already knew the answer. They knew we \nwould rebuild and become stronger, and we have. Alaska is now the \nNation's Arctic energy storehouse and feeds the Nation with sustainable \nseafood stocks. I know the Presiding Officer understands the value of \nfisheries and that they are an incredible element of our food inventory \nand storage for our country. Alaska is a State that is important in \nthis regard, as is the State of Massachusetts.\n  But we must still be very vigilant against the threat of earthquakes \nand tsunamis. That is why I introduced this bill, joining again with \nSenators Cantwell and Schatz in this endeavor. We encourage its swift \npassage, as it is important to make sure, when it comes to these \nissues, that no matter where one lives, safety is protected because the \ndevastation is incredible.\n  Let me end on another personal note. When I think of growing up in \nAlaska--someone born and raised there--and living in East Anchorage, I \ncan still remember growing up and my dad thinking about where he bought \nland to build this house, and this apartment building was on incredible \nsoil. But years later, when I became mayor of Anchorage and sat on the \ncity assembly, I remember the great debate on building codes and \nearthquake capacity and stability and making sure buildings were \ndesigned right.\n  I remember the Federal building, which is now city hall--and I was on \nthe Anchorage Assembly then--and the great debate came up as to whether \nwe were going to renovate or move or something else in regard to the \nlocation. But we decided we wanted to stay downtown to keep downtown \nvibrant. Well, the building was built during a time when it would \nprobably not withstand an earthquake of the magnitude that occurred in \nthe 1964 earthquake.\n  I remember when we vacated the building and they stripped the \nbuilding down and left the shell. I walked in to take a tour of the \nbuilding with the developer. He was showing me what he called the shock \nabsorbers--these incredible columns within the building that, if an \nearthquake hit, not only would they try to absorb it, they would help \nthe building move up or side to side, absorbing the impact of the \nearthquake and preserving the building, ensuring that the investment \nand lives would be saved. To me, it was the most amazing thing because \nin the old days--as I said, when I grew up--we just put the buildings \ntogether, slapped them up, and thanked God we had a home to live in \nduring a cold winter. So the technology has advanced significantly so \nas to ensure safety in an area that is clearly an earthquake zone.\n  It is not uncommon for me to be back home and be at a meeting in a \nhotel or giving a speech in a ballroom or sitting in a home with \nsomeone and having a conversation and an earthquake kind of comes \nthrough. It is always amazing to me that if I am there with visitors \nfrom out of town, they get a little nervous. But as Alaskans, we know \nwe have improved our building codes, we have improved our warning \nsystems, and we have continued to make sure we can minimize or mitigate \nthe damage from those natural disasters that could occur. Again, this \nbill reauthorization on tsunamis focuses on that. We saw a whole city \nor town washed off the map--gone--because of the power of a tsunami.\n\n  So today I appreciate and remember the history of Alaska and the \nuniqueness of being there during times of growth and also times of \ntragedy, but today being part of legislation which in an odd way comes \nfull circle: As a 2-year-old experiencing an earthquake, to where I am \ntoday, being able to ensure that not only my State but any coastal \nState has the capacity to ensure a tsunami warning system is not only \nthe best but the best in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          Wealth Distribution\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as the longest serving Independent in \nthe history of the U.S. Congress, I wish to address an issue which I \nbelieve does not get the kind of discussion it should from either \npolitical party but certainly not from our Republican colleagues--the \nmoral, economic, and political dimensions of the kind of income and \nwealth inequality which we have in our country today. In my view, this \nis the most important issue facing the United States because it impacts \non virtually every aspect of our lives. It is an issue we must be \ndiscussing thoroughly and one in which the American people have to be \nengaged.\n  The fact is that while we often speak of the United States of America \nbeing the wealthiest Nation on the face of the Earth, that is only \npartially true, because within the context of total wealth is the \nreality that the great middle class of this country is disappearing. \nThe reality is we have more people living in poverty today than at any \ntime in the history of the United States of America. The fact is we \nhave by far the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major \nindustrialized nation on Earth. So if we add it all together, yes, we \nare the wealthiest Nation on Earth, but the reality is the people on \ntop own a huge amount of this wealth while the middle class is \nshrinking and poverty is increasing.\n  I will speak to our colleagues and the American people about some of \nthe realities in terms of income and wealth distribution.\n  Today the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the financial wealth of \nAmerica. I wonder how many Americans\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nknow how much the bottom 60 percent owns. I want people to think about \nit. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the financial wealth, and the \nbottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. One family in this country--the \nWalton family, the owners of Walmart--are now worth as a family $148 \nbillion. This is more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of American \nsociety. Today the richest 400 Americans own more wealth than the \nbottom half of America, 150 million people. This is distribution of \nwealth--what we own.\n  The latest information we have in terms of distribution of income is \nfrom 2009 through 2012, which says that 95 percent of all new income \nearned in this country went to the top 1 percent. When we talk about \neconomic growth--2 percent or 4 percent, whatever it is--it doesn't \nmean much, because almost all of the new income generated in this \ngrowth has gone to the very wealthiest people in this country. The top \n25 hedge fund managers made last year over $24 billion. This is enough \nto pay the salaries of more than 425,000 public schoolteachers. Over \nthe past decade, the net worth of the top 400 billionaires in this \ncountry has doubled by an astronomical $1 trillion in the last 10 \nyears.\n  In a moment I will discuss the extraordinary political power of the \nKoch brothers, a family investing very heavily in the political \nprocess, spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to elect \nrightwing candidates who will protect the interests of the wealthy and \nthe powerful.\n  To give some idea of what is going on in this economy, everybody \nshould understand that Charles and David Koch--the Koch brothers--are \nthe second wealthiest family in this country. In the last year alone, \nthis one family saw a $12 billion increase in their wealth, bringing \ntheir total wealth to $80 billion.\n  The other day in the Washington Post there was an article talking \nabout the Adelson primary. When we talk about a political primary, what \nit means is we have candidates in the Democratic Party and the \nRepublican Party competing against each other to get the support of the \npeople in their respective parties. Well, forget about that. That is \nold news. Now the goal is to appeal to one multibillionaire so this \nindividual can contribute hundreds of millions of dollars into the \ncampaign. This is what is going on right now in the Republican Party.\n  While the wealthiest are doing phenomenally well, while the United \nStates today has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of \nany major country on Earth, and while that income inequality is worse \ntoday than at any time since 1928, what we are also seeing is the \ncollapse of the middle class and an increase in poverty.\n  Since 1999, the typical middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by more than $5,000 after adjusting for inflation. The typical \nmiddle-class American family earned less income last year than it did \n25 years ago, back in 1989. The Presiding Officer is probably the last \nperson in the world I have to explain this to, having written several \nbooks on this subject.\n  Why are people angry in this country? The median male worker in this \ncountry made $283 less last year than he did 44 years ago, and the \ntypical female worker earned $1,700 less than in 2007.\n\n  The question I think every American should be asking is: How does it \nhappen, when we have a huge increase in productivity--everybody has a \ncell phone, everybody has a sophisticated computer, we have robotics in \nall of our factories, we have a huge increase in productivity--where is \nall of the wealth going which increased productivity has created? The \nanswer is pretty clear: It has gone to the top 1 percent.\n  So the moral issue we have to address as a nation is: Are we \ncomfortable as a nation in which in recent years we have seen a huge \nincrease in the number of millionaires and billionaires, while at the \nsame time we have more people living in poverty than we have ever had \nbefore?\n  This is an incredible fact: As an aging nation with more and more \npeople reaching retirement, half of the American people have less than \n$10,000 in their savings accounts and in many ways have no idea how \nthey are going to retire with dignity. So the first issue we have to \ndeal with is a moral issue. Are we comfortable living in a nation when \nso few have so much while so many have so little, and so many of our \nbrothers and sisters--our fellow Americans--are struggling economically \nevery single day?\n  Today we are addressing the issue of extending long-term unemployment \nbenefits. There are millions of workers right now, including people who \nhave worked their entire lives and who no longer can find a job. They \nhave virtually no income coming in and are struggling to survive. \nSingle moms are trying to raise families with very limited income. Is \nthis the nation we are comfortable being?\n  I don't think we are. But it is not just an issue of individual \nincome. Today, corporate profits are at an all-time high while wages \nare near an all-time low.\n  Then when we look at issues about how can we fund early childhood \neducation, how can we make sure every American has health care as a \nright--how do we make sure that when people lose their jobs they are \ngoing to get the unemployment they need, we should remember that every \nsingle year corporations--large, multinational corporations--avoid \npaying at least $100 billion a year in taxes because they stash their \ncash in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens. The result is \none out of four American corporations pays nothing in Federal income \ntaxes. In fact, over the last 5 years, huge companies, profitable \ncompanies, such as General Electric, Boeing, and Verizon, pay nothing--\nzero--in Federal income tax, even though all of those companies have \nmade a combined profit of $78 billion since 2008.\n  Here is the irony of all ironies. It is one thing to understand that \nthe very wealthy are becoming wealthier while everybody else is \nbecoming poorer, but it is another thing to understand that the people \nwho have the money, the billionaire class, are going to war against \nworking Americans. If one has $80 billion, do they really need to \ninvest in the political process so they can elect candidates who will \ngive even more tax breaks? Do they really need to invest in rightwing \ncandidates who are out there trying to cut Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, the Environmental Protection Agency, nutrition, food stamps, \nand education? Why, if somebody has $80 billion, are they working so \nhard for more tax breaks for themselves and for more cuts to the middle \nclass and working class in terms of programs people desperately need?\n  Frankly, I think this is not an economic issue. I think it is a \npsychiatric issue. I think it is an issue which suggests people are \nsimply power hungry. They need more and more. I think this is a very \nsad state of affairs.\n  The struggle we are engaged in now is stopping the billionaire class \nfrom cutting Social Security, from cutting Medicare, from cutting \nMedicaid, and from preventing us from creating the millions of jobs our \neconomy desperately needs. But at the end of the day, what we are \nreally talking about is whether this Nation is going to become an \noligarchic form of society, and what that means, what an oligarchic \nform of society is about and which has existed in many countries \nthroughout the world, historically--in many countries in Latin America, \nalthough that has recently changed--is a nation in which both the \neconomics and politics of the nation are controlled by a handful of \nvery wealthy, billionaire families. It doesn't matter what party is in \npower because the real power economically and politically rests with a \nbillionaire class. It clearly seems that unless we act boldly to \nreverse this trend, we are seeing this country moving in exactly that \ndirection.\n\n  One of the reasons is as a result of the disastrous Citizens United \nSupreme Court ruling, which regards corporations as people and allows \nthe superwealthy to spend as much as they want on elections. The \nbillionaire party, which is obviously aligned with the Republicans, is \nnow, in fact, the major political force in this country. It is not the \nRepublican party, per se. It is not the Democratic party, per se. It is \nthe billionaire party led by people like the Koch brothers and Sheldon \nAdelson. They are the dominant political force in this country because \nthey can spend unbelievable sums of money on elections. They can spend \nas much money\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nas they need, setting up think tanks and various organizations which \nwill support their extreme rightwing point of view.\n  In the last presidential election Barack Obama's campaign spent a \nlittle bit over $1 billion. Mitt Romney spent somewhere around there, \nmaybe a little bit less, but about $1 billion. The Koch brothers' \nwealth increased by $12 billion in one year.\n  Is there any reason to doubt that in the future this one family will \nbe able to spend more money on a campaign than the presidential \ncandidates themselves, receiving donations from hundreds of thousands \nof people? That is where we are today. Where we are today is that the \nvery foundations of American democracy are being threatened by a \nhandful of incredibly wealthy people who are saying: You know what. \nEighty billion is not enough for me. Yeah, I made $12 billion more than \nlast year--not enough for me. I have to have more, and I am going to \nget more tax cuts for myself, and in order to do that we may have to \ncut Social Security; we may have to cut Medicare; we may have to cut \nMedicaid; we may have to cut education for middle-class families.\n  We are in a debate about whether we raise the minimum wage. My view--\nand I know the Presiding Officer's view--is that we should raise the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour so that every working person in this \ncountry at least--at least--can have a minimal--minimal--standard of \nliving. Many Americans don't know that it is not just that virtually \nall Republicans in the Congress are opposed to raising the minimum \nwage. The truth is many of them want to abolish the concept of the \nminimum wage.\n  The theory of the minimum wage is that nobody should work for below a \ncertain wage. For many of my extreme conservative friends, they think \nit would be perfectly fine in a high unemployment area if we abolish \nthe minimum wage. People today are working in this country for $3 and \n$4 an hour.\n  It is not only economics. Many of these billionaires are involved, as \nthe Koch brothers are, in energy, in oil. What they want to do is \nabolish agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency so they can \npollute more and more and more. The scientific community tells us in an \nalmost unanimous fashion that climate change is real, climate change is \nmade by human activity, climate change is already creating problems in \nour country and around the world, and that if we don't get our act \ntogether and significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions, the problems \nwill only become worse. Yet you have families such as the Koch brothers \nand other energy-related billionaires spending huge sums of money \ntrying to confuse people about the reality of climate change.\n  So to my mind the issue that we have to focus on as a Congress, the \nissue that we have to focus on as American people is: What kind of \nnation do we wish to live in? Do we want to live in a nation where a \nhandful of billionaires own a significant amount of the wealth in this \ncountry while the middle class has less and less, where families cannot \nafford to send their kids to college or get decent childcare for their \nlittle ones, where people are reaching the age of 65 with virtually \nnothing in the bank in order to provide a dignified retirement? Is that \nthe country we want to live in or do we want to see the middle class \ngrow and have a more equitable distribution of wealth and income, a \nfairer tax system where the millionaires and billionaires and large \ncorporations start paying their fair share of taxes.\n  From a political point of view, which is equally important: Do we \nwant to have a nation in which the concept is one person, one vote; \nthat we are all equal; that you have as much say about what happens in \ngovernment as anybody else or do we want to have a political system \nwhere a handful of billionaires can sit around the room and say: OK, \nput $100 million into that State. Let's put $50 million into that \nState--where a handful of billionaires will determine who gets elected \nPresident, who gets elected Senator, who gets elected Governor, and \nhave Members of Congress crawling up to these billionaires: What do you \nneed, Mr. Billionaire? How do I get the hundreds of millions of dollars \nyou can give me?\n  Is that really what American democracy is supposed to be about?\n  We have some very fundamental issues we have to address as a \nCongress. So I would suggest that we put on the agenda the issue of \ndistribution of wealth and income and the implication of that grossly \nunfair distribution of wealth and income that we have right now.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would yield the floor, and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Boston's Lost Heroes\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, this is a difficult day for the city of \nBoston. Yesterday Boston lost two courageous firefighters who gave up \ntheir lives battling a terrible fire in the city's Back Bay.\n  When others flee, our firefighters rush headlong into danger, \nconcerned only for the safety of others. They put their lives on the \nline every time. Today we mourn the loss of two brave men, two heroes \nwho made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Lieutenant Ed Walsh and firefighter Mike Kennedy were highly \nrespected and committed members of the Boston Fire Department who \ndedicated their lives to keeping our families safe. Firefighter Kennedy \nof Ladder Company 15 on Boylston Street was a member of the Boston Fire \nDepartment for 6\\1/2\\ years. He grew up in Roslindale, served our \ncountry as a U.S. Marine Corps combat veteran in Iraq, and was a first \nresponder to the Boston Marathon attacks last year. He wanted to run in \nthis year's marathon, so to be admitted he wrote an essay about his \nexperiences responding to the marathon bombing. He had been at training \nfor the big day, but he won't be running this year.\n  Lieutenant Walsh served on Engine 33, also based at the Boylston \nStreet Fire Station. He was a firefighter in Boston for 9\\1/2\\ years \nand lived in West Roxbury with his wife Kristen and their three young \nkids. Lieutenant Walsh came from a firefighting family and followed in \nthe footsteps of his father and his uncle, both of whom served on the \nWatertown Fire Department. He will be missed.\n  I know I speak on behalf of the city of Boston and the people of \nBoston when I say that all our thoughts and prayers are with Lieutenant \nWalsh's and Firefighter Kennedy's families at this very difficult time. \nBoston is deeply grateful to Lieutenant Walsh and to Firefighter \nKennedy, and to all our policemen, firefighters, and first responders \nwho put their lives at risk to protect our families every single day, \nand to all of our firefighter families who face the risk that a loved \none will rush into a burning building and give up everything to keep \nall of us safe.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, every day firefighters and other first \nresponders around our country put their lives on the line to protect \nthe public. Yesterday members of the Boston Fire Department bravely \nentered a burning building in Boston's Back Bay in a selfless effort to \nsave lives and keep the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nsafe.\n  Firefighters head toward the danger as ordinary citizens run away \nfrom danger. They are a very special breed, these firefighters. It is \nwith a very heavy heart that I come to the floor today, along with \nSenator Warren, to honor two of these courageous men, Lieutenant Edward \nWalsh and firefighter Michael Kennedy, who became caught in the fire \nand heroically sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. Thirteen \nother firefighters were injured in the blaze and are expected to \nsurvive.\n  Firefighter Michael Kennedy was 33 years old. A native of the \nRoslindale\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nsection of Boston, he lived in Hyde Park and had been with the Boston \nFire Department for the past 6 years. A former marine, Michael was \namong the first responders who nobly and bravely served those injured \nin the Boston Marathon bombing almost 1 year ago.\n  Lieutenant Edward Walsh was 43 years old. He lived in West Roxbury \nwith his wife and three children. Lieutenant Walsh came from a \nfirefighting family. Both his father and uncle were fire lieutenants in \nnearby Watertown. He had been with the Boston Fire Department for 9\\1/\n2\\ years and was stationed at Engine 33, Ladder 15, just blocks from \nthe building where the fire occurred.\n  Lieutenant Walsh and Firefighter Kennedy are American heroes. Their \nmemories will live on forever as everlasting examples of the \nextraordinary courage and dedication that is at the very heart of the \nBoston Fire Department and in the hearts of firefighters everywhere. \nBoston is strong because of heroes such as Lieutenant Walsh and \nFirefighter Kennedy who place the safety of others before themselves.\n  In this nine-alarm fire, there were zero civilian casualties. These \ntwo brave men put their lives on the line so that others may go on \nliving. I offer my condolences to the families of Lieutenant Walsh and \nFirefighter Kennedy and to the Boston Fire Department. Massachusetts \nhas lost two of its finest sons, and I grieve along with the rest of \nthe Commonwealth, along with Senator Warren, and along with everyone \nelse for the loss that has been suffered.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, George Holland was a pretty exceptional \nkid. When he was 14 years old, he went through something that I do not \nthink any of us can even imagine what it is like to go through. His \nparents got into a heated argument. They were estranged at the time. It \nbecame so violent that it culminated in his mother fatally stabbing his \nfather. He was 14 years old, and he lost his dad and then saw his \nmother get sent away to prison.\n  He then went to live with his aunt. His aunt attests to the fact that \neven in those dark days, he was full of a positive attitude. He refused \nto dwell on the murder, to use it as a crutch. He excelled.\n  His friends said his smile was infectious. He was always hugging \neverybody.\n  He played center on the high school football team in Providence, RI, \nwhich is where he is from. His coach says that he was a great team \nplayer, he was a leader, and he was always looking to take the younger \nkids under his wing. His coach said, ``He was just a great kid.''\n  Well, 3 years after his mother killed his father, George Holland died \nas well. A gunman targeted his house on February 4 of this year--a \nhouse he was visiting. He was with his girlfriend and her family when \nsomeone shot into the house around 9 p.m. A bullet went through the \nkitchen window and struck George, who collapsed and later died at Rhode \nIsland Hospital. He was 17 years old.\n  Steve Finkbeiner and his wife Constance were beloved in their town of \nLaPlace, LA. They owned a feedstore that was at the end of a quiet \nroad. They had owned it for 28 years. The community all looked upon the \nFinkbeiners as family. Everybody had some reason to go into that \nfeedstore every now and again. Constance and Steve treated their \ncustomers as if they were members of their own immediate family.\n  One friend said exactly that: They were like family. They were just \nlike family.\n  Others remembered Steve as a hard-working man and a community member.\n  It was just after 2:30 p.m. on February 25--just a few weeks ago--\nwhen deputies received a call from the feed and supply store. A woman \nsaid she and her husband had just been shot during an armed robbery. \nConstance survived the attack but was critically injured. Her husband \nSteve died. What happened was two robbers initially went into the store \ninquiring about shots for a pet. They left briefly only to return to \nrob the place and shoot the couple who owned the store.\n  Ruthanne Lodato lived just over the border in Alexandria, VA. She was \na music teacher, 59 years old. She was as involved as one can be in the \ncommunity. She was a loving wife to her husband and the mother of three \ndaughters. She was planning her class's 40th reunion. She was \nremembered fondly as a music teacher who would hold up her hand to cue \nthe group to sing her school's alma mater. She was the glue that held \nher family and friends together. That is how she was described.\n  There were 300 mourners at her funeral. On February 6 of this year--\nagain, just over a month ago--she was shot after she opened the door to \nher suburban home for what was described as a balding, bearded man in a \ntan jacket, who shot her dead.\n  Ricky Roberts was a very exceptional guy. He lived out in Sonora, CA. \nHe was a demolition derby driver, and he used his garage to construct \ndemolition derby cars. That is what he loved to do. He loved it so much \nthat when he got married to his wife Teddi, they were married on top of \na derby car, probably one that he had made, in July of 1990. They were \nmarried on top one of his derby cars at the town's Mother Lode \nFairgrounds.\n  What he also loved was volunteering for his community. Ricky was a \nlongtime Sonora police volunteer and a member of the Christian Heights \nChurch. He volunteered hours and hours every week as one of the citizen \npolice officers, and he was very involved with the Police Explorers, \nhelping to train and organize some of the kids who were involved in the \nPolice Explorers Program.\n  He was a very positive person. His mom said that he made people feel \ngood about themselves and that he had a great rapport with people. He \nhad a great sense of humor and he had the ability to laugh at himself.\n  On February 16 of this year, Ricky was found at 11 a.m. bleeding in \nhis garage--the garage where he built demolition derby cars--from an \napparent gunshot. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He was the first \nhomicide victim in Sonora, CA, in nearly 13 years.\n  The numbers are pretty stunning: 31,000 people every year die from \ngun violence; 2,600 people die every month, and 86 people die every \nday.\n  There is no other country in the industrialized world that has \nnumbers that come anywhere close to approximating these catastrophic \ntotals.\n  What I have tried to do is come down to the floor every week to tell \nthe story of the voices of these victims to let my friends know that \nthese are real people with real families who are getting killed at a \nrate of 86 per day all across the country. We can talk about these \nstatistics, but apparently the statistics haven't moved Congress and \nthe Senate to action. Maybe the voices of those 86 people a day will--\neven after they leave this place.\n  The carnage and the wreckage that is left behind is nearly \nincalculable. Surveys have been done of what it is like to live in \ncities with a high incidence of gun violence. They show that the rates \nof PTSD among the kids who have to live every day with the fear of \nbeing shot or with the knowledge that they are pretty sure that in that \nyear a friend, a neighbor or a relative will be killed. They rival the \nrates of PTSD of our returning soldiers. These cities are like war \nzones.\n  The tragedy of all of this is that we are not powerless to do \nsomething about it. We have the ability to change laws, to modify laws, \nin order to reduce the rates of gun violence all across this country.\n  I close by drawing attention to the evidence. Johns Hopkins recently \ndid a new study of a Missouri law that for years had required \nbackground checks before people bought guns and licenses for all \nhandgun owners.\n  In 2007, Missouri repealed that law.\n  Johns Hopkins, one of the best research universities in the country, \ndid an exhaustive study of rates of gun violence before that law was \npassed and the rates of gun violence afterwards.\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\nThey controlled for every factor other than this law that was repealed. \nThey looked at whether rates of gun violence were increasing in only \ncertain counties. They compared it to rates of gun violence in nearby \nStates, and they looked at all of the other factors that could go into \nan explanation other than the repeal of the law when trying to figure \nout why rates of gun violence were increasing.\n  What they found was very simple. They found that even when we control \nfor all of the other factors, the repeal of the background checks law \nin Missouri led to a 23-percent spike in firearm homicide rates. That \nis an additional 55 to 63 murders every year from 2008 to 2012.\n  There were 60 additional people killed in one State alone because \nthat State had chosen to allow criminals to own guns. When we repeal a \nbackground check law, we essentially are allowing criminals to go into \nplaces where guns are sold, purchase them, and then either use them \nthemselves or sell them in the black market to people who will do the \nkind of destruction that leads to 31,000 people dying every year.\n  My colleagues, we have the ability to change this situation. I try to \nmake this point every time I come to the floor to talk about the voices \nof victims. I understand that we are not going to bring these numbers \nto zero by passing a commonsense background checks bill or by investing \nmore money into our mental health system or by trying to do something, \neven if it is in a nonlegislative way, to address the culture of \nviolence in our society. There is always going to be gun violence.\n  We can do something. We can lower these numbers. We can lessen the \ndamage, the trauma, and the carnage all across our country, all across \nthe States that we represent.\n  Think about a kid like George Holland, who had overcome so much, the \ndeath of one of his parents and the imprisonment of the other, to \nbecome an immensely compassionate 17-year-old. Who knew. Who knows what \nhe was going to accomplish.\n  We will never get to understand the good that George Holland could \nhave done in this world because, at age 17 on February 4 of this year, \nhe was gunned down in his girlfriend's home.\n  Hopefully, whether it is the data or the voices of victims, the \nSenate will figure out that we can do something to change that reality.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nwith respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 3979 be modified so that \nwhen the postcloture time is expired the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe motion to proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4302\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks on \nMonday, March 31, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4302, \nwhich was received from the House and is at the desk; that there be no \namendments or motions in order to the bill with the exception of budget \npoints of order and the applicable motions to waive; that the time \nuntil 5 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees for debate on the bill; that notwithstanding the previous \norder, following the vote on confirmation of the Owens nomination on \nMonday, March 31, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4302, the \nbill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill; that the bill be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; \nfinally, that upon disposition of H.R. 4302, the Senate proceed to vote \non the motion to proceed to H.R. 3979, as provided under the previous \norder.\n  Madam President, I want everyone to understand there will be at least \n3 hours of debate on H.R. 4302, and I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands I will be giving Senator Wyden the 1\\1/2\\ hours on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n\n\n                                  SGR\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before Chairman Baucus became Ambassador \nto China, the Finance Committee, under his auspices, negotiated a \nbipartisan, bicameral bill with the House to repeal the flawed Medicare \nphysician payment system. He worked on that for more than a year. But \nthe committees didn't come to an agreement on the really hard part--how \nto pay for it.\n  Senator Wyden, the new chairman of the Finance Committee, has come up \nwith a way to pay for it. I support repealing the payment system--the \nSGR--permanently. I have been in favor of that for a long time, and I \nappreciate the work done on that in the past period of time Senator \nWyden has been chairman of that committee. I repeat, the work done on \nit for a year didn't have a way to pay for it. So I support repealing \nthis permanently. I believe we should repeal it without pay-fors or by \nusing reductions in the overseas contingency fund, called OCO.\n  The deadline is here. I spoke on the floor this morning, and I say it \nagain. Everyone is saying, Well, why are you helping the doctors? Madam \nPresident, I am helping my Medicare recipients in Nevada. They need \nphysicians. And for us to play around with this bill, as we do \ncontinually, isn't fair to the patients. Because doctors are unhappy \nthat they do not have some degree of certainty, and that is what they \nneed. So that is why I am for getting rid of this totally. We don't \nhave that now.\n  The House passed a short time ago a patch of 12 or 13 months, which \nis good. So efforts will continue on the permanent repeal of the SGR, \nand I support Senator Wyden seeing what he can do to come up with some \nvotes for a permanent repeal. He served a long time in the House and a \nlong time in the Senate and he knows what he is doing. So let us hope \nhe gets enough votes. Until then, we are left with a patch.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Remembering Ed Muskie\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to memorialize one \nof the great residents, citizens, denizens of this body--Senator Edmund \nSixtus Muskie of Maine--who tomorrow, March 28, 2014, would have been \n100 years old.\n  I knew Ed Muskie--not well, but I knew him. I knew him working here \nas a staff member. We were very scared of him. He was a presence. He \nwas a force. He was indeed a great man. He is the classic American \nstory--a classic American story we need to remind ourselves of.\n  He was the son of a Polish immigrant tailor in a small town called \nRumford on the Androscoggin River in western Maine. He rose to become a \ngreat U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, candidate for President, \ncandidate on the ballot for Vice President of the United States, and \none of the great citizens of Maine and the country of the 20th century. \nEd Muskie rose by his own merits.\n  I am convinced that the secret sauce of America is the welcoming of \npeople from all over the world who come here to bring their talents and \nallowing them to express themselves fully and freely in the wonderful \nrich soil of this great country.\n  Ed Muskie went to school on a scholarship at a small college in \nMaine, Bates College, where the Muskie Archives currently reside. Then \nhe went on to Cornell Law School through the generosity of individuals \nand scholarships because he had no resources of his own. He was in \nWorld War II and then came back to practice law in the small town of \nWaterville in Central Maine.\n  In 1954 Ed Muskie literally invented the Democratic Party in Maine. I \ndon't believe there had been a major Democratic officeholder in Maine \nfor some 50 years. I think perhaps there were a few in the 1920s and \n1930s, but the State was completely dominated by the Republican Party \nall through the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.\n  When Ed Muskie ran for Governor in 1954, it was the longest of long \nshots. In fact, the story in Maine was that, of course, in the 1936 \nelection, when\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt ran against Alf Landon, Roosevelt carried every \nState in the Union except two--Maine and Vermont. Hence the famous \nsaying: As goes Maine, so goes Vermont.\n  The story goes that on the coast of Maine, in a small Republican town \nof several hundred people, the clerk announced the vote.\n  At the end of the tally, she said: Landon 47, Roosevelt 2.\n  Someone mumbled: The SOB voted twice.\n  That was the way the Republican Party dominated the State--until Ed \nMuskie in 1954. He drove from one end of the State to the other with \nfriends, stayed on friends' living room couches--nothing fancy. The \nidea of a political ad on television in those days was to show up at \nthe TV station at the appointed hour, and as the clock ticked to 8 you \nwould look into the camera, give your statement for 30 seconds, and \nthen you were off to the next campaign stop.\n  As the campaign went on in 1954, something happened in Maine: An \nexcitement built--a buzz, I guess we would say today. Ed Muskie--\nindeed, to everyone's shock and surprise--was elected Governor in that \nyear. In those days, the Maine Governor's term was 2 years. He was \nreelected in 1956--a very successful Governor--and then was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate in 1958.\n  There is a wonderful story about when Muskie first came to the \nSenate. Lyndon Johnson, of course, was the dynamic, I would say all-\npowerful majority leader of the Senate at the time. The story is that \nJohnson took Muskie aside and said: Now, Ed, when somebody comes and \nasks you for your vote, you just tell them you haven't made up your \nmind yet. Your vote is the most valuable thing you have in the U.S. \nSenate, and keep it to yourself. And if they press you, just say, \n``Senator, they haven't gotten to the M's yet. When they do, you will \nknow how I am going to vote.''\n  This was Johnson's advice to the freshman Senator from Maine.\n  A few weeks later, apparently there was some kind of procedural vote \non the floor, and Johnson wanted to line up his votes in his Democratic \ncaucus.\n  He went to Ed Muskie and said: Ed, can I count on your support?\n  Allegedly, Muskie replied: Senator, they haven't gotten to the M's \nyet.\n  The result was that Muskie was exiled to the Public Works Committee--\nat the time one of the least desirable of committee assignments. Of \ncourse, now it is the Environment & Public Works Committee and one of \nthe most important and prestigious of our committees. But at the time \nit was the same as being sent to the outer limits by the majority \nleader, who didn't like this smart aleck from Maine.\n  But I think this story has an important and instructive ending \nbecause Ed Muskie, with his Maine work ethic, his common sense, and his \nintuition and insight, used the Public Works Committee to invent \nenvironmental law in America.\n  In 1970, 12 years later, the passage of the Clean Air Act was the \nfirst major passage of an environmental piece of legislation in \nAmerican history. There had been a few small things here and there, but \nmost States had very little in the way of environmental regulation and \ncertainly there was no national regulation. But the amazing thing, the \nastonishing thing about the passage of the Clean Air Act--and it was a \nvery important piece of legislation. It was very significant. It \naffected every business in the country. It affected the automobile \nindustry. It affected the paper and manufacturing industry. It was a \ntremendously important piece of legislation and very controversial. But \nthe Clean Air Act passed the Senate unanimously. Imagine. We can't pass \nthe time of day unanimously, and he marshaled the resources, the votes, \nand the sentiment of the entire Senate. He did it through amazingly \nhard work. They had hundreds of hearings and hundreds of hours of \nmarkup. He listened to his colleagues, he found compromises, and he \nfound ways to make it work across the entire spectrum of the Senate.\n  There were plenty of conservative Senators here in 1970. In fact, at \none point in the debate on the Clean Air Act, Howard Baker, who was the \nRepublican leader, gave his proxy to Muskie because he had to be out of \nthe Chamber for a few hours. Again, imagine today the Republican leader \ngiving his proxy to one of the Democratic Senators on a major piece of \nlegislation. I think it says something about, unfortunately, the \ndifference between then and now in the Senate, but it also says \nsomething about Muskie's leadership. It was made up in part of \nincredibly high intelligence. People who knew him well, such as Senator \nGeorge Mitchell, have said he was one of the most brilliant people they \nhave ever met. So he had high intelligence, but he also had high \nemotional intelligence. He could intuit what people needed, what they \nneeded and wanted, and what they had to hear and how to persuade them. \nBut he also had incredible perseverance and patience, and he was \nwilling to listen and understand other people's point of view.\n\n  The Clean Air Act and later the Clean Water Act in 1972 are really \nthe pillars of environmental law in this entire country. It is hard for \nus to realize today because we take for granted our commitment to \nenvironmental protection, but it didn't really exist until Ed Muskie's \nleadership in the late 1960s.\n  It is all the more remarkable for me as a political representative of \nthe State of Maine that Muskie took this step because it had a \nsignificant impact on our major industry. Maine is a pulp and paper \nState, with huge mills and outpourings into the water and into the air. \nAt the time, they were virtually untreated.\n  So this was not an insignificant act from Muskie's own political \nsituation. It wasn't as though he had a free ride on this, but I \nbelieve part of the impetus for this great action, for this great \ninsight was Muskie's being raised as a young boy in the town of Rumford \non the Androscoggin River. The Androscoggin River at one point was one \nof the most polluted rivers in America. I live on the Androscoggin \ntoday. When Muskie was a boy, the saying was that the river was too \nthick to drink and too thin to plow. It was a terrible situation. Ed \nMuskie realized that, and he realized he had to do something about it. \nSo he used the vehicle of the Public Works Committee, where he had been \nsent in exile, to achieve one of the great legislative monuments of the \n20th century.\n  He also is the father of our current budget process. He was one of \nthe Senators who put together the budget process in the mid to late \n1970s. He had an incredibly distinguished career. He was an incredible \nforce and a very powerful man.\n  I have a vivid personal recollection of him which to this day I don't \nquite know what to make of, but it is an absolutely true one. In 1968 \nhe was running for Vice President of the United States. Ed Muskie was \nHubert Humphrey's running mate. In the latter stages of the campaign--\nSeptember, October of that year, 1968--it was the last several weeks of \nthe campaign, and it was a time when Presidential and Vice Presidential \ncandidates flew around the country. They didn't even take the time to \nhave a motorcade and go into town to make a speech. The plane would \nland, the crowd would be right out on the airport runway, there would \nbe a little fence line, and the candidate would come down the stairs, \nmake a speech, and get back on the plane and go.\n  I was a law student that year at the University of Virginia, and I \nhad no connection to Maine at the time, but I somehow heard that Ed \nMuskie, the Vice Presidential candidate, was coming to Richmond, VA, \nand was going to be at the airport at 8 or whatever on Tuesday night. \nSo a bunch of us went over to Richmond to hear him. I can remember \nstanding in this crowd along a fence line with probably 300 or 400 \npeople and listening to Muskie right before the election in 1968. He \nspoke passionately about his vision for America. He spoke about what \nthis country can and should mean. And this was a very important \nelection. This was Richard Nixon versus Hubert Humphrey, and it was an \nelection decided by one vote per precinct across the country--it was \nthat close. It was a very close election.\n  Here is my strange memory, which again I say I don't really fully \nunderstand. I remember standing in the crowd listening to Muskie \nspeak--whom I didn't know at all. I had never set foot in Maine at that \npoint. I didn't know him. I hadn't met him. But I was listening to him \nspeak. And at the end of his speech, out of my mouth completely \nspontaneously came the words\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\n``We trust you.'' It was something about the man that made you feel you \ncould trust him. He was so honest, so authentic, and so entirely \nhimself. It was an amazing moment.\n  Here it is almost 50 years later, and I remember that evening in \nRichmond, VA, my first encounter with Ed Muskie.\n  I got to know him somewhat more when I worked here as a staff member \nfor his colleague Bill Hathaway, the other Senator from Maine at that \ntime. Then I had the privilege of interviewing him in my capacity as a \npublic television host for a documentary in 1981, when he retired as \nSecretary of State.\n  He had a distinguished career here in the Senate. Then he went on and \nheeded Jimmy Carter's call in 1980 to serve as Secretary of State \nduring the height of the Iran hostage crisis. He served our country \nhonorably and well during that period and then retired. But when he \nretired, he didn't stop his involvement in public affairs. He became a \nchampion of access to the legal system for the poor. He, of course, \nremained committed to the environment and had a very active life--\nmostly in Maine, in his beloved house in Kennebunkport--and was a \ncontributor right up to his death in 1996.\n  Ed Muskie is a true American hero. There is no way my poor words or \nanybody else's can really capture his career and the impact he made. I \nthink perhaps the closest I could come is to recall Sir Christopher \nWren's epitaph on his tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral. On the tomb it \nsays, ``If you seek his monument, look around you.'' If you would see \nEd Muskie's memorial, look around you. Take a deep breath. Experience \nour great rivers. Experience the environment we now have in this \ncountry which we treasure and which is so much a part of who we are \nacross the country and in, of course, the State of Maine. Ed Muskie was \na great man. He was a great member of this body and it is an honor for \nme--to say it is an honor is a gross understatement--to be standing \ntoday in his seat, the seat that he held for those important years from \n1958 to 1980 and when he served our country so, so well. Ed Muskie is a \nman who belongs to the ages, who we all miss, and who made such a \ndifference in all of our lives.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, I urge Members from both sides of the aisle \nto come together and support passage of the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act of 2013, an important and bipartisan bill that will \nimprove the effectiveness of our criminal justice system. This \nlegislation was voted unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \non October 31, 2013. It is fitting that the full Senate is considering \nthis legislation now, ahead of Crime Victims' Rights Week.\n  This important legislation, which is cosponsored by Senator John \nCornyn of Texas, reauthorizes the original Justice for All Act of 2004. \nThat landmark law took significant steps to improve the quality of \njustice in this country by increasing the resources devoted to DNA \nanalysis and other forensic science technology, establishing safeguards \nto prevent wrongful convictions, and enhancing protections for crime \nvictims. The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an \nenormous impact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them.\n  We must do more than just reauthorize these vital programs, however.\n  The legislation before us strengthens key rights for crime victims, \nreauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, includes \nprovisions to improve the quality of indigent defense, and increases \naccess to post-conviction DNA testing to protect the innocent. It also \nincludes new measures to help ensure the effective administration of \ncriminal justice in the States.\n  The reauthorization strengthens the Kirk Bloodsworth Post Conviction \nDNA Testing Grant Program. Kirk Bloodsworth was a young man just out of \nthe marines when he was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for \na heinous crime that he did not commit. He was the first person in the \nUnited States to be exonerated from a death row crime through the use \nof DNA evidence.\n  The Kirk Bloodsworth Post Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program \nprovides grants to States for testing in cases like Mr. Bloodsworth's--\nwhen someone has been convicted but significant DNA evidence was not \ntested. The reauthorization clarifies the conditions set for this \nprogram, so that participating States are required to preserve key \nevidence, and are given further guidance that will make the program \nmore effective and allow more States to participate.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2013 also takes important \nsteps to ensure that all criminal defendants, including those who \ncannot afford a lawyer, receive effective representation. It requires \nthe Department of Justice to assist States in developing an effective \nand efficient system of indigent defense, and it calls on the States to \nproduce comprehensive plans for their criminal justice systems. I know \nfrom my time as a prosecutor that the justice system only works as it \nshould when each side is well represented by competent and well-trained \ncounsel. The principle that all sides deserve zealous and effective \ncounsel is at the bedrock of our constitutional system, and I am glad \nthe legislation before us today embodies this belief.\n  The bill reauthorizes and improves key grant programs in a variety of \nareas throughout the criminal justice system. Importantly, it increases \nauthorized funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement \nGrant program, which is a vital program to assist forensic laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting those who commit those crimes.\n  It is also important to note that this bill would make all of these \nimprovements while responsibly reducing the total authorized funding \nunder the Justice for All Act. These changes will help States, \ncommunities, and the Federal government save money in the long term.\n  I thank the many law enforcement and criminal justice organizations \nthat have helped to pinpoint the needed improvements that this bill \nwill provide and I appreciate their ongoing support. I also thank \nSenators Coons, Udall of New Mexico, McConnell, Klobuchar, Franken, \nPortman, Feinstein, Hatch, Schumer, Landrieu, Burr, Collins, and \nMerkley for cosponsoring this critical legislation, and I thank the \nlead Republican cosponsor Senator Cornyn for working with me on this \nand on broader legislation to improve the use of forensic evidence in \ncriminal cases.\n  Together we will continue to work toward a criminal justice system in \nwhich the innocent remain free, the guilty are punished, and all sides \nhave the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to advance the cause \nof justice. Our criminal justice system is not perfect and we are all \nless safe when the system gets it wrong. Americans need and deserve a \ncriminal justice system that keeps us safe, ensures fairness and \naccuracy, and fulfills the promise of our Constitution. The Justice for \nAll Reauthorization Act will take important steps to bring us closer to \nthat goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1811-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1811-S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DISAPPEARANCE OF SOMBATH SOMPHONE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the \nlack of progress in the case of Sombath Somphone, who has been missing \nin Laos since December 2012. Mr. Somphone disappeared while working on \ncivil society development, and despite repeated calls by the U.S. \ngovernment for a transparent investigation\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\nand Mr. Somphone's safe return to his family, his disappearance is \nstill unexplained.\n  A respected member of the development community, Mr. Somphone has \nlived and worked for many years in Laos and his efforts to strengthen \nLaotian civil society are well documented. The circumstances of his \ndisappearance are mysterious, and, given his high profile, more than \ntroubling. Furthermore, the lack of effort on the part of the Laotian \ngovernment to investigate what has been described by many international \nobservers as a forced disappearance is deeply disappointing.\n  Mr. Somphone's courageous work on behalf of political freedom and the \nprotection of human rights in Laos is admirable, and he and others who \nengage in such pursuits should not fear for their safety, especially at \nthe hands of a government. Despite repeated offers of international \nassistance and numerous inquiries about Mr. Somphone's welfare, the \nLaotian government appears satisfied despite having made no progress on \nthe case.\n  I call on Laotian authorities to recognize the importance this has \nfor Members of Congress and the American people, and people around the \nworld, and to take all actions necessary to enable Mr. Somphone to \nreturn home to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1812-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RAY ALLEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the Senate \nfloor about Vermont's dedicated farming families. Today, I would like \nto recognize the contributions of a great Vermont farmer, at a time of \ntransition, Ray Allen of Allenholm Farm in South Hero, VT.\n  Ray has, since 1990, represented the University of Vermont as a \ndelegate to the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, \nCouncil for Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching, CARET. The \nAPLU is a research, policy, and advocacy organization representing 235 \nuniversities and public land grant institutions nationwide, and CARET \nadvocates for greater national support and understanding of the land-\ngrant university system's food and agricultural research, extension, \nand teaching programs that enhance the quality of life for all people.\n  Ray is the longest serving delegate nationally to the CARET and has \nmade many significant contributions to the university extension \ncomponent of the land grant mission. It is fitting, and should surprise \nno one that this seventh generation Vermont farmer has so truly served \nthe land grant mission, considering that Ray's ancestors began farming \nin South Hero, VT in 1870, at about the same time that Vermont Senator \nJustin Morrill gained passage of his legislation creating the Land \nGrant College system.\n  Allenholm Farm is the oldest continuously operating apple orchard in \nthe State of Vermont, and over the years has grown to be a mainstay of \nour regional and State agricultural economy.\n  In 1870, Ray Allen's great-grandfather purchased the current farm, \nmarking the beginning of a family farming tradition on lovely Grand \nIsle, VT. Today, Ray and his wife Pam run the Allenholm Farm with the \nhelp of their children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren.\n  The chain of islands running up the center of Lake Champlain was once \nhome to more than 100 commercial apple orchards. Today there are fewer, \nbut the Allen's have thrived through creativity. They have diversified \nthe farm to include many new apple varieties, and they now produce and \nretail their own cider, ice cider, hard cider, applesauce, and more \nthan 3,000 apple pies every year.\n  Making great use of their location, which is within sight of New York \nand a few miles from the Canadian border, Ray and Pam have made the \nAllenholm Farm an international destination. Visitors can rent \nbicycles, stay the night at the Bed & Breakfast overlooking the \norchards, buy maple syrup and maple creemies, and visit their petting \nzoo to meet Willie and Sassafrass, the famous kissing donkeys.\n  The Allenholm Farm AppleFest attracts up to 25,000 visitors annually \nand has yielded a bountiful harvest for the entire local economy of the \nChamplain islands.\n  Vermont's agricultural economy is thriving today as more and more of \nfarmers follow Ray and Pam's formula: Focus on superb quality, create \nvalue-added products, build the Vermont brand, provide local food to \nlocal markets, and have fun doing it. For many visitors, Ray and Pam \nAllen are the face of farming.\n  As Vermont's agricultural leaders are inclined to do, Ray has taken \non many leadership roles in his local community, as well at the State \nand National level, all in addition to his decades of service to the \nAssociation of Public Land Grant Universities. He has served as town \nauditor, justice of the peace, a member of the school board and has \nbeen chief of the rescue squad since its inception in 1973. Ray's \ncontributions to his alma mater, the University of Vermont, are too \nnumerous to list completely here, but they include current or past \nmembership on the boards of the College of Agriculture and Life \nSciences, UVM Extension, and the Alumni Council. Ray's feats as a \nstudent track star are still the subject of legend now, 50 years later, \nand two annual track trophies bear his name.\n  As a strong supporter of the land grant mission, I thank Ray Allen \nfor his service to the Association of Public Land Grant Universities as \na delegate to the Council of Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nTeaching. I am certain that Ray will be missed in this role but that he \nwill continue to build on this record of accomplishment and public \nservice in many other venues and that the seventh generation Allenholm \nFarm will continue to thrive under his leadership.\n  Marcelle and I think of Ray and Pam as very special friends and \ncherished Vermonters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1812-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1812-S1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING SUNDY BEST\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nexceptionally talented country music duo from my home State of \nKentucky. Kris Bentley and Nick Jamerson have vaulted their band, Sundy \nBest, from the small bars and music halls of eastern Kentucky into the \nnational spotlight. The story of their rise is remarkable, and one that \nis far from its conclusion.\n  Nick and Kris first met in elementary school in Prestonsburg, KY, \nwhere they both grew up in music-loving families. The two started a \nband together in high school but parted ways when Nick went to play \nfootball at Pikeville College and Kris enrolled in Centre College, \nwhere he played basketball. Nick's passion for music never subsided, \nthough, and after college he contacted Kris to inquire about purchasing \na drum set. As it happened, Kris's passion for music remained as well--\nhe didn't have a set to sell, but he would gladly come play with his \nold buddy Nick. The two friends picked up right where they left off, \nand the very next night they were playing their first gig together.\n  The band's big break came in November of 2010. Nick had just moved to \nLexington with Kris, and the two landed a gig at Redmon's, a classic \nLexington live music establishment. Previously the two had played just \nas ``Nick and Kris,'' but for a venue like Redmon's they needed a name \nthat they could promote. The two settled on one that reflected their \nmusical roots in Sunday church services. As Kris tells it, ``It was \noriginally going to be Sunday's Best but then we said, `No, Sundy \nBest.' '' The duo dropped the ``a'' from Sunday because, ``That's the \nway we talk.''\n  The show at Redmon's was an enormous success, so much so that they \nbegan to play a regular gig there. This consistent venue for their \nmusic was instrumental in establishing the band's fan base and name \nrecognition. Kris acknowledges that this was when ``people started \ntaking us seriously . . . because that's a premier music venue.''\n  Things have been looking up for Sundy Best ever since. In 2013 they \nre-released their first album, Door Without a Screen, and watched it \nclimb into the iTunes Top 10. The video for the hit song from the \nalbum, ``Home (I Wanna Go),'' helped drive the album's success and is a \nfixture on Country Music Television.\n  As a fellow Kentuckian, I am proud of the success seen by Sundy Best. \nNick and Kris are not only talented musicians, but they are also \noutstanding ambassadors for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Although \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\nmusic is spreading further across the country each day, their roots \nremain grounded in eastern Kentucky.\n  I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing the success of \nSundy Best and wishing them well with the recent release of their new \nalbum, Bring Up the Sun.\n  Kentucky Monthly recently published an article chronicling the rise \nof Sundy Best. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From Kentucky Monthly, Feb. 25, 2014]\n\n                            The Best Men Win\n\n                          (By Tricia Despres)\n\n       When kids grow up with something to prove, they can become \n     stubborn and a bit hardheaded. But when those kids grow up to \n     be adults who want to make a living as musicians . . . well, \n     they just might become superstars.\n       So goes the story of Sundy Best.\n       Blending an eclectic mix of acoustic guitar with the beat \n     of the cajon drum and the compelling vocals of Nick Jamerson \n     and Kris Bentley, Sundy Best looks as if they are about to \n     embark on a career many others are often left to dream about. \n     Just last year, the Kentucky-based duo released a deluxe \n     version of their album Door Without a Screen and watched as \n     it landed in the Top 10 on iTunes. The video for their single \n     ``Home (I Wanna Go)'' reached the top of CMT Pure's fan-voted \n     poll for multiple weeks. A brand-new album in 2014 is sure to \n     help the duo prove to the rest of the world that, sometimes, \n     the underdogs win.\n       ``Growing up, I always seemed to have a chip on my \n     shoulder,'' says Jamerson. ``As a kid who loved playing \n     sports, I was smaller than anyone else, so I always had \n     something to prove in everything that I did. It was the \n     attitude I would ultimately have with everything in my life. \n     I was just always super competitive.''\n       It was an attitude Jamerson seemed to inherit from his \n     close-knit family. ``Three of my grandparents had a college \n     degree, which, coming from a small mining town in Kentucky, \n     was not at all common,'' he recalls. ``I mean, my grandmother \n     could build anything. Being around those kinds of people all \n     my life and seeing how driven and successful they were . . . \n     it definitely made an impression on me.''\n       As a 5-foot-10 kid basketball player from Prestonsburg, \n     Bentley also was up against his share of obstacles, none of \n     which he hadn't learned to conquer during his childhood years \n     growing up within the sacred walls of the church, hence the \n     name Sundy Best. ``I would play drums every Sunday with my \n     dad and brother,'' recalls Bentley, describing himself as a \n     good kid who ``put Mom through the wringer . . . church \n     really was the only outlet to get out there and do music, \n     especially in eastern Kentucky.''\n       Besides sports and a childhood spent within the church, the \n     two also shared a musical foundation formed within their \n     homes, often spending countless hours listening to a diverse \n     mix of rock, pop, and bluegrass. ``Everyone would get \n     together at my grandparents' house and play the old bluegrass \n     standards,'' recalls Jamerson. ``The doctor up the road would \n     come over and play the fiddle, Grandpa played the banjo, \n     Grandma played guitar, and my great-aunt played the \n     mandolin.''\n       First meeting in elementary school, Jamerson and Bentley \n     would go on to form a firm foundation of friendship through \n     their teenage years, which continues to benefit them to this \n     day. ``When you know someone as long as we have, you know \n     each other's dynamics,'' says Jamerson. ``He is like a \n     brother to me. It's gratifying to do this whole music thing \n     alongside someone you have known for so long.''\n       After high school, the pair's goal to play sports often \n     competed with the draw they shared to ultimately pursue a \n     music career. ``Music was the one passion that I always had, \n     but looking back, I am glad my parents talked me into getting \n     a college degree,'' says Jamerson, who was on the Pikeville \n     College football team. ``The people I met and the experiences \n     I had in college made me the person I am now. That's where \n     songs come from. You need perspective and life lessons as a \n     writer.''\n       The end of college (Bentley attended and played basketball \n     for Centre) brought the beginning of the duo's quick, yet \n     organic, ascent to musical success. After their joint move to \n     Lexington and a brief stint working at the local cable \n     company, the two began performing at patio parties, \n     restaurants and clubs, often playing four-hour sets each \n     night. A regular gig at Lexington's Redmon's helped the two \n     establish a growing fan base eager to find out more about the \n     band.\n       ``Thank goodness for social media,'' says Bentley, who cut \n     his musical teeth trying to emulate the songs of artists such \n     as Bob Seger and Tom Petty. ``Good ol' Facebook was the only \n     way to connect to our fans and tell them where we were going \n     to be every night. We would always have 20 or 30 people from \n     eastern Kentucky who knew us from when we played sports drive \n     up on a weeknight to see us perform. Seeing that kind of \n     support when we were just out there playing cover songs was a \n     huge boost to our confidence.''\n       Then, Sundy Best recorded the song that would change their \n     career: ``Home (I Wanna Go).'' ``That song took off right \n     around the same time when the winter had set in and the patio \n     gigs had shut down,'' recalls Bentley. ``Once people heard \n     that song, the whole thing just grew. People knew we were \n     serious about doing music.''\n       In 2012, the duo recorded some of their songs that they \n     self-produced with friend and filmmaker Coleman Saunders, and \n     independently released Door Without a Screen.\n       Last year, they were asked to play the jewel of all venues: \n     the Grand Ole Opry. ``As a musician and performer, I don't \n     think I will ever be the same,'' says Jamerson. ``I cried \n     when I found out we were playing there. It was like being at \n     church and feeling something on your heart and you don't know \n     what it is. We had been touring all year, so sharing it with \n     our families was an unbelievable feeling. I mean, what else \n     could top that? I was watching Netflix the other night and \n     they were doing a two-day concert special on Neil Young and \n     were showing this concert he did at the Ryman Auditorium, and \n     I mean, he was walking through the same doors we did when we \n     were playing there for the Grand Ole Opry. Every time we get \n     the chance to play there, it ends up being quite the \n     spiritual experience.''\n       The year 2014 brings Sundy Best fans the much-anticipated \n     new album Bring Up the Sun, a collection of songs that just \n     might take their longtime fans a bit by surprise. ``Our first \n     album was quite Kentucky-centric,'' says Jamerson, who spends \n     any spare time he has at home in Lexington with his two dogs \n     and cat. ``The music just feels good in our bones. It's a \n     really broad album, which everyone we work with has a hard \n     time explaining. But everyone will find something different \n     in it. It's good music, but it's coming from a bit of a \n     different angle now, so I suppose people are going to be \n     surprised. Some people want every record to sound the same, \n     but once your fans think they know you, you are done. You \n     won't grow as musicians if they think they have you figured \n     out.''\n       ``We definitely have a vision of where we want to be,'' \n     says Bentley, who with Jamerson played more than 190 dates \n     out on the road in 2013. ``I would never have expected to be \n     where we are today just one year ago. I think 2014 is going \n     to be another growth year for us. A lot of people still don't \n     know who we are, so we want to definitely continue to play \n     new markets. We are excited to see what happens with this new \n     record and then determine what happens next.''\n       No matter where their musical journey might still yet lead \n     them, one thing is for sure: These two will continue to give \n     credit where credit is due.\n       ``You hear people all the time talking about how they are \n     Texas proud or Georgia proud or even Tennessee proud,'' says \n     Bentley. ``When you are from eastern Kentucky, you are \n     automatically proud. You can be anywhere in the world, and if \n     you meet someone from eastern Kentucky, you are immediately \n     friends. Plus, they are the craziest fans ever. We love \n     Nashville and all, but we would just rather stay right here \n     in Kentucky. The people here have been the biggest driving \n     factor in our career, and we can never be too thankful.''\n       ``Before I moved to Lexington, my whole life had been spent \n     living in eastern Kentucky. I had never had a chance to miss \n     living in the country. And as we have begun touring more, I \n     now know it was something I myself took for granted,'' says \n     Jamerson. ``We love Kentucky and will always want to carry \n     that flag . . . but we can't wait to spread the word to \n     everyone else, too.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1813-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1813-S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SYRIAN WAR CRIME TRIBUNAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senators Rubio, Murphy, Kaine, and I \nrecently introduced in the Senate a concurrent resolution on the need \nfor the investigation and prosecution of war crimes, crimes against \nhumanity, and genocide committed by any groups involved in civil war in \nSyria. Congressman Chris Smith has introduced the House version of this \nconcurrent resolution. It calls for President Obama to have our \nAmbassador to the U.N. use the influence and vote of the United States \nto promote the establishment of a Syrian war crimes tribunal. The need \nis stark. Quite simply, the terrible crimes being committed in the \ncivil war in Syria call out for justice. As such, the U.N. should \nestablish a tribunal similar to the ones created in response to the \ncharges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the \nformer Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda.\n  As the Syrian conflict entered its fourth year this month, the \nhorrific violence there continues unabated. The losses from the \nconflict are staggering. According to some estimates the death toll has \nreached more than 146,000. There are an estimated 6.5 million \ninternally displaced persons in Syria and millions of Syrian refugees \nhave fled their country.\n  Last week I had the privilege of meeting with a number of dedicated\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nChicago-area members of the Syrian-American Medical Society who \nrecently returned from a medical mission to treat Syrian patients in \nthe north of Lebanon. They shared heartbreaking stories of the Syrian \nrefugees they met and treated and appealed for continued international \nhelp for these millions of innocent victims. As a hearing I chaired in \nJanuary on Syrian refugees illustrated, this humanitarian catastrophe \nhas created grave challenges for neighboring countries that are hosting \nthe vast majority of the refugees. Additionally, the fighting in Syria \nis inflaming sectarian violence in neighbors such as Iraq and Lebanon.\n  A staggering 9.3 million Syrians inside the country are estimated to \nbe in need of assistance due to the conflict, and even more barbaric, \nstarvation is being used as a weapon of war, with an estimated 220,000 \npeople trapped in besieged areas in Syria. The Assad regime and, to a \nfar lesser extent, some opposition groups have blocked humanitarian \nassistance in a deliberate effort to increase pressure on besieged \ncivilians. If the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime wasn't \nhorrific enough, it has also utilized so-called barrel bombs, mixes of \nexplosives and shrapnel stuffed into barrels, that helicopter gunships \ndrop in civilian areas controlled by the opposition such as Aleppo.\n  The Syrian conflict has devastated even the most innocent members of \nSyrian society. I was deeply moved by the plight of the children when \nlast year I visited Kilis, a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey. Yet sadly \ntheir plight continues. In January the U.N. issued a report which \nestimated that more than 10,000 children have been killed. UNICEF said \nin March that the real number is likely to be even higher. The January \nU.N. report stated that children in Syria experienced suffering which \nwas ``unspeakable.'' Some of the reports of terrible abuses include \nsexual violence against children held in Syrian Government detention as \nwell as minors being used in combat and as human shields. In addition, \nUNICEF released a report in March that estimated there are up to 1 \nmillion children who live under siege and in hard-to-reach areas that \nUNICEF and its humanitarian partners cannot access on a regular basis.\n  As my colleague Senator McCain mentioned in his remarks in February \non the Senate floor, respected former war crimes prosecutors issued a \nreport in January based on evidence they obtained regarding torture and \nmurder by the Syrian regime. The report stated that the evidence--\nlargely provided by a Syrian defector and which includes 55,000 \nphotographic images of approximately 11,000 detained persons who had \nbeen tortured and killed by the Syrian regime--was credible. \nAdditionally, these war crimes prosecutors noted that such evidence \ncould support findings of war crimes as well as crimes against humanity \nagainst the Assad regime.\n  In 2011, I was joined by Senators Boxer, Cardin, and Menendez on a \nletter to then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice urging that Assad be referred \nby the Security Council to the International Criminal Court. Now, 2\\1/\n2\\ years later, with so many further atrocities in Syria, the need for \nholding those accountable for war crimes is as strong as ever. We, and \nother concerned countries, have an interest in seeing justice served. \nThose who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity must be put on \nnotice that the international community will strive to hold them \naccountable for their unlawful acts.\n  Unfortunately, establishing a Syrian war crimes tribunal may face \nopposition from other members of the U.N. Security Council, most \nnotably Russia. Particularly given the widespread condemnation of \nRussia illegally violating the territorial integrity of another state, \nit seems that Russian President Putin does not care about the laws or \nviews of the international community. The hypocrisy of Putin stating \nthat other countries should not intervene in Syria where there is an \nundisputed humanitarian catastrophe, while he illegally annexes the \nterritory of another state, in part on false humanitarian ground, is \nstaggering.\n  Nevertheless, if Putin wants to block establishing a Syrian war \ncrimes tribunal, let us have Russia go on the record to say why it \nopposes justice for those who have suffered so much in Syria. Let them \nexplain how Russia, having suffered its own horrific siege of Leningrad \nduring which 800,000 people--one-third of the city's population--died \nof starvation during the almost 900-day siege by the Nazis, continues \nto support the same brutal starvation techniques of its client autocrat \nin Syria, Bashar al-Assad. With these types of brazen actions and \nstatements, Putin will never earn the global respect and credibility he \nso desperately demands by invading neighboring countries, while at the \nsame time continuing to support and arm butchers such as Assad.\n  In February the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution, which \nRussia finally supported, demanding greater humanitarian access as well \nas calling on all parties to immediately cease attacks against \ncivilians and lift the siege of populated areas. Yet 1 month after the \nSecurity Council ordered all parties in Syria to allow aid workers into \nbesieged areas and stop indiscriminate attacks on civilians, a soon-to-\nbe-released U.N. report says that the Syrian Government has essentially \nignored the Security Council. Food supplies have been held up at \ngovernment checkpoints, medical supplies removed from aid convoys, \nvisas stalled for U.N. officials, and key supply routes cynically kept \nclosed. And Assad's forces persist in using brutal barrel bombs, \ncausing horrific indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians. The \ninternational community should not let this obstruction stand and must \nenforce the Security Council resolution.\n  Ultimately, as President Obama has stated, this conflict needs to be \nresolved politically. Last year, I did support the limited use of \nmilitary force when Assad broke a long-established global taboo against \nthe use of chemical weapons but also agree that a political solution \nmust ultimately be pursued in Syria. But for a long-term and stable \npolitical solution to the war there must also be justice for those who \nhave suffered so much, and a Syrian war crimes tribunal would play a \nvital role in such a process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1814-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE CALENDAR OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request at the present time relating to the nomination of \nCarolyn Hessler Radelet to be the Director of the Peace Corps.\n  I will object because I am inquiring into the circumstances related \nto the refusal of the Peace Corps to grant the Peace Corps inspector \ngeneral full and timely access to records to which the inspector \ngeneral is entitled under the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer \nProtection Act of 2011 and the Inspector General Act of 1978.\n  At a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform convened on January 15, 2014, Peace Corps inspector general \nKathy Buller detailed difficulties she has encountered in accessing \nrecords which she deemed were directly relevant to her review of Peace \nCorps' handling of reports from its volunteers who claim that they have \nbeen sexually assaulted.\n  According to Inspector General Buller's testimony, records were \nwithheld based on reasoning that directly contravenes the Kate Puzey \nAct and the Inspector General Act.\n  In addition, Inspector General Buller testified that even when \nlimited access to records was later granted, most of the relevant \ninformation was withheld under an overbroad interpretation of what \nconstitutes ``personally identifying information'' under 22 U.S.C. \nSec. 2507a(f)(1)-(2). Inspector General Buller did clarify that, \nfollowing objections from Congress, Peace Corps narrowed its \ninterpretation of ``personally identifying information'' which allowed \nher to access slightly more information relating to the subject sexual \nassaults but not everything to which the inspector general is entitled.\n  In order to exercise the oversight function envisioned by the Kate \nPuzey Act and the Inspector General Act, it is critical for the Peace \nCorps inspector general to have full and timely access to all Peace \nCorps records which she deems relevant to her review.\n  The Peace Corps apparently withheld records from the inspector \ngeneral during the nominee's tenure as the Acting Director, and I would \nlike the opportunity to understand the circumstances more fully.\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\n                                  F____\n                                 \n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SFC OLLEN HUNT\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to SFC \nretired Ollen Hunt for his exceptional dedication to duty and service \nto the U.S. Army and to the United States of America.\n  A native of McLemoresville, TN, Sergeant Hunt was drafted into the \nU.S. Army in November of 1942. Sergeant Hunt was a part of the 92nd \nInfantry Division, which was also known as ``The Buffalo Division.'' \nSergeant Hunt and his unit boarded troop ships at Camp Henry, VA, and \nsurvived the sea journey to their destination in Italy. The 92nd fought \nwith distinction and divisiveness, and contributed to the eventual \ndefeat of the Axis Powers.\n  After returning from his deployment, Sergeant Hunt returned home for \na short time before returning to assignments throughout Europe. He was \nresponsible for the food and logistics operations at various military \ninstallations. He continued his military service until retiring as a \nSergeant First Class in 1963. A year after retirement, Sergeant Hunt \naccepted a position as a flight kitchen chef in Anchorage, AK. Sergeant \nHunt and his wife Hanna owned many small businesses, including the Hof \nBrau and Sandwich Deck. He also served on several downtown merchant and \nmunicipal committees and councils, receiving numerous awards for his \ncontributions to the Anchorage community. After his ``second \nretirement'', Sergeant Hunt worked with the Veterans Administration's \nOral History project writers to create an autobiography of his life. \nHis work formed what would later become his book Buffalo Soldier: What \nI Did for My Country, What My Country Did for Me.\n  Sergeant Hunt's leadership throughout his career has positively \ninfluenced his peers and superiors, soldiers, and civilians alike. As a \nhardworking and friendly man, he will be greatly missed by his family \nand those fortunate enough to have known him.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending SFC Ollen Hunt for his service to his \ncountry in the United States Army. We wish his wife, Hannelore, and \ntheir two children, Katherine and Ollen, all the best as they celebrate \nthe life of this great man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1815-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CLAUS-M.

I would like \nto honor him and his accomplishments as an educator, historian and \nfamily man.\n  Claus emigrated to Alaska in 1954 and moved to Fairbanks in 1957 to \nattend the University of Alaska Fairbanks, graduating with double \nmajors in political science and history. He obtained his doctorate from \nWashington State University and joined the University of Alaska \nFairbanks faculty in 1969, starting his long and illustrious career as \na teacher, mentor, researcher, author and administrator.\n  Claus was a professor of history at the University of Alaska \nFairbanks until 2001. He not only taught, researched and wrote, he was \nthe director of the University of Alaska Press until 2004. Managing the \nuniversity's press office added to Dr. Naske's workload, but it was \nevidence of his love for scholarly work.\n  Claus authored and co-authored over a dozen books, including ones on \ntwo prominent political Alaskan political figures, Bob Bartlett and \nErnest Gruening and several on Alaska's history. His book Alaska: A \nHistory, in its third edition, is considered the preeminent record of \nour great State. We owe a great debt of gratitude to Claus for his \ndedication and persistence as a historian, one who will long be \nremembered.\n  Claus received many well-deserved awards throughout his life, \nincluding the 2012 Distinguished Alumnus Award, the 2001 Usibelli Award \nfor Research, the 1997 Alumni Award for Professional Excellence, and \nthe 1995 Award of Merit by the Western History Association--to name a \nfew.\n  Claus married Dinah in 1960 and had two children: Natalia-Michelle \nNan-geak and Nathaniel-Michael Noah. He and his wife have been generous \nto UAF, establishing a history scholarship and making regular donations \nto the campus public radio station.\n  Claus-M. Naske will go down in history with a sterling reputation as \na scholar, teacher and father.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1815-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1815-S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL B. OLDEN\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate \nof the accomplishments of a fellow Mississippian, Mr. Samuel B. Olden \nof Yazoo City, on the occasion of his 95th birthday.\n  Mr. Olden is from Yazoo City, the ``Gateway to the Mississippi \nDelta,'' where he was born in 1919, to a family of Mississippi \nplanters. Throughout his youth, he read widely in the B.S. Ricks \nMemorial Library--the oldest privately-funded public library in the \nState--which greatly contributed to his personal development and \nadmission into the University of Mississippi in Oxford. There, he \nreceived a B.A. and M.A., reportedly conversed with Nobel Prize-winning \nauthor William Faulkner, and was ultimately recruited to Washington, \nDC, to serve at the Department of State. Prior to American involvement \nin World War II, Mr. Olden was sent abroad as the Vice Consul at our \nembassy in Quito, Ecuador, from 1941 to 1943. Upon his return, Mr. \nOlden enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving from 1943 to 1946 at posts \nranging from Shanghai, China, to Paris, France.\n  After the war Mr. Olden transited the North Atlantic on a Liberty \nship. A fellow naval officer noted Mr. Olden's fortitude during this \nstormy passage. While tending to his ailing father back in Mississippi, \nhe received a letter from Washington asking him to consider defending \nour Nation's freedom, in a third essential way. Mr. Olden returned to \nthe District of Columbia, where he was invited to join the newly formed \nCentral Intelligence Group. Commencing in 1947, Mr. Olden spent 2 years \nin the group's Washington office, followed by 3 years in Vienna, \nAustria, where he defended freedom and democracy against Communist \naggression.\n  Following a decade in public service, Mr. Olden entered the private \nsector, where he employed his experience abroad for a predecessor of \nExxon Mobil. From 1952-1957, he was posted in East and West Nigeria, \nBritish and French Cameroon, the Congo, Chad, and Gabon. He joined \nMobil's government relations department in 1957 and returned to New \nYork. There, he attained observer status at the United Nations and \nstrode the halls with Adlai Stevenson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Later, he \nwent abroad once more to serve as general manager of Mobil's affiliates \nin Tunisia, Algeria, Peru, and Spain.\n  By 1974, Mr. Olden was fluent in English, French, German, and \nSpanish. He had connections around the world. And where did he go? He \nchose to retire to the finest place he had ever lived: Yazoo City. \nThere, he owned and operated a cattle ranch for 15 years, while \ncontinuing to pursue his passion for the study of history. He was twice \na board member and was elected president of the Mississippi Historical \nSociety, served 15 years on the State committee for the Center for the \nStudy of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, and founded \nthe Yazoo Historical Society's remarkable museum--housed in the same \nTriangle Center building where he had attended elementary school. Even \nin his nineties, he established and helped to fund the Yazoo Memorial \nLiterary Walkway, which stretches between the Triangle Center and the \nB.S. Ricks Library. The walkway memorializes more than 100 Yazooan \nauthors to include former House Minority Leader and Senator John Sharp \nWilliams, literary critic and editor Henry Herschel Brickell, Gov. \nHaley Reeves Barbour, beloved writers Willie Morris, Teresa Nicholas, \nand Ruth Williams, and educator Henry Mitchell Brickell. His large \ncollection of pre-Columbian ceramics is now on display in the \nMississippi Museum of Art in Jackson.\n  This remarkable man has served his Nation as a diplomat, military \nofficer, and emissary, during wars hot and cold. He served the world in \nthe energy industry as a global businessman of distinction. He returned \nto his hometown and has continued to serve his State, his university, \nand his community as a historian, educator and philanthropist even into \nthe 10th decade of his life. His friends across the Nation and around \nthe world celebrate with him today.\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1816-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETE BALLARD\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Pete Ballard, a \ndear friend and a truly remarkable West Virginian who is known \nthroughout the Mountain State and far past our borders for his many \ntalents, especially for his global recognition of his still life \npaintings and historic period doll creations.\n  A native of Welch, located in the southern-most part of our State in \nMcDowell County, Pete currently resides in Peterstown, an idyllic small \ntown in the rolling emerald hills of Monroe County. Although Pete's \ncareer in the arts has taken him across the country and around the \nworld, including Saudi Arabia, China and Vietnam, there has never been \na doubt that Pete's roots are truly imbedded in West Virginia.\n  After receiving a degree in education from Concord University, Pete \nbegan teaching. However, it wasn't long before Pete's propensities \nsteered him far beyond just a career in education, leading him to \npartake in many more professional ventures.\n  Today, as an award-winning educator, celebrated artist, renowned \npainter, nationally acclaimed costume designer, curator, historian, and \nfamous doll creator, Pete's passion for the arts and creativity know no \nbounds.\n  Many of Pete's paintings are now displayed in museums and art \ngalleries across the country. Today, three of Pete's exceptional \npaintings are displayed among the most celebrated collection of \nAmerican Still Life paintings at The Butler Institute, which is \nAmerica's first museum to collect American art. His work will forever \nbe a part of such an extraordinary collection of America's best \nartwork.\n  In addition to his distinguished paintings, Pete has most recently \nbeen recognized across the country for his unique creation of 19th \ncentury fashion dolls. Pete creates each doll based on meticulously \nresearched and authentic period fashion. Made from head to toe in \npapier-mache, the dolls' figures range from approximately 3 to 5 feet \ntall and wear costumes that are designed in period clothing.\n  Due to Pete's painstaking attention to detail along with his fashion \nexpertise, hard work and brilliant vision, he is no stranger to \nreceiving prestigious awards. As Governor, I was honored to name Pete \nas a Distinguished West Virginian. He has also received the Grand \nGroundhog Watcher Award. Both of these awards were created to honor \nthose who have contributed significantly to West Virginia and those who \nhave brought positive attention to our great State. He was also named \nConcord University's Golden Alumnus, is among the Outstanding Educators \nin America, and has received the Order of the Arts and Historical \nLetters from the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Pete's \npaintings and dolls have also been displayed in galas and exhibitions \naround West Virginia and across the country.\n  Despite his astounding success, Pete has never collected a dime for \nhis work. After spending 12 hours a day, 7 days a week working on each \npiece of art, he merely donates every painting and every doll he \ndoesn't hold for keepsake to charity or to art galleries.\n  It has been an honor and privilege to know such a gifted West \nVirginian. Pete Ballard's imprint will always be marked by his \nbrilliant creations and his countless contributions to the State of \nWest Virginia. I join all West Virginians in celebrating his vast \nachievements, which will live on in our history books, atop the same \nshelves as some of the most distinguished artwork of our time and \nmounted on the walls of esteemed museums.\n  After all these years, I continue to look forward to viewing many \nmore paintings and doll creations because at the age of 83, Pete \ncontinues to work on his art every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1816-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PHYLLIS RHODES\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to thank Phyllis Rhodes for \nher outstanding service to the Municipality of Anchorage, the Federal \ncourt system, and Identity, Inc. on the occasion of her retirement.\n  Born in Arizona and raised in Texas, Phyllis and her former husband \nmoved to Alaska in 1967 with their young daughter Anne, making their \nhome in Anchorage. A second daughter, Emily, made her appearance after \nthe family relocated to Alaska. Since her arrival in Alaska Phyllis' \ncontributions to the cause of equality for the LGBTQ community, and all \nAlaskans, has become legendary.\n  Phyllis started out as the volunteer coordinator for Identity, Inc. \nbut with her usual passion and commitment, she started picking up \nspeed, eventually becoming the unpaid executive director of the \norganization. Over the course of her 10 years as executive director of \nIdentity, Inc. Phyllis has taken the organization from obscurity to \nhigh visibility in Anchorage and across Alaska. During Phyllis' tenure, \nIdentity, Inc. expanded its programs and began outreach to new \naudiences. The creation of an advocacy team has led to open dialogues \nwith Alaska businesses, churches, educational institutions and other \norganizations. Within the LGBTQ community, Phyllis is the recognized \nheart and soul of Identity, Inc.\n  I would like to extend my deepest thanks to Phyllis for her many \nyears of advocating for equality.

Colonel Mize was a native of Marshall County and an American \nhero. He embodied the ideals of service and courage that make our State \nproud.\n  Colonel Mize was born on August 28, 1931, in Marshall County, and \ndropped out of high school after ninth grade to provide for his family. \nHe was rejected for enlistment by the Army numerous times because he \nwas blind in one eye and they claimed he was too small. Eventually he \nwas accepted and joined the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  He is perhaps best remembered by his defense of Outpost Harry when it \nwas attacked during the Korean war. Colonel Mize bravely protected \ninjured comrades and held opposition forces at bay, valiantly risking \nhis life for others. For this intrepid gallantry, Colonel Mize earned a \nMedal of Honor, which remains on display in the Guntersville Museum.\n  Colonel Mize went on to join the Special Forces and served 3\\1/2\\ \ntours in Vietnam with the Green Berets and then served as an Active-\nDuty advisor to National Guard Special Forces units. Throughout the \ncourse of his military career, he was awarded the Silver Star, the \nLegion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and, of course, the \nMedal of Honor. Colonel Mize continued to be active in veterans' events \nand where he was known and honored by all. He retired in 1981 after 31 \nyears of service.\n  Mary and I mourn his passing and send our condolences to his wife \nBetty, his daughter Teresa Peterson, and his six brothers and sisters. \nAlabama has lost a true hero and his legend will grow. I was honored to \nget to know him.

McCrary, \nwho retired this month from his position as the president and chief \nexecutive officer of Alabama Power Company.\n  Mr. McCrary's involvement with Alabama Power extends back to the \nsummer of 1970, when he joined the company following his freshman year \nat Auburn University. During a long and distinguished career, he \nassumed positions of increasing responsibility, rising from vice \npresident for Southern Nuclear Operating Company, to president of \nSouthern Company Generation, chief production officer of Southern \nCompany and president of Southern Power Company. On October 25, 2001, \nMr. McCrary became the tenth president and CEO of Alabama Power, which \ngenerates electricity for over 1.4 million Alabama customers.\n  A Birmingham native, Mr. McCrary attended Shades Valley High School \nand received his bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from \nAuburn University, followed by a juris doctor from Birmingham School of \nLaw. He was admitted to the Alabama State Bar in 1979.\n  Mr. McCrary is married to the former Phyllis Brantley of Birmingham \nand is the father of two sons, Doug and Alex.\n  Throughout his tenure at Alabama Power, Mr. McCrary has served the \ncompany and its customers with the highest standards of integrity and \nprofessionalism. He also oversaw Alabama Power during some of our \nState's most severe natural disasters, including Hurricane Ivan in \n2004, which caused 825,701 outages, the largest number of outages in \ncompany history; Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with 636,891 outages; and \nthe tornado disaster on April 27, 2011 with 412,000 outages. In the \nwake of these disasters, Mr. McCrary initiated the policy of \npublicizing when customers could expect their power to be restored. \nThis practice of announcing utility restoration commitments has since \nbecome an industry standard.\n  Mr. McCrary also pioneered ``Target Zero,'' a program for ensuring \nthat employees are properly trained and equipped to do their jobs \nsafely. This practice too has become a touchstone within the utility \nindustry.\n  Mr. McCrary is a dynamic leader both in his community and throughout \nthe State of Alabama, and serves as chairman of the Economic \nDevelopment Partnership of Alabama and on the boards of Regions \nFinancial Corporation, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International Inc., \nProtective Life Corporation, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, \nSouthern Research Institute, and the Auburn University Board of \nTrustees.\n  Committed to fostering economic development at both the regional and \nState levels, Mr. McCrary has advanced cooperative efforts between \ncities, counties, and business leaders in order to bring several \nindustries, including automotive, aerospace, and steel manufacturers to \nAlabama.\n  Please join me and Senator Sessions in congratulating Charles on his \nretirement and in thanking him for his leadership at Alabama Power, for \nhis dedication to improving his local community, and for his decades of \nservice to the great State of Alabama. We wish him all the best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1817-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1228.

A bill to prevent harassment at institutions of higher \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as many in this Chamber know, I am very \nproud of the many ways my home State of Washington is leading the way. \nOur State is an economic leader. We are home to the American aerospace \nindustry, we have a thriving agricultural sector, and dozens of \ncompanies creating new products and new jobs with cutting-edge \ntechnology. We are a leader in protecting the environment and educating \nour children. Washington State is also the place that tens of thousands \nof servicemembers and veterans call home.\n  Last, but not least, I could not be more proud of our State's history \nof protecting the rights of all of our citizens, including members of \nthe LGBT community. We know in Washington State that it is wrong to \ndiscriminate against people. We know that a person's race, religion, or \ngender have nothing to do with their worth as a human being, and we \nknow that actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity \ndon't either. We get that in my home State of Washington, but we can't \nstop working until the same is true in all 50 States, and that is why I \nhave come to the Senate floor today.\n  I want to share with everyone a story about a young man by the name \nof Kris. Kris will be the first to tell you he has not led the easiest \nof lives. After turning 18 years old and aging out of the foster care \nsystem in Texas, Kris found himself homeless at 18 years old in Houston \nand sleeping on whatever park bench or apartment roof was available to \nhim that evening.\n  As luck would have it, one night while Kris was searching for a \npublic restroom to use, he stumbled on an admissions fair for the \nUniversity of Houston's downtown campus. Kris had always had ambitions \nto go to college, but because of his very unstable childhood and \nminimal income, pursuing higher education was never a priority. Once he \nlearned that night that tuition for the school was waived for foster \nsystem alumni, this dream seemed more like a reality so Kris decided to \nenroll.\n  He went to school, declared his major in social work, and settled \ninto college life. He made friends and participated in extracurricular \nactivities on campus.\n  In fact, Kris got so involved that one of his good friends, Isaac, \ninvited him to be his running mate for the upcoming student government \nelection. Kris was very excited about that idea and realized it was his \nopportunity to make a real difference for many of the students on \ncampus who had been through some of the same trying experiences he had.\n  Kris and Isaac kicked off their campaign and pursued elective office. \nThen 1 day--in fact 1 year ago this month--Kris was called into the \ndean of students office. Kris sat down and the dean reached into his \nbriefcase and pulled out a stack of fliers with Kris's photo on each \nand every one of them with a big X across his picture. In big, bold \nletters across the top of the flier, it read: ``WANT AIDS?'' Across the \nbottom of that flier it read: ``Don't Support the Isaac and Kris \nHomosexual Agenda.'' On the back of the flier--unbelievably--was a copy \nof Kris's official\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nprivate medical record displaying in plain view that Kris was HIV \npositive. Stunning. I am sure every one of you are as stunned as I was.\n  The dean then informed Kris that these had been found all over the \ncampus. As if the situation couldn't get any worse, the dean told Kris \nthat there is nothing the university or the administration could do \nabout it--nothing.\n  At one point Kris said the administration even accused him of being \nresponsible for these acts. Kris was told the administration's sole \nresponsibility was to simply inform him this was going on and nothing \nmore. They just had to make sure he knew about it.\n  Kris was told that words such as homosexual or AIDS were proper \nterms, protected speech, and not grounds for punishment.\n  As you can imagine, Kris was devastated. He didn't attend class for \nweeks after that. His friends, family, and loved ones started to \nseriously worry about his well-being.\n  In the meantime, the word of this and Kris's status as HIV positive, \nas you can imagine, spread like wildfire across the campus. While Kris \nhad been out to a small group of friends, there was no going back once \nthe local paper picked up on the story which eventually circulated in \nthe national media.\n  Thankfully, there is a happy ending to this heartbreaking story. In \nyet another example of how the younger generation in our country is \nswiftly helping to turn the tide against intolerance, Kris and Isaac \nwon that election, and Kris served a term as the student body vice \npresident. Kris has now moved on to serve in a different but somewhat \nsimilar capacity, and that is as a congressional intern here in my \noffice in Washington, DC. I am proud to say that Kris is here with us \non the floor today. And just like the fate he found that one night in \nsearch of a public restroom, Kris now has another chance to be part of \na life-changing experience because today I have come to the floor to \nreintroduce the Tyler Clemente Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of \n2014.\n  As many of you may remember, this legislation is named after Tyler \nClemente. He was an 18-year-old freshman at Rutgers University. Back in \n2010, without his knowledge, Tyler's roommate streamed video footage on \nthe Internet of Tyler in his dorm room being intimate with another \nmale. After his roommate and another student invaded his privacy in \nsuch a serious way and continued to harass him over the Internet, Tyler \nleapt off the George Washington Bridge and sadly took his own life.\n  When I sat down and spoke with Kris about this recently, he told me \nhow his story was very close to ending just like Tyler's story. He \ndidn't have anyone on campus to turn to. Since the administration said \nthey were unable to do anything about this hate crime, Kris felt he had \nno opportunity for closure.\n  Kris told me:\n\n       For most young people, when things like that happen, we \n     have got to have people who are going to be proactive in \n     helping them. And not someone telling them there's nothing we \n     can do to help you.\n\n  Quite shockingly, despite statistics telling us that LGBT students \nare nearly twice as likely to experience harassment when compared to \ntheir heterosexual peers, there is no Federal requirement that colleges \nand universities have policies to protect their students from \nharassment.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about this legislation.\n  The legislation I am introducing will require colleges and \nuniversities that receive Federal aid to establish anti-harassment \npolicies for students no matter who they are or what they identify \nwith, and they will be required to have the language of those policies \neasily accessible. It will recognize cyber bullying of all kinds as \nserious means of harassment. Finally, the Tyler Clementi act authorizes \ncompetitive grants for schools to initiate or expand programs to \nprevent these kinds of things from happening, to provide counseling for \nvictims of the accused, and to train everyone on campus about how to \nprevent this in the future.\n  When I was back home last week in Spokane, I told Kris's story, just \nas I did today, and talked about the desperate need for these kinds of \nprotections. I am sure, as with many of those listening, most of my \nconstituents were pretty surprised to learn these policies aren't \nalready in place at all of our institutions of higher learning. I \ncouldn't agree more. Why aren't colleges and universities across our \ncountry all being proactive in establishing these programs and points \nof contact for students such as Tyler or Kris who have experienced or \ncould experience such a life-changing event?\n  While many schools currently have successful prevention and \ncounseling programs in place, students shouldn't have to take their \nhealth and safety into account when they decide where they are going to \nstudy in this country.\n  Kris recounted for me how each day during this horrible experience he \nwould awaken, and there were 5 or 6 seconds where he would feel normal \nagain, as if nothing had happened. But then reality would set in, and \nit felt as though a ton of bricks had fallen on top of him. Fortunately \nfor Kris, he was able to lean on the campus LGBT community for support \nduring this very trying time. But he said:\n\n       If I hadn't reached out to the community, I probably \n     wouldn't be here today. Every day going to school felt like a \n     battlefield.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are others similar to Kris who don't have that \npoint of contact on campus--a supportive parent or a tight-knit group \nof friends who help them get through these kinds of experiences.\n  I am very proud to be here today, with the support of my outstanding \ncosponsor, Senator Baldwin, to take a major step to change this.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to pay tribute to my \nfriend Senator Frank Lautenberg and his staff for their tireless work \nto craft this original bill which serves as a tremendous honor to the \nlife of Tyler Clementi. No student, whether they are gay or straight or \nBlack or White or Christian or Muslim, should have to face \ndiscrimination and harassment in pursuit of their education. While I \nknow it is impossible to eradicate all bad behavior from our society, \nwe have to arm our campuses with the tools and resources necessary to \nnot only efficiently and effectively support the victims but also to \ntake action against those who have perpetrated such senseless crimes.\n  That is why I am here today. I am very proud to introduce this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to thank Kris for his courage in speaking out and his ability \nto be here today to make sure no other student in our country ever has \nto go through what he did.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2177. A bill to establish an Office of Forensic Science and a \nForensic Science Board, to strengthen and promote confidence in the \ncriminal justice system by ensuring scientific validity, reliability, \nand accuracy in forensic testing, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, from DNA to digital evidence, prosecutors, \ndefense attorneys, and judges are becoming increasingly reliant on the \ncollection and analysis of various forms of forensic evidence in a \ncriminal investigation or prosecution. It is therefore all the more \nimportant that we strengthen our confidence in the criminal justice \nsystem, and the evidence it relies upon, by ensuring that forensic \nevidence and testimony is accurate, credible, and scientifically \ngrounded.\n  I am proud to introduce today the Criminal Justice and Forensic \nScience Reform Act. This legislation represents a comprehensive and \ncommonsense approach toward guaranteeing the effectiveness and \nscientific integrity of forensic evidence used in criminal cases, and \nin ensuring that Americans can have faith in their criminal justice \nsystem. The bill is also bipartisan, and I am pleased that Senator \nCornyn has agreed to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Over the course of the past 5 years, my staff and I have spent \ncountless hours talking to prosecutors, defense attorneys, law \nenforcement officers, judges, forensic practitioners, academic experts, \nand many, many others to learn as much as we could about what is \nhappening in the forensic sciences and what needs to be done. As this \neffort has progressed, I have been disturbed to learn about still more \ncases in which innocent people may have been convicted, and perhaps \neven executed, in part due to faulty forensic\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nevidence or the lack of valid forensic evidence. Since the first post-\nconviction DNA exoneration in the United States in 1989, there have \nbeen 314 DNA exonerations. These exonerees spent an average of 13.5 \nyears in prison, amounting to an astounding total of 4,202 years. It is \na double tragedy when an innocent person is convicted. An innocent \nperson suffers, and a guilty person remains free, leaving us all less \nsafe. We must do everything we can to avoid that untenable outcome.\n  It has also become abundantly clear through the course of this \ninquiry that the men and women who test and analyze forensic evidence \ndo tremendous work that is vital to our criminal justice system. I \nremember their important contributions and hard work from my days as a \nprosecutor in Vermont, and the rapid development and expansion of the \nforensic science disciplines since that time has been extraordinary. So \ntheir work is even more important today, and we need to strengthen the \nfield of forensics, and the justice system's confidence in it, so that \ntheir hard work can be consistently relied upon, as it should be.\n  Everyone recognizes the need for forensic evidence that is accurate \nand reliable. Prosecutors and law enforcement officers want evidence \nthat can be relied upon to determine guilt and prove it beyond a \nreasonable doubt in a court of law. Defense attorneys want strong \nevidence that can be used to exclude innocent people from suspicion. \nForensic science practitioners want their work to have as much \ncertainty as possible and to be able to testify in court with \nconfidence and integrity. All scientists and all attorneys who care \nabout these issues want the scientific analysis that is admitted as \nevidence in the courtroom to meet the same rigorous testing and \nresearch standards found in the laboratory.\n  There is general agreement that the forensic sciences can be improved \nthrough strong and unassailable research to test and establish the \nvalidity of the forensic disciplines, as well as the application of \nconsistent and established standards in the field. There is also a dire \nneed for well managed and appropriately directed funding for research, \ndevelopment, training, and technical assistance. It is a good \ninvestment that will lead to fewer trials and appeals, and will reduce \ncrime by ensuring that those who commit serious offenses are promptly \ncaptured and convicted. There is also broad consensus that all forensic \nlaboratories should be required to meet rigorous accreditation \nstandards and that forensic practitioners should be required to obtain \nmeaningful certification.\n  Finally, there is wide acknowledgement about the need for \ncomprehensive legislation to address all of these issues. I first \nintroduced a version of this legislation in 2011, after an extensive \nprocess of consultation with experts and stakeholders that included \nthree Judiciary Committee hearings, dozens of meetings with individuals \nand organizations, and multiple drafts and revisions of legislative \nproposals. We have continued to refine this bill over the past 3 years, \nand the legislation Senator Cornyn and I introduce today is the product \nof that ongoing conversation.\n  I have been encouraged by the efforts of the Department of Justice \nand National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to implement \nadministratively some of the basic structural reforms contained in our \nbill, pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding that led to the \nformation of the National Commission on Forensic Science. However, \nexecutive action is not enough. Congress must enact comprehensive \nforensic science reform legislation, and I look forward to working with \nthe Department of Justice, NIST, the National Science Foundation, and \nothers to make sure we implement the necessary reforms as expeditiously \nas possible.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Improving the reliability of forensic \nevidence does not advance the interests of just prosecutors or \ndefendants, or of Democrats or Republicans. It is in the interest of \njustice. Senator Cornyn recognizes this, and I am proud to have him as \na cosponsor of this important legislation. We will continue to work \ndiligently with senators on both sides of the aisle, and I hope many \nother senators will join us to cosponsor this legislation, and work \nwith me to ensure its passage.\n  I want to thank the forensic science practitioners, experts, \nadvocates, law enforcement personnel, judges, and so many others whose \ninput forms the basis for this legislation. Their passion for this \nissue and for getting it right gives me confidence that we will work \ntogether successfully to make much needed progress in implementing \ncomprehensive forensic reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds and declares the following:\n       (1) The Russian Government has deliberately blocked the \n     Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of \n     information and has provided alternative news and information \n     that is both inaccurate and inflammatory.\n       (2) United States international programming exists to \n     advance the United States interests and values by presenting \n     accurate and comprehensive news and information, which is the \n     foundation for democratic governance.\n       (3) The opinions and views of the Ukrainian people, \n     especially those people located in the eastern regions and \n     Crimea, are not being accurately represented in Russian \n     dominated mass media.\n       (4) Russian forces have seized more than five television \n     stations in Crimea and taken over transmissions, switching to \n     a 24/7 Russian propaganda format; this increase in \n     programming augments the already robust pro-Russian \n     programming to Ukraine.\n       (5) United States international programming has the \n     potential to combat this anti-democratic propaganda.\n       (b) Programming.--Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), \n     Incorporated, and the Voice of America service to Ukraine and \n     neighboring regions shall--\n       (1) provide news and information that is accessible, \n     credible, and accurate;\n       (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to \n     highlight inconsistencies and misinformation provided by \n     Russian or pro-Russian media outlets;\n       (3) prioritize programming to areas where access to \n     uncensored sources of information is limited or non-existent, \n     especially populations serviced by Russian supported media \n     outlets;\n       (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational \n     presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea;\n       (5) promote democratic processes, respect for human rights, \n     freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; and\n       (6) take necessary preparatory steps to continue and \n     increase programming and content that promotes democracy and \n     government transparency in Russia.\n       (c) Programming Surge.--RFE/RL, Incorporated, and Voice of \n     America programming to Ukraine and neighboring regions \n     shall--\n       (1) prioritize programming to eastern Ukraine, including \n     Crimea, and Moldova, and to ethnic and linguistic Russian \n     populations, as well as to Tatar minorities;\n       (2) prioritize news and information that directly \n     contributes to the target audiences' understanding of \n     political and economic developments in Ukraine and Moldova, \n     including countering misinformation that may originate from \n     other news outlets, especially Russian supported news \n     outlets;\n       (3) provide programming content 24 hours a day, seven days \n     a week to target populations, using all available and \n     effective distribution outlets, including--\n       (A) at least 8 weekly hours of total original television \n     and video content in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages, \n     not inclusive of live video streaming coverage of breaking \n     news, to be distributed on satellite, digital, and through \n     regional television affiliates by the Voice of America; and\n       (B) at least 14 weekly hours the total audio content in \n     Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages to be distributed on \n     satellite, digital, and through regional radio affiliates of \n     RFE/RL, Incorporated;\n       (4) expand the use, audience, and audience engagement of \n     mobile news and multimedia platforms by RFE/RL, Incorporated, \n     and the Voice of America, including through Internet-based \n     social networking platforms; and\n       (5) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates \n     to seek and start co-production for new, original content, \n     when possible, to increase distribution.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for fiscal year 2014, in addition to funds \n     otherwise made available for such purposes, up to $10,000,000 \n     to carry out programming in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, \n     and Tatar language services of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the \n     Voice of America, for the purpose of bolstering existing \n     United States programming to the people of Ukraine and \n     neighboring regions, and increasing programming capacity and \n     jamming circumvention technology to overcome any disruptions \n     to service.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 15 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the \n     Senate a detailed report on plans to increase broadcasts \n     pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Coats):\n  S.J.

Res. 402\n\n       Whereas throughout the history of the United States, women \n     have made and continue to make invaluable contributions to \n     society that strengthen the political, social, and economic \n     fabric of the Nation and improve the lives of countless \n     individuals;\n       Whereas women in the United States have been and continue \n     to be leaders in promoting justice and equality during times \n     of great difficulty for the Nation;\n       Whereas women in the United States have played a pivotal \n     role in ensuring freedom and security in the United States;\n       Whereas section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 (34 Stat. \n     1228) left thousands of women born in the United States, such \n     as Elsie Knutson Moren from Minnesota and Theresa Rosella \n     Schwan from Wisconsin, stateless and without a nationality \n     after marrying a foreign national;\n       Whereas section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 caused \n     thousands of United States women, such as Lorella Martorana \n     from Pennsylvania who lost her citizenship and was not able \n     to vouch for her husband during his naturalization \n     proceedings, and Lena Weide Demke from South Dakota who lost \n     her citizenship and was almost deported during World War I, \n     to have their loyalties questioned, face harassment, and be \n     subject to deportation for various legal infractions;\n       Whereas section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 affected \n     numerous women, such as Florence Bain Gual, a New York City \n     school teacher whose tenure was stripped after 15 years of \n     teaching because she married a foreign national, causing them \n     to face difficulties providing for their families because \n     they lost, or were not able to gain, public employment after \n     marrying a foreign national;\n       Whereas section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 prevented \n     women in the United States, such as Ethel MacKenzie from \n     California who was unable to register to vote because she \n     married a foreign national, from participating in the \n     political process and casting ballots in various elections;\n       Whereas section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 is \n     similar to discriminatory State laws that criminalized or \n     nullified marriages between individuals of different races;\n       Whereas the revocation of citizenship restricted the \n     ability of numerous women in the United States to own houses \n     and real estate;\n       Whereas an acknowledgment of the actions of the Senate that \n     have contributed to discrimination against women will not \n     erase the past, but will highlight the injustices of the \n     national experience and help build a better, stronger, and \n     more equal Nation; and\n       Whereas the Senate recognizes the importance of addressing \n     the error of section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 in \n     order to educate the public and future generations regarding \n     the impact of this law on women and to prevent a similar law \n     from being enacted in the future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\n       (1) acknowledges that section 3 of the Expatriation Act of \n     1907 (34 Stat. 1228) is incompatible with and antithetical to \n     the core principle that all persons, regardless of gender, \n     race, religion, or ethnicity, are created equal;\n       (2) expresses sincere sympathy and regret to the \n     descendants of individuals whose citizenship was revoked \n     under section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907, who suffered \n     injustice, humiliation, and inequality, and who were deprived \n     of constitutional protections accorded to all citizens of the \n     United States; and\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment to preserving civil rights and \n     constitutional protections for all people of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1832-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 403--CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF \n TURKEY IN RESTRICTING FREE EXPRESSION AND INTERNET FREEDOM ON SOCIAL \n                                 MEDIA\n\n  Mr. MURPHY (for himself and Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2183) entitled ``United States International \n     Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has been asked to take up and \npass by unanimous consent House legislation on U.S. international \nprogramming to Ukraine and neighboring regions. This House bill directs \nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors to increase programming in the \nVoice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Ukrainian, Balkan, \nRussian, and Tatar language services, and authorizes up to an \nadditional $10,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 for this purpose.\n  We all support Ukraine's democracy and territorial integrity, and \nwant to provide credible news and information to people in Ukraine \nwhose access to uncensored information has been blocked by the Russian \nGovernment. I intend to ensure that current programming for Ukraine, \nRussia, and neighboring regions is not reduced in fiscal year 2014. But \nI want to remind Senators, as well as Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, that the Congress already enacted the fiscal year 2014 \nfunding level for U.S. international broadcasting to Ukraine and other \nregions of the world.\n  The House bill we are adopting today does not appropriate additional \nfunds. Nor does it provide offsets for the cost of additional \nbroadcasting to Ukraine, Russia or the other regions specified. As \ndrafted it is an unfunded mandate, which as a practical matter has no \neffect unless we are to reduce broadcasting to other critical countries \nor regions, such as Burma and Tibet, which I doubt Senators of either \nparty would support.\n  Consequently, this bill should be interpreted as authorizing funds to \nbe appropriated for the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty to Ukraine and neighboring countries, consistent with the role \nof the House authorizing committee from which it originated. As \nChairman of the Department of State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nthat funds international broadcasting programs, I will work with the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors to ensure that additional funds are \nappropriated for these language services in fiscal year 2015 to enable \nthem to sustain and strengthen critical broadcasts and programming to \nUkraine, Russia, and neighboring regions.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2183) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds and declares the following:\n       (1) The Russian Government has deliberately blocked the \n     Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of \n     information and has provided alternative news and information \n     that is both inaccurate and inflammatory;\n       (2) United States international programming exists to \n     advance the United States interests and values by presenting \n     accurate and comprehensive news and information, which is the \n     foundation for democratic governance;\n       (3) The opinions and views of the Ukrainian people, \n     especially those people located in the eastern regions and \n     Crimea, are not being accurately represented in Russian \n     dominated mass media;\n       (4) Russian forces have seized more than five television \n     stations in Crimea and taken over transmissions, switching to \n     a 24/7 Russian propaganda format; this increase in \n     programming augments the already robust pro-Russian \n     programming to Ukraine;\n       (5) United States international programming has the \n     potential to combat this anti-democratic propaganda.\n       (b) Programming.--Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), \n     Incorporated, and the Voice of America service to Ukraine and \n     neighboring regions shall--\n       (1) provide news and information that is accessible, \n     credible, and accurate;\n       (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to \n     highlight inconsistencies and misinformation provided by \n     Russian or pro-Russian media outlets;\n       (3) prioritize programming to areas where access to \n     uncensored sources of information is limited or non-existent, \n     especially populations serviced by Russian supported media \n     outlets;\n       (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational \n     presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea;\n       (5) promote democratic processes, respect for human rights, \n     freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; and\n       (6) take necessary preparatory steps to continue and \n     increase programming and content that promotes democracy and \n     government transparency in Russia.\n       (c) Programming Surge.--RFE/RL, Incorporated, and Voice of \n     America programming to Ukraine and neighboring regions \n     shall--\n       (1) prioritize programming to eastern Ukraine, including \n     Crimea, and Moldova, and to ethnic and linguistic Russian \n     populations, as well as to Tatar minorities;\n       (2) prioritize news and information that directly \n     contributes to the target audiences' understanding of \n     political and economic developments in Ukraine and Moldova, \n     including countering misinformation that may originate from \n     other news outlets, especially Russian supported news \n     outlets;\n       (3) provide programming content 24 hours a day, seven days \n     a week to target populations, using all available and \n     effective distribution outlets, including--\n       (A) at least 8 weekly hours of total original television \n     and video content in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages, \n     not inclusive of live video streaming coverage of breaking \n     news, to be distributed on satellite, digital, and through \n     regional television affiliates by the Voice of America; and\n       (B) at least 14 weekly hours the total audio content in \n     Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages to be distributed on \n     satellite, digital, and through regional radio affiliates of \n     RFE/RL, Incorporated;\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n       (4) expand the use, audience, and audience engagement of \n     mobile news and multimedia platforms by RFE/RL, Incorporated, \n     and the Voice of America, including through Internet-based \n     social networking platforms; and\n       (5) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates \n     to seek and start co-production for new, original content, \n     when possible, to increase distribution.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for fiscal year 2014, in addition to funds \n     otherwise made available for such purposes, up to $10,000,000 \n     to carry out programming in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, \n     and Tatar language services of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the \n     Voice of America, for the purpose of bolstering existing \n     United States programming to the people of Ukraine and \n     neighboring regions, and increasing programming capacity and \n     jamming circumvention technology to overcome any disruptions \n     to service.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 15 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the \n     Senate a detailed report on plans to increase broadcasts \n     pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1835-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MILITARY AND VETERANS CAREGIVER MONTH\n\n  Mr. KING.

Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Maine and \nappreciate the conversations we have had in this past week. He has \ntaken a journey to the north that most of us only dream about. He is \nengaged in issues I care deeply about as it relates to the Arctic. \nAlthough I know that was not the discussion my colleague was speaking \nto earlier, I just wanted to note while my friend from Maine was still \non the floor that I look forward to working on these issues of great \nimportance not only to my State but truly to our entire Nation and \nArctic Nation.\n  I come to the floor this evening to speak very briefly about the \nphysical security of our Nation's power grid, which is a very important \nsubject. Recently, there were stories in the Wall Street Journal about \nan attack on the California Metcalf substation that happened last April \nand has drawn considerable attention. While those stories about that \nattack highlighted potential vulnerabilities, my principal focus will \nbe to highlight not only the safeguards that are already in place to \nprotect the Nation's bulk power system but also to announce a step that \nI believe is now necessary to prevent the undue release of sensitive \nnonpublic information.\n  First and foremost--and I think this is important for people to \nrecognize--it is important to remember that during the Metcalf \nincident, the PG system did not lose power. In fact, it was an \nincident that many didn't know had taken place until months after \nbecause there was no loss of power. I think this fact emphasizes the \ngrid's resiliency and the importance of building redundancy into the \nbulk power system.\n  As usual, the electric industry has learned from and responded to--\nappropriately responded--the California incident. At the end of last \nyear the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security--along with the \nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, along with \nthe Federal Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and the FBI began a cross-\ncountry tour of 10 cities in order to brief utility operators and local \nlaw enforcement on the lessens that were learned from Metcalf. \nGovernment officials discussed mitigation strategies and meeting \nparticipants were able to develop some pretty important relationships \nbetween first responders and the industry.\n  In fact, as a result of the mandatory requirements of the 2005 Energy \nPolicy Act, the electric industry has invested significant resources to \naddress both physical and cyber security threats and vulnerabilities. \nThrough partnerships with various Federal agencies, the industry is \nkeenly focused on preparation, prevention, response, and recovery.\n  For example, NERC holds yearly security conferences and a grid \nexercise which tests and prepares industry on physical and cyber \nsecurity events. Yet former FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff was quoted in \nthe Wall Street Journal calling the Metcalf incident ``the most \nsignificant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has \never occurred.''\n  In my view, comments such as these are certainly sensational. \nDepending on the factual context, they can actually be reckless.\n  Although the topic of physical security warrants discussion--\nabsolutely warrants discussion and debate--we have to be prudent about \ninformation for the public sphere. Many government leaders are privy to \nconfidential and sensitive information that if not treated carefully \ncould provide a roadmap to terrorists or other bad actors about our \nvulnerabilities. At a minimum, government officials have a duty to \nsafeguard sensitive information that they learn in their official \ncapacity.\n  A story that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 13 was, I \nbelieve, shocking because it included sensitive information about the \nNation's energy infrastructure that the newspaper said came from \ndocuments that were created at FERC. Although the Wall Street Journal \ndid not name specific facilities at risk, it did detail the geographic \nregions and the number of facilities that if simultaneously disabled \ncould cause serious harm. The March 13 article claimed the potential \nfor a national blackout.\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n  I want to commend FERC Chair Cheryl LaFleur for her statement \nregarding the publication of this information. I thank Commissioner \nTony Clark as well for his statement about the matter.\n  I think it is fortunate our current FERC Commissioners are an \nindependent lot. I understand that the Commission is looking into this \nmatter, including the question of how sensitive internal FERC documents \nmade their way into a very high-profile news article. I urge FERC to be \nvery diligent in this matter and truly leave no stone unturned.\n  I have grave questions about the irresponsible release of nonpublic \ninformation that unduly pinpoints potential vulnerabilities of our \nNation's grid. If this conduct is not already illegal, I have suggested \nit should be. The source of the leaked information appears to be \nsomeone with access to highly sensitive, narrowly distributed FERC \ndocuments. Releasing this sensitive information for publication has put \nthe Nation potentially at greater risk and potentially endangered \nlives, including those of the many good people who are faithfully \nworking every day to maintain and to protect the grid.\n  In order to learn what has happened and to determine how better to \nsafeguard critical information as steps are being taken to make the \ngrid less vulnerable, my colleague, the chairman of the energy \ncommittee, Senator Landrieu, and I have written to the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Energy whose oversight includes FERC.\n  It is our understanding that the IG has already begun an inquiry into \nthis matter. We have asked him to conclude his inquiry as soon as \npossible. We have also asked for his immediate assurance that if the \ninquiry must ripen into an investigation, that he will--as we have \nevery confidence he would--follow the information he learns wherever it \nleads.\n  We are eager to receive recommendations to improve the safeguard of \nkeeping sensitive information from disclosure. We have also asked the \nIG to look into the obligations of current and former FERC \nCommissioners and employees with respect to nonpublic information. I \nwould certainly hope the inspector general's inquiry leads to the \nidentification of the person or persons who provided this sensitive, \nnonpublic information to the media, but even if it does not, even if we \nlearn the leak of this information could have been accomplished without \nthe violation of any disclosure restrictions, we will consider \nintroducing legislation to make sure that in the future the disclosure \nof nonpublic information about our energy infrastructure that puts our \nNation at risk is a violation of Federal law. We must remember that the \npossibility of a physical attack that disables key parts of the grid \nhas always been a risk. Again, in this instance, though, with the \nMetcalf instance, our system worked and no power was lost. Therefore, I \nurge a measured approach when evaluating our next steps in response to \nMetcalf. Erecting barriers at every transmission substation and \nsurveillance of every inch of transmission is not feasible. I am \nconcerned these types of measures will potentially cost billions of \ndollars with little impact. There must also be a balance between the \nmeasures related to physical security and the costs that would likely \nbe passed through to consumers.\n\n  On March 7, the FERC used the grid reliability framework that \nCongress established in the 2005 Energy Policy Act by directing NERC to \nestablish standards addressing physical vulnerabilities to better \nprotect our Nation's power grid. NERC has 90 days to develop its \nproposed standards through a collaborative process. The proposed \nstandard will then be reviewed independently before it is submitted to \nthe FERC.\n  Our Energy Policy Act standards are foundational. Constant \ninformation sharing between government and industry, coupled with \nalerts for rapid response, are also key tools for dealing with the \nchanging state of security.\n  As policymakers we must include physical security as a key issue in \nour decisions. We must also take measured steps to protect the grid, \nbut we shouldn't sensationalize the threat. I commend NERC and FERC for \nstarting the standard-setting process, and I urge all of the \nparticipants to strike this balance between measures related to \nphysical security and costs and benefits for electric customers and the \nbroader public as a whole.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the energy committee for her \nwillingness to join me on this letter which again I feel is very \nimportant as we begin this review through the inspector general. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, as a valued member of the energy committee, is \nvery keenly aware of these issues when we talk about our grid \nreliability threats to not only the physical security of our \ninfrastructure but most certainly the cyber security threats we face as \nwell.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair this evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referenced in my remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2014.\n     Hon. Gregory Friedman,\n     Inspector General, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Inspector General Freidman: The Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources is responsible for oversight of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Commission, FERC) \n     and has jurisdiction over the laws the Commission \n     administers, including the Federal Power Act (FPA). In the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress amended the FPA, adding \n     section 215, to establish the framework for ensuring that the \n     nation's bulk power system (BPS or electric grid) is \n     reliable.\n       Recent reports in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) about grid \n     security (see attached) were shocking in their detail and \n     appear to have been based upon highly sensitive, narrowly \n     distributed FERC documents that may have pinpointed \n     vulnerabilities of the BPS. In the wrong hands, such \n     documents potentially could provide a roadmap for those who \n     would seek to harm the nation by intentionally causing one or \n     more power blackouts.\n       We are writing to respectfully request that the Department \n     of Energy Office of Inspector General (OIG) conduct a full \n     and thorough inquiry regarding the apparent leak to the WSJ \n     of sensitive information regarding physical threats to the \n     electric grid. As part of this effort we ask not only that \n     the OIG review the past, but also provide recommendations \n     regarding how to avoid a repeat of this very unfortunate \n     incident in the future.\n       We understand that your office has initiated a preliminary \n     review of this matter on its own initiative and we commend \n     you for doing so. We are also aware that the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) is conducting its own \n     investigation. We commend the FERC for this action, as well. \n     However, we note that it can be difficult for agencies to \n     effectively investigate their own actions which is why we are \n     making this request to the OIG.\n       The internal FERC documents regarding grid security that \n     appear to have been disclosed to the WSJ, are sufficiently \n     sensitive and potentially harmful to grid security that we \n     believe it would not be prudent to highlight specifically the \n     issues they raise at this time as part of this letter. For \n     the same reason, many of the questions that we request that \n     OIG answer also should not be made public. Consequently, we \n     will provide to OIG on a non-public basis associated \n     questions.\n       We do not know if the FERC documents that apparently form \n     the basis of the news reports are credible, but in any case, \n     disclosing and sensationalizing them, as it appears was the \n     work of the person who gave them to the newspaper, is highly \n     irresponsible or worse.\n       Even if your inquiry does not lead to the identification of \n     the person who provided this sensitive non-public information \n     to the media (and we hope it will), if you conclude that the \n     unauthorized disclosure of this information could have been \n     accomplished without the violation of any disclosure \n     restrictions, legislation could well be necessary. In that \n     event, we will consider introducing legislation to make sure \n     that the unauthorized disclosure of non-public information \n     about energy infrastructure that puts our nation at risk is a \n     violation of federal law.\n       We ask you to conclude your inquiry as soon as possible. We \n     have every confidence that you will follow the information \n     you uncover wherever it leads. Nevertheless, we seek your \n     immediate assurance that if the results of your initial \n     inquiry indicate that applicable Federal law and regulations \n     may have been violated by any current or former Federal \n     employee or official that you would then initiate a formal \n     investigation using all the powers of your office.\n       We are eager to receive recommendations concerning the \n     preparation, handling and proper treatment of the sensitive \n     information that forms the basis of the news reports and any \n     related information. We also ask you to examine the legal or \n     regulatory obligations of current and former FERC \n     commissioners and employees with respect to non-public \n     information, especially of the type covered by this letter \n     and the associated non-public attachment.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We intend to be fully \n     supportive of your inquiry.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n     Again, we look forward to having the benefit of your findings \n     as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mary Landrieu,\n                                                       Chairwoman.\n                                                   Lisa Murkowski,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/27/senate-section/article/S1837-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
