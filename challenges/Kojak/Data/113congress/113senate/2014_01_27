Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 294.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 294, S. 1926, a bill to \n     delay the implementation of certain provisions of the \n     Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and to \n     reform the National Association of Registered Agents and \n     Brokers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 5:30 p.m. there will be a rollcall vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the flood \ninsurance bill.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 1950\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told that S. 1950 is at the desk and \ndue for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1950) to improve the provision of medical \n     services and benefits to veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would object to any further proceedings with respect to \nthis bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I announced earlier, today the Senate \nwill vote at 5:30 to advance legislation which will protect millions of \nhomeowners and small businesses from drastic increases in flood \ninsurance premiums. This bipartisan measure will save many homeowners \nthousands of dollars a year and protect America's recovering housing \nmarket.\n  Since higher premiums would kick in whenever a home is sold, still \nstruggling housing markets across the country could stumble if Congress \nallows flood insurance rates to skyrocket. That will happen if we don't \nmove this legislation.\n  The bill before the Senate will preserve current rates until the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency submits a plan to keep premiums \nreasonable and provide stability to home and business owners.\n  I wish to thank Senators Menendez and Landrieu, as well as Senator \nIsakson, for their leadership on this issue. Their bill will cut \nthrough the red tape and give consumers better, cheaper options when \nthey shop for insurance.\n  So I hope the Senate can wrap up work quickly on this measure. We \nhave tried for weeks to get agreement to move forward on it, but we are \nnever quite there. Always there are requests to give a little more \ntime. That time has run out. Homeowners deserve certainty, and the \nSenate faces a substantial workload over the next 3 weeks.\n  Tomorrow, President Obama will address Congress and the Nation in his \nannual State of the Union address. I, like the American people, look \nforward to hearing the President's vision to create an economy in which \nthe middle class grows and prospers, because every individual should \nhave a fair shot at success.\n  The Senate must also consider a number of critical national security \nand judicial nominations in the coming weeks. With the help of my \nRepublican colleagues, we could process these nominations swiftly and \npainlessly--without late night or weekend votes.\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\nAs always, it will depend upon the level of cooperation we receive from \nthe Republicans.\n  This work period the Senate will also consider a farm bill conference \nreport. This legislation is a compromise that was reached thanks to the \nleadership of Chairwoman Stabenow, and it will reduce the deficit and \ncut waste and fraud, all while protecting hungry children and families.\n  The Senate will also debate legislation to effectively prevent and \npunish sexual assault in the Nation's Armed Forces, and we have \ncompeting views of this with Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand.\n  Democrats will continue our fight to restore benefits to 1.6 million \nAmericans looking for work during difficult economic times. In the last \n2 weeks since Republicans filibustered a bill to restore this important \nlifeline, an additional 150,000 Americans have lost their emergency \nunemployment benefits. For many families already suffering through hard \ntimes, the loss of $300 a week has meant going without food, turning \ndown the heat on freezing days or staring down homelessness.\n  One Nevada woman--a Vietnam veteran in her sixties who has worked all \nher life and raised a family--said she is afraid she will end up on the \nstreets if Washington doesn't restore her emergency benefits. This is \nwhat she wrote to me:\n\n       It is not that I don't want to work. It is that I am unable \n     to procure job . . . I do feel that it might be my age, but I \n     am more energetic than some young people I know. Please \n     continue to [work to] get this passed, as I am fearful that I \n     will end up homeless.\n\n  Her situation is not unique. Nationwide, thousands upon thousands of \nveterans looking for work have been kicked off unemployment. In Nevada, \nwhere unemployment is still almost 9 percent, 21,000 people struggling \nto find jobs have been cut off from these benefits. In fact, \nunemployment actually ticked up slightly in Las Vegas last month. As \nlong as there are three job seekers for every available position, we \nowe it to Americans to lend a helping hand during this emergency.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1926.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Margaret Chase Smith\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, on January 27, 1964, \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine announced her candidacy for \nPresident of the United States. The following July, at the Republican \nNational Convention in San Francisco, the great lady from Maine became \nthe first woman in history to ever have her name entered into \nnomination by a major party for our Nation's highest office. I rise to \ncommemorate this remarkable leader and this significant milestone in \nour history.\n  At the time of her announcement, Senator Smith was in her 24th year \nin Congress and was an established groundbreaker. She was the first \nwoman elected to both the House and the Senate and the first to serve \non the Armed Services Committee. She was the woman who gave other women \nthe opportunity to pursue careers in the military. Due to her early and \nenergetic support for the space program, she has been called the woman \nwho put a man on the Moon.\n  Her courageous ``Declaration of Conscience'' delivered in the Senate \non June 1, 1950, turned the tide against McCarthyism and reminded all \nAmericans of our Nation's core values of free expression and \nindependent thought.\n  Senator Smith made her Presidential announcement in a speech at the \nWomen's National Press Club in Washington. Yes, Mr. President, there \nwas a separate press club for women in those days. It was an important \naddress in which she described both the progress that America had made \nagainst bigotry, prejudice, extremism, and hatred as well as the \nchallenges that remained, but Margaret Chase Smith saved the best for \nlast. After telling her audience of the flood of letters she had been \nreceiving from all over the country urging her to run for President, \nSenator Smith described the reasons offered by her supporters, such as \nshe had more experience at the national level than any of the other \nconfirmed candidates, she had the stature that could break the barrier \nagainst women being seriously considered for President, she would \nprovide a moderate, middle-of-the-road option in an election that was \nshaping up as one between a very conservative and very liberal \nphilosophy.\n  Then she described the reasons she should not run: The widespread \ncontention that the Presidency was a man's job, her lack of financial \nresources, and a professional political organization, and the fact that \nthe odds were stacked heavily against her. Senator Smith said she found \nthe reasons offered against running far more compelling than those in \nfavor. So imagine the surprise of her audience when she said that \nbecause of those very reasons, she had decided to enter the New \nHampshire primary.\n  Senator Smith's campaign was off and running, and what a campaign it \nwas. Senator Smith accepted no money from anyone. All contributions--\nwhether they were large or small--were returned to sender. She took to \nthe campaign trail only when the Senate was not in session in order to \npreserve her perfect record of never missing a rollcall vote and to \nkeep the pledge of dedicated service she had made to the people of \nMaine. Her campaign motto was: ``There is nothing more effective than a \nhandshake and a little conversation.''\n  As a consequence of her self-imposed financial and time restraints, \nSenator Smith did not win a primary. But in the one primary where she \nwas able to campaign somewhat extensively--the State of Illinois for \nall of two weekends and a total expenditure of $85--she finished a \nstrong second in a field of six. She lost only to the eventual nominee, \nBarry Goldwater. With 25 percent of the vote, she came in far ahead of \nsuch well-known candidates as Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller, and \nHenry Cabot Lodge. It is intriguing to think what she might have done \nwith a more traditional campaign.\n  At the Republican National Convention in San Francisco that year, \nSenator Smith's name was entered into nomination by Senator George \nAiken of Vermont. He told the delegates that Senator Smith's integrity, \nability, common sense, and courage made her ``the best qualified person \nyou ever voted for.'' On the first ballot, 27 delegates did vote for \nMargaret Chase Smith from the great State of Maine.\n  Unlike the other candidates, Senator Smith did not release her \ndelegates to the landslide victor, Senator Goldwater. That was not done \nout of spite. Indeed, she campaigned earnestly for him in the general \nelection. It was done because she wanted to demonstrate--she wanted the \nhistorical record to show that a woman had been given serious \nconsideration for the Presidency of this country.\n  Many words have been spoken over many years in attempts to describe \nthe character of Senator Margaret Chase Smith. Perhaps the best were \noffered by the candidate herself on that campaign trail a half century \nago. She said:\n\n       I have few illusions and no money, but I'm staying for the \n     finish. When people keep telling you, you can't do a thing, \n     you kind of like to try.\n\n  On this milestone anniversary, I am honored to celebrate an \nextraordinary woman from Maine who tried and failed in one endeavor but \nin doing so inspired generations of Americans with her strength and \ndetermination and demonstrated, as she once said, that a woman's place \nis ``everywhere.''\n  Today, the Senate has a record 20 women Senators. In a sense each of \nus owes a debt to Senator Margaret Chase Smith, but none more so than \nI. You\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\nsee, I first met Senator Smith when I was a high school senior from \nCaribou, ME. I was selected as one of two students to come to \nWashington as part of the Senate Youth Program sponsored by the William \nRandolph Hearst Foundation, a program that still exists today. I \nremember how excited I was to see Senator Smith and her graciousness in \ninviting me into her office and spending nearly 2 hours with me.\n  As the Presiding Officer can appreciate, for any of us to spend 2 \nhours with anyone is remarkable nowadays, but Margaret Chase Smith \ncarved out that time to talk with me. Recently her library sent me \ncopies of her appointment book for that day so I could see that my \nappointment with her was listed and preserved for all time.\n  She talked to me not about what it was like being the only woman in \nthe Senate, she talked to me instead about her service on the Armed \nServices Committee, about what we could do to create more jobs in this \ncountry and, most of all, about her famous ``Declaration of \nConscience'' in which she stood up against the smear campaign and the \nexcesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Through that speech she taught us \nall to stand tall for what we believe in and to speak out against \ninjustice and bigotry.\n  I remember when I left her office I was so thrilled and inspired. I \nremember thinking women could do anything. This was back in 1971, and \nalthough I came from a family with wonderful role models in both my \nmother and my father, who were so active in their community and in \ntheir State, there were a lot of other messages about that time that \nraised doubts in the minds of growing girls about whether we could, in \nfact, be whatever we wanted to be. So that message that I learned from \nMargaret Chase Smith was so important in shaping who I am today.\n  Although I did not know it at the time at all, that meeting with \nMargaret Chase Smith shortly after I had turned 18 as a high school \nsenior taught me I could achieve my dream, and in many ways it was the \nfirst step on a journey that led me to run for her seat in the Senate \n25 years later.\n  Today I am so proud that the desk at which I stand--the desk that I \nuse and is assigned to me on the Senate floor--once belonged to the \nlegendary Senator from Maine Margaret Chase Smith. What a wonderful \nrole model she was to me the entire time I was growing up when she was \nrepresenting the State of Maine with such integrity, skill, and \ncourage. I feel so fortunate to hold her seat in the Senate.\n\n  So today it gives me great pride as well as great pleasure to inform \nmy colleagues that this is the 50th anniversary of the day that Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith of Maine became the first woman in history to \nannounce her candidacy for President of the United States and later \nthat year to be the first woman to have her name placed in nomination \nby a major political party. Let us celebrate this day as we also \ncelebrate the presence of a record number of women in the Senate. I \nbelieve that would have made Senator Smith very proud.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           immigration reform\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the immigration issue the country is \nwrestling with is broad and deep and has huge ramifications in a host \nof areas. But one area that has just been ignored systematically, it \nseems to me--at least to a degree that is unacceptable--is the impact a \nmassive increase in immigration to America will have on the already \ndeclining wages and job prospects of Americans who are hurting \ntoday. That is just a fact that needs to be discussed. We need to be \nhonest about it.\n\n  Prime Minister David Cameron in the United Kingdom has announced \nmajor reductions in immigration and said there may be more. He said we \ncannot expect that foreign workers would take jobs we need to be \ntraining Britons to do. How simple and valuable a concept is that?\n  So we are talking about legislation that can shift the power, wealth \nfrom working people to businesspeople, the corporations, because it \nwill shift, if not done properly--and we believe in immigration. We are \nnot opposed to immigration. It just needs to be done at the level and \nin the proper way so our workers are not so adversely impacted, as \nwould occur if the Senate bill were to become law. Thank goodness the \nHouse is saying they are not going to pass that bill.\n  President Obama is preparing to deliver a State of the Union Address \ntomorrow night in which he will address the continued financial \ncollapse of the American middle class, much of which has occurred on \nhis watch. However, it did start before he took office.\n  Since 2000, the average wage of working Americans has declined. As \nadjusted for inflation, it is negative. In the last 2 or 3 years--since \nthe recession is supposed to be over and has been announced is over--\nthat decline has accelerated. Professor Borjas and others have tagged a \nlot of that result as occurring because of a substantial increase in \nimmigration that has been occurring in America. If the President wishes \nto demonstrate a sincere concern for struggling workers, then he must \nrecognize the negative impact his immigration policies are having on \nwage earners throughout the country right now.\n  According to Harvard Professor Borjas, the Nation's leading expert on \nimmigration and an economist--himself an immigrant from Cuba as a young \nman--Professor Borjas says every dollar of increased profit for \ncompanies that use immigrant labor is offset by a dollar in lost wages \nfor the Americans competing with that immigrant labor. Think about \nthat.\n  In fact, he estimates that businesses lobbying for this bill will \nbenefit on an order of $400 billion. They and their political activist \nallies lobbying for this bill, they definitely receive a financial \nbenefit. He estimates, based on rigorous analysis that virtually every \ndollar of that will come from reduced wages of American workers.\n  That is the way, colleagues, the free enterprise system works. If we \nhave more cotton in America, the price of cotton goes down. If we bring \nin more labor than we have had before, the price of labor comes down. \nThat is just the way it works. We have not eliminated the law of supply \nand demand. The law of supply and demand dictates that an increased \nsupply of workers will result in a reduced cost of hiring workers.\n  The President's push for higher Federal wage controls and extended \nunemployment jobless benefits is effectively an admission that his \npolicies have cut wages and reduced the ability of Americans to get \njobs.\n  But these measures he is proposing are treating the symptoms. Why are \nnot wages going up as they have throughout most of the history of our \ncountry, naturally through supply and demand? Could it be that we have \nhad, as Professor Borjas said, for the last 30 years an incredible \nincrease in the flow of foreign workers who are competing for these \njobs every single year?\n  One cannot return to full employment and rising wages for workers at \nall skill levels without tightening the labor market. We have a loose \nlabor market. We have a surplus of people looking for jobs.\n  Gene Sperling, the President's top adviser on the economy, said just \na few weeks ago that we have three workers applying for each one job \nthat exists in America. Why in the world then would we want to bring in \nand allow businesses to demand increased numbers of low-skilled \nworkers?\n  The President's plan will provide companies an incentive to hire even \nfewer American workers, and they will be less likely to hire a person \nwho has been unemployed for a long time--the long-term unemployed.\n  The United States has already formally admitted more immigrants, \nlargely lesser skilled, in the last 10 years than any prior 10-year \nperiod in America's history. So the question every reporter, pundit, \nand lawmaker should ask is this: How does the President think it will \nhelp Americans trying to climb into the middle class to pass an \nimmigration plan that would\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\ndouble the number of immigrant workers competing against them for jobs \nand wages?\n  The single largest category in our budget right now is welfare and \npoverty support programs helping people who have lower incomes. \nIncluding State contributions, my Budget Committee staff has discovered \nwe spend more than a $1 trillion on Federal means-tested support \nprograms each year--over $1 trillion. That is greater than the defense \nbudget, more than Social Security, more than Medicare. A record one in \nfive households today received food stamps in 2013--one in five. The \nmajority of them are working age. That is the first time that has \nhappened that a majority of the recipients of food stamps are within \nthe working age group.\n  Our urgent national mission is to begin transitioning these \nstruggling workers into good jobs with rising wages. Instead, the \nPresident proposes to increase Federal spending even more to sustain \nmillions on welfare while increasing the supply and the admission of \nlower skilled immigrants to take the available jobs that exist.\n  House leaders are reportedly rushing to assemble a plan that is \nsimilar to the President's. I hope not. But that is what is being \nsuggested. This would be the worst thing they could do at such a time. \nInstead, the Democratic Senate having spoken, the Republican House must \nstand, expose the President's disastrous policies, and advocate a new \ndirection that promotes assimilation, rising wages, and a growing \nmiddle class for all Americans, including those who have recently \nimmigrated.\n  Our lower skilled workers are the ones who are adversely affected the \nmost from increased flows of immigrant labor into the country. I just \nhope we will consider this and talk honestly about it because it is not \ngoing away. It is a reality. The suggestion that somehow this will not \nhappen is not so. The Congressional Budget Office, in scoring the \nSenate bill, concluded it would pull down wages of Americans for 20 \nyears.\n  The last thing this Senate or any President of the United States \nshould do would be to advocate and promote a policy that will pull down \nwages. We need to be looking for ways to increase wages. When you are \nin a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. Do not make it \nworse. Do not create four or five applicants for every one job that \nexists in America.\n  I hope the President will talk about that. I challenge him to talk \nabout it. I am going to watch what he says. I expect him, as President \nof the United States addressing a joint session of Congress, to tell \nthe truth and be accurate about his analysis and discussion of this \nimportant issue. It is important to America. We believe in immigration, \nbut we want a lawful system of immigration, an immigration system that \nfirst and foremost does not damage, hurt, and weaken the financial \nposition of already struggling American workers. Isn't that our first \nresponsibility?\n  We should create this lawful system in a way that serves the long-\nterm interests, the legitimate long-term interests of the United States \nof America and all the people who are in it, not just a few special \nones with big money and special political power.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak about the flood insurance \nbill. I am speaking with a smile on my face because I believe we have \nthe 60 votes to break the filibuster so we can get to the bill. I would \nhope that if we exceed that 60-vote threshold, indeed those who have \nbeen trying to torpedo this bill would then, instead of stringing us \nout all week, making us go through all of the parliamentarian \nprocedures when we have the votes, would let us get it passed.\n  The problem is going to be down at the other end of that hallway \nbecause the Speaker of the House has already said that he does not like \nit. But what he is going to find out that he does not like is that a \nlot of Members of the House of Representatives have constituents who \nare facing 10-fold increases in their flood insurance because of \nsomething that was tacked onto a transportation bill.\n  That was a year ago, Biggert-Waters, the sponsors in the House for \nthis law which is now causing these unforeseen and never-expected huge \nincreases. We can rectify that today. At 5:30 we are going to have the \nvote on the motion for cloture to cut off debate so that we can get to \nthe bill.\n  What does this bill do? It is really easy. It delays these giant rate \nhikes for 4 years, and it mandates on FEMA an affordability study so \nthat we can see. I mean, you can say you want rates to go up and be \nactuarially sound. But if what happens is what has been happening, that \npeople cannot afford it because it is 10 times as much, or that because \nit is so high it completely dries up the real estate market, that is \nnot helping anybody.\n  That is hurting a lot of people. It is hurting our economic recovery \njust at the moment in which the real estate market is coming back all \nalong the coasts of America, as well as along the rivers and lakes, the \nvery places that flood insurance is necessary for a homeowner or a \nbusiness.\n  I might say that today, as I was in Florida, the temperature was in \nthe 60s, moving to the 70s. I got off the plane here, and it was in the \n30s. But the chilling winds of Biggert-Waters, with the gargantuan \nflood insurance rate hikes--those chilling winds are not only killing \nreal estate sales, they are killing commerce, and it is putting an \nimpossible financial burden on our people.\n  We can take care of this at 5:30. Some have opposed us the whole way \nas we have tried a handful of times to bring up this legislation, \nasking unanimous consent. Finally, thanks to the leader, who has forced \nthe issue, we are going to vote on cutting off debate today.\n  I have several documented cases along Florida's gulf coast where the \npremiums for flood insurance have gone up by 10 times. In one \nparticular case in Pinellas County, chronicled by the Tampa Bay Times, \nthe premium was $4,500, and it has gone to $45,000.\n  No homeowner can endure and afford that kind of increase. In another \ncase, a $1,400 flood insurance premium has gone to $14,000. It is the \nsame. We should be around here promoting home ownership. But if the \npoor homeowner has a mortgage because they have gotten a loan from the \nbank, what is the bank going to do to require some security for their \nloan? They are going to require flood insurance.\n  So how can we expect a homeowner to have to go through this. You can \nsay this is a subsidized program. It is. But the big losses in the \nprogram have been because of very unusual climatic events. In the first \nplace, it was Hurricane Katrina. That was an ordinary, garden-variety \ncategory 3 Hurricane. Those of us in Florida understand hurricanes.\n  But what happened with this hurricane? It went to the east of New \nOrleans, so the counter clockwise winds were not coming directly from \nthe gulf. They were coming in over New Orleans, over Lake \nPontchartrain. It caused the lake to rise, it filled up the canals. The \nwater rose in the canals. The water pressure against the side of the \ncanals increased. There were faulty canal dikes, and they breached in a \ncouple of places, and then all of the water flooded into parts of New \nOrleans and filled up the bowl of New Orleans.\n  That was a huge loss to the Federal Flood Insurance Program. Then \nthere was another extraordinary event. This was just a year ago. This \nwas a category 1 storm, and it was extraordinary because it hit in the \nwinter. Where did it hit? It hit the highly urbanized coasts of New \nJersey, New York, and parts of New England. As a result, there were \nhuge losses there and people were desperate to have assistance. Look at \nwhat those folks are facing with regard to the flood insurance hikes.\n\n  We can take care of all of this at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon as we \nstart the process of getting on the bill. I urge all of our Senators--\nbecause sooner or later somebody in your State is going to face a \nflood, and they are going to get remapped. They may not be paying those \nrates now, but they are going to get remapped because of those floods,\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nand then they are going to get hit with these unaffordable, gargantuan \nrate hikes on the premiums of Federal flood insurance--this is the \nright thing to do.\n  I see my colleague from Utah. The Senator used to tell me they don't \never have floods there, but I will bet they do. Even though Utah is a \ndry State, I know Utah has water because it supports a population which \nis represented by my most distinguished and dear personal friend \nSenator Hatch.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear colleague. The Senator is a very close \npersonal friend of mine too.\n  I have to say we have had our floods out there too, and thank \ngoodness we have had some of these things to help us, no question about \nit. The last one was in St. George. It was very devastating to people. \nI appreciate the Senator's work.\n\n\n                    Alternative Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a legislative proposal I \nunveiled yesterday with two of my colleagues, Senator Richard Burr and \nDr. Tom Coburn, that represents our vision for an alternative to \nObamaCare.\n  Let me start by saying something that most Americans--from Utah to \nNorth Carolina to Oklahoma--know to be true: ObamaCare just is not \nworking. Try as he might during the State of the Union Address \ntomorrow, President Obama will not be able to convince the American \npeople that his health care law is anything other than an unmitigated \ndisaster. This horribly misguided law puts government between people \nand their doctors. It includes over $1 trillion in new taxes and a new \nunsustainable entitlement.\n  It includes mandates and regulations that have forced too many \nAmericans off their health plans and businesses to cut back on hiring. \nIt has done next to nothing to put a brake on skyrocketing health care \ncosts that are hitting every family in this country.\n  The three of us knew there was another way, a better way--a way that \ndoesn't need 2,700 pages of government programs and mandates to enact \ncommonsense reforms that the American people want and need.\n  Let me say that these two Senators with whom I have joined on this \nproposal have been looking at this for some time, as have I. I commend \nthem for their leadership.\n  Our plan rests on four simple principles. First, repeal ObamaCare \nwith all its costly mandates, taxes, and regulations in its entirety.\n  Second, reduce costs by taking government out of the equation, and, \ninstead, empowering consumers to make choices about their own health \ncare.\n  Third, provide commonsense consumer protections to protect \nindividuals with preexisting conditions.\n  Fourth, reform our broken Medicaid system by giving States more \nflexibility to provide the best coverage for their citizens.\n  We are confident our plan will accomplish all of this, and it would \ndo so without adding one red cent to our $17 trillion debt.\n  These four principles are the core of what we unveiled today. They \nare smart, they make sense, and they are what the people of my State \nhave been looking for, and I think the people of every State. We start \nwith the biggest barrier to health care in this country, and that \nhappens to be skyrocketing health costs. Too many families cannot \nafford to buy insurance or to see a doctor. Why? Because of costs.\n  We recognized this. Our plan would give people affordable options \nthat meet their needs by harnessing the power of the marketplace, not \nthrough Washington-directed mandates. With more options in the private \ninsurance marketplace--particularly in the small group and individual \nmarkets--on top of greater consumer protections and more transparency, \nthe American people would be better able to purchase coverage that is \nright for them.\n  We can see the importance of choice in the failings of ObamaCare, \nwhich is struggling to sign up young people who might need a health \nplan that is affordable instead of one that includes coverage they will \nnever use or need. Maybe a 25-year-old male auto mechanic, for example, \nonly wants catastrophic coverage and not a plan that includes maternity \ncare. We give people those options to allow them to find coverage that \nbest meets their needs. Our plan does that.\n  We also include significant commonsense consumer protections, such as \nmaking sure a person cannot have their coverage cancelled if they get \nsick. We help make sure patients with preexisting conditions can gain \naccess to affordable coverage and let children stay on their parents' \ninsurance through age 26--something we were always willing to do.\n  We also get rid of lifetime limits. Under our plan, insurers won't be \nable to put a cap on total benefits to be paid out over a person's \nlifetime, eliminating a patient's fear of maxing out their health care \ncoverage. We give States more options to provide people with more \ncoverage while once again reducing costs.\n  Under our plan, families earning up to $71,000--or 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level--will get a tax credit to purchase the insurance \nof their choosing. We help small businesses enjoy the same advantages \nas large businesses by allowing them to band together to leverage their \npurchasing power to buy insurance. This just plain makes sense.\n  I have to say one of the most absurd aspects of ObamaCare is that a \ngood portion of the people it covers is through Medicaid. Yet as we all \nknow, Medicaid is a financially unsound program that is threatening \nState budgets. Its expansion under ObamaCare only threatens the program \nfurther.\n  Our plan includes a key reform that is similar to the Medicaid \nmodernization plan that House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman \nFred Upton and myself put out last year. Currently, Federal taxpayers \nhave an open-ended liability to match State Medicaid spending, which is \na significant driver in Medicaid's budgetary challenges.\n  Our proposal would create per capita spending caps--similar to what \nPresident Clinton and many Democrats who remain in this Chamber \nsupported in the past--to ensure that the dollars follow the patient. \nThis structural reform of Medicaid is coupled with new flexibility for \nStates to best manage their Medicaid populations.\n  On top of that, we give those on Medicaid the option of purchasing \nprivate health insurance, which is more frequently accepted by quality \ndoctors.\n  I want to emphasize that our proposal trusts the American people to \nmake the best choices for themselves. That is why we include an \nexpansion of health savings accounts so people can plan and save for \ntheir future medical needs. That also means injecting transparency into \nhealth care costs so people know which provider charges what and how \nsuccessful those providers are.\n  We include other cost-containing measures such as medical malpractice \nliability reform to help reduce the costly practice of defensive \nmedicine.\n  In my early life, I actually tried medical liability cases, defending \ndoctors, hospitals, nurses, and health care practitioners, et cetera. \nMost of those cases were frivolous. They were brought to get the \ndefense costs. Doctors were scared, so doctors were told: Fill up your \nrecords to show that you went way beyond the standard of care and the \nstandard of practice. Thus, we have had hundreds of millions of dollars \nin unnecessary defensive medicine ever since.\n  We also reduce the distortions in the Tax Code that actually increase \nthe cost of health care in our country by capping the employee \nexclusion. This is a key way of restraining costs that has been cited \nacross the economic spectrum.\n  The bottom line is that this proposal is sustainable and achievable, \nand without the tax hikes, mandates, and budget-busting spending that \nhave made ObamaCare care so unpopular with the American people. Most \nimportantly, unlike ObamaCare, our plan will reduce health care costs \nfor American individuals, families, and businesses.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and experts throughout \nthe health care community to better refine and improve our blueprint, \nand that is what it is right now, it is a blueprint.\n  I am confident we will be able to build strong consensus around our \nideas and be in a position to formally introduce legislation that will \nrepeal the President's health law and replace it with strong reforms \nthat will actually lower costs, reduce spending, and\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nput high-quality care within the reach of every American. Frankly, this \napproach should appeal to everyone, Democrats and Republicans.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side are very nervous about the \nfailures--already--of ObamaCare, and it is just starting. Anybody who \nthinks that once we heal the rollout disaster everything is going to be \nOK, let me say that is only the beginning. ObamaCare is a disaster, and \nevery day it continues is going to be more of a disaster. I think my \ncolleagues on the other side ought to take a look at what we are \nproposing because it may be one way of helping their colleagues and \ntheir constituents understand that they really are serious about trying \nto get health care we can live with and can help our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \nPresident's sixth State of the Union Address tomorrow night. Although I \ndo not think the Framers imagined the pageantry that has come to \naccompany the State of the Union, it certainly is enshrined in the \nConstitution. According to article II, section 3:\n\n       The President shall from time to time, give the Congress \n     information on the State of the Union and recommend to their \n     consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and \n     expedient.\n\n  ``Recommend for Congress consideration such measures''--I note with \ninterest in today's Wall Street Journal on the front page that \nPresident Obama intends to assert a unilateral agenda at the State of \nthe Union, according to press reports, at least in the Wall Street \nJournal. The article begins:\n\n       President Barack Obama Tuesday night will seek to shift the \n     public's souring view of his leadership.\n\n  It goes on to say in paragraph 2:\n\n       Mr. Obama will emphasize his intention to use unilateral \n     Presidential authority, bypassing Congress when necessary, to \n     an extent not seen in his previous State of the Union \n     speeches.\n\n  This certainly does not sound like article II, section 3, where the \nState of the Union is anticipated by our Founders as an opportunity for \nthe President to make recommendations to the Congress, but we shall \nsee. It should not be difficult for President Obama to outline a number \nof national priorities that are necessary and expedient for the \nCongress to consider. As we enter the sixth year of the Obama \nadministration, the economy continues to suffer from anemic growth and \nchronically high unemployment. Family poverty statistics are at record \nhigh levels. Small businesses, the ones that create our Nation's jobs \nfor the most part, are struggling to pay for government mandates and \nkeep Americans at work at the same time.\n  Of course, a major concern for Americans is the President's health \ncare law, legislation that was rammed through Congress without \nbipartisan support. Individuals, families, businesses, and investors \ncan plainly see that the law is plagued with problems. Hardly a day \ngoes by without hearing from our citizens back home who are frustrated \nand worried about how the law impacts them.\n  Instead of more affordable and more accessible health care, families \nin my State and across the country are dealing with a backlash of \ncanceled insurance policies, higher premiums, and fewer choices. No one \ncan dispute these facts. At this point, Americans are right to be \ndoubtful of more promises. They want to see results. They want to see \nreal health care reform. They want to see job-creating strategies that \nwill work, that have been proven to work.\n  Americans need more tomorrow night than phraseology from the \nPresident. Without leadership and accountability, the public is right \nto lack confidence that the President's big government approach can \nmove us forward or that the President wants to work with Congress \ntoward bipartisan solutions.\n  I hope we can work together for bipartisan solutions. One recent poll \nsuggests--and this is stunning--that a majority of Americans actually \nquestion the Obama administration's competence in running the \ngovernment. The same survey showed that most Americans believe the \neconomy is either staying the same or getting worse.\n  I believe the American public sees things correctly. Until Americans \nsee significant improvements in their lives, attempts by the White \nHouse to spin a positive economic message will ring hollow. Many \nAmericans have been forced to take part-time work or have left the \nlabor force altogether. In the December jobs report, an official report \nof the government, we saw that the labor force participation rate, \nwhich reflects the number of adult Americans who have a job or are \nlooking for one, has fallen to its lowest level since 1979.\n  Let me repeat that. After 5 years of the Obama administration's \nleadership, the labor force participation rate is the worst it has been \nsince 1978. Recent estimates indicate that median household income is \nalmost $2,400 less than it was 4 years ago, in inflation-adjusted \ndollars.\n  President Obama has tried to shift the blame for the harm caused by \nhis health care law, but that attempt to duck responsibility will not \nwash with the American people. Millions of Americans have had their \nhealth coverage canceled, even though the President repeatedly \npromised: If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health \ncare plan. Oftentimes he punctuated that with `` . . . you can keep \nyour health care plan, period.''\n  The President recently said he regrets that Americans find themselves \nin that situation. Americans find themselves in that situation because \nof the health care law which he rammed through Congress on a strictly \npartisan basis. They find themselves in that situation because they \nwere told a very flat and emphatic statement by the President of the \nUnited States, the leader of the free world. That emphatic direct \nstatement turned out not to be the case.\n  Americans are uncertain of how they will afford significantly higher \npremiums. Employers are facing costly mandates. Now we learned at the \nend of last week that Moody's has downgraded the economic outlook for \nhealth insurers, citing the law's difficult implementation and the \nadministration's numerous delays. So Moody's downgraded the outlook of \nthese health insurers that are trying to make the law work.\n  As the country's chief executive, the President should start a \ndialogue in his State of the Union speech tomorrow night that focuses \non ways to empower Americans to create jobs and opportunities. This \nbody is controlled by the Democrats. The other body is controlled by \nthe Republicans. We need bipartisan solutions to create jobs and \nopportunities. We have seen a big government approach with more \nburdensome regulations and more bureaucratic intrusions. We have seen \nhow that approach does not work.\n  The State of the Union offers the President an opportunity to outline \nissues where he is willing to work with Republicans in a bipartisan \nway. We should be talking about market-driven strategies to reform \nhealth care. We should be talking about the Keystone XL Pipeline and \nhow to advance America's rich energy potential, the most abundant \nenergy sources in the world right here in America. Keystone XL Pipeline \nwould be a jobs win for the Obama administration. Yet the President \ncannot bring himself to come forward on this bipartisan idea.\n  Of course the best welfare program is a jobs program. The best \nunemployment program is one that creates jobs for Americans. Americans \nare ready to go to work. Rather than focus on the politics of jealousy \nand income inequality, the President should demonstrate leadership and \ncooperation. In a divided government, both leadership and cooperation \nare needed to bring about the enduring economic recovery this country \nneeds.\n  I look forward to the President's address tomorrow night and hope we \ncan hear bipartisan solutions to move us forward.\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       MLB Hall of Fame Inductees\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to three \ngentlemen who, as a result of a vote taken by the baseball writers of \nAmerica a couple of weeks ago, are going to be inducted into the \nBaseball Hall of Fame. These three men are former Atlanta manager Bobby \nCox and former pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux. These incredible \nathletes have left their imprint not only on Georgians but on the \nentire baseball community around the world. These three gentlemen are \namong baseball's most accomplished coaches and players and will \ndeservedly be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in July \nof this year.\n  So far as I know, there has never been three individuals who spent \nmost of their time with the same team, inducted into the Hall of Fame \nin the same year--truly remarkable.\n  First, let me mention and honor Bobby Cox, a baseball legend and one \nof Major League Baseball's winningest managers. With a record of 2,504 \nwins, he ranks fourth on baseball's all-time managers win list. Bobby \nCox started his career with the Braves in 1978. He left briefly in 1982 \nto manage the Toronto Blue Jays, only to return to the Braves in 1985, \nwhere he would spend the remainder of his career until his retirement \nfollowing the 2010 season.\n  In 1995 he led the Braves to the World Series Championship, where \nthey faced the Cleveland Indians. The Braves won the series in game 6 \nin Atlanta, claiming the team's third championship in franchise \nhistory. Aside from Bobby's remarkable .556 percent winning percentage, \nhe is also remembered for his all-time record for ejections in Major \nLeague Baseball with 158. For those of us who know Bobby well and know \nhe is one of the nicest people you will ever meet--and he is a big \nteddy bear--it is fair to say that if Bobby did not agree with a call \non the field, he was quick to express his dissatisfaction and his \ndisgust with it, and nobody could protect their players as a manager \nbetter than Bobby could.\n  It was no surprise when he would sometimes find himself watching the \ngame ultimately from the locker room. No one can question Bobby's sheer \npassion and love for the game of baseball. Both the city of Atlanta and \nthe State of Georgia are in his debt.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the impressive careers of Tom \nGlavine and Gregg Maddox and highlight a few of their accomplishments.\n  As Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine combined for over 400 wins, they will \nbe the first players in 40 years who spent the majority of their \ncareers together to become Hall of Farmers in the same year. The last \nto do so were New York Yankee players Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford.\n  The Braves drafted Tom Glavine in the second round in 1984. He was \nsuch a talented athlete that the very same year the Los Angeles Kings \ndrafted him in the fourth round to play professional hockey. Luckily \nfor the Braves and for baseball, he chose baseball.\n  He went on to spend 17 of his 22 decorated seasons in Atlanta. The \nfamous lefthander ended his distinguished professional career with 305 \nwins, 2,607 strikeouts, and two Cy Young Awards, which he received in \n1991 and 1998, both as a Brave.\n  In the Brave's 1995 World Series victory, Glavine was named the most \nvaluable player. When the lefty pitcher grabbed the bat and stepped up \nto the plate, we saw something not often seen in today's game. He came \nout swinging and he could hit.\n  Glavine was the recipient of four Silver Slugger Awards, an award \ngiven to the best offensive player at each position each year.\n  His teammate Greg Maddux was known as a right-handed control pitcher \nwith great precision and accuracy, not missing his targets often. He \nwouldn't beat you with a 100-mile-per-hour fastball, but he would \nembarrass you with placement and movement rarely seen before or since.\n  Maddux started his career in 1986 with the Chicago Cubs. Following \nhis seventh season with the Cubs, and with the Cy Young Award under his \nbelt, the Braves signed Maddux as a free agent in 1993, in what is \nwidely described as one of baseball's best free agent deals.\n  He then went on to win five more consecutive Cy Young Awards in a \nBraves uniform. Maddux ended his career with 335 wins, a 3.13 ERA, \n3,371 strikeouts, an impressive four Cy Young Awards, and a record 18 \nGold Gloves in 23 seasons.\n  Together these individuals led the Braves to 14 straight division \nchampionships--an unparalleled accomplishment in any sport. I daresay \nthat record will likely never be broken.\n  It comes as no surprise that the Braves have retired the numbers 6, \n31, and 47 to celebrate and recognize the distinguished careers of \nthese three men.\n  I am pleased to join Georgians in congratulating Bobby Cox, Tom \nGlavine, and Greg Maddux on their tremendous accomplishment of being \ninducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe quorum call and to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, at 5:30 today the Senate is going to \ncast a very important vote to people in many States, not just the State \nof Louisiana, which I have had the honor and the privilege of \nrepresenting now for almost 18 years, but to States from one end of \nthis country to the other, including coastal States and interior \nStates, on an issue that is very important to homeowners and business \nowners alike. The vote we are going to cast is a vote to begin debating \na Menendez-Isakson bill that will fix the many urgent problems that \nhave presented themselves in a recently passed bill called Biggert-\nWaters.\n  Biggert-Waters is a bill that had wonderful intentions, which were to \nstrengthen the flood insurance program and to make it self-sustainable. \nIt is a program many people depend on. It is a public-private \npartnership that provides affordable flood insurance for the middle \nclass. But the bill was built backward and upside down. The bill had \ngood intentions, but it has had very detrimental consequences. So the \nbill we are going to vote to go to debate on--the Menendez-Isakson \nbill--is really a good-faith attempt to correct some of the problems \nwith Biggert-Waters and to lead us in a direction to a place where this \ncountry can have a public-private partnership for flood insurance that \nactually works for the taxpayer, for the millions and millions of \npeople--5 million plus--who are going to have to have flood insurance, \nwhether they have had it in the past or not. There are new maps that \nare coming and millions and millions of people will be required by the \nlaw to have flood insurance if they have a mortgage on their home, and \nmost people have mortgages. Most people are unable to pay cash for \ntheir homes. Some people are fortunate to do so, but I would say 95 \npercent of the people have mortgages on their homes. So if people have \nmortgages, they are going to be required to have flood insurance, and \nif they are required to have flood insurance they will have Biggert-\nWaters, unless we can postpone it and instead get Menendez-Isakson.\n  Many of the critics who are not supporting the reform effort we have \nunderway say we are trying to protect mansions on the beach. So I \npulled some random pictures from the Web page I set up called ``My Home \nMy Story.'' This is in St. Amant, LA, Walker, Belle Chasse, Chalmette, \nPointe Coupee, Mandeville--these are a variety of neighborhoods--\nIndependence, LA; New Orleans--there is no beach within miles of this \nhome. There is no beach within miles of Independence. This is very far \ninland.\n  We can see this is a home where there is water all around here, but \nthis house is raised probably 13 to 17 feet, which is now the required \nelevation in many parts of Louisiana and the gulf coast. But except for \nthis home, which looks like a beautiful old mansion, none of these are \nmansions and none of them are on a beach. What is happening all over \nAmerica is that these flood maps are being put into place, not just on \nthe coast of California or Louisiana or Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, \nbut I call the attention of my colleagues particularly to inland\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\nStates such as Pennsylvania. We have had a lot of criticism from some \nof the representatives from Pennsylvania about what we are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statistics \nabout States that are not coastal States such as Pennsylvania. We just \ngot some new material which I will submit for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Community means any State, or area or political subdivision \n     thereof, or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal \n     organization or Alaska Native village or authorized native \n     organization, which has authority to adopt and enforce \n     floodplain management regulations for the areas within its \n     jurisdiction. The number of communities is approximate for \n     each state.\n\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

The purple are \nflood maps that are in effect. Green are proposed flood maps that will \nbe introduced, and gold are new flood maps that are possible. The State \nof Pennsylvania is No. 1 in the number of new flood maps that will be \nproposed, by a long shot. There will be 1,425 new maps in Pennsylvania \nalone--people who have never been in a flood zone, people who will soon \nbe in a flood zone, and when they find out their insurance is $10,000 \nor $5,000 a year or $20,000 a year, they are not going to be happy, let \nme assure my colleagues. Pennsylvania is No. 1. No. 2 is New York where \n625 new maps are going to be executed; in New Jersey, 435 new maps; in \nNorth Carolina, 565 new maps; and in Michigan, 550 new maps.\n  Everyone thinks this is a Louisiana issue. I have been trying to say \nfor a year and a half: Yes, this affects my State; yes, it affects \nMississippi and Georgia and Alabama. But the country needs to wake up. \nThis issue will affect people in many places, because of the new maps \nthat are coming out, because of the new science, the new ability to \nmeasure elevations. There are going to be people who have never been in \na flood zone, and they are going to be told they are now in a flood \nzone. We better get a program they can afford.\n  I thank Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson for their leadership. \nThey will both speak later this evening as we move to this vote. Let's \nhave this debate. Let's come up with a new approach that works for the \ntaxpayer, the homeowners, as well as the realtors, the bankers, and the \nstakeholder groups that have been so supportive. Realtors, home \nbuilders, the National Association of Counties, League of Cities, \nBankers Association, Community Bankers, and Independent Insurance \nAgents are all supporting these efforts.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for \nallowing me to jump in front of him.\n  I commend the Senator from Louisiana and confirm everything she said. \nThe vote tonight on the motion to proceed is important. This is an \nimportant debate not just for coastal States and not just for the \ncoastline but for the entire United States, because the unintended \nconsequences of Biggert-Waters as it goes into place are less insurance \ncoverage for less and less Americans and more damage in case of another \nterrible storm such as Sandy or Katrina.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and the coalition \nshe has worked with to bring this issue forward. I hope all of our \ncolleagues will vote yes on the motion to proceed this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             War on Poverty\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, tomorrow night we have the State of the \nUnion Address, and news reports say that one of the issues the \nPresident will be speaking about is income inequality. That brings me \nto something I should have spoken on a couple of weeks ago, because \nJanuary 8, 2014, marked the 50th anniversary of President Johnson's \ncall for a war on poverty. This anniversary provides a time to reflect \non and reevaluate its twin aims of poverty relief and economic \nopportunity.\n  The goal of poverty relief is to ensure that even those who might \nfind themselves in tough times have sufficient assistance to meet their \nbasic human needs while lifting themselves out of abject poverty. In \nother words, we have to make sure people have a roof over their heads \nand food on their table, as minimums.\n  The goal of economic opportunity is to ensure the lower rungs on the \neconomic ladder are strong enough to support that climb out of poverty. \nEconomic opportunity is another term for the American dream that \nthrough hard work, as we know, we can improve not just a person's own \nlot in life but that a person's children and a person's children's \nchildren will be better off.\n  If we judge the war on poverty according to the first aim, a good \ncase can be made that we have been very successful. Looking at the \nofficial poverty level that is based on income prior to many transfer \npayments, little has changed since 1964. However, consumption-based \nstudies show the poor are much better off today than they were decades \nago. A study available from the National Bureau of Economic Research \nthat looks at consumption rather than income shows over a 26-percent \ndecline in poverty since 1960.\n  There is little doubt that programs from Social Security to food \nstamps, from Medicaid to heating assistance, have helped increase the \nstandard of living for those at or below the poverty level. However, \neconomic growth and the general decline in the cost of technology have \nalso been a great source of poverty reduction.\n  While providing relief from poverty is an admirable goal, the \nAmerican dream has always been about opportunity. As President Johnson \nsaid in his State of the Union Address 50 years ago, the goal of the \nwar on poverty ``is not only to relieve the symptoms of poverty, but to \ncure it and, above all, to prevent it.''\n  It is this goal of the war on poverty that has largely fallen flat. \nAs I referenced earlier, the official poverty level has changed little \nin the 50-year fight on poverty, despite spending trillions of dollars \non antipoverty measures. In 1964, around 19 percent lived in poverty. \nToday, according to the most recent census data, that number stands \nonly slightly lower at 15 percent.\n  We all know America is the land of opportunity. In America, we have \nno caste system. Laws and social norms do not relegate any individual \nor any group of individuals to lower social status. It can be tough, \nbut individuals can and do climb their way to the top. Sometimes this \nprocess can take generations, but it has always been a\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\nsource of pride that the next generation is better off and has more \nopportunities than the generation that came just before.\n  Indeed, there is considerable upward mobility in our economy. A 2007 \nTreasury study on income mobility found that between 1996 and 2005, \naround half of those taxpayers who found themselves in the bottom \nquintile in 1966 moved to a higher income group in 2005.\n  How about the very top of the income distribution my colleagues are \nfixated on? Contrary to what some may claim, those at the top are not \nthe same year after year. The Treasury study found of those taxpayers \nwho were in the top one-hundredth of 1 percent in 1996, only 25 percent \nremained in that group in 2005.\n  While there is upward mobility in America, there is always room for \nimprovement. And there certainly are those who feel trapped in a cycle \nof poverty.\n  Unfortunately, too often programs meant to help the less fortunate \ncan act as an anchor, preventing Americans from climbing up the ladder \nof success. I have no doubt the vast majority of those living at or \nbelow the poverty lines are very hard-working people. Our programs do \nnot act as an anchor because of the poor themselves but because too \noften programs meant to help actually turn out to punish success. Too \noften those who are seeking to escape generations of poverty feel as if \nthe harder they work, the further behind they get.\n  The landmark welfare reform legislation Congress passed in 1996 \nsought to lift the anchor off the backs of the poor. It sought to \nincrease opportunity by incentivizing individuals to work.\n  The welfare reform law was meant to reward personal responsibility \nand a strong work ethic rather than punish these traits so essential to \nsuccess.\n  The landmark law established work requirements, requiring individuals \nto work when job ready and within 2 years after coming on assistance. \nTo receive funding, States must require a minimum amount of work, and \nthat participation must be in hours by families receiving assistance. \nThis meets one of TANF's--Temporary Assistance for Needy Families--\nprimary goals: to end the dependence of needy parents on government \nbenefits by promoting job preparation.\n  In other words, if you are going to move up the economic ladder, you \nhave to be in the world to work. If you are shunted off to the side of \nsociety, out of sight, out of mind, then there is no opportunity to \nmove up.\n  In the years that followed, those who argued dire consequences would \nresult, particularly for single mothers--these people were proven \nwrong. Following the enactment of welfare reform, there was a \nprecipitous decline in welfare caseload and usage. At the same time, \nthe single mother labor force participation rose and their incomes \nrose.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama has persistently implemented policies \nthat erode these statutory regulations; thereby, discouraging personal \nresponsibility and a strong work ethic.\n  On July 12, 2012, the administration issued what is referred to as \nguidance to States about this TANF Program. This guidance explained how \nStates can now seek waivers of work requirements for welfare recipients \nfor the first time since the TANF Program was created in the 1996 \nwelfare reform law.\n  The 1996 welfare reform helped families to enjoy the dignity of self-\nsufficiency. It reduced poverty. Instead of pushing families out of \npoverty, the President's policies trapped Americans in soul-crushing \ngovernment dependency.\n  While welfare reform made strides, too often those working hard to \nget a leg up feel as if they are only treading water. In November 2012, \nthe Congressional Budget Office released a report looking at the \neffective marginal tax rate of low- and moderate-income workers; that \nis, how much extra tax or reduction in government benefits is imposed \non an American worker when he or she earns an additional dollar of \nincome; in other words, people are pretty sophisticated about looking \nat how much they get in a government program, and if they go into the \nworld to work, are they going to be penalized for it instead of drawing \nhelp.\n  According to CBO, in 2013, the average marginal effective tax rate \nfaced by low- to moderate-income workers was 32 percent. Keep in mind \nthis is just the average. Many workers experience marginal effective \nrates far exceeding the top statutory rate of 39.6 percent paid by the \nhighest income people in America.\n  For an example, an economist with the Urban Institute calculated the \nmarginal effective tax rate of a single parent with two children under \nvarious scenarios. Just one scenario examined what would happen if a \nhousehold income rose from $10,000 to $40,000.\n  Perhaps a single mother was able to increase her skills and earning \npotential by taking classes at night at a local community college. If \nthis single mother had been receiving all the benefits she was eligible \nfor, she would face a marginal effective tax rate of 80 percent as a \nreward for trying to make a better life for her and her family. That is \na far higher marginal tax rate than most on the left even proposed for \nthe much derided top 1 percent.\n  It is difficult to blame an individual in this situation who becomes \ndisgruntled and just gives up, not seeking employment. It is we in the \ngovernment who have tilted the scales against those low-income \nAmericans trying to realize the American dream. In order to alleviate \nthis disincentive, there must be a better coordination between benefits \nand how they are phased out.\n  Instead of reducing this disincentive to work, in recent years we \nhave actually made it worse. The premium tax credit and cost-sharing \nsubsidies that were enacted as a part of the Affordable Care Act will \nincrease marginal tax rates by an average of 12 percentage points. \nMoreover, according to an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nwhen the premium tax credit is fully in effect, some workers could \nexperience ``infinite marginal tax rates.''\n  Some of you may wonder what is an infinite marginal tax rate. To put \nthis into more understandable language, this means some workers could \nactually face marginal effective rates exceeding 100 percent.\n  For a worker in this situation, it means if they decide to put in a \nfew more hours at work or get a second job to earn extra cash, they \ncould actually end up worse off financially. Of course, this is an \nabsurd result that tells people do not work hard, do not try to advance \nyour situation, because if you do, we are going to take it all away \nfrom you.\n  Harvard economics professor and former chief White House economist \nGreg Mankiw recently opined on this result saying: ``It is hard to \nbelieve that the law is so badly written as to have this feature.'' \nWell, Professor, believe it or not, the President and the majority \nparty did enact this law with this feature, and they did so with the \nfull knowledge of the Joint Committee on Taxation analysis which I had \nmade public.\n  Often I hear my colleagues on the other side come to the floor to \npound the table about income inequality--something we are going to hear \nthe President talk about tomorrow night in his State of the Union \nAddress, we are told. There are a number of studies that examine income \ninequality. There is great variation among these studies on how income \ninequality is measured and the degree to which it has actually \nincreased over the years.\n  However, all these studies do point to some degree of increasing \ninequality over the last several decades. That we have to admit. This \nhas occurred during both Republican and Democratic administrations. It \nhas also been occurring across most of the developed countries. It \nhappens not just in the United States but other places as well.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle often cite income \ninequality to justify whatever Democratic policy agenda is up at that \nparticular time. Whether it is taxing the rich, raising the minimum \nwage or extending unemployment benefits, they cite income inequality to \njustify their aims.\n  However, these policies either fail to address the root causes of \ninequality or are nothing more than a temporary bandaid. Income \ninequality is a symptom of much larger structural problems, not the \ndisease itself. Raising taxes might be successful at generating revenue \nto fund greater wealth transfer payments, but it does nothing to \nrectify what caused the inequality in the first place.\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\n  Soak-the-rich policies do not create greater opportunity for low-\nincome individuals. In fact, because of the negative effects on \neconomic growth and capital formation, they can reduce opportunity not \nonly for the poor but for all Americans. Our country has historically \nbeen a land of opportunity. Whether such policies are well intended or \ncynical political opportunism, they are not worth trading away our \nNation's legacy of opportunity.\n  You do not have to take my word for the antigrowth effects of \nincreasing taxes. Research by Christina Romer, President Obama's former \nchief economist, found that a tax increase of 1 percent of GDP reduces \neconomic growth by as much as 3 percent. According to this study, tax \nincreases have such a substantial effect on economic growth because of \nthe ``powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment.''\n  In effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist \npolicies are saying--to quote Margaret Thatcher--is that they ``would \nrather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less \nrich.''\n  That may reduce inequality but at the expense of making us all worse \noff. Our goal must be to create wealth and to create opportunity for \nall Americans.\n  I reject the notion that in order to improve the lot of one \nindividual someone else must be made worse off. The leadership of the \nmajority has become fixated on redistributing the existing economic \npie. I believe the better policy is to increase the size of that pie. \nWhen this occurs, no one is made better off at the expense of anyone \nelse.\n  This is best achieved through progrowth policies aimed at growing the \neconomic pie, not by taking from some and giving to others.\n  Similarly, increasing the minimum wage or extending emergency \nunemployment benefits also fail to address long-term causes of \ninequality. These proposals are well intended, and I myself have \nsupported both under the right circumstances but neither strike at the \nheart of income inequality.\n  While there are many contributing factors, much of the research \npoints to the widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor. If \nwe are to address income inequality, the primary focus must be on \nensuring individuals have the skills necessary to compete in a 21st \ncentury economy.\n  One way to accomplish this is through greater competition in \neducation through increased school choice. We should also further \nexpand our efforts made in 1996 to incentivize individuals to work and \nensure those who want to work can gain the skills that are necessary \nfor a 21st century economy.\n  There are certain ways we can help reduce poverty and promote \nopportunity. However, just throwing more and more money at existing \nprograms is not the answer. According to a Congressional Research \nService report, Federal spending on low-income assistance programs as a \npercent of Federal outlays has more than doubled since the 1970s.\n  No amount of money then will change the tried-and-true formula for \nescaping poverty; namely, graduate high school, wait until marriage to \nhave children, and find a job and keep it for at least 1 year. While \neven those who follow this formula can fall on tough times, \nstatistically it is rare that they will find themselves poor for a \nsustained period of time.\n  We should be sure our laws and programs encourage rather than \ndiscourage these three keys to success. One place to start is to take a \nlook at reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty that can arise in \nboth our tax laws and benefit programs.\n  The war on poverty will not be won as long as the value of marriage \nis diminished.\n  You cannot disagree with the facts. Children in single-parent \nhouseholds will face more challenges and are more likely to be poor.\n  Some economists say that children raised in single-parent homes are \nfour times more likely to be living in poverty. According to census \ndata, in 2012 just 6.3 percent of the families headed by married \ncouples are poor. In contrast, 31 percent of those in single-parent \nhouseholds are poor.\n  Today, more children are born out of wedlock, more marriages are \ndissolved, families are not as strong as they could or should be, and \nwe have a social problem that cannot be cured with more government \nspending. The war on poverty must be solved in part by encouraging and \nnurturing healthy families.\n  Of course, there is no magic cure-all for poverty. In fact, that is \nthe point. The notion that experts in Washington can wage a successful \nwar on poverty with spending programs as a weapon was never realistic. \nWe are dealing with real people, with real lives trying to realize \ntheir dreams, not pieces on a chess board that we can move around as we \nwish.\n  Our goal should be to tear down the barriers to economic opportunity \nand simply get out of the way. When we discover that well-intentioned \nprograms designed to help the poor are actually trapping them in \ngenerational poverty, we need to have the courage to chart a new \ncourse.\n  The American dream is not to be dependent upon others for bare \nsubstance but to have the opportunity to get ahead through your own \nhard work and perseverance. All Americans deserve the self-respect that \ncomes from earning your own success in life.\n  Millions of immigrants have flocked to our shores because America \noffered greater economic opportunity than any other nation. We are at \nrisk of losing part of what has made our society unique. We should \nseize the opportunity of this anniversary of the war on poverty 50 \nyears ago to reevaluate our approach to ending poverty and get back to \nwhat has historically worked for generations of Americans, and that is \nsimply to promote economic opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my remarks to the Senate will deal with \nthe Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. I am pleased the \nSenate is close to considering a bill to protect homeowners and \nbusinesses from unintended increases in the cost of flood insurance.\n  In July 2012, as part of a larger legislative package that included \nthe highway bill and the Gulf Coast RESTORE Act, Congress passed the \nso-called Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act with no opportunity \nfor amendments. The Biggert-Waters Act generally succeeded in its aim \nto strengthen and ensure the long-term fiscal solvency of the National \nFlood Insurance Program.\n  But we need to take another look at a few of the act's reforms that \nare causing a great deal of consternation throughout my State and the \nrest of the country. At the time of its consideration by the Senate, we \nknew Biggert-Waters might cause modest increases in flood insurance \npremiums. Administration officials testified repeatedly before our \ncommittees that the increases would be manageable for American \nhomeowners.\n  Unfortunately, the increases have been anything but manageable, as \nskyrocketing premiums are driving citizens out of their homes and \nthreatening the future viability of entire communities.\n  These Americans are receiving notices that their flood insurance \npremiums are rising to stratospheric heights, regardless of the fact \nthat their homes may have never flooded or despite investments in flood \ncontrol infrastructure and mitigation against future risk.\n  A constituent from Ocean Springs, MS, contacted my office to give us \nher perspective on the legislation. She wrote:\n\n       Built in 1986, [my house] survived all hurricanes including \n     Katrina. I used my retirement savings to buy the house. \n     Before closing, flood insurance was grandfathered at $245 per \n     year. After closing, the rate skyrocketed to $18,450. You can \n     understand my shock.\n\n  If you do the math, her new rates are more than 75 times the rate \nwhen she purchased her home. I hope Senators will vote to end this \ndebate tonight and proceed to the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act. This is our opportunity to protect homeowners from \nskyrocketing flood insurance premiums until Congress is provided \nassurances from the administration related to affordability and the \nengineering practices it is using to make flood insurance rate \ndeterminations.\n  A study by the National Academies of Science produced in March 2013 \nhas\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\ncalled into question some of the engineering practices the government \nuses to determine rates. It is important that we make certain the \ngovernment's engineering practices and procedures are sound and \nunderstand the implications of these rates before we allow them to \ndevalue private property and ruin people's lives. It will be very \nchallenging to rebuild neighborhoods or restore home equity once they \nare lost. We must get it right.\n  The long-term solvency of the National Flood Insurance Program is \ncritical to protecting taxpayer investments, communicating flood risk \nto homeowners and encouraging communities to invest in mitigation \nmeasures. The reform legislation enacted in 2012 made positive changes \nto the program. However, some of those changes are now working in \nopposition to the broader goals of reform. These shortcomings are \nalienating the very people the program is intended to help and actually \nthreaten to make the program less solvent in the long run.\n  The long term viability of the flood insurance program is important \nto many inland and coastal States. The new insurance rates penalize \ncitizens, who have followed the rules and places the heaviest burden on \nthose who are just now recovering from recent disasters. In my State, \ncommunities continue to work to overcome the damage caused by the \ngreatest natural disaster in our Nation's history, the effects of the \nDeepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, and now dramatic flood insurance \nrate increases.\n  Our bill does not create new programs to address rising premiums. It \nsimply leaves in place some current practices so that we can make sure \nthe productive reforms we enacted in 2012 will actually improve the \ncredibility of the program among communities and homeowners. Our bill \nwould not affect the positive reforms related to expanding program \nparticipation or the phase-out of subsidized flood insurance premiums \nfor vacation homes and homes that have a history of repeated flooding.\n  The consideration and passage of this bill would represent a \nbipartisan consensus to make modest changes to existing law, while \nprotecting homeowners and steering the National Flood Insurance Program \nonto a path to fiscal sustainability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Homeowner Flood \nInsurance Affordability Act, which I have sponsored with Senator \nIsakson. It is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation to ensure \nthat families will be able to afford flood insurance so they can stay \nin their homes, businesses can stay open, and property values will not \nplummet. This broadly bipartisan legislation will stop the most onerous \nand damaging rate increases while minimizing the impact on the National \nFlood Insurance Program's solvency.\n  I want to thank all of those who have supported the legislation, all \nof our cosponsors, as well as the National Association of Home \nBuilders, the National Association of Realtors, the American Bankers \nAssociation, the Independent Community Bankers of America, the \nIndependent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, and Greater New \nOrleans, Incorporated, who have all endorsed our bill.\n  I specifically want to thank my lead Republican cosponsor Senator \nIsakson. I have had the pleasure to work with Senator Isakson on a \nnumber of issues. I have come to respect his honesty and desire to come \ntogether and get things done regardless of the issue.\n  I also want to thank Senator Landrieu who has been focused like a \nhawk on this issue for years now. She is without a doubt the Senate's \npreeminent expert on disaster recovery and flooding issues. The people \nof Louisiana are fortunate to have such a tireless champion. She has \ntaken the time and effort to understand every aspect of flooding and \ndisaster recovery.\n  I saw that expertise firsthand when Senator Landrieu came to New \nJersey after Sandy struck and worked with us. I cannot thank her enough \nfor the valuable insight she gave to us as we were dealing with Sandy \nrecovery.\n  When Sandy struck New Jersey, over 2 million households were without \npower, 346,000 homes were damaged or lay in ruin, and, most tragically \nof all, 37 fellow New Jerseyans lost their lives. But true to our \nState's motto we were Jersey tough. People who lost their homes were \nknocked down but not out. They got up, dusted themselves off and \nstarted the long process of rebuilding.\n  But just as they were getting started, they got hit by another \ndisaster, this time a manmade one that took the form of drastic flood \ninsurance premium hikes that threaten to finish the job that Sandy \nstarted. I started receiving letters--first dozens, then hundreds, then \nthousands of people pleading to me for help. They wrote in desperation \nthat their insurance premium was about to go from about $1,000 a year \nto an incredible $10,000. They told me after exhausting all of their \nsavings on repairing and rebuilding their home, they simply had no more \nto spare--none left.\n  They were being hit by what I have come to call a triple whammy. \nFirst they got hit by the worst natural disaster in our State's \nhistory. Then they were faced with drastically elevated premiums \nmandated by Biggert-Waters. Finally, they had to contend with fatally \nflawed mapping processes that further exacerbated the drastic rate \nincreases.\n  While Sandy made New Jersey especially vulnerable to the rate hikes \nrequired under Biggert-Waters, make no mistake about it, this is not a \nNew Jersey or New York issue. It is not even a coastal issue. The \nreason this bill has such broad support across the ideological and \ngeographical spectrum and the political spectrum is because flood \ninsurance is not just a coastal or a northeast issue, it is an issue \nthat affects the entire country.\n  The fact remains that 55 percent of Americans live within 50 miles of \nthe coast. National Flood Insurance insures more than 5.5 million \nproperties across all 50 States. Every State in the Nation will see \npremiums on some of their properties increase as a result of Biggert-\nWaters. As this map shows, FEMA is in the process of updating maps in \nevery State. The different colors are simply what the status is of that \neffort.\n  People who played by the rules and built to code will suddenly find \nthat they are no longer in compliance and will be faced with a \ndifficult decision: Spend upwards of $100,000 to elevate their home 3, \n4, 5 or more feet from its current level or see their annual insurance \npremium spike from $1,000 to $10,000 to $20,000 over the next 5 years.\n  Not all of these increases will be so drastic, but the many that are \nwill act as a de facto eviction notice for homeowners who have lived in \ntheir homes and played by the rules their entire lives. If they try too \nsell their homes, prospective buyers will balk after learning of the \nhigh premium cost that comes with it, leaving the owner no choice but \nto sell at a fire sale.\n  This will drive down property values just as the housing market is \nstill struggling to recover. We all know that declining property values \nhave a domino effect, causing entire neighborhoods to decline in value, \nwhich in turn hurts the broader economy. What is most alarming is the \nfact that FEMA does not even know the size or scope of this problem.\n  They were supposed to complete a study into the affordability of rate \nincreases under Biggert-Waters by last April, but they failed to do it. \nThis was a mandated study that I was able to include in Biggert-Waters \nbecause I knew that this was going to be a problem. The main reason for \nthe delay is they simply do not know what the new rates are going to \nlook like. They do not know how many families will see rates double or \ntriple--or many times more--so they cannot even guess on how these \nhikes will affect affordability.\n  Think about that for a second. We are making dramatic changes in \npolicy that could impact more than 5.5 million policyholders--that is \nreally families. These changes can have ripple effects throughout the \nhousing market and our entire economy, before we even know the extent \nof the changes and their impact.\n  That is simply not acceptable. No one can argue to me that is sound \npublic policy. In addition to the impacts\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\non families, the housing market, and the economy, drastic rate \nincreases could actually have the perverse effect of undermining the \nsolvency of the program. It could end up costing taxpayers more in \ndisaster assistance payments by pricing homeowners out of insurance.\n  Recent reports suggest that only about 18 percent of properties in \nthe flood zones participate in the program. One study has shown that \nfor every 10-percent increase in premiums, program participation \ndecreases by approximately 2.9 percent, almost 3 percent.\n  If rates are raised too high and too quickly, people will simply opt \nto drop their insurance, decreasing participation and the risk pool the \nNational Flood Insurance Program draws on. The sharper the increases, \nthe higher the proportion of dropouts. As with any insurance fund, this \nis about spreading risk. The smaller the risk pool, the greater the \nrisk, and, therefore, the higher the costs. It perpetuates itself.\n  By pricing people out of the flood insurance program, increasing \nrates could have the unintended consequences of actually making the \nprogram less solvent. Reduced program participation would also increase \nthe amount taxpayers are on the hook in disaster assistance payments.\n  Since FEMA grants, SBA loans, and other disaster assistance are \nreserved for unmet needs, more uninsured homeowners translate into more \ndisaster assistance payouts.\n  Not only are we blind to the extent of these rate hikes and the \neffect they will have on program participation and the overall budget, \nwe are also allowing what I believe to be a highly questionable mapping \nprocess to justify them. My experience with FEMA's map updates has led \nme to have serious doubts about the process and the accuracy of their \nresults.\n  In December of 2012, FEMA released advisory base flood elevation \nmaps, or ABFEs, for 10 counties in New Jersey. These showed a dramatic \nexpansion of what are known as a V zone, which are high-risk flood \nzones that require houses to undergo special retrofitting that is often \nprohibitively expensive. For the thousands of families who were now in \nthis dread V zone, the notification they received might as well have \nbeen an eviction notice, because they were never going to be able to \nafford the retrofitting, and without it they couldn't afford their \npremiums.\n  To be fair, FEMA did say that this first round of maps was \nconservative and subject to change in the next phase of the updates, \nbut they maintained the changes would be minimal and the zones would \nremain largely intact.\n  After working with municipalities and counties, challenging the \naccuracy of these maps, and pushing FEMA to expedite their review \nprocess, they finally released a new iteration that showed as much as \nan 80-percent decline in the V-zone area in some of our counties. This \nwas not a small mistake or a rounding error, it was a fatally flawed \nprocess that resulted in needless anxiety and frustration for thousands \nof homeowners only months out from Sandy.\n  While this is bad enough, imagine how much worse the consequences \nwould have been if premium rates were increased to reflect these \ninaccurate ABFEs. Families would be forced out of their homes and \nhomeowners would lose the most valuable asset they have--something they \nhave worked their whole lives for--all because of inaccurate maps.\n  While there is no question we need to put the flood insurance program \non a more solvent trajectory, we first need to understand the scope of \nthese changes and be sure the mapping process used to set these rates \nis accurate. We need to understand the impact these dramatic changes in \nBiggert-Waters will have on the housing market before it is too late.\n  Unfortunately, Biggert-Waters forces changes that are far too large, \nfar too fast, without having all the facts. It requires FEMA to \nincrease rates dramatically even before FEMA knows the scope of these \nchanges or how they will impact program participation. That is why our \nbill would impose a moratorium on the phaseout of subsidies in Biggert-\nWaters for most primary residences until FEMA completes the \naffordability study that was mandated in Biggert-Waters and proposes a \nregulatory framework to address the issues found in the study.\n  It would also require FEMA to certify in writing that it has \nimplemented a flood mapping approach that utilizes sound scientific and \nengineering methodologies before certain rate reforms are implemented. \nFor any property sales that occurred during this period, the homeowner \nwould continue to receive the same treatment as the previous owner of \nthe property, unless they trigger some other provision of Biggert-\nWaters not covered by this bill. For prospective home buyers, the \ncertainty that they will not see their rate dramatically increase \nsimply because they purchased a home is critically important to \nmaintaining property values.\n  Also, this new legislation would give FEMA more flexibility to \ncomplete the affordability study. It would reimburse qualifying \nhomeowners for successful appeals of erroneous flood map \ndeterminations. It would give communities fair credit for locally \nfunded flood protection systems. It would continue the fair treatment \nafforded to communities with floodproof basement exemptions. It would \nprovide for a FEMA ombudsman to advocate for and provide information to \npolicyholders.\n  Just as important as what this bill would do, it is also important to \nknow what this bill will not do. The legislation would not stop the \nphaseout of taxpayer subsidies for vacation homes and homes that have \nsubstantially been damaged. It would not stop the phaseout of taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies for properties that have been repetitively flooded, \nincluding the 1 percent riskiest properties that account for over one-\nthird of all claims. It would not encourage new construction in \nenvironmentally sensitive or flood-prone areas, and it would not stop \nmost of the important reforms included in Biggert-Waters.\n  This legislation simply provides temporary relief to a targeted group \nof property owners who played by the rules and are now poised to see \nthe most valuable asset in their life become worthless, all through no \nfault of their own.\n  This bill doesn't include everything I wanted--and I know there are \nmany other ideas that other cosponsors wanted to include--but in order \nto reach a true consensus, this bill focuses on ideas that had broad \nbipartisan support. That is why we are here today, Democrats and \nRepublicans, asking for the support of the Senate on this vital piece \nof legislation.\n  We tried to reach a delicate balance with this bill that recognizes \nthe need to improve solvency and phase out certain subsidies, but tries \nto do so without discouraging program participation and thus \nundermining solvency and fiscal responsibility.\n  Finally, this isn't only about insurance rates, tables, and actuarial \nrisk rates, it is about our fellow citizens. It is about people, people \nwho played by the rules their whole lives and are now facing a life-\naltering event they never could have prepared or planned for.\n  If Biggert-Waters is allowed to be implemented as written, we will \nsee property values drop, middle-class families forced from their \nhomes, and our economy suffer.\n  The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act is a broadly \nbipartisan, carefully crafted, tightly targeted approach to restore the \nsolvency of the program, while fulfilling the original intent of the \nprogram to make flood insurance affordable and accessible. That is why \nwe hope our colleagues will vote yes on cloture so we can proceed to \nprovide relief to families before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Extending Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it has been almost 1 month since Senators \nand House Members went home and failed to extend unemployment \ninsurance, a lifeline for 1.6 million Americans.\n  In my home State of Ohio, 52,000 have lost their unemployment \nbenefits--people who were working, lost their jobs, were looking for \nwork, and have had their benefits ended. Another 76,000 in my State \nalone--from Toledo to Chillicothe to Cleveland to Dayton--will lose \ntheir benefits by the end of the year.\n  This insurance program is not called unemployment welfare; it is \ncalled unemployment insurance. People pay into it when they are working \nand get the benefits when they are laid off, and they only receive \nthese benefits if they are actively seeking work. This is why it is \ncalled unemployment insurance. This is a program which has worked. This \nnot only hurts the families who aren't receiving the unemployment \nbenefits of about $300 a week. It is also money which goes into our \neconomy and helps our economy grow.\n  A new report shows that because we didn't have an extension of these \nbenefits, we have lost $1.76 billion in economic activity just in this \n1 month alone. Ohio has lost tens of millions of dollars.\n  What does that mean? It means people don't have $300 a week in their \npocket to go to the grocery store or to fix their car which they need \nto look for work. They don't have money to go to the local store or to \nbuy clothes for their kids.\n  Economic experts have said extending unemployment benefits will \ncreate 200,000 jobs in our country because of the economic activity \ngenerated. So it is not just these families--in Ohio, 52,000 workers \nand in many cases their families--who are hurting. It is also the \ncommunities from Toledo to Steubenville, all over my State, and all \nover this country. At a time when Congress should be helping to grow \nthis economy, our inaction slows growth and makes it harder to find \nwork.\n  We know we are still emerging from the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. We have made progress, but there are still nearly 11 \nmillion Americans unemployed, and about 4 million have been unemployed \nfor at least 27 weeks.\n  When President Bush signed the latest round of emergency assistance \ninto effect, the unemployment rate was about 5.5 percent--more than 1 \npoint lower than it is today. Today, the long-term unemployment rate is \nmore than double what it has been at any other time Congress has let \nemergency jobless assistance expire.\n  Americans work hard. They want to work. Yet there is one job opening \nfor every three job seekers.\n  The same people who don't like unemployment insurance typically don't \nlike the way Social Security works--another social insurance program--\nand typically don't like Medicare--another social insurance program. \nMedicare, Social Security, unemployment insurance--they are social \ninsurance programs you pay into when you are working and get benefits \nwhen you are not, whether it is Medicare or Social Security or whether \nit is unemployment.\n  I will read a couple stories from real people affected by this. These \naren't just numbers. These are real people hurt when Congress doesn't \ndo its job.\n  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island has been on this floor over and \nover. A number of us have pushed for this unemployment insurance \nextension. We continue to be met by a threatened filibuster. The House \nof Representatives continues to dig in and do nothing about \nunemployment insurance because they simply don't believe in the \nunemployment insurance program.\n\n       I'm in my mid-40s, have a Master's degree, and had an \n     excellent career history until I was laid off--through no \n     fault of my own--late last spring. I've been searching for \n     work for 7 months and hope to find something soon. While I am \n     encouraged that I have had five interviews in the last two \n     weeks, I know that if I am not hired soon, I will not be able \n     to pay my rent and buy groceries.\n       I would much rather be working, and I am doing the best I \n     can to find something. Please do not assume the long term \n     unemployed have given up. We have not. We need support in \n     continuing our search, however, so we can afford the bare \n     necessities.\n\n  The $300 a week for somebody like Emily--I don't know precisely what \nshe would get based on her income and all the years she worked and all \nthat she would need, but it is clear we are turning our backs on people \nsuch as Emily from Lake County.\n  Matthew from Cuyahoga County:\n\n       I was laid off almost a year ago, and I have been \n     diligently looking for work but have not been able to find \n     anything yet.\n       One of my children was recently diagnosed with an \n     incurable, yet manageable disease, and the medical bills have \n     exhausted our emergency fund.\n       I have worked extremely hard my entire adult life to \n     provide a good life for my family only to see it threatened \n     by the continual bickering in Congress. For many of us, the \n     recession is not over.\n       Please work with other Senators to continue the federal \n     unemployment benefits.\n\n  That is what we are doing. We are going to continue to bring this \nissue to the floor. We are going to continue to work to extend \nunemployment insurance for people such as Matthew, for people such as \nEmily.\n  Terry from Medina County writes:\n\n       I am a 59 year old single parent and have been diligently \n     looking for employment since November of 2012, [13 months]. I \n     have been able to secure some temporary work but not a \n     permanent job.\n       I have worked since I was 17 years old and I have never \n     been out of work before. I am also a college educated woman \n     with a Masters Degree in Public Administration. If I don't \n     find something soon, I may have to file for bankruptcy. My \n     house will likely go into foreclosure by the spring. My son \n     may have to live with his dad to finish out his last year of \n     high school, and he will struggle to obtain the necessary \n     finances to afford college.\n       Senator Brown, I want to work.

I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to John Rogers, Sr.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Friday at Rockefeller Chapel on the \ncampus of the University of Chicago hundreds braved the frigid weather \nto pay tribute to a fallen American hero. The life story of John \nRogers, Sr., recalls an extraordinary chapter in the life of our \nNation.\n  Seventy years ago, during World War II, the first African-American \nmilitary aviators in the history of the United States Armed Forces \ndeployed to North Africa.\n  These brave men were part of the now-legendary 99th Pursuit Squadron \nof the United States Army Air Corps. We know them better today as the \nvery first Tuskegee Airmen to be deployed overseas--the first of the \nfirst.\n  During the war, Tuskegee Airmen were often referred to as ``Red \nTails,'' after the distinctive color of the aircraft tails. Many of the \nbomber crews whose missions the Tuskegee Airman escorted over Nazi-\noccupied Europe had another name for them. They called them the ``Red-\nTailed Angels'' because they made possible for so many other pilots to \ncome home after the war to their families.\n  Last Tuesday, one of those original Red-Tailed Angels went to his \nfinal home. I am proud to say that I knew him and his family. His name \nwas Judge John Rogers. He was 95 years old. He lived in Chicago.\n  Let me tell you about him.\n  John Rogers was born in Knoxville, TN in 1918. His father was a \nminister who also owned his own 12-chair barber shop. His mother died \nof tuberculosis when Judge Rogers was just 4 years old. The family \nlives across the street from Knoxville College, which John's parents \nhad both attended.\n  Their father instilled in John and his three sisters a reverence for \neducation. In addition to learning, young John Rogers also developed a \nlove of flying. These were years when flying was still a new miracle.\n  As a boy, Judge Rogers would construct his own model planes using \npaper, string and the light wood from cheese boxes. When he was 9 or 10 \nyears old, he walked miles from his family's home to the Knoxville \nairport just to be able to say that he had touched an airplane. When he \nwas 12, he suffered another terrible loss. His father died of kidney \nfailure.\n  John and his three sisters moved to Chicago to live with his mother's \nbrother, a kind man who raised them in a loving home. Judge Rogers \nattended Tilden Technical High School in Chicago, walking 4 miles each \nway to school--8 miles a day.\n  After high school, he earned a degree from Chicago Teachers College. \nHe put himself through college working as a short-order cook, among \nother jobs. After college, he became a teacher in the Chicago public \nschools.\n  At the same time he was studying to be a teacher, he was also \nlearning to fly in the Army's Civilian Pilot Training Program in \nChicago, where all the instructors were black.\n  He received his civilian pilot's license in 1938, when he was 20 \nyears old--one of only about 120 African Americans pilot in the whole \ncountry at that time.\n  When World War II broke out, John Rogers tried to enlist in the Army \nas a pilot. The Army told him that it didn't have any ``colored'' \npilots and didn't have any plans to have any ``colored'' pilots,'' but \nthey had an opening for a truck driver. John Rogers told them: No \nthanks. He said he figured if he was going to be in combat, it was \nsafer to be in the air than on the ground. So he volunteered in 1941 \nfor a new Army Air Corps training program that had just been \nestablished for African American pilots in Tuskegee, AL.\n  He became part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, the first all-black air \nunit, under the leadership of the legendary Lt. Colonel--later \nGeneral--Benjamin O. Davis. In April 1943, he one of the first 28 \nAfrican-American pilots to go overseas.\n  The 99th was based in Northern Africa and flew escort and bombing \nmissions over Italy. Pilots of the 99th once set a record for \ndestroying five enemy aircraft in under 4 minutes. Even among such an \nelite group of pilots, John Rogers stood out for his keen eyesight and \nsteady nerves.\n  Mark Hanson is curator of the Chanute Air Museum--formerly Chanute \nAir Force Base--in Rantoul, IL, where the 99th was first activated. He \nsaid John Rogers was revered as a pilot who was so good he ``could put \na 500-pound bomb through a building's window.''\n  A photo at the Chanute museum, taken by an armaments officer and \nfriend, shows John Rogers standing next to his P-40 Warhawk. An \ninscription on the photo reads: ``This is Jack Rogers, the best dive-\nbomber pilot in the business.''\n  Another photo of John Rogers and members of the 99th hangs at the \nSmithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n  The skill of the men of the 99th was well known among pilots, \nespecially by the British, who often asked for the Airmen's close-air \nsupport.\n  What I am about to say here I read as I sat at that church service. I \nlooked at it and I said it must be a misprint, and I read it again and \nit is true. All told, John Rogers flew 120 often dangerous combat \nmissions for his Nation, over Europe, most of it over Nazi-occupied \nterritory, and he rose to the rank of Army captain--120 missions.\n  After the war, he returned to Chicago. He decided at that time he \nwanted to go to law school so he said: I am going to the best. He \napplied over the phone at the University of Chicago law school. He was \ntold that he lacked ``the necessary qualifications.''\n  Undeterred, John Roger showed up the next day at the law school \nwearing his Army officer's uniform. He said that someone who served his \ncountry in war deserved a chance to at least take a test to prove that \nhe did have the qualifications to go to law school. So they gave him a \ntest and he passed it, and he attended law school under the GI bill.\n  He went to school year-round, summers too, and graduated ahead of his \nclass in 1948. He also, over time, earned a Ph.D. from Ohio State \nUniversity.\n  On his first day in law school, John Rogers met his future wife Jewel \nStradford, who would go on to become the first African American woman \nto graduate from the University of Chicago law school. She later served \nin the administrations of two Presidents of the United States. John and \nJewel Rogers have one son, John, Jr. Although they divorced after 15 \nyears of marriage, they remained close friends until her death many \nyears later, and they both were actively engaged in raising an \nextraordinary son who is my friend today.\n  Judge Rogers practiced law in Chicago for almost 30 years. He gained \na reputation as an outstanding attorney who was committed to justice \nand to his clients--and to mentoring younger and talented African-\nAmerican lawyers.\n  In 1968, on a blind date, he met a fellow University of Chicago \ngraduate, an educator who was active with the NAACP fund. John Rogers \nand Gwen DuBose dated for 33 years before marrying in 2001. They were a \ngood match, and they were devoted to one another.\n  In May 1977, John Rogers was appointed an associate judge in Cook \nCounty, and several months later he was assigned to the juvenile \ndivision. Some judges don't like the juvenile court and look for a \ntransfer. The cases can be heartbreaking and the proceedings occur out \nof the public view,\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\nso juvenile court judges don't receive the publicity some of their \ncolleagues receive.\n  John Rogers loved juvenile court. He spent 21 years as a judge there \nand eventually became the supervising judge. To the often-complicated \ncases involving minors, Judge Rogers strove to bring wisdom, \ncompassion, and justice.\n  Gwen Rogers has a stack of letters from men and women who appeared \nbefore Judge Rogers as youths and later wrote him letters thanking him \nfor giving them a second chance. There was one letter in particular \nthat he kept close and read several times. It was from a man who \nappeared before Judge Rogers on three different occasions. On his third \ncourt appearance, Judge Rogers said: ``I could send you to juvenile \ndetention and you would deserve it. But I still see a glimmer of hope \nin you, so I am sending you to Boystown.'' He made it clear to the \nyoung man that this was his last chance.\n  Years later that boy--now a grown man--wrote to him and said he \nfinished at Boys Town, went on to graduate from college, became a \nminister, and founded a church in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nIndiana.\n  Judge Rogers was the sort of man who became a father to many young \nmen who needed someone to look up to. The young man he really poured \nhis hopes and dreams into was his own son John Rogers, Jr. When John \nJr. was 12 years old, his parents invested in some stock for him. Every \nbirthday and Christmas after that, instead of toys John Jr. received \nstock certificates. At the age of 16, he got his first summer job--that \nwas a family rule. Judge Rogers saved every dime he could in order to \nsend his son to the best school. Eventually John Rogers, Jr. graduated \nfrom Princeton University. He would go on to found Ariel Capital \nManagement, now called Ariel Investments, the first African-American-\nowned asset management company in America.\n  In 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen were honored right here in the U.S. \nCapitol with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor our \nNation can bestow. The Tuskegee Airmen are the largest group ever to \nreceive the medal. About 300 of the airmen crowded into the Capitol \nRotunda on that cold March day to receive their medals. What an \nincredible sight. Many wore red jackets, a symbol of their Red-Tailed \nAngels reputation.\n  Afterwards, I was honored to host a reception in my Capitol office \nfor the 11 Tuskegee Airmen from my home State of Illinois. One of them \nwas John Rogers. Also joining us for that little reception was my \ncolleague at the time, Senator Barack Obama. What a moment that was to \nsee the arc of history and justice.\n  Five years later, President Barack Obama invited Judge Rogers and 14 \nother surviving Tuskegee Airmen to the White House for a screening of \n``Red Tails,'' a George Lucas film about the historic flyers. Talk \nabout the arc of history--the first African-American President inviting \nthe first African-American aviators to the White House.\n  Judge Rogers, this man whose courage helped to break the color \nbarrier in America's military, first knew Barack Obama as a promising \nyoung community organizer who was dating Michelle Robinson. The Rogers \nand Robinson families go back a long, long way. When John Rogers, Jr. \nwas captain of Princeton's basketball team, he recruited Craig \nRobinson, Michelle's brother, to play for Princeton. Craig Robinson \nwould later help persuade his younger sister to attend Princeton. There \nthey were all those years later, Judge Rogers, President and Mrs. \nObama, together in the White House watching a Hollywood film about the \nTuskegee Airmen.\n  Judge Rogers' granddaughter Victoria said her grandfather actually \nwatched the film three different times. Every time he moved his hands \nas though he were flying. She said, ``He said he could remember the \ntension.''\n  A while back Judge Rogers told a reporter: ``I hope there are planes \nin heaven so I can fly, because you know how much I love to fly.''\n  Well, Judge, I hope there are planes there too for your sake, and I \nhope you are sitting in first class or in the cockpit where you belong. \nYou earned it.\n  In closing, Loretta and I and our family extend our sincere \ncondolences again to Judge Rogers, his beloved wife Gwen, his son John, \nJr., his granddaughter Victoria, to the rest of the Rogers family, to \nJudge Rogers' many friends, and all of those whose lives he touched and \nenriched.\n  That gathering in that Rockefeller Chapel was such an outstanding \nturnout of people in Chicago who wanted to pay tribute to the great man \nJohn Rogers, Sr. He will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S481-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Sister City \nprograms in Ohio. The Sister Cities International program was created \nby President Eisenhower in 1956 with the intent of fostering peace and \nprosperity through cultural exchanges that promote appreciation through \nmutual experience and understanding.\n  Through the years, relationships have been formed and strengthened \nthrough ``citizen diplomacy'' and person-to-person exchanges between \nU.S. and international cities. These educational, informational, and \ncultural exchanges have not only created important diplomatic, economic \nand trade relationships, but they have also formed lasting personal \nbonds between individuals and cities.\n  The Sister City programs have positively impacted many cities \nthroughout the United States, but today I would like to specifically \nrecognize the 2014 U.S.-China Sister City Award recipients in my home \nState of Ohio. The State of Ohio was one of four recipients in the \ncountry for the Longest Relationship Award for its relationship that \nbegan in 1979 with the Hubei Province. Cincinnati was one of four \nprograms in our Nation to be recognized as a Best Overall U.S.-China \nSister City program in 2014. This strong relationship between \nCincinnati and its Chinese Sister City Liuzhou in the Guangxi Province \nhas existed since 1988. I was honored to be one of the original board \nmembers of this special Sister City relationship. In addition, the \nColumbus Sister City program was one of only three U.S.-China Sister \nCity programs in the country to win a Sustainable Development Award. \nThe relationship between Columbus and its Chinese Sister City, Hefei in \nthe Anhui Province also began in 1988.\n  The U.S.-China Sister City programs in Ohio have been successful in \nforming relationships that mutually benefit the partnering communities \nby building global cooperation at the municipal level, promoting \ncultural understanding, and encouraging economic development. Some of \nthe cultural exchanges made possible through these programs in Ohio \ninclude educational student and teacher exchanges, home stays, summer \nlanguage camp exchanges, art exchanges, and science and medical \nexchanges.\n  The participants in these programs have demonstrated a commitment to \nenrich their communities culturally and economically, and I am inspired \nby the achievements that have been made in Ohio. I would like to \ncongratulate the Ohio Sister City programs on being 2014 U.S.-China \nSister City award recipients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S481-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S481-S483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         VERMONT ESSAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord winning essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my \noffice.\n  The essays follow:\n\n       Alexina Federhen, Mount Anthony Union High School, Grade 11 \n     (Winner)\n\n                            A House Divided\n\n       2013 was a difficult year for America. Nature brought death \n     and disaster by fire, wind, and water; four prominent banks \n     used unethical methods to deprive Americans of their homes; \n     numerous individuals, businesses, and the city of Detroit hit \n     financial rock bottom; and shootings in our schools\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\n     every other week killed 19 and wounded 24 students and staff. \n     A spy revealed that our government is spying on our private \n     conversations; universal healthcare became a universal \n     headache when the application process required major surgery; \n     and an exciting finish exploded into terror at the Boston \n     Marathon. But Americans are resilient and resolute. Oklahoma \n     is rebuilding and Detroit is reorganizing. Many Americans \n     have healthcare for the first time and dozens of Boston's \n     runners finished their race in the Shires of Vermont \n     Marathon. Americans weathered the tragedies of 2013 with the \n     same determination, innovation, and cooperation that has \n     enabled us to overcome depressions, recessions, wars, and \n     disasters in the past; we pull up our boot straps, plant our \n     feet firmly in the direction of progress, and extend a \n     helping hand to those in need.\n       Tragically, there was one disaster that the American people \n     could not overcome in 2013--a Congress so dysfunctional that \n     it could not even manage to operate the government for the \n     entire year. And our expectations were not high to begin \n     with. A Gallup poll conducted in January 2013 found that \n     Americans rank Congress lower in popularity than root canals \n     and cockroaches and rate Congressmen lower in ethics and \n     honesty than used car salesmen. Instead of employing \n     collaboration and compromise, our leaders indulged in \n     backstabbing and finger pointing. Rather than seeking common \n     ground to find solutions to the problems facing our country, \n     our elected representatives nitpicked and cherry picked and \n     attacked each other's intentions and integrity to boost their \n     personal prospects for fundraising and reelection. The \n     spectacle of Tea Party Republicans posturing for the press \n     while the government crashed and burned lacked only a violin \n     accompaniment to rival Nero's folly.\n       The 113th Congress was the least productive legislature in \n     our history, passing only fifty-five bills into law. Public \n     approval of Congress sank from a ``high'' of 18% on January \n     1, 2013 to a current low of 8%. In fact, ``69% think no \n     matter how bad things are, Congress can always find a way to \n     make them worse.'' (Rasmussen Reports) We deserve better from \n     our political leaders. We need Congressmen and Senators who \n     will set aside personal gain and divisive ideology in order \n     to build compromise and find consensus on the issues that \n     challenge us: economic opportunity, income parity, gun \n     control, immigration, stagnant academic achievement, climate \n     change, and long-term deficit reduction.\n       Abraham Lincoln once observed that ``a house divided cannot \n     stand.'' Our House and Senate have splintered into partisan \n     factions of squabbling inactivity. Americans will continue to \n     soldier on, overcoming whatever obstacles impede our \n     advancement. We can only hope that our Congressional leaders \n     will acquire the maturity and wisdom to help rather than \n     hinder our progress. But for now, we are a union without \n     unity.\n                                  ____\n\n       Katharine Mayo, Twinfield Union School, Grade 11 (Second \n     Place)\n       In our changing world today we face many challenges, not \n     just in our country and individual regions, but throughout \n     the globe. One of the main problems that could alter our \n     world forever is climate change. Throughout the past century \n     we have spewed hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon \n     dioxide into the atmosphere, which top scientists now \n     unanimously agree is warming our world and causing extreme \n     weather to become frighteningly common. Our planet has warmed \n     1.4 deg. in the past one hundred years, and is projected to \n     keep warming if we do not act soon. This warming is causing \n     changing weather patterns that are drastically affecting our \n     world. Flooding, fires, and tornadoes throughout the country \n     and storms such as Tropical Storm Irene right here in Vermont \n     show how the effects of climate change are hurting people \n     everywhere. Even the small changes in my home town in Vermont \n     are starting to add up, we have less snow, more green \n     Christmases, and extreme summer storms. Floods are also \n     becoming increasingly common. However, neither Vermont nor \n     America are the only places that are being heavily affected \n     by climate change. It is a global problem, and we have to \n     think globally and work together in order to mend what we \n     have done to our planet. Our world is beautiful and fragile, \n     and we must put our energy to solving the problem of climate \n     change before it is too late.\n       America has always been known as a place where individuals \n     are both innovative and creative in order to solve problems. \n     I believe that we can each take steps as individuals and as a \n     country to reduce the carbon we released into the atmosphere. \n     These steps include driving less, and carpooling more, \n     replacing light bulbs for more energy efficient ones, being \n     more conscious of where our food comes from, and recycling \n     and composting as much as possible. We have seen over the \n     past one hundred years that each of us have the power with \n     our small, everyday choices do destroy earth's environment \n     and natural balance. I believe that if we have been able to \n     do that, then we each have the power with our small, everyday \n     choices to change the earth's environment for the better. We \n     must all make small changes in order to live a more \n     sustainable lifestyle and lead the world in the right \n     direction by being a country with a minimal carbon footprint.\n       We cannot put this issue off any longer. Now is the time to \n     act, now is the time to put our differences aside and work \n     together in the government and around the world to change the \n     world for the better and protect our world for future \n     generations. We must not be selfish about this problem by \n     brushing it under the rug because it is easier that way, or \n     in order to maintain our way of life. We must act now to make \n     changes in the way we live in order to preserve this \n     beautiful world for our future children and for generations \n     to come.\n                                  ____\n\n       Robert ``Will'' Aldrich, Mount Abraham Union Middle/High \n     School, Grade 9 (Third Place)\n       In the world there are many issues that we need to address. \n     There is poverty and debt, the circling case in which \n     innocent people can't feed themselves or their families \n     because they can't afford to, which in turn causes famine. \n     Another problem is pollution, which destroys our environment \n     by making it dirty and useless for future generations. \n     Another problem is communication, a thing that most countries \n     do not know how to do. All of these problems, every single \n     one, could be solved by promoting sustainable development. \n     Promoting sustainable development will help to make great \n     leaps forward in solving world issues.\n       One way that promoting sustainable development will help to \n     solve world problems is that it will help developing \n     countries. Aiding the developing countries will prove \n     extremely useful later on when we need help. This will give \n     us the image that we are helpful and are there when other \n     countries need us. Although this will cost a lot of money, it \n     will become a large help later on if and when we're in \n     trouble. Promoting sustainable development in developing \n     countries will also increase peace throughout the world. If \n     all the countries are helping each other out, meaning that we \n     are sharing our information and products, then there will be \n     little to no conflicts, and we can all be happy and get \n     along. Not to mention that helping out other countries will \n     heavily decrease poverty and famine, which will prevent the \n     need for future U.S. aid and thus save us money, since that \n     is what some people are more interested in. Clearly, \n     promoting sustainable development will help to increase peace \n     and equality and decrease poverty and famine.\n       Promoting sustainable development will definitely help to \n     improve our image as a country. We will be looked at as a \n     great role model and a powerful force with good intentions. \n     The U.S. could be viewed as a gentle giant of sorts. This \n     will improve our favor when it comes to disputes and it will \n     also increase our ally count. Although that should not \n     matter, we should be doing these things out of the goodness \n     of our hearts, not expecting reward. We should not need to \n     receive a reward for us to support the dying, the sick, and \n     the poor. In conclusion, promoting sustainable development \n     will improve our image so that we are looked at in a better \n     light.\n       Promoting sustainable development will greatly reduce \n     conflict over rare resources. One example of conflict over \n     scarce resources is the U.S. and Iran over oil. Another is \n     against the residents and loggers in South America over the \n     Amazon Rainforest. This could all be avoided if we all shared \n     our resources and promoted the use of sustainable \n     development. Sustainable development would mean that we do \n     not need to constantly deplete the Earth's resources. \n     Sustainable development would mean that we come up with ways \n     to fuel our economies with sources that will never run out! \n     If the countries do work together to achieve that goal, then \n     we will no longer have to fight over the sources that we need \n     because we'll never run out of them.\n       Promoting sustainable development will help the world make \n     great leaps forward in solving world issues. It will do this \n     by helping developing countries develop in economically and \n     environmentally sound ways, improving the image of the U.S., \n     and reducing disputes and fighting over rare resources. The \n     solving of these problems will help bring about an era of \n     peace all over the world. Sustainable development will save \n     Mother Earth from mutilation and destruction. The world will \n     be a better place if everyone gets along and we all are \n     working toward the same thing: the protection of our planet. \n     Promoting sustainable development will make for a better \n     world for all the generations to come.\n                                  ____\n\n       Brian Townley, Woodstock Union High School, Grade 10 (Third \n     Place)\n       Dear Senator Sanders, The American Economy is currently in \n     recovery from the worst recession to hit this nation since \n     the great depression. This recession has left the American \n     economy in disarray, specifically the American middle class. \n     Stuck on median wages, the American middle class has been hit \n     the hardest by the collapse of the infrastructure of the \n     American economy.\n       In order to repair this monumental failure of our nation to \n     recognize the middle class as valuable, we must begin to \n     support Main Street America; local businesses. As a nation we \n     tend to ignore the services, and products of local businesses \n     in favor of the cheaper alternatives offered by billion \n     dollar conglomerates. If we, as a nation, can ever hope to \n     change, we must be willing to sacrifice. This phenomenon is \n     responsible for the gradual disappearance of Main Street \n     America, and the lack of attention given to the American \n     Middle Class.\n       With the ominous threats of climate change advancing, we \n     are offered a second chance to strengthen the middle class. \n     We\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\n     must create sustainable energy sources, to put an end to \n     global warming. To build our industrial foundation upon a new \n     type of energy will create a surplus of jobs. These jobs must \n     offer respectable wages, health care benefits, and \n     opportunities for growth. If this is done effectively, we may \n     be able to get the American middle class back on track, and \n     simultaneously end the impending threat of global warming.\n       In order to allow our economy to recover from the \n     recession, we must recognize the youth of America as our \n     future. In doing so, we must stress upon implementing a \n     better educational system to better engage the students, \n     create more affordable collegiate education for the middle \n     class. The middle class faces many challenges, yet are a \n     cornerstone of the American economy. However, when attempting \n     to send their children to college, the middle class faces yet \n     another challenge. The wealthy are able to pay the college \n     tuition, and the poor are given generous financial aid \n     grants. However, the middle class is expected to pay thirty \n     to fifty thousand dollars a year to send their kids to \n     college, money which they don't have. This is unacceptable, \n     and takes away a great deal of incentive for these kids to \n     even attend college. Those who do attend college leave with a \n     degree, but are then faced with enormous amounts of student \n     loans. Lastly, we must involve the youth in the workforce of \n     America. Not only will this strengthen our workforce, but it \n     will also provide the American youth with savings for \n     college, and teach them the value of work.\n       As I previously stated, in order to change, we must be \n     willing to sacrifice. We must be willing to sacrifice the \n     allure of bargain brands to support a local brand. We must \n     sacrifice our tendency towards gasoline to find more \n     sustainable sources of energy. If we are truly willing to \n     sacrifice, we will change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S483-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Catholic \nschools across our Nation that provide our children with an outstanding \neducation while preparing them to lead lives in the example of Jesus \nChrist. This year, we mark the 40th year of celebrating Catholic \nSchools Week, shedding light on the extraordinary contributions these \nschools and their students make to communities across the country.\n  This year's theme, ``Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, \nKnowledge, and Service,'' provides a solid representation of the \nmission of these schools in educating the whole person and forming our \nchildren into responsible stewards ready to take on the challenges of \nthe future. Today, more than 2 million children are educated in \nCatholic schools in the United States. Ninety-nine percent of them \ngraduate from high school, and 85 percent pursue postsecondary \neducation. Such a rate of success is a great testament to the quality \nof our Catholic schools and their educators.\n  As an alumnus of a Catholic school in New Orleans, I have firsthand \nexperience of the benefits of receiving a Catholic education. These \nschools are devoted to nurturing the young minds that pass though their \nhalls each year, instilling in them the values necessary to become \nactive and caring members of their communities, cities, and Nation.\n  In a recent statement, Bishop George Lucas, chairman of the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Education, stated:\n\n       Our schools have educated millions of young people over the \n     years by providing them a superior academic background, \n     always pointing the way to eternal life. The success of \n     Catholic schools in handing on the faith, generation after \n     generation, is a bright light in the history of the Church in \n     the United States.\n\n  During the week of January 26 to February 1, let us recognize the \nsteadfast commitment of the administrators, teachers, students, and \nfamilies, who support Catholic schools across the United States, and \nappreciate their efforts to educate the youth of our Nation. In that \nrespect, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass my bipartisan \nresolution celebrating Catholic Schools Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S483-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTRE DAME SEMINARY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, since 1923, the Archdiocese of New \nOrleans has offered a deeper understanding of Catholic theology and \ndiscipleship through Notre Dame Seminary. In its 90 years, Notre Dame \nSeminary has prepared men for ministerial priesthood in the Roman \nCatholic Church, promoting a spirit of humility, service, and \nsacrifice. In addition, the seminary offers graduate theological \neducation programs to deepen the faith of both religious and laity.\n  Leaving the seminary, these young men are prepared to become servant \nleaders in their parish communities around the world and to profess the \nlife and good works of Christ in their daily lives. Blessed John Paul \nII said, ``The formation of future priests . . . is considered by the \nChurch one of the most demanding and important tasks for the future of \nevangelization of humanity.''\n  These 90 years are a testament to Notre Dame Seminary's steadfast \ncommitment to this demanding and important task. Their stewardship of \nGod's grace has blessed our communities, protected the vulnerable, \ncomforted the sick, and offered hope to the broken. Men who have \ngraduated from Notre Dame Seminary have served our communities in over \n20 dioceses throughout the United States.\n  I am grateful for Notre Dame Seminary's leadership in our community \nand throughout the United States and celebrate their 90 years of \npreparing servant leaders for our church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S483-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PORTOPERA\n\n Mr. KING.

Over the years it has brought some of the \nworld's greatest stars and most highly acclaimed productions to Maine \naudiences and played an invaluable role in enriching our communities.\n  PORTopera's dedication to excellence has been recognized around the \ncountry earning praise in Opera News for its 2012 production of \n``Madama Butterfly'' and the Boston Globe for ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' in \n2001. Furthermore, PORTopera's educational outreach initiatives such as \nthe young artists programs and the opera-in-school program with the \nUniversity of Maine have provided future generations of singers a place \nto hone their skills and learn from some of opera's greatest figures.\n  As Maine's artistic community continues to grow, I am pleased to \nrecognize PORTopera for its leadership and tremendous accomplishments. \nCongratulations and thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S483-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on January 17, 2014, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \npursuant to 10 U.S.C. 6968(a), and the order of the House of January 3, \n2013, the Speaker appointed the following Member on the part of the \nHouse of Representatives to the Board of Visitors to the United States \nNaval Academy: Mr. Mike Rogers of Michigan.\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris) \nhad signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3547.

A bill to establish the Pullman National Historical Park in \nthe State of Illinois as a unit of the National Park System, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to introduce the Pullman National Historical \nPark Act. This legislation continues our commitment to preserve the \nunique stories and places that have a special place in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The Pullman neighborhood has been the site of some major events in \nU.S. history. The area was first developed in 1880 by George Pullman as \nthe first American industrial town--a mixed-income community where the \nfamilies of company executives and factory workers could work and live \ntogether.\n  During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman site served \nas the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the United \nStates, which helped lead to the establishment of Labor Day as a \nnational holiday.\n  The Pullman community then went on to play an important role in \nAfrican-American and early Civil Rights history through the legacy of \nthe Pullman porters, as well as the development of the Brotherhood of \nSleeping Car Porters--the first Black labor union.\n  So it is fitting that the area has been recognized as a historical \nlandmark by the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, and nationally. \nBut more can be done to showcase Pullman's unique place in America's \nhistory.\n  A study released last year by the National Park Service stated that \nthe Pullman Historical District had undisputed national significance \nand would make an excellent candidate for addition to the national park \nsystem. I agree. I am joined by my colleagues Senator Mark Kirk and \nCongresswoman Robin Kelly today to introduce a bill to designate the \nPullman\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\ndistrict as a national park. If created, the Pullman National \nHistorical Park would be an important addition to the current national \nparks system because it would poignantly highlight stories from \ncommunities that are rarely represented in other national parks.\n  The park's urban location on Chicago's South Side would make it \neasily accessible to millions of people by public transportation--\nagain, setting Pullman apart from other national parks. The Pullman \nNational Historical Park would also provide an opportunity for tourism \nand facilitate job creation in the Southeast side of Chicago. More than \n3,000 Chicagoans and 110 organizations and businesses--including the \nAFL-CIO and Chicago Federation of Labor--have signed statements of \nsupport calling for its creation.\n  Studies show that for every dollar that is invested in national park \noperations, $10 of economic activity is generated locally. Just last \nyear, national park visitors contributed more than $30 billion to local \neconomies and support more than a quarter million jobs. The benefits \nare clear.\n  Creating the Pullman National Historical Park will allow the National \nPark Service to better represent America's cultural and ethnic \ndiversity while providing a boost to the local economy and conservation \nopportunities for the area. I urge my colleagues to support Pullman \nNational Historical Park Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follow:\n\n                                S. 1962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pullman National Historical \n     Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior designated the \n     Pullman Historic District as a National Historic Landmark \n     District in 1970 because of--\n       (A) the significance of the District to the labor history, \n     social history, architecture, and urban planning of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the pivotal role of events in the District in creating \n     the first national Labor Day holiday in the world;\n       (2) between 1880 and 1884 George M. Pullman, owner of the \n     Pullman Palace Car Company, built the Pullman community, \n     which was envisioned by Pullman as an industrial town that \n     would provide employees with--\n       (A) a model community; and\n       (B) suitable living conditions;\n       (3) the town developed by George M. Pullman, which \n     consisted of over 1,000 buildings and homes, was awarded \n     ``The World's Most Perfect Town'' at the International \n     Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Exposition in 1896;\n       (4) the Pullman factory site is a true symbol of the \n     historic struggle in the United States to achieve fair labor \n     practices for the working class, with the original factory \n     serving as the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in \n     the United States;\n       (5) in the midst of economic depression in 1894, to protest \n     unsafe conditions and reductions in pay, Pullman factory \n     workers initiated a strike that--\n       (A) when taken up as a cause by the American Railway Union, \n     crippled the entire rail industry;\n       (B) continued even in the face of a Federal injunction and \n     a showdown between laborers and Federal troops that turned \n     violent and deadly; and\n       (C) set a national example for the ability of working \n     people in the United States to change the existing system in \n     favor of more just practices for protecting workers rights \n     and safety;\n       (6) following the deaths of a number of workers at the \n     hands of the United States military and United States \n     Marshals during the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted \n     to approve rush legislation that created a national Labor Day \n     holiday, which was signed into law by President Grover \n     Cleveland 6 days after the end of the strike;\n       (7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also played an important \n     role in African-American and early civil rights history \n     through the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of whom were \n     ex-slaves were employed in a heavily discriminatory \n     environment immediately following the Civil War;\n       (8) the Pullman porters, who served diligently between the \n     1870s and the 1960s, have been commended for--\n       (A) the level of service and attention to detail of the \n     Pullman porters; and\n       (B) the contributions of the Pullman porters to the \n     development of the African-American middle class;\n       (9) the information, ideas, and commerce the Pullman \n     porters carried across the country while traveling on trains \n     helped to bring education and wealth to African-American \n     communities throughout the United States;\n       (10) the positive role of the Pullman porters in the \n     historical image of the first-class service that was made \n     available on Pullman cars is unmistakable;\n       (11) the Pullman community was the seminal home to the \n     Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which--\n       (A) was the first African-American labor union with a \n     collective bargaining agreement;\n       (B) was founded by civil rights pioneer A. Philip Randolph \n     in 1925;\n       (C) fought against discrimination and in support of just \n     labor practices; and\n       (D) helped lay the groundwork for what became the great \n     Civil Rights Movement of the 20th Century;\n       (12) the Pullman community is--\n       (A) a paramount illustration of the work of architect Solon \n     Spencer Beman;\n       (B) a well-preserved example of 19th Century community \n     planning, architecture, and landscape design; and\n       (C) comprised of a number of historic structures, including \n     the Administration Clocktower Building, Hotel Florence, \n     Greenstone Church, Market Square, and hundreds of units of \n     rowhouses built for Pullman workers;\n       (13) the preservation of the Pullman site has been \n     threatened by--\n       (A) plans for demolition in 1960; and\n       (B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the iconic clocktower and \n     the rear erecting shops;\n       (14) the diligent efforts of community organizations, \n     foundations, nonprofits, residents, the State, and units of \n     local government in the restoration and preservation of the \n     District after the 1998 fire were vital to the protection of \n     the Pullman site;\n       (15) due to the historic and architectural significance of \n     the District, the District is designated as--\n       (A) a registered National Historic Landmark District;\n       (B) an Illinois State Landmark; and\n       (C) a City of Chicago Landmark District; and\n       (16) the preservation, enhancement, economic, and tourism \n     potential and management of the important historic and \n     architectural resources of the Park requires cooperation and \n     partnerships from among local property owners, the Federal \n     Government, the State, units of local government, the private \n     and nonprofit sectors, and the more than 100 civic \n     organizations who have expressed support for community \n     preservation through the establishment of the Pullman \n     National Historical Park.\n\n     SEC. 3.

It is based on mutual sacrifice, mutual respect, \n     shared interests, and shared responsibility to promote peace \n     and security in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, including \n     uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technologies, \n     undermine security on the Korean Peninsula. The United States \n     and the Republic of Korea have a shared interest in \n     preventing further proliferation, including through the \n     implementation of the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party \n     Talks.\n       (3) Both the United States and Republic of Korea have a \n     shared objective in strengthening the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at London, Moscow, and \n     Washington July 1, 1968, and a political and a commercial \n     interest in working collaboratively to address challenges to \n     their respective peaceful civil nuclear programs.\n       (4) The nuclear energy agreement referred to in section 3 \n     is scheduled to expire on March 19, 2014. In order to \n     maintain healthy and uninterrupted cooperation in this area \n     between the two countries while a new agreement is being \n     negotiated, Congress should authorize the President to extend \n     the duration of the current agreement until March 19, 2016.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SKVARLA AS CURATOR EMERITUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. Res. 338 \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 338) designating Diane K. Skvarla as \n     Curator Emeritus of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today we honor the hard work and \naccomplishments of Ms. Diane Skvarla, who is retiring after 20 years of \nservice as the Senate curator.\n  In the 27 years that I have served Nevadans in the Senate, I have \nnever lost my appreciation for the rich history, works of fine art, and \ncraftsmanship along the halls of the Senate. The Capitol and Senate \noffice buildings are treasures and symbols of our democracy.\n  An enduring institution, the Senate is passed down from generation to \ngeneration as Senators and visitors come and go. Just as we have a \nresponsibility to preserve the traditions and history of the Senate, we \nalso have a responsibility to preserve the buildings and furnishings. \nFormer majority leader Mike Mansfield understood the need to conserve \nthese adornments of American democracy and advocated for the creation \nof the U.S. Senate Commission on Art and the Office of Senate Curator \nto fulfill this objective. Curators usually oversee museums and private \ncollections. The Senate, on the other hand, is a working building. \nMaintaining a balance between conservation and the considerations of \nworking life for Members and staff is a unique task. In her role as \nSenate curator, Diane has worked fiercely to successfully strike this \nbalance every day.\n  Diane began working for the curator's office in 1979 as a staff \nmember following graduation from Colgate University. After she earned \nher master's degree in museum studies from George Washington University \nin 1987, Diane took on more responsibility, including work on the \nSenate's bicentennial celebration in 1989. After a short break from the \noffice, Diane was asked to return in 1994 as the curator to follow Jim \nKetchum.\n  Throughout her tenure as curator, Diane has remained a steadfast \nadvocate for the preservation of the Senate. Diane worked to publish \nthe Catalogue of Fine Art and Catalogue of Graphic Art, both \ncomprehensively documenting the decorative treasures of the Senate. \nDiane also worked to acquire the large portrait of Henry Clay that was \npreviously unknown and now hangs in the Brumidi Corridor just off of \nthe Senate floor. In addition, Diane spearheaded restoration efforts of \nthe Old Senate Chamber in 2011-2012 and ongoing restoration and \nresearch in the Brumidi Corridor. She has been instrumental in the \nforthcoming publication of a book detailing the discoveries of the \nBrumidi Corridor in the Senate.\n  Among her many achievements are projects close to my heart. Diane \nworked hard to discover, catalogue, and restore articles of historic \nfurniture such as the Russell barrel-back chairs and rosewood writing \ndesk now used in my office. She also managed the restoration of a \nportrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart that hangs in the \nentrance to my office.\n  Managing the working considerations of the Senate can be a challenge, \nespecially following recent emergencies such as September 11 and the \nanthrax attacks in 2001. Following the terrorist attacks on New York \nCity and the Pentagon new emergency measures and plans were implemented \nthroughout the Federal Government. Diane has been instrumental in \ndeveloping emergency disaster plans for the Senate's artistic and \ncultural artifacts. Creating and rehearsing evacuation plans for staff, \nproducing protocols for handling artwork, and coordinating with first-\nresponder agencies to ensure safe access and communication following \ndisasters and emergencies, Diane leaves the Senate more prepared than \never.\n  I join my colleagues in thanking Diane for her hard work and extend \ncongratulations on her well-earned retirement. I wish her the best in \nall of her future endeavors.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 338) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/27/senate-section/article/S492-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1963\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
