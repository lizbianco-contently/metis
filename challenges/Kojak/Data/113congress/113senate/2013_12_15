Mr. President, we are here today dealing with a non-\nessential distraction from the issues our country should be dealing \nwith. None of these nominees need to be confirmed right now. Rather, we \nshould be dealing with the problems we see each day. I talked about two \nof the biggest problems we face last Wednesday: Obamacare and our debt \nand deficit. I want to expand on those matters and discuss some of the \nother things we should be addressing.\n  We are here today dealing with a non-essential distraction from the \nmounting Obamacare problems. None of these nominees need to be \nconfirmed right now. Rather, we should be dealing with the problems we \nsee each day of how the health care law will fail to live up to the \npromises made by the administration. We must repeal this law, because \nas these reports demonstrate, it is bad for consumers and bad for small \nbusinesses. The outcry of millions of people who lost health care plans \nthey were told they could keep forced President Obama to admit that he \nbroke his promise. He then announced a new initiative that he said \nwould really allow people to keep their existing health insurance plans \nthis time--for a short time.\n  This isn't true either because for one thing he doesn't have the \npower under the Constitution to rewrite or ignore laws passed by \nCongress. It would also mean he would have to be willing to ignore a \n2010 administration regulation that has prevented insurers from \ncontinuing to offer insurance for millions of individuals and small \nbusinesses. That's right, at the same time the President was promising \nout of one side of his mouth that people could keep their health \ninsurance, the other side was approving rules that would make that \nimpossible.\n  And everyone who was in the Senate at the time knew it. It was right \nthere in the Federal Register and written by the President's own \nadministration. Congress knew and the administration knew the President \nwas not telling the truth, but kept making the promise anyway.\n  When one party has 60 votes in the Senate, the minority party is very \nlimited in what it can do. There are few exceptions to the majority \nleader's control. He decides what the Senate can debate and vote on. \nThrough parliamentary manipulation he can also block amendments.\n  One sure way to inject something not approved by the majority leader \nis to find an offensive regulation and petition the Senate for a debate \nand a simple majority vote. I did that in 2010. One catch is that has \nto be acted upon within 60 days of the regulation's publication in the \nFederal Register. Miss that date and it can't be brought up again. Lose \nthe vote and the opportunity is also gone. That's an opportunity \nDemocrats in the Senate squandered. Every single one voted to defeat my \nresolution and many ridiculed the effort. Over the next few months \ntheir constituents are going to make them answer for this.\n  I have fought against the new health care law for the past 4 years \nbecause I knew that there was no way the President could keep all of \nthe promises he was making about how the law would affect average \nAmericans. As an accountant and former small business owner, I \nunderstood that you cannot mandate that everyone must purchase gold-\nplated health insurance plans without increasing costs and causing \nmillions of people to lose their existing insurance plans.\n  But wait. There is more. If you can't keep the health plans that you \nlike, then you are going to have a tougher time keeping the doctors and \nhospitals you like. Get ready for the next wave of disappointment and \nfrustration when expectations created by this President and his PR \nmachine come crashing up against the harsh reality of the real world. \nObamacare casualties will continue to grow even as this President \nlaunches media blitz after media blitz in attempt to convince people \nthat higher premiums, worse coverage and a bigger debt for this country \nis a good thing.\n  During the health care debate, the President and his Congressional \nallies also promised that the new health care\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nlaw would reduce health insurance premiums for American families. I and \nmy colleagues argued that rather than saving money, the new law would \ninstead drive up the costs of insurance for millions of families.\n  Disastrous planning and implementation of the healthcare.gov website \nhave made it difficult for Americans to learn just how much this \npartisan law has driven up costs. People are starting to learn how much \ntheir premiums are increasing, and the more they do the more people \nwill not appreciate how the President's promise failed to reflect the \nreality of the new health care law.\n  The President and his allies also promised that the new law would \nimprove the economy and protect Medicare beneficiaries. We now know \nthat small businesses across the country are not hiring new workers \nbecause of the impact the health care law will have on their bottom \nlines. In addition, millions of Medicare beneficiaries face reductions \nin their existing benefits as a result of the $500 billion that was \ntaken from Medicare to fund the new law.\n  It is not quite 2014 yet and most of the 2,700 pages of the new law \nhaven't gone into effect. But each day it seems there is a new breaking \nstory about what a debacle this health care law is turning out to be.\n  I received a letter from Jessica in Laramie who explains how this \nhealth care law is negatively affecting her. Jessica's ``catastrophic'' \nhealth care plan as a single adult, according to healthcare.gov, is \n$297 per month. This is with the premium support from the Federal \nGovernment. I repeat, this is with the subsidy. The University of \nWyoming health insurance rate for a semester is $452. That's over the \ncourse of 4 months. The university's rate is nothing new. It has been \navailable to students long before the Democrats forced their health \ncare disaster through Congress. Today, Jessica's premiums would cost \nmore than any of her medical bills to date. Jessica recently fractured \nher foot, a very common injury, and this cost her less than $300 in \nmedical bills. Jessica's mother also works for the State government, \nand has a health care through the state. However, even though she is \nunder the age of 26, Jessica is not allowed to join her mother's \ninsurance plan. This is yet another example of a broken promise from \nthe Obama administration. The President's flawed health care bill is a \nraw deal for our students, and for our Nation. Jessica said, ``It feels \nlike the government is punishing everyone for the few people who have \nhealth bills worth more than a house. It isn't remotely fair.''\n  Karen from Cody contacted me because her construction company had to \ndrop their Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. Why is this? \nThe President's flawed health care plan mandates health care coverage \nfor full time employees that work more than 90 days for the company. \nThe company was already providing health care plans for their \nemployees, and now these folks can't keep their health care plan they \nliked. Their employees are mostly young Americans and are trying to \nmake their budgets work. They couldn't afford to sign up for health \ncare plans that would reduce their pay. As a result, all of her \nemployees will have to seek individual policies in 2014. Karen also \nsaid there is a lack of information on insurance plans. She doesn't \nknow what doctors and medical facilities will be included or even \navailable in any health insurance plan next year. Karen is upset. I am \nupset, too.\n  It is time for Congress to heed the calls of the majority of \nAmericans and repeal this partisan law, but that won't happen unless \nordinary Americans continue to speak out and demand those who brought \nthem Obamacare keep their promises--all of them.\n  I also want to talk about the recently announced Murray/Ryan budget \nlegislation. I had hoped we would have an open process to finally come \nup with a solution to our Nation's spending problems, but that didn't \nhappen. Instead, we have another backroom deal put together by two \nmembers that is bad for our country. It increases spending and shows \nthat one thing some Democrats and Republicans can agree on is putting \noff hard decisions.\n  This plan spends more than current law. It charges people and States \nmore for things and uses the money to increase spending in non-related \nareas. Spending cuts are scheduled for outlying years and the so-called \n``savings'' are used up right away. It isn't real.\n  This bill has a lot of problems. It again raises rates for premiums \nthat private companies pay the Federal Government to guarantee their \npension benefits. Raising premiums for all companies participating in \nPBGC is effectively a tax increase. Moreover, this money isn't going to \nshore up PBGC. The ``savings'' that these rate increases generate will \nbe spent on other Federal discretionary programs. And employers are \nstill in the process of implementing a $9 billion rate increase to pay \nfor highways per last year's transit bill. To put it simply, over 2 \nyears the flat-rate premium will have increased 40 percent and over 3 \nyears, the variable-rate premium will have increased over 100 percent. \nThis is a huge tax that will cause companies to end their voluntary \npension and retirement plans. These pensions are completely voluntary \nand if the cost to keep them goes up, companies may have to re-\nevaluate. Workers and their families will be forced to find other ways \nto save for retirement due to this increased ``tax'' on companies.\n  Under this budget deal, they are also again telling Wyoming, Montana, \nUtah, Colorado, New Mexico and other States that allow for the \nproduction of minerals on their lands that the Federal Government \ndeserves more than half of the revenues. Under Federal law, States are \nentitled to half of the royalties collected by the Federal Government \nfor energy production on their lands. To distribute the State share, \nthe law intends for the Minerals Management Service to divide the \namount of mineral royalties collected by two, write a check for that \namount, and mail it to the States. But an even split is not enough \nunder the new budget bill. In an attempt to satisfy an insatiable \nappetite for spending, the budget bill's plan is to take more money \naway from our States, about $40 million every year. This is money that \nour State governments use for roads, health care, education for our \nchildren, and more efficient and environmentally-friendly development \nof our energy resources. It is money that finds its way directly to the \npeople, not down some bureaucratic black hole. A disproportionate share \nof this funding--about $20 million--comes from my home State of \nWyoming, which supplies a disproportionate share of energy to our \ncountry. Yet the Federal Government still wants more. Unlike \nbureaucrats, we answer to our constituents. Mine are telling me they \ndon't want the Federal Government to take any more of our State's \nmoney. I am sure yours will tell you the same thing, either now or \nlater.\n  Worst of all, the so-called budget conference committee for all \npractical purposes did not exist. The agreement was the sole product of \none House member and one Senate member. I sat on the conference \ncommittee and I can tell you that I learned the particulars of the deal \nat the same time as the public. We were not part of the process or \nnegotiations. This is a symptom of the abandonment of the committee \nprocess. Instead of Representatives and Senators offering constructive \namendments and debating spending bills in public, a couple people and \ntheir staff sit in a room and then present a take-it-or-leave-it deal \nright before a holiday or manufactured crisis deadline.\n  This is not the way to operate. We have to start legislating and stop \ndeal-making. I had hoped we could make a small move in that direction \nwith this conference committee because I have several ideas for how to \nkeep us out of the situation we were just in--the government shutdown \nand whether and to what extent to raise the debt limit--and make \nreasonable, but real, progress on our deficits and debt. I have a penny \nplan, a proposal on biennial budgeting, some relevant amendments for \nspending bills, the End Government Shutdowns legislation, forced \nprioritization for spending cuts, and tax reform.\n  My penny plan cuts overall spending by 1 percent for 2 years and \nbalances the budget so that we don't have to raise the debt ceiling. We \nhave to stop spending more than we take in and find a way to start \npaying down the $17 trillion--and growing--debt. The penny plan doesn't \nmandate any specific cuts. Congress would have the authority to make \ntargeted cuts and focus on the\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nworst first, but would be required to meet the 1 percent overall cut. \nEverything would be on the table. And I would argue that we should \nfocus on identifying and eliminating all of the wasteful spending that \noccurs in Washington before we look to other important programs and \nservices. Let's not make the cuts hurt. Let's be smart about the \nspending cuts and prioritize how we spend taxpayers' dollars.\n  My biennial appropriations bill would allow for each of the \nappropriation bills to be taken up over a 2-year period, with the more \ncontroversial bills taken up in a non-election year and the less \ncontroversial bills taken up in an election year. The defense \nappropriations bill would be taken up each year. This would allow us to \nget into the spending details more and eliminate duplication and waste.\n  The End Government Shutdowns Act that I've cosponsored would help us \nmove away from the crisis governing and deal making that has become a \nmainstay when it comes to funding the Federal Government. It would \nautomatically continue funding for programs, but would use the \nmechanism from my penny plan to reduce spending across the board by one \npercent.\n  We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We shouldn't raise \ntaxes in order for Washington to spend more. We cannot spend our way to \nprosperity. Identifying a process forward for tax reform is where part \nof our efforts on the budget conference should be focused. If done \ncorrectly, tax reform will help to generate additional revenue through \neconomic growth to reduce the deficits and pay down the debt. I am \nready to make that happen.\n  We need to prioritize spending cuts--find the spending cuts that will \ndo the least harm and start there. It worked here in Wyoming, and it \ncan work in Washington. Raising taxes to offset more spending is not \nthe path forward. Reigning in out-of-control spending is.\n  I sit up nights worrying about our Nation's debt and how it will \naffect Wyoming children, my children and grandchildren. This was a \nchance to apply reasonable constraints to impossibly high future \nspending, but instead we got more spending and no plan to solve the \nproblem.\n  Congress should have been working on Federal spending bills and a \nresponsible budget for months. Instead, the Senate majority put off \nthis work. If the Senate majority would have allowed the 12 \nappropriations bills to move through the committee process to floor \ndebate in a timely manner, with input and amendments from Senators on \nboth sides, there would have been no need for a continuing resolution \nand no government shutdown. Deal making instead of legislating is not \nan appropriate way to run the country.\n  And even now we are not working on issues we should be working on. \nInstead, the Senate majority broke the rules the change the rules, and \nwe are here processing nominations instead of dealing with the problems \nof Obamacare and reining in our debt and spending problems.\n  One of the other things we should be working on is a Defense \nauthorization bill, but once again the Senate has been prohibited from \ndoing its job. The Senate majority leader blocked all but two \namendments to the National Defense Authorization Act from \nconsideration, and now we will be asked to vote on a package put \ntogether in a back room by a few Members. That is not right. If you \nwant to know what is wrong with the Senate and why people of all \npolitical persuasions are upset with Congress, that is a big part of \nthe answer right there.\n  This is a very important bill for our country and there are a lot if \nimportant issues that we need to discuss. We haven't considered issues \nrelating to our nuclear deterrent, privacy concerns relating to the \nNSA, how to address sexual assault in the military, or a number of \nother important issues. In the past, we have spent multiple weeks on \nthe defense bill and considered dozens of amendments. That's what we \nshould be doing this year too. Our national security needs to be fully \ndebated by the entire Senate.\n  One of those important issues that we are skipping over is our \nnuclear deterrent on which I offered several amendments. I have the \nhonor of representing the city of Cheyenne, WY which is the home of \nF.E. Warren Air Force Base and the 90th ICBM Missile Wing. These are \ntop notch men and women who work together to maintain the world's most \npowerful military force.\n  Unfortunately, there are those in this administration who take the \ncontributions of our military for granted. They don't have the sense of \nhistory that is needed to appreciate why these weapons were designed \nand put into operation in the first place. They don't see how much they \nare still needed to ensure our future. They don't fully appreciate the \nkey role they have played in the past. They seem to think that nuclear \nweapons are part of a bygone era--a relic of the past--that has not \nbeen needed since the Cold War ended.\n  The President is playing a dangerous game with our nation's national \nsecurity. In June he announced that the administration is reducing U.S. \nstrategic warheads to as few as 1,000. This is 550 below the \nrequirements under New START. This comes at a time that both Russia and \nChina are modernizing their nuclear arsenals at a frenetic pace. Even \nmore troubling, however, are the reports that the administration may \nseek to avoid Congress and undertake further nuclear reductions outside \nof the formal treaty process.\n  The administration's views on our nuclear deterrent should come as no \nsurprise to us or anyone who has watched the development of these ideas \nsince they were first offered for consideration. We've seen President \nObama promise to do all that he can to reduce our nuclear arsenal--step \nby step. First, he rammed the New START Treaty through the Senate by \npromising commitments that he ultimately did not keep. One of those was \nthe promise to modernize our nuclear force, which we're still waiting \non.\n  I have serious concerns about this policy position, because I believe \nmaintaining a strong nuclear force, which includes ICBMs, is a critical \npart of protecting our country, which is why I voted against New START. \nICBMs are not only cost-effective and reliable, they are a visual \nreminder that America stands ready to protect itself and its allies \nfrom any who would do us harm. By preserving our ICBM force, states \nlike Wyoming play an important role in keeping America strong and free.\n  Important issues like these are why we need to allow Senators to do \ntheir job--offer amendments, debate them, and take votes. This is the \nleast we can do for our national security and the men and women who lay \ntheir lives on the line every day to protect our freedoms.\n  We should also be addressing the fact that the coal industry is under \nregulatory attack in Washington. Since being sworn into office, \nPresident Obama's rule-making machine has released rule-after-rule \ndesigned to make it more expensive to use coal.\n  Instead of encouraging production, the administration always seems to \nbe busy trying to do everything it can to restrict production. When \ntheir policies cause a drop in supplies and prices go up they're \nmystified when they see that people are growing more and more concerned \nabout their energy bills.\n  Instead of running from coal, we should invest in its abundance, in \nits power and its potential. Instead of running from coal, America \nneeds to run on coal. Coal supplies nearly half the Nation with low \ncost, reliable energy. Because we generate 87 percent of our \nelectricity from coal, Wyoming's electricity rates are among the lowest \nin the Nation. The coal industry also provided--directly and \nindirectly--over 700,000 good paying jobs in 2010. It is no wonder it \nis so essential to the U.S. economy.\n  Fortunately, we have coal champions in the House and Senate who fully \nrealize that we have to work together to keep our coal industry active, \nvital and productive for the people they employ, the families in \nAmerica who rely on inexpensive energy and our Nation's economy.\n  I hope more of my Senate colleagues will join me in fighting back \nagainst President Obama's war on coal. Working together we can take a \nstand against this administration's goal of higher electricity costs.\n  We should be working to address improper payments and duplication. \nThese are a huge leak in our national finances. They are avoidable \nwastes of\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\ntaxpayer dollars. They are obstacles to better and more efficient \noperations. Ending waste and duplication like this not only helps get \nour fiscal house back in order, but can help restore some confidence in \nthe ability of the government to operate effectively.\n  The Government Accountability Office has reported that 31 areas of \nthe Federal Government are in need of reform to eliminate duplicative \nand unnecessary programs. Consolidating programs and agency functions \nthat overlap would save 95 billion; 2013 is the third year the GAO has \nbeen producing its report on duplication. Unfortunately, Congress and \nthe administration have only address a fifth of the recommendations \nthat have been made to fix overlap and duplication.\n  In fiscal year 2012, there were nearly $100 billion in improper \npayments. These are payments that shouldn't even be going out the door, \nto people who are no longer eligible for benefits or overpayments of \nbenefits or, in the worst cases, payments to people who are deceased. \nTo put the overpayments in perspective, the annual spending reductions \nrequired under sequestration are $85 billion. That's almost 15 billion \nless than the improper payments going out the door.\n  We should be working on the problems that have arisen as a result of \nDodd-Frank. In 2010, I voted against the Dodd-Frank act because I had \nserious concerns about the excessive regulations it created and the \nunintended consequences it would have for folks who had nothing to do \nwith the financial crisis.\n  The law requires a host of new regulations for banks and non-banking \nentities no matter what size they are. The big banks that have more \nfunds and man power to handle the new regulations are fine; it's the \nsmall banks in our communities that don't have the resources to keep up \nwith all the extra paperwork.\n  The 300 plus new regulations from the act--only about 40 percent of \nthe total expected--are already creating regulatory uncertainty as they \nare written and implemented. We are now seeing some of the consequences \nI spoke about in 2010. The problems are numerous and I am glad that \nsome of my colleagues are starting to listen and help look for \nsolutions.\n  One of my constituents, Wesley from Jackson, WY, wrote to me with a \ngreat example of some of the unintended consequences of this law and \nits effect on small business. Here's what he had to say: ``I am writing \nto you as member of the Wyoming small business community to report on \nthe implementation of an add-on to the Dodd-Frank act. Specifically \nsection 1502, conflict minerals. This legislation is imposing a very \nsevere burden especially on small businesses in the tech sector. I and \nothers struggling to conform to the new requirements have found that \nthey are usually impossible to meet in either the spirit or the letter \nof the law. I will explain. Section 1502 requires as I understand that \npublicly traded American companies must certify that their products do \nnot contain conflict minerals--minerals obtained in the DRC--a noble \ngoal indeed. The basic problem is that in practice, this certification \nis nearly impossible to meet. We are a small private company and are \nnot explicitly subject to the regulation. However we have received \nnumerous requests for these certifications from our (publicly traded) \nclients, which means that for them to meet the regulation, we must do \nso as well, and on down the line. Attempting to fulfill these \nrequirements in order to keep our business will occupy 100s of man \nhours this year that we don't have. This chain of requirements goes all \nthe way to the raw material suppliers, where the ore originates. This \nis perhaps hundreds of levels in the chain for us. For the vast \nmajority of materials we would want to purchase, our suppliers (of \nfinished parts) cannot provide the certification, which means that we \ncannot provide it to our clients, which means that they will not buy \nfrom us. It is not possible for any honest firm to actually meet the \nrequirements, because it is not possible to buy certified parts in many \ncases. For example we purchase resistors, which are purchased from \nlarge wholesalers and may come from many different vendors. Some of \nthese vendors are overseas, and will not provide the certification even \nthough the products are probably conflict-free. This means that the \nwholesaler must either lie to certify his product to us, or provide a \ncertification that says ``we don't know the status of our parts but are \nlooking into it''. We must then do the same to our clients, and on up \nthe chain. At no point in this process is it possible for an honest \ncitizen to actually know the conflict status of their materials. We \nhave received boilerplate ``we don't know'' certificates from nearly \nevery vendor we have asked for certification, and this is happening all \nacross the industry. No one can provide a real certificate: if anyone \nalong the supply chain is foreign-owned, the chain of certification \nusually ends there. Nearly everything we would want to use in our \nproducts has some components that are foreign, and not certifiable. I \nwould suggest that the burden of proof should be confined to companies \nthat purchase the raw materials from smelters. At this level of the \nsupply chain it would be possible to actually verify one's sources, but \nfor thousands of small to large businesses across the nation, this is \nsimply a severe paperwork burden which does not actually serve to meet \nthe intended goal. Please let us get back to our work.''\n  First let me say I love representing folks in Wyoming. They \nunderstand the issues and offer great common sense solutions. What \nWesley pointed out in his letter is what I talked about when we debated \nthis bill--the unintended consequences associated with a massive bill \nlike this one that the majority crams through without consideration in \nthe committee of jurisdiction will be many and they will be complex. It \nis unfortunate that businesses like Wesley's are being stymied by \nregulations while trying to maintain honest business practices. As a \nformer small business owner, I have been an advocate for small business \nand have worked to scale back the inundation of federal regulations on \nbusinesses large and small.\n  Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nwhich has no congressional oversight and is funded not through the \ncongressional appropriations process but by the FED. I have serious \nconcerns about this agency and the lack of oversight and transparency.\n  The Bureau, as allowed by the Dodd-Frank act, could spend up to $600 \nmillion every year, but is not subject to the congressional \nappropriations process, the same congressional appropriations process \nthat approves the budgets of other agencies like the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Instead, the \nagency is funded through revenues from the Federal Reserve, funds that \nare supposed to be remitted to the Treasury for deficit reduction. The \nCFPBs cut is 10 percent for fiscal year 2011, 11 percent for fiscal \nyear 2012, and will be 12 percent for fiscal year 2013 and beyond. This \nmeans 12 percent of the combined earnings of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, which was $4.98 billion in 2009. At that time, 10 percent would \nbe just under $500 million.\n  We are giving all this money to an agency to look into, and track, \nthe financial decisions of American consumers. That's right. News \nreports in April 2013 indicated the CFPB was collecting information on \nas many as 10 million Americans and compiling sophisticated, layered \nconsumer profiles including credit card, overdraft, mortgage and \nstudent loan information on individuals. Most recently, reports \nindicate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking to monitor \nfour out of every five U.S. credit card transactions this year--up to \n42 billion transactions. The agency also has the goal of monitoring up \nto 95 percent of all mortgage transactions.\n  When the Dodd-Frank act was under consideration in the Senate, I \nfiled an amendment to require the CFPB to obtain the written consent of \nthe consumer before they could collect any financial data. My amendment \nwas not allowed to come up for a vote. I most recently filed a similar \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, to address \nthis issue. Right now consumers have no say; the CFPB can and will \ncollect their financial data with no input from consumers at all. I \nhave long believed in the importance of financial literacy and consumer \nprotections, but I can't condone the CFPB putting together a ``Google \nEarth'' of the financial transactions of American citizens.\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\n  Any conversation I have with the banking community in my home State \nof Wyoming invariably turns to concerns over the regulatory burden \nbeing passed down to them by the CFPB. Just last month a longtime \nmember of the banking community in Wyoming relayed that a small \ncommunity bank in Lusk, WY--population around 1,550--has discontinued \nresidential real estate lending because they don't have the man power \nto comply with new regulations from the CFPB.\n  The bad actors this agency is supposed to weed out is hitting the \nfolks who provide needed services in our country's smallest communities \nwith their one-size-fits-all regulations and requirements. This is only \nthe tip of the iceberg.\n  Mr. President, these are not the only issues we need to address, but \nthey are some of the most important. And the United States would be \nbetter served if we were working on these issues than voting on non-\nessential nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/15/senate-section/article/S8821-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 1824.

Res. 263\n\n       Whereas the estuary regions of the United States constitute \n     a significant share of the economy of the United States, with \n     as much as 41 percent of the gross domestic product of the \n     United States generated in coastal shoreline counties;\n       Whereas the population of coastal shoreline counties in the \n     United States increased by 39 percent from 1970 to 2010 and \n     is projected to continue to increase;\n       Whereas not less than 1,900,000 jobs in the United States \n     are supported by marine tourism and recreation and other \n     coastal industries that rely on healthy estuaries;\n       Whereas the commercial and recreational fishing industries \n     rely on healthy estuaries and directly support 1,700,000 jobs \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2011, commercial fish landings generated \n     $5,300,000,000 and recreational anglers spent \n     $26,780,000,000;\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\n       Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats for countless \n     species of fish and wildlife, including many species that are \n     listed as threatened or endangered species;\n       Whereas estuaries provide critical ecosystem services that \n     protect human health and public safety, including water \n     filtration, flood control, shoreline stabilization, erosion \n     prevention, and the protection of coastal communities during \n     hurricanes and storms;\n       Whereas the United States has lost more than 110,000,000 \n     acres of wetland, or 50 percent of the wetland of the United \n     States, since the first European settlers arrived;\n       Whereas some bays in the United States that were once \n     filled with fish and oysters have become dead zones filled \n     with excess nutrients, chemical wastes, harmful algae, and \n     marine debris;\n       Whereas changes in sea level can affect estuarine water \n     quality and estuarine habitats;\n       Whereas the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1451 et seq.) provides that it is the policy of the United \n     States to preserve, protect, develop, and, if possible, \n     restore or enhance the resources of the coastal zone of the \n     United States, including estuaries, for current and future \n     generations;\n       Whereas 24 coastal and Great Lakes States and territories \n     of the United States operate a National Estuary Program or \n     contain a National Estuarine Research Reserve;\n       Whereas scientific study leads to better understanding of \n     the benefits of estuaries to human and ecological \n     communities;\n       Whereas the Federal Government, State, local, and tribal \n     governments, national and community organizations, and \n     individuals work together to effectively manage the estuaries \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore natural \n     infrastructure in local communities in a cost-effective \n     manner, helping to create jobs and reestablish the natural \n     functions of estuaries that yield countless benefits; and\n       Whereas the week of September 23 through September 29, \n     2013, has been recognized as ``National Estuaries Week'' to \n     increase awareness among all people of the United States, \n     including Federal Government and State and local government \n     officials, about the importance of healthy estuaries and the \n     need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 23 through September \n     29, 2013, as ``National Estuaries Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Estuaries \n     Week;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of estuaries to sustaining \n     employment in the United States and the economic well-being \n     and prosperity of the United States;\n       (4) recognizes that persistent threats undermine the health \n     of the estuaries of the United States;\n       (5) applauds the work of national and community \n     organizations and public partners that promote public \n     awareness, understanding, protection, and restoration of \n     estuaries;\n       (6) reaffirms the support of the Senate for estuaries, \n     including the scientific study, preservation, protection, and \n     restoration of estuaries; and\n       (7) expresses the intent of the Senate to continue working \n     to understand, protect, and restore the estuaries of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/15/senate-section/article/S8822-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
