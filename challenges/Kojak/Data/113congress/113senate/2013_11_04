Mr. President, Springfield, MA, police officer Michael \nCarney fought for 2\\1/2\\ years to get his job back--and he won. After \nhe took a medical leave of absence, Springfield officials refused to \nreinstate Officer Carney because the veteran officer had revealed he \nwas gay. But Officer Carney was determined to return to the force. \nBecause he lived in Massachusetts, one of only 17 States to protect \nemployees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, Officer Carney is now back on the job, serving and protecting \nthe people of Springfield, MA. I am also pleased to say Nevada law also \nincludes robust protections against this type of discrimination. \nOfficer Carney testified before the House of Representatives in 2007 \nand shared his story. This is what he said:\n\n       I'm a good cop, but I have lost 2\\1/2\\ years of employment \n     fighting to get that job back because I am gay. I never would \n     have been able to do that had I not lived in Massachusetts or \n     one of the handful of other States that protect . . . \n     employees from discrimination.\n\n  Sadly, not everyone is able to fight back like Officer Carney. In 33 \nStates, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people can be fired and \nharassed just for being who they are.\n  West Virginia coal miner Sam Hall was terrorized by his coworkers for \n7 years because he was gay. Mr. Hall just wanted to make a living, but \nsupervisors told him he would have to endure the persecution if he \nwanted to keep his job. West Virginia is one of 33 States with no \nprotections against this type of oppression. That is why I so admire \nJoe Manchin for recognizing that this is an issue which is important to \neveryone.\n  A patchwork of State laws that excludes tens of millions of Americans \nfrom basic protection against discrimination is simply not good enough. \nIt is time for Congress to pass a Federal law so that all Americans, \nregardless of where they live, can go to work unafraid to be who they \nare. As long as hardworking, qualified Americans can be denied job \nopportunities, fired or harassed because of their sexual orientation or \ngender identity, all workers are at risk.\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\n  This week the Senate will begin debate on the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, which would simply afford all Americans the same \nprotections from discrimination based on prejudice. In fact, 4 out of 5 \nAmericans mistakenly believe that these protections already exist. Two-\nthirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support \nFederal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity in the workplace. Once again, Republicans in \nCongress are out of step with Republicans in the rest of the country. \nHouse Speaker John Boehner this morning said he does not support this \nlegislation, but the Speaker should take his cue from the 56 percent of \nRepublicans nationwide who support ENDA and bring this legislation up \nfor a vote.\n  Corporations also agree nondiscrimination policies are good for \nbusiness. Most Fortune 500 companies already prohibit this kind of \npersecution, and more than 100 of the nation's largest businesses, more \nthan 80 national civil rights, labor, religious, civic, and \nprofessional organizations, and faith leaders from many denominations \nhave spoken in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  But there is more, much more, and a more important reason to support \nthis legislation than popular support. It is the right thing to do. \nHere is what Harvey Milk, the murdered California politician and gay \nrights activist once said:\n\n       It takes no compromise to give people their rights. . . . \n     It takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no \n     political deal to give people freedom. It takes no survey to \n     remove repression.\n\n  All Americans, regardless of what they look like, where they live or \nwho they choose to love, deserve to be treated with the same respect \nand dignity while they earn a living. An employee should not be judged \non matters that really are unimportant. We are talking about fairness. \nEmployees should be judged on the quality of their work and on their \ntalents and performance, and not on their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote tonight supporting the legislation that \n81 percent of Americans approve, to begin debate on a bill that would \naffirm the equal rights and freedoms of every American and to do so \nsimply because it is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/04/senate-section/article/S7782-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7782-S7783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday I read an excellent column in the \nNew York Times by Nicholas Kristof, the complete text of which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 2, 2013]\n\n                     This is Why We Need Obamacare\n\n                        (By Nicholas D. Kristof)\n\n       The biggest health care crisis in America right now is not \n     the inexcusably messy rollout of Obamacare.\n       No, far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing \n     people like Richard Streeter, 47, a truck driver and \n     recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene, Ore. His problem \n     isn't Obamacare, but a tumor in his colon that may kill him \n     because Obamacare didn't come quite soon enough.\n       Streeter had health insurance for decades, but beginning in \n     2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option. He says \n     he tried to buy individual health insurance but, as a \n     lifelong smoker in his late 40s, couldn't find anything \n     affordable--so he took a terrible chance and did without.\n       At the beginning of this year, Streeter began to notice \n     blood in his bowel movements and discomfort in his rectum. \n     Because he didn't have health insurance, he put off going to \n     the doctor and reassured himself it was just irritation from \n     sitting too many hours.\n       ``I thought it was driving a truck and being on your \n     keister all day,'' he told me. Finally, the pain became \n     excruciating, and he went to a cut-rate clinic where a \n     doctor, without examining him, suggested it might be \n     hemorrhoids.\n       By September, Streeter couldn't stand the pain any longer. \n     He went to another doctor, who suggested a colonoscopy. The \n     cheapest provider he could find was Dr. J. Scott Gibson, a \n     softhearted gastroenterologist who told him that if he didn't \n     have insurance he would do it for $300 down and $300 more \n     whenever he had the money.\n       Streeter made the 100-mile drive to Dr. Gibson's office in \n     McMinnville, Ore.--and received devastating news. Dr. Gibson \n     had found advanced colon cancer.\n       ``It was heartbreaking to see the pain on his face,'' Dr. \n     Gibson told me. ``It got me very angry with people who insist \n     that Obamacare is a train wreck, when the real train wreck is \n     what people are experiencing every day because they can't \n     afford care.''\n       Dr. Gibson says that Streeter is the second patient he has \n     had this year who put off getting medical attention because \n     of lack of health insurance and now has advanced colon \n     cancer.\n       So, to those Republicans protesting Obamacare: You're right \n     that there are appalling problems with the website, but they \n     will be fixed. Likewise, you're right that President Obama \n     misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their \n     insurance plan because that's now manifestly not true \n     (although they will be able to get new and better plans, \n     sometimes for less money).\n       But how about showing empathy also for a far larger and \n     more desperate group: The nearly 50 million Americans without \n     insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result. \n     FamiliesUSA, a health care advocacy group that supports \n     Obamacare, estimated last year that an American dies every 20 \n     minutes for lack of insurance.\n       It has been a year since my college roommate, Scott \n     Androes, died of prostate cancer, in part because he didn't \n     have insurance and thus didn't see a doctor promptly. Scott \n     fully acknowledged that he had made a terrible mistake in \n     economizing on insurance, but, in a civilized country, is \n     this a mistake that people should die from?\n       ``Website problems are a nuisance,'' Dr. Gibson said. \n     ``Life and death is when you need care and can't afford to \n     get it.''\n       The Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council \n     this year ranked the United States health care system last or \n     near last in several categories among 17 countries studied. \n     The Commonwealth Fund put the United States dead last of \n     seven industrialized countries in health care performance. \n     And Bloomberg journalists ranked the United States health \n     care system No. 46 in efficiency worldwide, behind Romania \n     and Iran.\n       The reason is simple: While some Americans get superb care, \n     tens of millions without insurance get marginal care. That's \n     one reason life expectancy is relatively low in America, and \n     child mortality is twice as high as in some European \n     countries. Now that's a scandal.\n       Yet about half the states are refusing to expand Medicaid \n     to cover more uninsured people--because they don't trust \n     Obamacare and want it to fail. The result will be more \n     catastrophes like Streeter's.\n       ``I am tired of being the messenger of death,'' said Dr. \n     Gibson. ``Sometimes it's unavoidable. But when people come in \n     who might have been saved if they could have afforded care \n     early on, then to have to tell them that they have a \n     potentially fatal illness--I'm very tired of that.''\n       Streeter met with a radiologist on Thursday and is bracing \n     for an arduous and impoverishing battle with the cancer. \n     There's just one bright spot: He signed up for health care \n     insurance under Obamacare, to take effect on Jan. 1.\n       For him, the tragedy isn't that the Obamacare rollout has \n     been full of glitches, but that it may have come too late to \n     save his life.\n\n  Mr. REID. The editorial tells the story of a number of people, but \none is about Richard Streeter, a truck driver who is very ill with \ncolon cancer. Why? Because he couldn't afford insurance; he couldn't \nafford health insurance. Kristof writes:\n\n       The biggest health care crisis in America right now is not \n     the inexcusably messy rollout of ObamaCare. No, far more \n     serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard \n     Streeter.\n\n  Mr. Streeter is a resident of Eugene, OR. His problem is not \nObamaCare but a tumor in his colon that is going to kill him unless \nthere is a miracle. He could have been treated had he had health \ninsurance. For him, ObamaCare did not come quite soon enough.\n  Kristof's column is an important reminder that the rollout of \nObamaCare is about more than a defective Web site, it is about saving \nlives, lots of lives. Kristof is reminding Republicans that they should \nhave empathy for ``the nearly 50 million Americans without insurance \nwho play health care Russian roulette [every day] as a result.''\n  He urges them, the Republicans, to remember that every 20 minutes an \nAmerican dies. Why? They lack health insurance.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/04/senate-section/article/S7783-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 815, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 184, S. 815, a bill to \n     prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks another step forward in the \nprogress of the United States of America in making sure that all of our \ncitizens are treated fairly and equitably under the law, that each \ncitizen of this country will know he or she cannot be discriminated \nagainst because of race, religion, sex, or national origin. That was \nall covered in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  In 1990 I was proud to stand at this very desk when we took another \nstep forward when we said we were going to extend civil rights to cover \npeople with disabilities. Today I stand here to mark another step \nforward when we will have a vote on proceeding to the debate to end \ndiscrimination in employment because of a person's sexual orientation. \nIt is a huge step forward, one too long in coming.\n  I was here in 1996 when we voted on the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct, the bill that is now before the Senate. We lost by one vote--50 to \n49. That was a dark day. We have been trying to get it before the \nSenate ever since, and we have finally done so. I am proud to say that \nwe got it through the HELP Committee this summer on a strong bipartisan \nvote, and we now have it before the Senate.\n  People should understand this is a momentous day in the development \nof our country, ensuring that every person is recognized for their \nindividual worth and for what they contribute to society, not for the \ncolor of their skin or race or religion or national origin or whether \nthey have a disability. Today we also say: We will make sure you cannot \nbe discriminated against because of your sexual identity or whom you \nlove.\n  It has been 17 years since Ted Kennedy, who chaired the committee at \nthe time, brought this bill to the floor in 1996, and it was, again, \none vote shy of passage. In the meantime, over those 17 years, the \nattitudes in this country have changed dramatically about the rights of \ngay, lesbian, transsexual, and transgender Americans. In a nutshell, I \nthink the vast majority of Americans believe that individuals ought to \nhave the right to earn a living free from discrimination and that they \nshould be judged on their performance in the workplace based on their \ntalent, their ability, and their qualifications.\n  Interestingly enough, since 1996, 17 States--including my State of \nIowa--have passed legislation that includes basic employment \nprotections for all LGBT Americans. I will use that acronym or those \nletters to explain lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n  Eighty-eight percent of Fortune 500 businesses have included \nprotections in their nondiscrimination policies, as have the majority \nof small businesses. Over 100 major businesses, including \npharmaceutical and technology companies, banks, manufacturing \ncompanies, and chemical companies have announced their support for this \nbill. In fact, there are polls that show 8 out of 10 Americans already \nbelieve that discrimination against people because of their sexual \norientation is already illegal; for example, that it is illegal to fire \nsomeone for being gay or for being a lesbian.\n  Why are we here today? Twenty-three years ago I stood at this desk as \nthe manager of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That bill was to \nextend nondiscrimination clauses to people with disabilities. At that \ntime a lot of people said: What is the problem?\n  Here is the problem in a nutshell. Let's say you are an African \nAmerican--or a woman or Jewish or Catholic or anything else--and you \napplied for a job for which you were fully qualified and the \nprospective employer said: No, I am not hiring African Americans. I \ndon't want any Black people working here. No, you are Jewish; get out \nof here. Do you know what you could do? You could turn right around, \nwalk out the door, go down to the courthouse, and the courthouse door \nwould be open for you. You can go into that courthouse and take that \ncase to court.\n  When I stood here 23 years ago, I said: Until the President signs \nthat bill into law, a person with a disability--for example, someone \nbound to a wheelchair--could be turned down in spite of being qualified \nfor the job. The prospective employer could say: Get out of here; I \ndon't hire cripples. If you then went down to the courthouse, the door \nwas locked. You had no recourse under law for the violation of your \ncivil rights. That is true today for gays, lesbians, bisexual, and \ntransgender Americans. They could be fired just because of that. If \nthey go down to the courthouse door, it is locked. They have no \nrecourse under law.\n\n  As I said, 17 States have State laws, some municipalities have \nmunicipal laws, but the vast majority of Americans live in States in \nwhich there is no civil rights law governing LGBT people. The majority \nof Americans--more than 56 percent--live in States in which it is \nperfectly legal to fire or refuse to hire someone because of who they \nare--lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. They have no recourse \nunder law. As I said, most people in America think they are covered. \nThey think you can't discriminate against someone because of that. The \nfact is that it is still perfectly legal to do so in most States in the \nUnited States.\n  As I said, I think we have changed quite a bit in the 17 years since \nwe last considered this bill. That last vote was 49 to 50. We lost by \none vote, and there were no amendments. At that time a majority of \nSenators would have been enough to pass it. All we needed was one more \nvote. I remember Vice President Al Gore was sitting in the chair, but \nwe were one vote short.\n  Today, however, as times have changed, we know we need 60 votes to \npass bills. Just think about that--17 years ago 51 votes would have \npassed this bill; now we have to have 60 votes. I won't get into the \nnecessity of having to change the rules of the Senate. We need 60 votes \nbefore we can even bring up the bill. It is a tribute to the leadership \nof the bill's sponsors, Senator Jeff Merkley and Senator Mark Kirk, \nthat we have now reached 60 votes. As of last week we only had about 57 \nor 58 votes, and then 2 more people decided to support the bill. Now \nthat Senator Heller of Nevada has announced his support for the bill, \nwe have 60 votes. We have 60 votes, and I predict we will get more than \n60 votes. Once we reach the critical mass, I think my colleagues will \nunderstand that this is another step in the direction of opening \nAmerica and making our society more inclusive rather than exclusive.\n  Senator Kirk, who is managing the bill for the minority, had been a \nsupporter of this legislation before he was elected to the House. \nSenator Merkley, who is the sponsor of the bill, was the leader of this \neffort when he was in the Oregon State Legislature. One Republican and \none Democrat were champions of this bill before they came to Congress. \nThey both played a critical role in ensuring the bill was brought \nbefore our committee. Even though Senator Merkley left our committee to \njoin the Appropriations Committee, he always kept on top of this. With \ntheir help, we voted it out of our HELP Committee in July with a strong \nbipartisan vote of 15 to 7. I thank the present occupant of the Chair, \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, for all of his help and \nsupport for getting this bill through. We had the support of three \nMembers of the minority as well. The vote was 15 to 7. It was a great \nvote.\n  Despite the passage of laws at the State and local levels, \ndiscrimination in the workplace continues to be all too real. Forty-two \npercent of lesbian, gay, and bisexual workers report having experienced \nsome form of discrimination at work. Even with the progress that has \nbeen made at the State and local levels, as I mentioned, too many\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nhard-working Americans, whether employed by private companies or public \nentities, are judged not by their ability and qualifications but by \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  Consider the example of Michael Carney, who was denied reinstatement \nas a police officer three times before successfully using the \nprotections of State law to get his job back. This is a job in which he \nhas now served with distinction for many years.\n  Consider Sam Hall, a West Virginia miner who suffered destruction of \nproperty and verbal harassment from coworkers because of his identity \nas a gay person. Sam is one of those millions of Americans who \ncurrently have no legal recourse without this law.\n  Discrimination against transgender Americans is even more common, \nwith 78 percent reporting harassment at work. I was fortunate enough to \nhear from Kylar Broadus, who was a witness at our HELP Committee \nhearing last year. Kylar faced intense harassment at work as he \ntransitioned from female to male. He has never fully recovered \nfinancially from the loss of his well-paid position.\n  Allyson Robinson also provided written testimony to the committee \nregarding the painful separation from her family that she endured \nbecause of financial hardships while she searched for her first job as \nan openly transgender female.\n  Again, too many of our fellow citizens are being judged not by what \nthey can contribute to the workplace but by who they are and whom they \nchoose to love. Unfortunately, we can cite countless cases of bigotry \nand blatant job discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. Equal opportunity is not just an abstract principle or a \nmatter of statistics. Every day, decent hard-working Americans are \nbeing hurt by this form of discrimination.\n  It has been almost 50 years since we first took steps to eliminate \ndiscrimination at work and 23 years since we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act to eliminate discrimination against people with \ndisabilities. We still have a long way to go, but our country is a far \nbetter place because of laws against discrimination based on race and \nsex and national origin and religion and age and, yes, disability. At \nlong last, it is time for us to also prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Such discrimination is \nfundamentally wrong and cannot be tolerated any longer in our country.\n\n  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans deserve the same \ncivil rights protections as all other Americans. This bill will \naccomplish that. It will say to millions of LGBT Americans that they \nare full and welcome members of our American family and that they \ndeserve the same civil rights protections as every other American.\n  The bill is very simple. It is very clear. It states that private \nbusinesses, public employers, and labor unions cannot make employment \ndecisions--hiring, firing, promotion or compensation--because of a \nperson's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThere are exemptions for small businesses and religious organizations, \nand current rules that are applicable to the Armed Forces are not \naffected. The bill expressly prohibits disparate impact claims. I wish \nto repeat that. The bill expressly prohibits disparate impact claims. \nIt is modeled on title VII of the Civil Rights Act. That law has been \nin place, as I said, since 1964. This bill also incorporates many \nsuggestions from members of both sides, Republicans and Democrats, on \nour HELP Committee, and I am glad we could work on a bipartisan basis \nto improve the bill and get it through our committee.\n  ENDA, as it is known--the Employment Non-Discrimination Act--has \nunprecedented support from major American businesses, including Dow \nChemical, General Electric, Hilton Hotels, GlaxoSmithKline, Chevron, \nWells Fargo, Marriott Hotels, Coca-Cola, Cisco, Kaiser, and on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this list of \nover 100 companies that support the passage of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Business Coalition for Workplace Fairness\n\n       The majority of United States businesses have already \n     started addressing workplace fairness for lesbian, gay, \n     bisexual and transgender employees. But we need a federal \n     standard that treats all employees the same way.\n       The Business Coalition for Workplace Fairness is a group of \n     leading U.S. employers that support the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act, a federal bill that would provide the \n     same basic protections that are already afforded to workers \n     across the country.\n       Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees are not \n     protected under federal law from being fired, refused work or \n     otherwise discriminated against. ENDA would do just that.\n\n\n Leading employers that support workplace fairness and the passage of \n             the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act\n\n       Accenture Ltd., New York, NY; AIG, New York, NY; Alcoa \n     Inc., New York, NY; American Eagle Outfitters Inc., \n     Pittsburgh, PA; American Institute of Architects, Washington, \n     DC; Ameriprise Financial Inc., Minneapolis, MN; Amgen Inc., \n     Thousand Oaks, CA; AMR Corp.

Asked \nwhy they had chosen to implement strong nondiscrimination policies \nthemselves, the Nike executive testified:\n\n       ENDA is good for business because teams thrive in an open \n     and welcoming work environment, where individuals are \n     bringing their full selves to work.\n\n  The bill we are debating specifically protects religious liberty with \na substantial exemption that allows specific religious organizations to \ncontinue to take sexual orientation and gender identity into account \nwhen making employment decisions in their religious organizations. I \nmight point out this bill is supported by 60 faith-based organizations, \nincluding congregations and organizations ranging from the Presbyterian \nChurch of America, the Episcopal Church, the Progressive National \nBaptist Convention, the Union of Reform Judaism, the Union Synagogue of \nConservative Judaism, the Islamic Society of North America, and many \nothers.\n  Among other things, polls show that 67 percent of American Catholics \nsupport basic workplace protections for LGBT workers. Almost 70 percent \nin that poll of evangelical Christians supports LGBT employment \nprotections. So there is overwhelming support for this bill, as I said, \namongst people of faith and religious-based organizations.\n  Again, I acknowledge the leadership of Senator Kirk, as well as the \nbill's lead sponsor, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who has championed \nthis bill and without whom, I dare say, we would not be starting this \ndebate today. In addition, we are fortunate the lead Democratic sponsor \nof the bill in the House in previous Congresses is now a Member of the \nSenate and a member of our HELP Committee, that is Senator Tammy \nBaldwin of Wisconsin. I hope she will soon be able to say she helped \npass this bill in both the House and the Senate.\n  I look forward to the vote later today when we will vote to proceed \nto this bill. As we all know, under the rules of the Senate, after \ncloture is invoked, we will have up to 30 hours of debate and then the \nbill will be on the floor and open. We had several amendments filed in \ncommittee that members of the HELP Committee reserved to try to bring \nto the floor. So I am confident we can work with those if they are \noffered again. I hope all amendments that are offered will be directed \nat improving this important civil rights legislation. I hope amendments \nthat are focused on unrelated matters can wait for another time, \nanother day, perhaps when that issue is on the floor. This is just too \nimportant--this major step forward in expanding our concept of civil \nrights laws--too important to be dragged down by spurious amendments \nthat have nothing to do with the bill whatsoever. I hope we do not get \nbogged down with that.\n  As I said, it has been a long time coming for this bill, when we \nthink about it. Seventeen years ago we voted on it and lost by one \nvote. Attempts have been made periodically to get it back to the floor \nagain and it has just never happened, but now we have the opportunity. \nWe reported it out of committee, as I said, with a good bipartisan \nvote.\n  ENDA is a critically needed bill. It is commonsense legislation. It \nhas overwhelming support from corporate America, from religious groups, \nfrom small and large businesses all across the country. As I said, 8 \nout of 10 Americans already think it is the law. So let's make sure \nthose 8 in 10 Americans who already think it is the law will now know \nit is the law, and we can pass it, send it to the House. Hopefully, the \nHouse will pass it and the President can sign it into law as soon as \npossible.\n  No American should be turned away or have to fear the loss of their \njob or their means of support or fear of not being hired, even though \nthey are eminently qualified, for any reasons other than their ability \nto do that job. People shouldn't be fired and shouldn't be \ndiscriminated against in hiring because of the color of their skin, \ntheir race, their religion, their sex, national origin, disability. \nThat is already in the law; now we put this next piece in place--no one \nshould be denied a job, an opportunity to work because they are gay, \nlesbian, bisexual or transgender. That is what this bill does.\n  I encourage all Senators to join with us in passing this important \ncivil rights legislation and continuing our Nation's advance toward \nfreedom and inclusion for everyone in our society. Let's say this is a \nbright day for America. We are finally bringing it to the floor. As I \nsaid, we will have the vote later today. We have 60 people who have \nsaid they will vote for it; I hope we have more. Sometime later this \nweek--I don't know if we will use the 30 hours but, hopefully, sometime \nlater this week, we can finally pass it. As I said, I think this week \nwill be one that will be an uplifting week. We have had a lot of \nproblems around this place over the last couple of months. I know from \nthe polls that Members of Congress, in both the House and the Senate, \nare probably about as popular as a toothache with the general public \nright now. But this week we can show the American people we can come \ntogether and we can lift our eyes above the haze and the smoke on the \nhorizon, and we can make this country a better place for all of us by \npassing this bill. Let's do this, and let's bring to the American \npeople what they think they have already and what they now want. That \nis, a society free of discrimination.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just returned from spending a weekend \nin my home State of Wyoming, traveling around the State and visiting \nwith people in Natrona County and Casper as well as in Rock Springs, \nWY. I attended a marvelous event held every year in Sweetwater County \ncalled Cowboys Against Cancer. There were 700 people there to celebrate \nsuccesses and remember those whom we have lost in these battles. I was \nthere along with Senator Enzi as well as our Governor and others \ntalking about an issue facing the Nation--an issue, of course, that is \non everyone's mind--the health care law. This has been a very rough 5 \nweeks for hard-working Americans who are concerned about their health, \nand this obviously came up for significant discussion at the Cowboys \nAgainst Cancer event Saturday night in Wyoming.\n  Many people were hoping the Democrats' health care law would actually \nhelp decrease costs; that it would actually help increase access to \nquality health care. But all America knows that hasn't happened. On \nOctober 1, the Obama administration launched its health care exchange. \nThis was to be the biggest moment of the President's signature \nachievement in office. It was one where people were looking forward to \nthe opening of the exchanges, and it flopped. It completely flopped. \nThe Web site crashed and fell right on the heads of the people who were \nalready anxious about their health care. People all across the country \nsaw this collapse, and even the late-night comedians have made a lot of \njokes about the incompetence and the mismanagement of the Obama \nadministration.\n  But I have to say the failure of the exchange is no laughing matter, \nbecause this is much more than a failed Web site. Real people are \nfacing real health care problems and are being hurt because of this \nadministration's failed health care law. Because of this law, millions \nof people are getting letters saying their insurance has been canceled. \nI talked to some of them this past weekend in Wyoming. There are at \nleast 3\\1/2\\ million people impacted by this across the country, and \nthe number continues to climb every day. The Obama administration says \nthat is no big deal. They say only 3\\1/2\\ million people are losing the \ninsurance plans they have now. But this administration's goal--their \ngoal--was just 7 million people covered in the exchanges. So why does \nthe White House think 3\\1/2\\ million Americans losing their coverage is \nno big deal when their goal this year was to cover 7 million Americans?\n  President Obama and Democrats in Congress promised over and over: If\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nyou like your insurance, you can keep it. But that wasn't true. The \nWashington Post Fact Checker looked into the President's claim. These \nare the folks who decide if something is truthful or not truthful. They \ngave the President the full four Pinocchios for completely false \nclaims.\n  The Fact Checker wrote:\n\n       The President's promise apparently came with a very large \n     caveat: ``If you like your health care plan, you'll be able \n     to keep your health care plan--if we deem it to be \n     adequate.''\n\n  Well, the President never said that. If the White House had been \nhonest about people losing their health insurance, this law would never \nhave passed. But the law did pass and people across the country are \nlearning how much it is going to actually hurt them personally.\n  For millions of people who are losing the insurance they have, they \nare finding the options available under the Democrats' health care law \nmuch more limited and much more expensive. The rates are higher, the \ndeductibles are higher, their copays are higher. It is not the kind of \nreform people wanted or needed, but that is what the Washington \nDemocrats gave them.\n  The cost increases and the canceled insurance policies are just the \nbeginning. A lot of people are now starting to realize they are no \nlonger going to have access to their family's doctor. It wasn't \nsupposed to happen this way. President Obama said this in 2009:\n\n       We will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you \n     will be able to keep your doctor. Period.\n\n  That is what President Obama said. If the White House had been honest \nabout how many families were going to lose access to their doctors, \nthis health care law would never have passed. But the White House did \nmake that promise, Democrats did pass that law, and American families \nall across the country are suffering as a result.\n  Coming back from Wyoming this morning I picked up USA Today. The \neditorial page of this newspaper supported the President's health care \nlaw, but their view today is:\n\n       Coverage cancellations belie Obama's promise. Obamacare is \n     starting to resemble a patient bleeding from self-inflicted \n     wounds. A month after launch, the online health exchanges \n     where individuals are supposed to shop for insurance remain \n     slow or unusable, except in states that opted to run their \n     own marketplaces and did a more competent job than the \n     administration.\n\n  States were more competent than the administration.\n  Continuing to quote the article:\n\n       As if that weren't trouble enough, critics are justifiably \n     mocking President Obama for his repeated, untrue promise that \n     if people liked their health plans, they could keep them.\n\n  The editorial on the opinion page of today's USA Today says:\n\n       Oops. Hundreds of thousands of people are getting \n     termination notices from plans that don't meet the strict new \n     requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Presumably, not all \n     those people disliked their plans.\n\n  Referring to the President, they go on to say:\n\n       Now he can't seem to admit he overpromised and \n     oversimplified. He and his aides compound their credibility \n     problem by suggesting that people whose plans are being \n     canceled ``just shop around in the new marketplace''--a \n     laughable impossibility while HealthCare.gov is plagued by \n     bugs.\n\n  So that is what I read in this morning's USA Today as I was coming \nback from Wyoming. Then I picked up the Wall Street Journal and turned \nto another column, and this is a guest column: ``You Also Can't Keep \nYour Doctor.''\n  You also can't keep your doctor. And there is a little subheadline \nthat reads: ``I had great cancer doctors and health insurance. My plan \nwas cancelled. Now I worry how long I'll live.''\n  I am sorry the Senate Chamber isn't full of all those people who \nvoted for this health care law as this woman worries how long she will \nlive. The Wall Street Journal says it is an absolutely devastating \npiece by one woman who is suffering because of the health care law. Her \nname is Edie Littlefield Sundby. She wrote about her experience \nfighting stage 4 gallbladder cancer. She had a health care plan with \naffordable access to good doctors who she points out saved her life.\n  As a doctor, I will tell you stage 4 gallbladder cancer has a very \nsmall chance of success and survival. She has beaten the odds because \nof those taking care of her. But now she has been told that the plan \nshe has is being canceled because of the President's health care law. \nHere is what she wrote:\n\n       What happened to the President's promise, you can keep your \n     health plan? Or the promise that, you can keep your doctor? \n     Thanks to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-\n     class health plan. The exchange would force me to give up a \n     world-class physician.\n\n  She has had some of the best physicians in the world--MD Anderson in \nTexas and California at Stanford, as well as in her home community of \nSan Diego.\n  Washington Democrats knew their law would harm people such as Edie \nLittlefield Sundby who writes today in the Wall Street Journal. They \nknew that people like her all across the country would lose their \ninsurance and lose their doctors. They just didn't want the American \npeople to know it.\n  It was in the regulations that they wrote and they supported. The \nissue has to do with a section of the health care law that says that \nanyone who had an insurance policy on March 23, 2010, and continued to \nrenew it, could keep it even after the ObamaCare exchange is launched. \nIt is called a grandfather clause, and it is to protect people from the \nlaw's new rules and mandates--to let people, if they had something they \nliked, keep what they had.\n  But less than 3 months after the President signed his health care \nlaw, the administration issued a regulation setting very specific \ncriteria these health plans had to meet in order to be grandfathered. \nThe regulation dismantled the section of the law by placing \nunreasonably tight restrictions on grandfathered policies. Now, any \nroutine change made to a grandfathered insurance plan immediately \nbreaks the Democrats' promise that Americans can keep their health \ninsurance.\n  A lot of consumers want the freedom and flexibility to increase their \nplan deductible, or copayments, rather than face a higher monthly \npremium. It is natural that people want to do it--with their health \ninsurance, car insurance, or homeowners insurance. Looking and making \ndecisions for you and your family is just part of being responsible. \nThe Obama administration's regulations took away that choice.\n  Republicans saw this train wreck coming, and we tried to stop it. My \ncolleague Senator Enzi from Wyoming in 2010 brought S.J. Res. 39 to \nthis floor. This was a Resolution of Disapproval, which would have \nimmediately overturned the administration's burdensome grandfather \nregulations.\n  What Senator Enzi brought to the floor for a vote of the entire body \nwould have, if passed, allowed everyone to keep the insurance they had \nif they liked it--basically, to uphold the President's promise.\n  Republicans supported this resolution. Senate Democrats voted against \nit in lockstep. Absolutely every one of them said no. They kept the \nregulation on the books and made sure people would not be able to keep \nthe insurance policy they had if they liked it.\n  Now Democrats don't want to hear about people like Edie with stage 4 \ngallbladder cancer. Republicans do want to hear about people like her--\npeople who are losing their coverage because of this health care law. \nWe want people to tell us their stories by tweeting with the hashtag \n``YourStory.'' We want to make sure that nobody in the Obama \nadministration forgets that these are real people and they have been \nhurt by this health care law which the President has continued to, on \nparty lines, force down the throats of the American people in its \npassage, and then continue to deliberately deceive the American people \nwith his quotes, not very long ago, and repeated so many times: If you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\n  Republicans support real health care reform. We support ideas such as \nallowing people to buy insurance across State lines. That would \nincrease access to coverage and to care, not decrease it. That would \nincrease competition and bring down prices--not raise them. But the \nDemocrats' health care law is doing just that. That would be a reform \nthat would help the American people. But the Obama health care law took \nthe exact opposite approach.\n  Here is how Edie Littlefield Sundby put it in her story. She wrote:\n\n       Before the Affordable Care Act, health-insurance policies \n     could not be sold across state lines; now policies sold on \n     the Affordable Care Act exchanges may not be offered across \n     county lines.\n\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n\n  That should change. President Obama and Washington Democrats wanted a \npolitical win. They were willing to do anything and say anything--to \nsay whatever they needed--to get that win, whether it was true or not. \nIf they had been honest with the American people, they would have never \ngotten this law passed. But the Democrats' health care law today in \nAmerica is hurting people, hurting families, hurting Americans. This \nmust end.\n  The President should come to the table. He should work with \nRepublicans to pass real reform, to help the American people who have \nbeen hurt and continue to be hurt by his health care law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about a bipartisan effort to advance uniquely American values: \nfreedom, fairness, and opportunity. The Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct, or ENDA, has at its foundation these core values. It is about \nfreedom, the freedom to realize our founding belief that all Americans \nare created equal under the law. It is about fairness, about whether \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans deserve to be treated \njust as their family members, their friends, their neighbors, and \nfellow workers. It is about opportunity, about whether every American \ngets to dream the same dreams, chase the same ambitions, and have the \nsame shot at success.\n  One year ago this week the people of Wisconsin elected me to the \nSenate. The citizens of Wisconsin made history, electing our State's \nfirst woman to the U.S. Senate, and electing the first out gay or \nlesbian person to the U.S. Senate in the history of our great Nation. \nBut I didn't run to make history, I ran to make a difference, a \ndifference that would give everyone a fair shot at achieving their \ndreams.\n  I couldn't be more proud of the bipartisan effort to make a \ndifference with the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. I thank and \nrecognize my colleagues Senators Mark Kirk, Jeff Merkley, Susan \nCollins, and Tom Harkin for their leadership working across party lines \nand moving this legislation forward. I take great pride at being a part \nof this effort. I think it shows great promise of what can be achieved \nif we work together in a bipartisan way to get work done for the \nAmerican people.\n  I also want to take the time to recognize the 55 cosponsors of this \nbill, both Democrats and Republicans, who made a commitment to ending \ndiscrimination against our fellow citizens simply because of who they \nare and who they love. I realize that for some this is not an easy \nvote. I understand for some they may believe it is not good politics. \nBut I want to say that I have a deep respect for those who choose to \nstand on the side of progress for our country this week. For those who \nstand this week and answer the call for courage, I can say with \nconfidence your courage will be respected and remembered when the \nhistory of this struggle is written.\n  In June I had the opportunity to speak at the Department of Justice \nduring its Pride Month observations. It was fitting that we gathered in \na building that bears the name of Robert F. Kennedy. He became Attorney \nGeneral at a time of rapid progress in the area of civil rights, \nprogress that thrilled many Americans and frightened others. Kennedy \nknew, however, that America should be on the side of progress. He \ntraveled to Georgia, at the time unfriendly territory for a civil \nrights reformer, to make his first formal speech at the University of \nGeorgia law school. He did not shy away from the Kennedy \nadministration's commitment to equal opportunity, ``For on this \ngeneration of Americans,'' he explained, ``falls the full burden of \nproving to the world that we really mean it when we say that all men \nare created free and equal before the law.''\n  He backed his words with actions, not only by vigorously enforcing \nthe laws and court orders that advanced the cause of civil rights but \nby holding the Kennedy administration itself accountable, demanding \nthat the Justice Department and other government entities prioritize \ndiversity in the workplace. Of course, as much progress as that \ngeneration made in fulfilling the promises America makes about fairness \nand equality, there was plenty to do for the generations that have \nfollowed.\n  Today we continue that work, guided by the belief that everyone \ndeserves a fair shot at the American dream and that our LGBT family \nmembers, friends, and neighbors deserve to be treated as everyone else \nin the United States. Every American deserves the freedom to work free \nof discrimination. Passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nstrengthens this freedom by recognizing the right to be judged based on \nyour skills, talents, loyalty, character, integrity, and work ethic.\n  My home State of Wisconsin was the first State in the Nation to add \nsexual orientation to its antidiscrimination laws. At the time, back in \n1982, only 41 municipalities and 8 counties in the United States \noffered limited protections against discrimination based on sexual \norientation. Wisconsin's efforts to pass the Nation's first sexual \norientation antidiscrimination statute were supported by a broad and \nbipartisan coalition, including members of the clergy, various \nreligious denominations, medical and professional groups. The measure \nwas signed into law by our Republican Governor, Lee Sherman Dreyfus, \nwho based his decision to support the measure on the success of \nmunicipal ordinances providing similar protections against \ndiscrimination.\n  Since Wisconsin passed its statute in 1982, 20 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, representing nearly 45 percent of our Nation's \npopulation, have passed similar antidiscrimination measures. Sixteen \nStates and the District of Columbia also protect their citizens on the \nbasis of gender identity. However, 76 million American workers have to \ncontend with the ugly reality that in over two dozen States it is legal \nto discriminate against LGBT employees. That is simply wrong and this \nlegislation seeks to right that wrong.\n  The business community understands this. That is why a majority of \nFortune 500 companies have sexual orientation and gender identity \nnondiscrimination policies in place, and more than 100 companies have \nendorsed this bill. It is time to level the playing field and extend \nthese protections to all Americans. But we don't just want to live in a \ncountry where our rights are respected under the law; we want to live \nin a country where we are respected for who we are, where we enjoy \nfreedom and opportunity because that is who we are as Americans.\n  More than 5 years after he spoke at the University of Georgia law \nschool, half a world away at Cape Town University, in South Africa, \nRobert F. Kennedy said, ``Few will have the greatness to bend history, \nbut each of us can work to change a small portion of the events and \nthen the total--all of these acts--will be written in the history of \nthis generation.''\n  The change we work for today can add up to incredible progress in our \nlifetime. This generation can be the one in which we fulfill the \npromises of freedom and equality for all, in which America finally \nbecomes a place where everyone's rights are respected at work and every \nfamily's love and commitment can be recognized and respected and \nrewarded under the law.\n  I am hopeful that we can now move this Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct forward, to build a tomorrow that is more equal, not less, for all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk the call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to be a longtime supporter \nand original cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known \nmore commonly as ENDA. This bill\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nwill affirm the principle that individuals in the workplace should be \njudged on their skills and abilities and not on extraneous criteria, \nsuch as sexual orientation.\n  In 2002, more than 10 years ago, I was proud to join Senator Ted \nKennedy, whom we all remember as a lifelong champion of civil rights, \nas the cosponsor of ENDA. I am pleased to support this important bill \nagain today, but I am dismayed that so many years have gone by--more \nthan a decade--and this bill still has not become law. It is time for \nus to enact this important legislation.\n  I wish to recognize the efforts of the chief sponsors of this bill, \nSenators Merkley and Kirk, who took up this cause and moved this bill \nforward. I also acknowledge the work of chairman Tom Harkin in bringing \nthis bill to the Senate floor. He, too, has been a champion of civil \nrights throughout his long career, and I hope that when he retires at \nthe end of this Congress, this bill will be one more of his \naccomplishments.\n  The time to pass it has come. All Americans deserve a fair \nopportunity to pursue the American dream. Over the years, we have \nrightly taken a stand against workplace discrimination based on race, \nsex, national origin, religion, age, and disability. It is past time \nthat we ensure that all employees are judged solely based on their \ntalents, abilities, hard work, and capabilities by closing an important \ngap in Federal employment law as it relates to sexual orientation. The \nright to work is fundamental. How can we in good conscience deny that \nright to any LGBT American who is qualified and willing to work? \nEspecially in today's economy, job security has taken on an even \ngreater importance to all Americans. How can we, in good conscience, \ntell one segment of Americans that they are not entitled to that \nsecurity because of whom they love?\n\n  Equal rights in the workplace is neither a new nor a revolutionary \nconcept. Much of corporate America has already embraced LGBT \nprotections. Why? Because it allows them to attract the best and the \nbrightest employees and to retain talented employees. Nearly 90 percent \nof Fortune 500 companies already have sexual orientation \nnondiscrimination policies in place, and many Maine businesses and \nbusinesses associated with the State of Maine have such policies. They \ninclude IDEXX Laboratories, L.L. Bean, Maine Medical Center, the Warren \nCenter in Bangor, Hannaford Supermarkets, Bath Ironworks, and Unum, a \nlarge insurance company. There are many more. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a list of leading Maine employers that support workplace fairness \nand the passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act be included in \nthe record following my remarks.\n  In addition, ENDA is very similar to current law in nearly two dozen \nStates, including, I am proud to say, the great State of Maine.\n  But in spite of how far we have advanced the cause of civil rights in \nthis country, it still remains legal in 29 States to fire or to refuse \nto hire someone simply because he or she is lesbian, gay, or bisexual. \nMost businesses don't discriminate. They simply want to hire the best \nworker for the job, regardless of sexual orientation. But in others, \nhigh-performing LGBT employees can be and still are legally \ndiscriminated against.\n  When I discuss this issue with many of my constituents, they are \nshocked to learn it is legal under Federal law--not Maine law but \nFederal law--for them to refuse to hire or to fire someone solely \nbecause of their sexual orientation. They find that shocking. They just \nassume our civil rights laws, which protect people from discrimination \nbased on race, gender, religion, and age, also protect individuals \nbased on sexual orientation. Of course, because they are operating in \nthe State of Maine, they cannot legally discriminate against an \nindividual based on sexual orientation. I am proud to say the vast \nmajority of Maine's businesses would never think of discriminating \nbased on sexual orientation. They simply want to hire and retain the \nbest person for the job.\n  Along with former Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, I worked hard \nto repeal the military's discriminatory policy of ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell.'' That policy prevented gay and lesbian servicemembers from being \nopen about their sexual orientation. My view was that if they were \nwilling to put on the uniform of our country, be deployed to distant \nlands, and risk their lives for our freedom, we should be thanking \nthem, not trying to exclude them from serving in the military. Now that \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has been repealed, I think it is significant \nthat the implementation of repeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has gone \nso smoothly. It has gone very well, contrary to the dire predictions of \nsome of the opponents. We hear some of the same kinds of predictions \ntoday as we debate this bill. I would say that, just as the repeal of \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has been implemented quite smoothly, we will \nsee ENDA implemented smoothly as well if we stand, do what is right, \nand pass this bill.\n  The bill before the Senate deserves support as a matter of fairness \nand as a matter of civil rights. It is a commonsense solution \nconsistent with existing Federal civil rights laws, and it will not \nplace an undue burden on American employers. We would not see so many \ncompanies voluntarily adopting nondiscrimination policies if it were \nsomehow burdensome to do so. They are doing so because it is in their \nown best interests, because they want the most qualified employees and \nto retain the most talented employees, regardless of their sexual \norientation. That is not relevant to their ability to do the job.\n  Finally, it is simply right to pass this bill. We cannot in this day \nand age countenance legal discrimination against qualified employees \nand applicants. It is time that we enact this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support ENDA, and I am hopeful we will get \nmore than the 60 votes needed this evening to proceed to this important \nbill.\n  Thank you, Madam President.

Senator Mark Kirk, my \nRepublican colleague from Illinois, is a cosponsor of this issue as \nwell.\n  When it comes to discrimination, neither party has a monopoly on \nopposing discrimination. We should be working together. So I thank the \nSenator from Maine for speaking as she has so often for the kinds of \nliberties and values which we all should share in this country.\n  If we ask most Americans this very basic question: Is it legal to \ndiscriminate against someone because they are gay--to say I won't hire \nyou, I won't promote you, I won't give you a raise--80 percent of \nAmericans say, of course not. That can't be legal in America. The \nreality is that in more than half of the States it is legal, and in \nmore than two-thirds of the States it is legal to discriminate based on \ngender identity. That which we take for granted as part of the ordinary \ncourse of life and business in America turns out not to be true. This \nENDA bill, which is going to be considered on a procedural vote in \nabout an hour, is an effort to establish a national standard of \ntolerance, a national standard against discrimination.\n  I come from a background--and I think most people do--that believes \neach person deserves a chance to prove themselves and that we shouldn't \nhold it against them if they happen to be a man or a woman, a person \nwho is of one religious faith or another, or because of a person's \nnational origin, race, or religion. We shouldn't discriminate against \npeople based on that. It really strikes me as fundamental to what we \nare as Americans to say that everyone deserves a chance to be judged on \nthe merits, on the basis of their performance. This Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, on which we will consider a procedural vote in \nabout an hour, is an effort to enshrine that into law at the Federal \nlevel.\n  Some of the critics say: Why are you doing this? The House of \nRepresentatives will never take this up; they will never consider it. \nWell, I think it is our responsibility to speak out in favor of doing \nthe right thing. I am hoping that, as we saw with the statement from \nthe Senator from Maine, Republicans will step up and realize that this \nshouldn't be a partisan issue, and that the Republican-controlled House \nof Representatives, where the Republicans have the majority, will \nactually stand and speak against this form of discrimination.\n  As many as 48 percent of lesbian, gay, or bisexual Americans and 59 \npercent of transgender Americans have no legal protection against \ndiscrimination in the workplace. In 29 States, lesbian, gay, and \nbisexual Americans have no legal protection. In three States, \ntransgender Americans have no protection. Between 15 percent and 43 \npercent of LGBT people have experienced discrimination or harassment in \nthe workplace as a result of their sexual orientation. Twenty-six \npercent of transgender people report having been fired from a job \nbecause of gender identity, and 90 percent reported experiencing \nharassment, mistreatment, or discrimination.\n  Those are terrible statistics, but there is a ray of hope. We found \nit on the issue of marriage equality, and we found it when it comes to \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, and here is what is most \nhopeful: Younger people don't feel this way. The newer generation \nacross America looks at the older folks, scratches their heads, and \nsays: What are you doing? Why would you possibly discriminate against \nsomeone because of their sexual orientation?\n  There are some who will decry this as the deterioration of American \nvalues. Not me. I think it is an indication that each generation has an \nopportunity to expand opportunity, an opportunity to expand freedom, \nand to put to rest discrimination. How many times has it happened \nthroughout our history? We waged a Civil War over the issue of race and \nslavery, and in our Constitution women were treated as second class \ncitizens and not allowed to vote until the 20th century. We have seen \nsimilar discrimination against groups throughout our history. We know \nit happened in the early days when it came to discrimination against \nthose who were disabled and faced other disabilities. All of that is \nchanging for the better. We are moving toward a society that really \njudges people based on what they do with their lives, how they conduct \nthemselves.\n  When we extend Federal employment discrimination protections \ncurrently provided based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age, \nand disability to sexual orientation and gender identity, we will be \nmoving forward on this Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which is \nknown as ENDA. In this measure, we prohibit public and private \nemployers with more than 15 employees, employment agencies, and labor \nunions from using an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity \nas the basis for employment discrimination such as hiring, firing, \npromotion or compensation. We apply to Congress and the Federal \nGovernment as well as employees of State and local governments the same \nbasic protection.\n  This bill reflects what the business community is largely already \ndoing. A majority of Fortune 500 companies have sexual orientation and \ngender identity nondiscrimination policies in\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\nplace. More than 100 companies have already endorsed this bill.\n  Recent polling has shown the majority of small businesses have sexual \norientation and gender identity nondiscrimination policies in place. \nOne might say: If so many businesses are already moving in this \ndirection, why do we need it? Well, the vast majority of American \nbusinesses didn't discriminate based on race, but to protect people \nlooking for jobs, and others, we wanted to make sure everyone was \nprotected in the Civil Rights Act.\n  The business community from Wall Street to Main Street understands \nthat hiring the best and brightest, without considering irrelevant \ncharacteristics such as sexual orientation and gender identity, is the \nbest way to compete in our global economy.\n  ENDA would extend the protections already offered by the majority of \nbusinesses to level the playing field and ensure that all Americans \nhave equal protection against employment discrimination.\n  We do not get many chances in this job to make a mark in history. \nThis will be our chance in the Senate. In just an hour we will have \nthis procedural vote. We need 60. We have 55 Democrats, but we need 5 \nRepublicans to step up and join us. I believe we will have them, and I \nhope many more.\n  Let's make this a solid bipartisan effort, a solid stand against \ndiscrimination. That ought to be one issue that brings both parties \ntogether. With a solid vote coming out of the Senate, I hope our \nfriends on the opposite side of the Rotunda will follow our lead and \nthey will consider and pass this important and historic legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BROWN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                    NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Gregory Howard Woods, \nof New York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York and Debra M. Brown, of Mississippi, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, we are voting on the nominations \nof Debra Brown and Gregory Woods to fill vacancies on the District \nCourts of Mississippi and New York. If confirmed, Ms. Brown would be \nthe first African-American woman to serve as a Federal judge in \nMississippi. I am proud that together we will reach a landmark moment \nin diversity on the Federal bench, and I commend President Obama, \nSenator Wicker, and Senator Cochran for their important efforts.\n  These nominations come at a trying time for the Federal courts. We \nhave more than 90 judicial vacancies, and 37 of these vacancies have \nbeen designated as emergency vacancies due to high caseloads by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. While it is a \nsign of progress that we will vote to confirm two additional judges \ntoday, it is essential that the Senate move faster to confirm those \njudges that the Federal judiciary so urgently needs.\n  Last week, when debating whether we would be allowed to have an up-\nor-down vote on the nomination of Patricia Millett to the DC Circuit, \nthere was a lot of talk by Senate Republicans that Senate Democrats \nshould be concerned with filling judicial emergency vacancies rather \nthan the DC Circuit, which they claim does not need more judges. We all \nknow that their arguments about the DC Circuit have nothing to do with \ncaseload and everything to do with the political party of the President \nnominating. As one of only three members of my caucus who have served \nin the Senate since the 1970s, and having served both in the majority \nand the minority, I have cautioned against changing the rules. However, \nif the filibuster rules continue to be abused by my Republican \ncolleagues I will have no option but to reconsider my longstanding \nopposition to such a change.\n  I also find the Senate Republicans' newfound concern about judicial \nemergency vacancies particularly rich with irony given their role in \npreventing this President from filling many of those vacancies. In \nfact, nearly half of the emergency vacancies are empty because of \nRepublican obstruction. First, there are 15 judicial nominees pending \nbefore the full Senate, including 7 nominees who would fill judicial \nemergency vacancies if the Republicans would allow us to vote on them \ntoday: Elizabeth A. Wolford, to be U.S. district judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York; Brian Morris, to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Montana; Susan P. Watters, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe District of Montana; Brian J. Davis, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Middle District of Florida; James Donato, to be U.S. district judge \nfor the Northern District of California; Beth Labson Freeman, to be \nU.S. district judge for the Northern District of California; and Pedro \nA. Delgado Hernandez, to be U.S. district judge for the District of \nPuerto Rico. Instead, Republicans continue to force many of these \nnominees to wait needlessly on the Senate floor.\n  Moreover, Republicans are obstructing nominees from filling these \njudicial emergency vacancies in other ways that the public is less \naware. Much of these delay tactics occur earlier in the process, and \ninclude the refusal to return blue slips and the refusal to provide \nrecommendations to the President for district court nominees from their \nState that they would be willing to support. In fact, there are \njudicial emergency vacancies that have persisted for years because \ncertain Republican Senators refuse to either return their blue slip or \nprovide a recommendation to the President. So I take these hollow \naccusations about focusing on judicial emergency vacancies from Senate \nRepublicans with a grain of salt. This is advice I will heed once \nSenate Republicans demonstrate through their actions that they care \nabout filling vacancies.\n  It is good news for New York and Mississippi that the Senate will \nvote today to confirm two excellent nominees. Yet I believe that the \nSenate should have acted sooner on these nominations. These nominees \nare uncontroversial and have remained on the Senate floor for far too \nlong. The unnecessary and irresponsible government shutdown did serious \nharm to our Federal courts, which was already operating on fumes as a \nresult of sequestration and the high levels of judicial vacancies.\n  Gregory Woods is nominated to a vacancy on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York. Since 2012, Mr. Woods has served \nas the general counsel for the U.S. Department of Energy. He previously \nserved for 3 years as deputy general counsel at the Department of \nTransportation, and in private practice for 11 years at Debevoise & \nPlimpton LLP, first as an associate, and later as a partner. Following \nlaw school, he worked for 4 years as a trial attorney in the Commercial \nLitigation Branch of the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. \nMr. Woods earned his B.A., with honors, from Williams College and his \nJ.D. from Yale Law School. He has the support of both of his home State \nSenators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. The Judiciary \nCommittee approved his nomination by voice vote more than 3 months ago.\n  Debra Brown is nominated to a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of Mississippi. Since 2012, Debra Brown has been \na\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\nshareholder in the law firm Wise Carter Child & Caraway. She previously \nworked at the law firm Phelps Dunbar LLP for over 15 years, first as an \nassociate, then as a partner, and finally as a counsel. While earning a \nreputation as an excellent litigator, she stayed involved in her \ncommunity, providing pro bono legal services through the Mississippi \nVolunteer Lawyers Project and serving on the Board of Directors for the \nMississippi Center for Justice. Ms. Brown earned her B.A. from \nMississippi State University, and her J.D. from the University of \nMississippi School of Law. Her nomination has the support of both her \nhome State Senators, Senator Wicker and Senator Cochran. The Judiciary \nCommittee approved her nomination by voice vote more than 3 months ago.\n  To me, the path forward is simple. Nominees such as the ones being \nvoted on today and the other uncontroversial, qualified nominees \ncurrently pending before the full Senate should be confirmed \nimmediately so that they can get to work for the American people. Now \nthat this shutdown has ended, we must work together to make sure that \nour Federal judiciary, a coequal and independent branch of government, \nhas the resources it needs to be working at full strength and with a \nfull complement of judges. Only then will we have a judicial system \nworthy of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to support the \nconfirmation of Ms. Debra Brown to be a U.S. district court judge for \nthe Northern District of Mississippi.\n  Ms. Brown graduated from the Mississippi State University School of \nArchitecture in 1987, where she served as a member of the school's \nadvisory council. She worked as an architect in Washington, DC, where \nshe participated in the renovation and restoration of municipal and \nhistoric buildings and in the construction of commercial and \nresidential properties as well.\n  She received her law degree from the University of Mississippi School \nof Law in 1997, where she served as associate editor and articles \neditor of the Mississippi Law Journal. Ms. Brown became the only lawyer \nin Mississippi with degrees in both architecture and law.\n  In 1997 she joined the Phelps Dunbar law firm in Jackson, MS, where \nshe became a partner and remained until January 2012, when she joined, \nas a shareholder, the Jackson law firm of Wise Carter Child & Caraway. \nBoth of these firms are highly respected.\n  During her almost 16 years in private practice, Ms. Brown has had the \nopportunity to be involved in numerous civil cases in a wide range of \nsubjects. Her specialty was commercial construction and civil liability \nlitigation. She is a member of the American Bar Association, the \nNational Bar Association, and the Federal Bar Association, as well as a \nmember of the Mississippi State Bar, the Magnolia Bar Association, and \nthe Mississippi Women Lawyers Association, where she has served as \npresident. She is a fellow of the Mississippi Bar Foundation. In 2004 \nMs. Brown received the Jackson Young Lawyers Outstanding Service Award, \nand in 2008 she was recognized by the Mississippi Business Journal as \none of Mississippi's leading businesswomen.\n  Her nomination was approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate Committee \non the Judiciary. I am very pleased to support this nomination. Ms. \nDebra Brown is very well qualified for this important responsibility, \nand I am confident she will serve with distinction as a U.S. district \ncourt judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise this afternoon, joining my \ncolleague from Mississippi, in strong support of Debra Brown's \nconfirmation to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nMississippi. Ms. Brown was nominated in May by President Obama to fill \nthe seat held by my friend, the late district court judge Allen Pepper.\n  As one of Mississippi's two U.S. Senators, I enthusiastically \nrecommend Ms. Brown based upon her qualifications. In addition, I am \nthrilled and honored to be part of this historic moment for our State. \nIf confirmed, Ms. Brown will become the first female African-American \nU.S. district judge in Mississippi. Making history, however, would be \njust the latest achievement in Ms. Brown's admirable career, which has \nreflected a longtime commitment to excellence--the kind of excellence \nher parents expected of her and her four sisters throughout their \nchildhood. Ms. Brown would go on to make her parents proud and to be a \ncredit to her hometown.\n  Sharing in this special moment today is Ms. Brown's native Yazoo \nCity, MS. It is worth mentioning that along with Federal judges William \nBarbour and Carlton Reeves, Debra Brown now becomes the third district \ncourt judge in recent memory from the small town of Yazoo City.\n  Ms. Brown is a proven trailblazer. As my colleague just stated, she \nwas the second African-American female to graduate from the School of \nArchitecture at Mississippi State University and the first member of \nher family to earn a law degree, which she completed in 1997 from the \nUniversity of Mississippi School of Law. So her confirmation today will \nbe a source of justifiable pride for two of Mississippi's great \nuniversities. Not many lawyers in the country have degrees in \narchitecture and in law, and indeed Debra Brown is reportedly the only \npracticing lawyer in Mississippi with an architectural background.\n  Following law school, Ms. Brown rose to become a partner in the law \noffice of Phelps Dunbar in Jackson, MS. Since last year she has been a \nshareholder in the law firm of Wise Carter Child & Caraway, where she \nhas handled a wide variety of commercial litigation matters before both \nFederal and State courts.\n  According to press reports, Ms. Brown's friends expect her to be very \ncoordinated, very detailed, and very prepared as a judge. Ms. Brown's \ncollege dean at Mississippi State University recalled that her key \ncharacter traits are perseverance, diligence, and focus. He noted that \nshe overcame early struggles, winning the top architecture student \nhonor--the Alpha Rho Chi Medal--in her senior year.\n  It is clear that Ms. Brown will bring a unique perspective to the \ncourt, drawing upon a diverse professional and educational background. \nI am confident her service will be good for our country, our State, and \nespecially good for the city of Greenville, where she will preside. \nHaving a judge who is also an architect would be particularly \nserendipitous for Greenville. The Federal courthouse there is woefully \ninadequate. The court is in desperate need of a new state-of-the-art \ncourthouse. I am hopeful Ms. Brown's tenure will coincide with its \nconstruction.\n  Although Ms. Brown's law career has focused primarily on civil \nlitigation, her dedication to her profession goes far beyond casework. \nFrom 2003 to 2004 she served as president of the Mississippi Women \nLawyers Association. She was also named by the Mississippi Business \nJournal as one of Mississippi's 50 leading businesswomen. In addition \nto pro bono work, Ms. Brown serves on the board of the Mississippi \nCenter for Justice, a public interest law firm that combats \ndiscrimination and poverty in Mississippi, and Operation Shoestring, \nwhich empowers families and children in the Jackson community. She has \nbeen endorsed by a number of prestigious organizations, including the \nMagnolia Bar Association, which represents minorities and other lawyers \nand judges throughout the State of Mississippi.\n  Our country needs judges who have a record of professional \nexcellence, integrity, and public service. Ms. Brown has demonstrated \nthis throughout her career. I urge my colleagues to vote for her \nconfirmation for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nMississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am told the Senator from Illinois is \nwaiting to speak. I know the time has been reserved for me on these \njudges, but of course I would be willing to yield to him.\n  I ask the Chair, how long does the Senator from Illinois need?\n  Mr. KIRK. A very brief time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will yield to him.\n  I do want to tell my two friends from Mississippi that I agree with \nwhat they\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nhave said about their nominee. I was proud to vote for her in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, proud to put her name on the agenda, and \nproud to have the hearing for her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to deliver my \nremarks while seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Employment Non-Discrimination Act\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I have been silent for the last 2 years \ndue to having a stroke a little under 2 years ago. I have come to speak \nbecause I believe so passionately in the ENDA statute. This is not a \nmajor change to law. It is already law in 21 States.\n  I think it is particularly appropriate for an Illinois Republican to \nspeak on behalf of this measure, in the true tradition of Everett \nMcKinley Dirksen and Abraham Lincoln, men who gave us the 1964 Civil \nRights Act and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, would I be in order to speak about \njudges who are going to be voted on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would be in order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of the nominations \nof Debra M. Brown to be U.S. district judge for the Northern District \nof Mississippi and Gregory Howard Woods to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Southern District of New York.\n  Before we vote on these nominations, I want to inform my fellow \nSenators and the American people once again on the excellent progress \nwe have made on nominations and the fair treatment of President Obama's \nnominees. With these confirmations today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 38 lower court article III judicial nominees this year.\n  Despite what I frequently hear--that this President is being treated \ndifferently than President Bush--President Obama is clearly ahead of \nwhere President Bush was at a similar timeframe, meaning at this time \nin his second term. The 38 confirmations this year is more than 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the number confirmed at a similar stage in President Bush's \nsecond term, when only 14 judicial nominees had been confirmed. In \nfact, for the entire fifth year of President Bush's term, only 21 lower \ncourt judges were confirmed. Again, in President Obama's fifth year we \nwill have confirmed 38 nominees after today's votes.\n  In addition to the robust pace of activity on the floor, the \ncommittee has had an aggressive schedule of hearings and business \nmeetings taking action on many more nominees. In total, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 207 lower court article III judges. We have voted \nagainst three nominees. So 207 to 3 being defeated is a success rate \nfor the President of 99 percent of his nominees. I think that is a \npretty outstanding record not just for President Obama but for any \nPresident. So I reject the continuing rhetoric regarding how \nRepublicans are obstructing President Obama's judicial nominees.\n  Again, I congratulate the nominees on their anticipated \nconfirmations.\n  Debra M. Brown is nominated to be United States District Judge for \nthe Northern District of Mississippi. She received her B.Arch. from \nMississippi State University in 1987. She worked as an associate in \narchitectural firms until starting law school in 1994. She received her \nJ.D. from University of Mississippi School of Law in 1997. Upon \ngraduation, she joined Phelps Dunbar LLP as an associate, focusing on \ncommercial litigation primarily in the financial and insurance context \nrepresenting commercial clients such as banks, mortgage companies, \nproperty and casualty insurers and commercial property managers. She \nbecame partner in 2004, and handled matters concerning construction-\nrelated litigation for construction sureties, general contractors and \nsome subcontractors. In 2012, she moved to Wise Carter Child & Caraway, \nP.A. There, she continues to handle construction litigation, as well as \nrepresentation of owners in construction matters, and representation of \nhospitals and medical providers in the context of employment law and \nmedical malpractice. She has participated in 12 trials, two as sole \ncounsel, and one as chief counsel.\n  The ABA has given Ms. Brown a rating of ``Unanimous Qualified''.\n  Gregory Howard Woods is nominated to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of New York. He received his B.A. from \nWilliams College in 1991 and his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1995. \nAfter graduating from law school, Mr. Woods joined the Department of \nJustice as a trial attorney in the civil division. While at DOJ, his \npractice included investigating and litigating cases under the False \nClaims Act. In 1998, Mr. Woods joined Debevoise & Plimpton as an \nassociate and was made an equity partner in 2004. At Debevoise & \nPlimpton his practice was focused almost exclusively on corporate \ntransactional law. As a partner, he devoted his practice principally to \nfinance and restructuring matters.\n  In August 2009 he was named Deputy General Counsel for the Department \nof Transportation. In 2012, after Senate confirmation, he was appointed \nby President Obama to be General Counsel of the Department of Energy.\n  The ABA has given Mr. Woods a rating of ``Majority Qualified, \nMinority Well Qualified''.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I won't go on so much on the numbers, but \nI did hear my friend say there is a question whether President Obama \nhas been treated differently than President Bush. I would note that \nwhen President Bush nominated John Roberts for the ninth seat to the DC \nCircuit, he was confirmed by every single Republican and Democrat \nvoting for him.\n  Patricia Millett, with exactly the same credentials as he for the \nNinth seat, was filibustered by the Republicans. Were they treated \ndifferently? Yes. That happened last week, so it is fresh in our \nmemories. But I wish to talk about a different issue.\n  Today, Senators are finally going to have a chance to cast their vote \nand put on the record where every Senator stands on the fundamental \nissue of fairness. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will help \nbring this great Nation one step closer to the goal of equal rights for \nall Americans.\n  I have long believed that American workers should be evaluated based \non how they perform, not on irrelevant considerations such as gender, \nrace, gender identity, or sexual orientation, but on how they do the \njob. If they do the job, they ought to be praised for it. In these \ndifficult economic times, ensuring equal protection in the workplace is \neven more critical. We have to do better. We shouldn't question if \npeople should be treated the same in the workplace, but that is what \nhas happened in parts of this country. Maintaining the status quo would \nkeep in place a system that supports a second class of workers in a \nmajority of States. This runs counter to the values on which America \nwas founded. It has to end.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would prohibit workplace \ndiscrimination and make it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or refuse \nto promote employees simply based on an individual's sexual orientation \nor gender identity. Currently, Federal law protects against employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, \nor disability--as it should. But it doesn't stop discrimination based \non sexual orientation or gender identity. It is long overdue for \nCongress to extend these protections to all American workers.\n  I am a native of Vermont. I am proud to represent the State of \nVermont, as I have for almost four decades, in this body. One reason I \nam proud to represent Vermont is our State has led the country on so \nmany civil rights issues. Vermonters believe in individual rights, in \nfairness, and in equality. More than two decades ago, our State of \nVermont added sexual orientation to the list of protected categories in \nits antidiscrimination employment law, and Vermont expanded its \nprotections to include gender identity protection 6 years ago. Yet in \n29 States, an employer can fire employees based on\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\ntheir sexual orientation, and in 33 States, they can be fired based on \ntheir gender identity. This is not right. I might also point out, \nVermont has one of the lowest unemployment rates of any State in the \ncountry.\n  Many employers have taken this issue into their own hands, making up \nfor Congress's inaction by implementing important antidiscrimination \npolicies. As of April of this year, 88 percent of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies had nondiscrimination policies that included sexual \norientation, and 57 percent had policies including gender identity.\n  I wish to mention two Vermont companies in particular, Fletcher Allen \nHealth Care and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, for showing real \nleadership on this issue; they banned discrimination in the workplace \nbased on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n  I also applaud companies such as IBM, Microsoft, General Electric, \nand Time Warner for doing the right thing. Two of these companies have \na major presence in Vermont. These corporations know that treating all \ntheir employees equally is not only fair--it also makes good business \nsense. They know that. It is time that we in Congress know that too.\n  Workplace discrimination hurts families, and the hatred that drives \ndiscrimination has no place in a nation continually striving to form a \nmore perfect union. So I thank Chairman Harkin for making this \nbipartisan legislation a priority in his committee, and for conducting \nthe groundwork in creating the record we need to ensure this important \nbill's passage. The bipartisan team of Senator Merkley and Senator \nCollins brought together Members by their thoughtfulness and tenacity.\n  A dear friend of mine used to sit in the back, and was in the Senate \nwhen I came here. I learned so much from him. I am speaking of Ted \nKennedy. I have to think he is looking down on this Chamber tonight as \nwe try to pass legislation he worked so hard to craft in his final \nyears in the Senate. I was happy to work on this civil rights \nlegislation with him then and with his partner on this effort, a former \nVermont Senator, Jim Jeffords. We honor their leadership tonight with \nthis vote.\n  I am encouraged States and employers are moving forward where we have \nnot. But I believe ending discrimination must also be a priority for \nCongress. I look at the distinguished Presiding Officer, and I think of \nher predecessor--another dear friend of mine for nearly four decades--\nand the discrimination he faced when he came out of the service, having \nlost an arm, and having received the Medal of Honor for this country, \nand was still told in some places in America that he couldn't walk into \ntheir establishment. I am sure each of us can think of times of \ndiscrimination of all sorts.\n  Let's pass legislation that bans all discrimination in the workplace, \nwhatever it is. Until we do that, we will fail to achieve the motto \nengraved in Vermont marble above the Supreme Court building that \ndeclares ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Let's make sure all Americans \nhave the equal rights they deserve.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to come together and support this important \nbipartisan bill without delay, and the other body to have the courage \nto stand up for America--standing up for all Americans, every single \nAmerican--and vote for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gregory Howard Woods, of New York, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of New York.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                        Vote on Brown Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Debra M. Brown, of Mississippi, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. \nMcCaskill), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nBurr), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Senate is about to take another \nhistoric step. Think about it. In 1964 we had the Civil Rights Act. In \n1990--23 years ago--I stood here when we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, which extended civil rights to people with \ndisabilities.\n  Today we are taking one more step to make the American family more \ninclusive and once and for all ban employment discrimination against \ngay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n  This is a historic opportunity for the Senate once again to say that \nwe are all members of the American family. No one should be \ndiscriminated against because of race, sex, religion, or national \norigin. They should not be discriminated against because of who they \nlove, who they are or whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or \ntransgender.\n  This is a historic step for the Senate to take today.\n  I urge a yea vote on the motion to proceed.\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield back time on the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And for 35 years, \nEBRI has been providing just that kind of information. For instance, \nEBRI is a major source of information on how health plan coverage has \nevolved over the years and how employers have responded to market \nchanges. EBRI is also a unique resource on both 401(k) and IRA \nownership, and during the Enron crisis of several years ago, EBRI was \none of the only sources of data on what was happening with company \nstock in 401(k) plans. Because of their expertise and reliability, we \nin Congress frequently ask EBRI's experts to testify at our hearings, \nsince we know we can trust what they have to say.\n  Health and retirement coverage for American families is critically \nimportant to our Nation's future. We are fortunate to have such a \nrespected and reliable source as EBRI to tell us what is happening with \nemployee benefits, and I commend them on their anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/04/senate-section/article/S7794-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7794-S7795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JO KENNEY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, in less than 1 week \nour Nation will commemorate Veterans Day. It is a day that we set aside \nto honor the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces, those \nwho are still among us, as well as those who, sadly, have left us.\n  Today I wish to pay tribute to an American hero, Vicente Ojinaga, who \npassed away on September 30 at the age of 95. Mr. Ojinaga was a valiant \nsoldier, a member of the Army's 200th Coast Artillery Regiment, a \ndefender of Bataan and Corregidor, and a survivor of the Bataan Death \nMarch.\n  During World War II, the courageous defenders of Bataan were an \ninspiration for an embattled nation. The Japanese attack on the \nPhilippines in December of 1941 came just hours after Pearl Harbor. The \nBattling Bastards of Bataan were outnumbered and outsupplied, but for 4 \nintense months they fought on against all odds. In holding off the \nenemy forces longer than expected, they bought the Allies precious time \nto regroup. They were, and always will be, an inspiring reminder of the \ngrit and determination of both Americans and Filipinos.\n  The courage and sacrifice of those brave troops should never be \nforgotten. Their number included 1800 New Mexicans. Many of them were \nalso Hispanic, deployed to the Philippines because of their ability to \nspeak Spanish. They were dedicated to defending the freedoms that we \nall hold dear, at a time when they themselves were treated as second-\nclass citizens.\n  For Mr. Ojinaga and his fellow soldiers, even worse was yet to come \nafter the surrender. Those who survived the Bataan Death March faced \n3\\1/2\\ years of horrific conditions and forced labor in Japanese \nprisons.\n  In an interview with the Santa Fe New Mexican, Mr. Ojinaga's \ndaughter, Teri Gonzales, recalled that her father would sometimes tell \nhis family about his experience during the war, but not in detail. ``We \ndidn't want him to relive the horrible things,'' Mrs. Gonzales \nexplained. ``He said what kept him alive was faith and prayer and his \nfamily, knowing he was going to come back to his family.''\n  Vicente Ojinaga was born on January 22, 1918, in Santa Rita, NM. \nAfter graduation from high school, he worked as a carpenter in the \ncopper mine. When his country called, on the brink of World War II, he \nanswered that call, unequivocally and with a powerful sense of duty. \nWith his passing, we say goodbye to a courageous veteran of the \nlegendary New Mexican survivors of Bataan. Our Nation is forever in \ntheir debt.\n  As his daughter said, despite the horrendous circumstances of his \ncaptivity, Mr. Ojinaga held on to his faith and held on to his hope \nthat someday he would return home, that someday he would see his family \nagain. By the war's end, his body bore the weight of his suffering. \nWhen he was finally released, he weighed only 95 pounds.\n  Like so many of the Bataan survivors, Mr. Ojinaga served his country \nat war but also in peacetime. He married Celia Presciado and together \nthey raised five children. He and his wife purchased a home, with the \nhelp of the GI bill, in the Casa Solana subdivision of Santa Fe. They \nwould live there together for over half a century. Mr. Ojinaga \ngraduated from the University of New Mexico in 1950 with a degree in \nbusiness administration. He worked for the Internal Revenue Service and \nthen for the New Mexico Bureau of Revenue until his retirement in 1978.\n  His daughter recalled to the New Mexican that after his retirement \nMr. Ojinaga was busy with his family and with community service. He was \na Little League coach, volunteered to provide tax counseling to the \nelderly, was president of the Guadalupe Credit Union, and served as a \nEucharistic minister at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. Mr. Ojinaga was \nblessed with a long and eventful life, and he dedicated his life to his \ncountry, to his family, and to his community.\n  Our Nation has lost a brave soldier. We extend to the family our \ndeepest sympathy and our enduring gratitude for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/04/senate-section/article/S7795-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 3204.

A bill to permit the continuation of certain health plans; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a bill I plan to \nintroduce in a few moments, and hopefully we will have a chance or an \nopportunity in the future to debate it because it is a very important \nfix, if you will, to the Affordable Care Act.\n  We debated this bill for literally years--months in committee for \nhours and hours, in daylight and during the evening sessions. There \nwere hundreds of amendments. This bill was built with Democratic input \nand support and Republican input. The Republicans did not vote for the \nbill, but they most certainly had a tremendous amount of impact in the \namendment process.\n  Building a new health care system for this Nation has been very \ndifficult, but it holds a great deal of promise. The Affordable Care \nAct--and the easiest way to explain it--was somewhere between what some \npeople on the left wanted, which was a government-run system, something \nlike Medicare for all--it is appealing, but it is very expensive. We \ncouldn't figure out a cost-effective way to provide that. Members on \nthe right, the more conservative-leaning in this body, wanted to \nprovide savings accounts. This works beautifully for people who have \nmoney to save in the account, but people who live paycheck to paycheck \nand have no money to save would never get any account to be able to \nprovide for their health insurance.\n  Between those two bookends, we debated for a long time about how to \nprovide a market-based approach to insurance. No nation in the world \nhas attempted this. This is a big effort, but it is an important effort \nbecause we are a developed nation. We need to have a healthy workforce. \nIt is about as simple as that. We can't be No. 1 in the world and we \ncan't be the strongest economic power in the world if our people are \nsick and weak. It is as simple as that. We can't be the strongest \neconomic power in the world if our health care system is sapping so \nmuch money out of our economic power--19 percent of the GDP, when Japan \nis 8 percent. We can't expect to beat Japan in economics if we are \npaying almost twice as much for health care and getting less results.\n  We had to change. We did, and we built a market-based approach, \ncontrary to what all of the opponents of the Affordable Care Act say. \nWe built a market-based approach that basically said that if people are \nover 65, they will be on Medicare. We are continuing to reform and \nstrengthen Medicare. There are some very good parts of it, and then \nthere are some weaker parts or difficult parts that need to be \ncorrected. Over time we will continue to streamline, save money, \nprovide better service, more choice, et cetera.\n  People who are among the poorest members of our country--133 percent \nof poverty, which is an income of about $15,000 or less--potentially \nmay not be able to find a good-paying full-time job or perhaps didn't \nreceive the education others received, perhaps have some disability, \nthey would go on Medicaid. Then everyone in between the lowest income \nand under the age of 65 is in a private health care system, which is a \nmarket-based system, with competition driving prices down.\n  The idea would be that there would be 20, 30, 40 health care plans \noffered in every State. People could choose what they want with a \nminimum bronze, silver, or gold plan with many choices. That is the \npromise; that is the hope; that is the idea. The great promise of this \nis that if someone has cancer, they can't be dropped. If they have \ndiabetes, they can't be turned away. Everyone is covered, the risk is \nspread, the price comes down, and the free market operates. We would \nnever know that based upon the criticism we hear on television and \nradio all day long, but this is the truth.\n  One of the important components of that bill that many of us talked \nabout was the fact that if someone had individual insurance on the \nmarket, they could keep it. What is happening now, unfortunately, \nbecause of the grandfather provision in the Affordable Care Act, in my \nview--this may not be shared by everyone on the floor--it was not \nwritten as tightly as it should have been, as clearly as it should have \nbeen. The bill I am introducing today, Keeping the Affordable Care Act \nPromise Act, will clarify this grandfather clause in the Affordable \nCare Act so that it will clearly say that if a person has an insurance \nplan they like, if it is what they want and can afford, they can keep \nit. This bill, if it passes, will help anywhere from 5 to 7 million \npeople who are getting notices in the mail every day like the one I \nwill read into the Record, which was sent to someone in my State.\n\n       Thank you for your support of Vantage Health Plan, Inc. \n     (\"Vantage'') over recent years. It has been our pleasure to \n     serve you and we hope that you have been satisfied as a \n     Vantage member.\n       In light of recent changes in the health insurance \n     industry, Vantage will be discontinuing our offering of \n     Grandfathered Individual plans, effective January 4, 2014. \n     This discontinuance will affect your policy.\n       Vantage is pleased to announce the availability of several \n     new individual products in 2014:\n       Beginning in January 2014, you will have the option to \n     enroll into a new plan through the Health Insurance \n     Marketplace (or the Exchange). Members enrolling into \n     Individual plans through the Marketplace may be eligible for \n     premium and/or cost sharing subsidies.\n\n  This is because everyone in Louisiana with a family income of up to \n$90,000 a year will have some sort of premium support, which will be a \ngreat help to many of our middle-class families.\n  Continuing:\n\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n\n       Many of the Marketplace plans will provide you with more \n     generous coverage than your current Grandfathered Individual \n     plan. We invite you to visit Vantage online at \n     www.VantageHealthPlan.com/marketplace to review our Exchange \n     plan offerings. You may also enroll online at \n     www.Healthcare.gov, by calling (800) 318-2596 or by \n     contacting your agent or broker.\n       In addition to the Exchange plan offerings, Vantage will \n     have several new plan offerings available outside of the \n     Exchange for 2014. These plans are similar to your current \n     Freedom or High Deductible plan. We will have more \n     information on those plan options later this Fall.\n\n  This is the letter thousands of people are receiving. This letter \nshould have never gone out. We said to people that if they have \ninsurance they like, they can keep it. We didn't say that if they have \ninsurance they like that doesn't meet the standards or that meets the \nminimum standards, they can keep it. We said and the President said \nover and over that if people have insurance and they like the insurance \nthey have, they can keep it. That is my bill. That is the single focus \nof my bill. It is not to undermine the Affordable Care Act; it is to \nstrengthen it and to keep our promise to the millions of Americans to \nwhom we said if they have insurance, they can keep what they have. If \nthey don't, there is a new marketplace where they and their families \ncan go and choose among a variety of different plans.\n  Depending on their income, they may have support from their community \nor from the government. If someone is extremely poor, we can provide \noptions for them through Medicaid. It is not as desirable as through \nprivate insurance, but many Governors, including some Republican \nGovernors, are being very creative with their Medicaid plans and \nactually changing them into more of a private-like insurance model. \nThere is great flexibility in how Governors who have good hearts and \ngood intentions are using their Medicaid dollars wisely.\n  Having said that, having reread the grandfather clause, having looked \nat it very closely, I have determined that this is the best course to \nintroduce this bill, which I will do later this evening to actually \nfile it. Again, it has two simple directives:\n  No. 1, all insurance companies shall continue to offer grandfather \nplans that were in effect prior to a certain date.\n  No. 2, every insurance company that provided those grandfather plans \nhas to explain to those policyholders how their current plan falls \nshort of the new standard on the market and what might be available to \nthem that is better, but they are not forced to buy it.\n  So I hope we can debate this. Unlike many on the other side who want \nto tear the act down and repeal it, to defund it--they even took the \nwhole Federal Government hostage and the whole economy of the United \nStates hostage because of it--or that is what they tried to do. They \nfailed, thank goodness, and the hostages have been released. The \ngovernment is back up and operating. There are some of us who are \nsincere about supporting the concepts of this bill, the promise of this \nbill, which is extraordinary and historic. We recognize there are some \npieces of it that need to be fixed or tightened or tweaked to make sure \nit is going to work in the future as we have said.\n  Again, that is simply what my bill does. I am happy to introduce it. \nI have one cosponsor, Senator Manchin of West Virginia, but many others \nhave expressed their interest in working with me, and I look forward to \nbringing this before the committee for full debate and hopefully to the \nSenate floor in some way in the near future for debate and hopefully \nfor passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1643. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \na two-year extension of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation to reauthorize the Veterans' Advisory Committee on \nEducation, a panel that provides much needed assistance to our Nation's \nveterans by advising the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on existing VA \neducation benefit programs, new education initiatives, and long-range \neducation planning and development. This legislation is entitled the \nVeterans Advisory Committee on Education Improvement Act, and I wish to \nthank my colleague, Senator Inhofe, for joining me in this effort.\n  I am proud to introduce this companion bill to House-passed \nlegislation which was introduced by Representatives John Delaney and \nJim Renacci and 12 other Members. This bill will reauthorize the \nVeterans' Advisory Committee on Education through December 31, 2015, \nand it expands the make-up of the Committee to include post 9/11 \nveterans. Absent Congressional action, the Advisory Committee's \nauthority will sunset on December 31, 2013. In addition to preserving \nits traditional role, our bill will require the Advisory Committee to \nexpand its reach to include veterans who served after September 11, \n2001. Currently, the Committee only provides assistance for veterans \nwho served through the Persian Gulf War. The Committee is particularly \ninterested in ensuring that educational opportunities are available to \neligible veterans and enabling them to readjust to civilian life and \nbecome members of a highly educated and productive work force. The \nCommittee focuses on improving the benefits provided by the GI Bill.\n  I believe that a true marker of our Nation's worth is our willingness \nto serve those who have served us. As we continue to wind down our \ncommitments in Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war, we need to \ngear up our commitment to our veterans. This legislation will ensure \nthat the brave men and women who serve our country in the armed \nservices receive the most effective education and training \nopportunities available. I am proud of the support that organizations \nhave provided in this effort. The Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, MOAA, Students Veterans Association, SVA, Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, IAVA, and Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, have \nprovided invaluable insight in crafting this\n  I am committed to making sure that our veterans receive the services \nand benefits they earned, and the support they were promised and \ndeserve. The United States is the strongest nation in the world and we \nowe veterans our gratitude and our respect. This legislation is just a \nsmall token of how Congress can help veterans have all the tools they \nneed, including education and job training, to ensure an easier \ntransition to civilian life. By making sure that post 9/11 veterans \nhave a voice at the VA this legislation encourages more effective and \nefficient government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
