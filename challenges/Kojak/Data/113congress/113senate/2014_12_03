The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                   Lance Corporal Chadwick A. Gilliam\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, I rise to share with my \ncolleagues the story of one brave marine from Kentucky who lost his \nlife while wearing our country's uniform.\n  LCpl Chadwick A. Gilliam of Mayking, KY, passed away on January 3, \n2009, of an apparent cardiac arrest at Camp Buehring, Kuwait. He was 29 \nyears old.\n  For his service in uniform, Lance Corporal Gilliam received several \nmedals, awards, and decorations, including the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Chris Damron, Chad's brother-in-law, recalls how Chad was happy to \nenlist. ``He'd said that it was just something he wanted to do,'' Chris \nsays. ``All his life he wanted to be a Marine.''\n  Before entering the U.S. Marine Corps, Chad graduated from Whitesburg \nHigh School in the mid-1990s. After earning his bachelor's degree, he \nalso graduated from Lindsay\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nWilson College with a master's degree in counseling and human \ndevelopment.\n  One of his former high school teachers, Scottie Billiter, said \nGilliam was an inspiration to other students. Billiter remembers that \nChad had a wide array of interests, from the football team to the \nSpanish club. ``I have nothing but great, fond memories of him,'' \nBilliter says. ``He was a big part of who we were.''\n  As a marine, Chad continued to be a natural inspiration to others. \n``All the Marines seemed to really look up to Chad,'' says brother-in-\nlaw Chris Damron. ``He was a leader in the Marine Corps.''\n  Chad was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine \nDivision, Second Marine Expeditionary Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, \nNC. He was an infantryman and joined the unit in June 2007. He was \npromoted to lance corporal in 2008 and deployed to Iraq in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  We are thinking of Chad's family as I share his story with my Senate \ncolleagues, particularly his parents Paul Gilliam and Mary Ellen Cook \nGilliam, his wife Corinne Marie Stewart Gilliam, his sister Paula \nRegina Damron, his brother Michael Wayne Gilliam, his brother-in-law \nChris Damron, along with many other beloved family members and friends. \nChad was preceded in death by his paternal grandparents Willard and \nBelvia Holbrook Gilliam and his maternal grandparents Arlie and Edna \nSergent Cook.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in expressing gratitude and \nsympathy to the family of LCpl Chadwick A. Gilliam--gratitude for his \nlife of service and sympathy for his ultimate sacrifice. Without brave \nmen and women such as Lance Corporal Gilliam to defend our country, we \nwould not be free. Those of us who cherish our freedoms must never ever \nforget that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Charlotte \nBurrows to be a commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, or EEOC, and David Lopez to continue to serve as the \nagency's general counsel.\n  These are two eminently qualified nominees. Mr. Lopez is a dedicated \npublic servant who has spent over two decades protecting people from \nworkplace discrimination. He did an admirable job during his first \nterm, and was responsible for marked improvements in both the agency's \nlitigation program and in its outreach to stakeholders.\n  Ms. Burrows has also had a distinguished career in public service. \nShe is currently Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of \nJustice, and previously served as general counsel for Civil and \nConstitutional Rights for Senator Kennedy and the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. She is a leading expert in the field of \ndiscrimination law, and she has proven herself committed to public \nservice.\n  Both of these nominees deserve to be confirmed by the Senate. And our \nNation needs public servants of their caliber and experience at the \nEEOC, which has the critical mission of protecting working Americans \nfrom workplace discrimination.\n  Throughout my career I have been guided by the vision of an America \nthat is compassionate, just, and inclusive--a society where the \ngovernment provides a ladder, or sometimes a ramp--of opportunity that \ngives every American a fair shot at the American dream. However, that \nladder cannot function properly if there are barriers of discrimination \nthat unfairly limit opportunities for some Americans to fully \nparticipate in the social, political, and economic life of this Nation.\n  Over the last 50 years, we have made great strides towards \neliminating discrimination in the workplace. The Civil Rights Act of \n1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national \norigin and religion. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, in 1967, \nprohibited discrimination on the basis of age. The Americans with \nDisabilities Act, in 1990, and the ADA Amendments Act, in 2008, \nprohibited discrimination on the basis of disability.\n  These important guarantees, however, are not self-enforcing. They are \nonly as strong as the agency charged with enforcing them, the EEOC. The \nEEOC's mission is simple and profoundly important--to promote equality \nof opportunity in the workplace and enforce Federal laws prohibiting \nemployment discrimination.\n  While much progress has been made in recent decades, discrimination \nin the workplace continues to be all too common. Too many employment \ndecisions are based on insidious stereotypes and prejudices rather than \nan employee's talent, ability, and qualifications. Too many hardworking \nAmericans face the harsh reality of getting a pink slip or not being \nhired at all because of race, sex, national origin, religion, age, \ndisability or some other irrelevant factor.\n  The realities are especially harsh for individuals with disabilities. \nLess than 30 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities \nparticipate in the workforce, and households with an adult member with \na disability earn 38.4 percent less than households without an adult \nmember who has a disability. These facts make it clear that people with \ndisabilities are still encountering roadblocks, and that the ADA's goal \nof economic self-sufficiency is far from achieved.\n  The EEOC has an important role to play in combating discrimination \nand supporting employment opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities and for all Americans.\n  Unfortunately, today's EEOC faces enormous challenges. The agency has \na substantial backlog of almost 71,000 cases. And it takes an average \nof 267 days to process a discrimination claim. The truth is that the \nEEOC suffers from chronic underfunding, and this underfunding has \nresulted in a significant reduction in full-time employees. Under this \nadministration, the agency has made real progress moving investigations \nforward in a timely manner, but all too often justice delayed is \njustice denied.\n  American workers deserve better, especially in these times of \neconomic turmoil, when discrimination often increases and workers who \nare victims of discrimination face even greater challenges. Now more \nthan ever, we need strong leadership at the EEOC. The nominees are both \nextremely well-qualified and have a deep commitment to public service. \nThey possess the extraordinary skills and experience that will help \nthem advance the EEOC's mission and ensure proper enforcement of \ncritically important laws.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have raised \nconcerns that EEOC is too quick to bring lawsuits. That is just not the \ncase. Litigation is a last resort for the agency, and represents less \nthan 0.5 percent of all charges filed and only around 5 percent of \ncharges where the commission has issued a cause finding.\n  The EEOC under this administration has made enormous strides in \nimproving the conciliation process. In the last 3 years, the EEOC \nimproved its conciliation results significantly with successful \nconciliations now at a rate of 41 percent of all cases that are \nconciliated, up from 31 percent in fiscal year 2011. It is important to \nremember that EEOC v. CRST, the case so often cited as evidence that \nthe agency isn't doing enough in the conciliation process, was a case \nbrought by a Bush administration-appointed general counsel.\n  My Republican colleagues also criticize the Commission for delegating \nthe prosecution of routine cases to the general counsel. There is \nabsolutely nothing inappropriate about that practice, and it should not \nbe a controversial issue. It is a practical measure to make sure the \nCommissioners are focusing on the most important issues and have ample \nopportunity to deliberate on broader policy issues. That is why the \nEEOC's delegation policy has been carried forward across multiple \nadministrations and has bipartisan support from both Republican and \nDemocratic Commissioners.\n  Now, I think we can all agree that there have been some unacceptable \ninstances where courts have required the EEOC to pay attorney's fees \nfor a defendant. But those cases are rare and\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\nneed to be viewed in perspective. Out of the 1,045 lawsuits filed from \nfiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013, there have only been seven \nin which fees have been assessed, and two of those are pending an \nappeal. Generally, the EEOC is prudent and successful in litigation, \nand the agency has won 11 out of 16 trials from fiscal year 2013 to the \npresent.\n  I want to comment on another issue that came up at the HELP Committee \nhearing on these nominees--the EEOC's work with regard to wellness \nprograms. I am a strong supporter of wellness programs, and I was \nintimately involved in drafting the section of the Affordable Care Act \nthat encourages such programs. Recently, the EEOC has been involved in \nlitigation involving wellness programs, and I think a lot of people are \ntrying to cloud the issue here. The EEOC has never--never--taken the \nposition that wellness programs are illegal. They are, however, \ninvestigating extreme cases where employers have allegedly forced their \nemployees to participate in programs that require medical testing. That \nraises Americans with Disabilities Act issues, and the EEOC is right to \nlook carefully at the issue. Plus, the agency has indicated that it \nintends to issue guidance next year to help employers and employees \nnavigate the tricky legal issues.\n  One final point, none of the manufactured concerns coming from the \nother side of the aisle have anything to do with the ability of these \ntwo nominees to do the job for which they were nominated. No one has \nquestioned their qualifications. Both Ms. Burrows and Mr. Lopez are \neminently qualified. Some of my Republican colleagues just do not like \nthe fact that the EEOC is doing its job and enforcing our Nation's \ncivil rights laws. That is a shame because civil rights should not be a \npartisan issue. We should all be coming together to support the agency \nand the important role it plays in making fairer, more equal \nworkplaces.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both of these distinguished nominees \nand confirm them quickly so they can get to work ensuring fairness and \nequal opportunity for every American worker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all cloture time has \nexpired.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote on the Burrows nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't know of anybody seeking \nrecognition. I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time having been yielded back, the question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Charlotte A. Burrows, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be a Member of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission?\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

DAVID LOPEZ TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE EQUAL \n                   EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Lopez nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of P. David Lopez, of \nArizona, to be General Counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the nomination.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today we are voting on the nomination \nof P. David Lopez to serve as general counsel of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission. The EEOC is an important agency with a critical \ntask.\n  In August 1963, I stood in the crowd on the National Mall and \nlistened to Dr. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech when he \ncalled for our Nation to ``make real the promises of democracy.''\n  The next year, the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, \nestablishing the EEOC as an important, independent agency to put an end \nto workplace discrimination, particularly in hiring, firing, and \npromoting.\n  Today, employees are protected by law if they are discriminated \nagainst because of race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national \norigin, age, disability, or genetic information.\n  The EEOC is charged with investigating complaints of discrimination \nto determine whether or not they have merit, and then attempting to \nresolve them informally, through conciliation and mediation.\n  The general counsel at the EEOC has a great deal of responsibility--\nhe or she is in charge of conducting litigation at this important \nagency.\n  Mr. Lopez is being re-nominated for the general counsel position. I \ndo not believe he has fulfilled his charge over the last four and one-\nhalf years and will not support extending his time at the agency. I \nwould strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this nomination as \nwell.\n  It is critical that the general counsel make wise decisions about \nwhich cases to litigate and how. Unfortunately, Mr. Lopez, often has \nfailed to meet this standard.\n  I have three primary concerns about the EEOC.\n  First, EEOC has placed too much emphasis on litigating high profile \nlawsuits, some of which have been rebuked by the courts, rather than \nresolving its backlog of discrimination charges filed by individuals.\n  Second, EEOC has not been fully transparent in how it issues guidance \nto the public and in the information it shares with the public about \nits activities.\n  And third, EEOC is suing employers for following the President's very \nown health care law.\n  On the first concern, a judicious general counsel should view costly \nand time-consuming litigation as a last resort. However, this EEOC has \nplaced too great an emphasis on litigating high-profile cases, some of \nwhich have been rebuked by the courts, rather than resolving its \nbacklog of discrimination charges filed by individuals.\n  In fiscal year 2014, more than 88,000 charges of discrimination were \nfiled with the EEOC and at the end of November 2014, EEOC reported it \nhad 75,935 unresolved discrimination charges pending.\n  A backlog of charges pending is nothing new for EEOC, but given this \nbacklog, I am disappointed that this EEOC has placed such a strong \nemphasis on actions and lawsuits--predicated upon not a single \ncomplaint--that do not address actual charges of discrimination brought \nto the Agency by employees.\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n  Under this administration, the EEOC has focused too heavily on \nheadline-making lawsuits at the expense of fair and swift resolution of \nclaims for those alleging workplace discrimination.\n  The desire to win big lawsuits has backfired. Numerous Federal courts \nhave criticized EEOC's litigation practices, failure to attempt to \nresolve cases and avoid court, misuse of authority, and reliance on \nfaulty expert analysis, among other complaints.\n  Example No. 1--EEOC's case against Kaplan Higher Education \nCorporation received such a sharp rejection by a unanimous three-judge \npanel on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014 that The Wall \nStreet Journal named it the ``Opinion of the Year.''\n  EEOC sued Kaplan for alleged race discrimination due to the use of \ncredit background checks. The court wrote, ``EEOC brought this case on \nthe basis of a homemade methodology, crafted by a witness with no \nparticular expertise to craft it, administered by persons with no \nparticular expertise to administer it, tested by no one, and accepted \nonly by the witness himself.'' The court also criticized EEOC for \nbringing a case against Kaplan for ``using the same type of background \ncheck that the EEOC itself uses.''\n  Example No. 2--Another Federal court reprimanded EEOC for being \n``negligent in its discovery obligations, dilatory in cooperating with \ndefense counsel, and somewhat cavalier in its responsibility to the \nUnited States District Court.''\n  Example No. 3--EEOC caused a small employer to spend $100,000 \nattempting to comply with requests for information that, according to a \nFederal judge, ``EEOC had no authority to obtain.''\n  Since 2011, EEOC has been ordered to pay attorney's fees in 10 \ndifferent cases. In six cases, fees were awarded under a rare step \nallowed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which according to the \nU.S. Supreme Court is reserved for cases that are ``frivolous, \nunreasonable, or without foundation'' or ``continued to [be] \nlitigate[d]'' after those circumstances became present.\n  In the four other cases, the court awarded fees for failing to \nprevent the destruction of evidence, for discovery abuses and for \npursuing a case that lacked substantial justification.\n  Not all of these cases where EEOC was ordered to pay attorney's fees \nwere initiated on this general counsel's watch, but he did initiate \nfive of them and it appears he continued to pursue four of them. These \ncourt losses cost taxpayers and hurt the victims of workplace \ndiscrimination whose charges are backlogged at EEOC.\n  EEOC's credibility is at risk. As one commissioner described, EEOC's \n``reputation and credibility has . . . suffered from several recent \nlawsuits where [EEOC was] not only sanctioned, but openly chastised by \nthe courts.''\n  EEOC should immediately reconsider the strong emphasis on lawsuits \nthat are not based on any complaint and do not even have a victim \nplaintiff.\n  In recent years, EEOC has pursued a number of cases without \ncomplaints, such as age discrimination cases against large accounting \nfirms--PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, and KPMG--whose partners have \nvoluntarily adopted a mandatory retirement age.\n  Age discrimination is certainly a significant problem that EEOC \nshould work to address. But they should go about it by assisting the \nmore than 21,000 people who complained to EEOC of age discrimination in \n2013, rather than directing investigations at an industry they find \nsuspect.\n  The five-member Commission has exercised too little restraint over \nthe general counsel. In 1995, the EEOC's then Commissioners gave the \ngeneral counsel far more authority to bring whatever cases he wanted, \nwith no check from the Commission. By 2012, this practice led to only 3 \nof the 122 lawsuits filed that year coming before the Commission for \napproval. Although EEOC has taken some steps to increase the \nCommission's role in approving litigation, more should be done. The \nCommission has the authority and duty to reverse this imprudent \ndecision and return to performing its statutorily obligated \nresponsibilities.\n  On my second concern, I believe the Commission has not been \ntransparent in its issuance of guidance and the information it shares \nwith the public about its activities. The EEOC sets national workplace \ndiscrimination policy by issuing formal regulations as well as \nguidance, which are meant to help employers and employees understand \nhow the law applies to them. EEOC does not allow the public to review \nor comment upon its draft guidance, even in cases of novel, significant \nor controversial guidance.\n  This is especially concerning because in two cases last year, the \nSupreme Court rejected substantive positions found in EEOC guidance. \nEEOC's issuance of guidance is not in compliance with the \nadministration's own best practices recommendations or the \nrecommendations of three of the current Commissioners.\n  I am concerned about this because agencies expect people to follow \nguidance. At a hearing in June, I asked the head of the Office for \nCivil Rights at the Department of Education whether she expected higher \neducation institutions to comply with the Office for Civil Rights \nguidance and she said yes.\n  Senator Enzi also urged greater transparency on significant guidance \nwhen he was ranking member of the HELP Committee, and I share his view.\n  So what harm would come from allowing the public to comment on draft \nguidance prior to issuing it?\n  Finally, my third concern about EEOC and its general counsel, Mr. \nLopez, is this. Employer wellness plans with premium discounts were \nspecifically authorized in the health care law and I worked on it with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle--it was one of the few \nprovisions of Obamacare with Republican and Democrat buy in.\n  I am concerned that EEOC has pursued litigation against employers who \nhave followed the health care law and implemented voluntary employer \nwellness plans to encourage healthy lifestyle choices.\n  These wellness plan lawsuits are sending a confusing message to \nemployers--reliance on the health care law's authorization of wellness \nplans does not mean you would not be sued by the EEOC.\n  This is why I intend to introduce legislation to prevent EEOC from \nsuing employers who are following the law in offering wellness \nprograms. Employers who are acting in good faith, relying on a law \nshould not face uncertainty of litigation due to an agency's misguided \npriorities.\n  EEOC is tasked with an important mission--to ensure workplaces are \nfree from discrimination. EEOC's misdirected focus and high-profile \nlitigation failures are coming at significant cost to taxpayers and \nvictims of workplace discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, when questioned about these missteps and the Agency's \nfocus on litigation without a single complaint, Mr. Lopez was not \nforthcoming with his answers. Therefore, I cannot support Mr. Lopez's \nnomination.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of P.

Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n              Authorization for the Use of Military Force\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, next Monday will mark 4 months since the \nPresident commenced military action in Syria and Iraq against ISIL. As \nof December 2, Operation Inherent Resolve, which the administration \ncalls a war on ISIL, has involved more than 1,100 coalition airstrikes \nin Iraq and Syria, the vast majority carried out by American air men \nand women. The President has authorized currently 1,400 U.S. ground \ntroops who are deployed in Iraq to train and advise regional forces. \nThe President has authorized an additional 1,500 U.S. troops to serve \nin that train-and-advise capacity. This past Monday, 250 paratroopers \nfrom the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC, were sent to Iraq. \nThe total cost of the operation thus far to U.S. taxpayers is in excess \nof $1 billion.\n  There have been three deaths of Americans serving in Operation \nInherent Resolve. On October 1, Marine Cpl Jordan Spears of Memphis, \nTN, was lost at sea while conducting flight operations over the Persian \nGulf. On October 23, Marine LCpl Sean Neal of Riverside, CA, died in \nIraq. On December 1, Air Force Capt. William Dubois of Newcastle, CO, \ndied in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.\n  Senator King and I visited Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in October to \nsee the Combined Air Operations Center in action, and I saw many \nVirginians there working with colleagues from all service branches and \nmany other coalition nations in directing the air strike campaign.\n  Let's not make any mistake about this--America is at war. The number \nof air and ground troops deployed is steadily creeping upwards every \nday. Our troops are dying. And the fiscal cost to American taxpayers is \ngrowing every day.\n  But this is a most unusual war. While all the activities of war are \noccurring, there is a strange conspiracy of silence about it in the \nWhite House and in the Halls of Congress.\n  The President has not offered any proposed authorization for the war, \ndespite his suggestions that one is needed. Congress has not debated \non, taken committee action on, or voted on the ongoing war. The House \nis contemplating adjourning for the holidays on December 11, without \nsaying anything about an ongoing war. And because neither the President \nnor Congress has undertaken the necessary public debate over the war, \nthe American public has not had the chance to be fully educated about \nwhat is at stake and why it is in our international interest to ask our \ntroops to risk their lives thousands of miles away.\n  We owe it to our troops serving abroad--troops who are engaged in war \neven as we think about recessing and leaving Washington on December 11 \nfor the holidays--to do our job and to have a debate and vote about the \nwar that our Constitution demands.\n  Let me make an earnest request to our President and to my colleagues \nin Congress.\n  To the President: I have previously taken the floor to strongly argue \nthat the President needs new legal authority to conduct the war on \nISIL.\n  When the President spoke to the Nation on September 10, he said that \nhe would ``welcome'' a congressional authorization. And on November 5, \nhe affirmatively asserted that a new congressional authorization was \nneeded and that he would ``engage'' Congress\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\nin passing one. But to this date, 4 months after the initiation of war, \nthe administration has not even been willing to present a draft \nauthorization of the mission to Congress.\n  In testimony yesterday at the Armed Services Committee, no DOD \nwitness could recall a single other instance in which a President told \nCongress of the need for a war but failed to present a proposed \nauthorization spelling out the dimensions of the military mission.\n  Instead, the President has persisted in a war that is not within the \nscope of his Article II powers, that is not authorized by any treaty \nobligation, that is not justified under either of the congressional \nauthorizations passed in 2001 or 2002. The President's unilateral \naction has even extended beyond the 60- and 90-day timing requirements \ncreated by the War Powers Resolution of 1973.\n\n  The President's willingness to push a war without engaging Congress \nhas even violated his own solemn and wise pronouncement of just 1 year \nago:\n\n       I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts \n     with the support of Congress. This is especially true after a \n     decade that put more and more war-making powers in the hands \n     of the President--while sidelining the people's \n     representatives from the critical decisions about when we use \n     force.\n\n  So I request our President: Make good on your promise to engage \nCongress. Do what other Presidents have done--demand that we debate and \nvote on an authorization, and that we do it now.\n  The votes are here in this body to support the President. I am a \nsupporter of the need for military action against ISIL, and I know that \nis a position held by a strong majority of the Senate and a strong \nmajority of the House. There is no reason for the President to not \ndemand that we actually have that debate and have that vote.\n  To my congressional colleagues, I have a similar request. Let's not \nleave this Capitol without a debate and a vote on this war on ISIL. We \nhave gone 4 months without any meaningful action about this war.\n  First, we were told that Congress would get to it after the midterm \nelections, and so we recessed for 7 weeks in the middle of a war \nwithout saying one thing--shirking our constitutional duties. Now many \nare saying we need to delay until after New Year's before having any \nmeaningful discussion of this war. So the unilateral war would extend \nto at least 5 months--and, in all likelihood, longer--before Congress \ngets around to any meaningful discussion of the ISIL threat and what we \nshould do to counter it.\n  Giving this President--giving any President--a green light to wage \nunilateral war for 5 or 6 months without any meaningful debate or \nauthorization would be deeply destructive of the legitimacy of the \nlegislative branch of our government; it would be deeply disrespectful \nof our citizens; and it would be especially disrespectful of the troops \nwho are risking their lives every day while we do nothing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                          Power to Declare War\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, Senator Kaine has spoken eloquently about \nevents of today. I wish to speak for a few moments about events of 200-\nplus years ago.\n  On Tuesday, August 17, 1787, at the Constitutional Convention in \nPhiladelphia, the delegates debated the question of war. They debated \nit passionately and with a sense of history and human nature. They \nunderstood the propensity of the Executive--any Executive throughout \nhistory, a prince, a king, a potentate, a sultan--to lead their country \ninto war for good reasons or no good reasons. They understood that this \nwas a basic question before the body--before the Constitutional \nConvention, and I would assert that the Framers knew what they were \ndoing.\n  Interestingly, in the first draft of the Constitution, the clause in \narticle I, section 8 that says the Congress shall have the power to \ndeclare war, said: The Congress shall have the power to make war. That \nwas the first draft.\n  The debate was about whether Congress could effectively make and \nexecute war. They wisely, I believe, realized that was impractical, \ngiven the nature of Congress and the large number of representatives, \nand the exigencies of war. So they left the power to the Commander in \nChief, to the Chief Executive. They also recognized the Chief \nExecutive's inherent power to repel an attack on this country. But in \nall other cases what the Constitution says is very clear. Article 1, \nsection 8, says the Congress shall declare war. There was some \ndiscussion about this. Some people said, well, we don't want to tie the \nhands of the Executive, but others made it more clear.\n\n  Madison's notes are a fascinating source of information about the \nhistory of the Constitution. The notes were taken the day of the debate \non Tuesday, August 17, 1787. Mr. Ellsworth of Connecticut stated that \n``it should be more easy to get out of war than into it.'' He \nunderstood this principle.\n  Pierce Butler of South Carolina said the Executive should have the \npower to repel sudden attacks. That is common sense. But then Elbridge \nGerry of Massachusetts, I think, put it most succinctly. He said, ``I \nnever expected to hear in a Republic a motion to empower the Executive \nalone to declare war.'' That is the fundamental issue that is before us \ntoday.\n  Then George Mason of Virginia later in the debate used a wonderful \nphrase that I think aptly captures what the Framers were after. He \nsaid: ``I am for flogging rather than facilitating war.'' That is what \nwe are supposed to do, is to debate, discuss, and have the people \nengaged in the discussion before this country is committed to war.\n  The Constitution in the Preamble makes it very clear that one of the \nfundamental purposes of this government or any government is to provide \nfor the common defense. Nobody questions that. Neither Senator Kaine \nnor myself nor anyone else who is talking about this issue questions, \nA, whether we should be debating it and, B, that it is our solemn \nresponsibility to provide for the common defense. I happen to think, as \nSenator Kaine does, that the fight against ISIL is worthy of national \nattention, worthy of national effort, and should be debated and \ncircumscribed through some form of authorization in this body. There \nhas not been a declaration of war by the Congress since 1942.\n  I will conclude with the observation that power doesn't spring from \none branch of our government to the other overnight or in some flash of \ninspiration or change. I would argue more aptly it oozes from one \nbranch to the other, not necessarily through Executive usurpation as \nthrough congressional application. For us to go home, to take a recess, \nto say: We don't really want to be talking about this, we don't want to \nbe responsible for this, I think is unfair to the American people. It \nis unfair to the people who are being put into harm's way. It is unfair \nand not responsive to the basic principles of the Constitution.\n  We owe it to our country to have this debate, and it is one that I \nbelieve is important and is constitutionally based. We are very good in \nCongress about not making decisions and then criticizing the Executive \nfor what they do. This is an opportunity where we have the power, the \nconstitutional power and the constitutional responsibility to discuss, \ndebate, and authorize the Executive's actions against this terrible \nfoe. I believe it is our responsibility to do so. To not do so is \nsimply one more sliding away, one more giving away of our \nconstitutional authority to the Executive that I think is in detriment \nnot only to the Constitution itself, clearly, but also to the interests \nof the American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, ever since November 4--this last \nelection, some 3 or so weeks ago--a number of people have speculated as \nto what a new Republican majority in the Senate will mean for the \ncountry. We will be working together with our Republican colleagues in \nthe House and with the President, who has hopefully heard the message \nthe American people sent him on November 4. He was the one who said it \nwas his policies that were on the\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nballot. I believe the vote by the American people came through pretty \nloud and clear as to what they thought of those policies. It was pretty \nclear that they want a new direction.\n  When people ask me what my constituents expect--my 26.5 million \nconstituents in Texas--I tell them they want us to demonstrate that we \ncan govern. They want us to demonstrate that we can actually solve some \nof the problems confronting our country. Those problems primarily deal \nwith how we unleash the American economy, get it growing again to \ncreate jobs and opportunity so people can find work, provide for their \nfamilies, and pursue their dreams.\n  I believe that is what Senator Schumer was saying the other day at \nthe National Press Club. We need to focus on the needs of the middle \nclass and the wage earners. They are seeing stagnant wages. While \nhealth care, energy, and other costs go up, their paychecks are \nshrinking. As a result, they are having to live on less, which is not \nthe American dream most people have bargained for.\n  The truth is no political party or branch of government can govern on \nits own. The fact is that even though we have a Republican majority in \nthe House and Senate, we still have a divided government, with \nPresident Obama in the White House--and he is not constitutionally \nirrelevant. In fact, he is critical in terms of actually getting things \ndone.\n  My hope is that we can find issues we can work on together. I believe \nRepublicans and Democrats can vote to put legislation on the \nPresident's desk, but then he has a choice to make--either to sign that \nlegislation into law or veto it. We then have a decision to make as to \nwhether we want to try--and whether we can--override his veto.\n  The truth is none of us can govern on our own. What has been \ntroubling to me--since the election--is that President Obama seems to \nthink he can govern on his own without regard for the Congress. Now, \npart of the consequences are the debates going on in the House and here \nin the Senate about the appropriate response to what has been widely \nseen as an overreach by the President--particularly when it comes to \nhis Executive action on immigration, which circumvented the Congress. \nHe acted as though he could do this alone without any consequence.\n  We know one thing for sure, and that is the President cannot \nappropriate money, which is why we are now having this discussion. But \nthere will be other ramifications and consequences as well. I hope one \nof those consequences is not that we fall back into the dysfunction we \nhave experienced over the last few years where we find ourselves \nincapable of working together and getting things done. All we can do is \nall we can do. As a Senate--as a Congress--we can't make the President \ndo anything he is bound and determined not to do, but we can do our \njob.\n  I and others have said: Well, with a new majority in the Senate, we \nhave to show we can govern. The truth is we can't govern by ourselves. \nThe President can't govern by himself, and we can't govern by \nourselves. That is the constitutional separation of powers and the \ndivision of responsibility that we must embrace together.\n  I don't know where the President has gotten this idea that he thinks \nhe can govern on his own. For 225 years our constitutional norms have \nsaid otherwise, and experience has shown otherwise. If we want to make \nreal progress on improving our broken immigration system--we actually \nsaw a bill passed out of the Senate. The President said he is \nfrustrated with the timetable in the House. But there continues to be a \nbipartisan desire, I believe, to fix our broken immigration system.\n  If we want to reform our Tax Code, I think that is something we ought \nto be getting to work on. The fact of the matter is we have the highest \ntax rate in the world. That is making America less competitive in terms \nof attracting investment and jobs. It discourages multinational \ncorporations headquartered in the United States from bringing back the \nmoney they have earned overseas because they don't want to have to pay \ntaxes twice--for what they have earned on their income overseas and \nthen pay double again when they bring that money back home. We ought to \nlook at what kind of Tax Code makes sense for us and incentivizes \ninvestment and job creation in the United States and not be content \nwith a system that discourages that.\n\n  I believe there is bipartisan support for doing what we can to shore \nup Medicare and Social Security. We have all seen the numbers--the \naging baby boomers and more and more people retiring. Unfortunately, \nthese young people are being left holding the bag. We are going to be \nOK--people my age and my generation--but future generations will not be \nOK unless we do our job now to deal with Medicare and Social Security \nand make them sustainable into the future.\n  What I feel has been most discouraging is health care. Whether you \nsupported the Affordable Care Act or were a skeptic, such as I was, I \nthink by and large the evidence is that it didn't work the way the \npeople who were the biggest cheerleaders thought it would work.\n  One little factoid that jumped out at me yesterday in the Wall Street \nJournal is that between 2007 and 2013 the average cost for middle-class \nfamilies for their health care went up 24 percent. That is part of what \nhas made this wage stagnation even worse because people are actually \npaying more for items such as health care. If there is one thing we \nought to all be able to agree on is that what makes health care more \navailable and accessible to more people is when it is more affordable. \nUnfortunately, the Affordable Care Act did not do that.\n  Well, I mentioned my disappointment with some of the President's \nactions--including his Executive action on immigration, which I think \nhas made our job harder--not easier. More recently there were stories \nof a pending negotiation on the tax bill that the President said he \nwould veto if it got to him. Why didn't the President say: Mr. Majority \nLeader, if this isn't in it, I am going to consider vetoing it? In \nother words, why didn't he use the bully pulpit and the leverage the \nPresident has to change the package if he didn't like it and make it \nmore acceptable? That is the kind of compromise and negotiation that \nneeds to occur.\n  What happens when you say I want everything my way or I want nothing? \nMore often than not, you are going to get nothing. Unfortunately, that \nis what the taxpayers got--a temporary reprieve from the retroactive \ntaxes and no real long-term solution which creates an opportunity to \nplan and make investments. That is what encourages job creation and job \ngrowth and grows the economy. All of this churning and uncertainty is \nthe antithesis of what we need when it comes to growing our economy, \ncreating jobs, and creating more predictability.\n  I know back in 2008 when President Obama was elected, millions of \nAmericans thought President Obama would be the kind of President that \nwould bring the country together on a number of levels--whether it was \na matter of race or just getting the government to be responsive to the \nneeds of the middle class. Unfortunately, he seems to have developed \nthis disdain for the very job he was elected to do. This stuff doesn't \nhappen by accident. It happens as a result of hard work. A lot of that \nhard work happens behind closed doors where Members of both parties sit \naround the table and say how can we work this out. When we are doing \nour best work, it does work out, and although it is not perfect, it is \na vast improvement over the status quo. That is the sort of thing the \nPresident, unfortunately, seems unwilling or unable to do.\n  The Executive action on immigration is perhaps the freshest \ndemonstration of the President's contempt for the role of Congress and \nthe normal legislative process. What I find hard to understand and \nbelieve is that for the weeks and months leading up to the \nannouncement, the President was repeatedly warned that such a decision \nwould provoke a constitutional crisis. And he was repeatedly warned \nthat what he was getting ready to do was something he did not have the \npower under the Constitution to do. And not coincidentally, the \nPresident--I think on 22 different occasions--admitted publicly that he \ndidn't have the authority to do what he ultimately decided to do with \nthis Executive order, but he did it anyway.\n\n  I can't think of many things he could have done that would be more \ndamaging to public confidence and Congress and the Presidency and our \nideal\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\nof self-government. If the President says ``I don't have the authority \nto do this without Congress'' but then he proceeds to do it anyway, \nwhat are we supposed to think?\n  As a result of the President's ill-advised action, the coming weeks \nand months threaten to be dominated by a political fight that was \ncompletely unnecessary. Meanwhile, the bipartisan prospects for \ncompromise on everything from immigration to tax reform have been \nsignificantly reduced.\n  The tragedy is that once we get beyond the daily partisan rhetoric, \nthere are more areas of bipartisan agreement in this Senate than people \nmight think.\n  For example, Members of both parties want to vote on the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  Members of both parties want to pass commonsense regulatory reform \nthat will reduce the burdens on families and businesses.\n  Members of both parties want to improve our patent system in order to \ndiscourage the abuse of costly litigation.\n  Members of both parties want to address America's counterproductive \nbusiness tax rate to help boost investment and create jobs here at \nhome.\n  Members of both parties want to take action to restore the 40-hour \nworkweek that was penalized by ObamaCare to get people back on full-\ntime work and off of part-time work. People would like to work full \ntime. And there are Members from both parties who want to repeal the \nlaw's medical device tax, falling as it does on the gross receipts of \nmedical device innovators here in America, causing some of my \nconstituents, for example, from Dallas to move their operations to \nCosta Rica and places where this tax won't be collected. Those are the \nsorts of incentives and disincentives that tax policy can have--and in \nthis case, very damaging.\n  Both parties want an immigration system that puts more emphasis on \nskills and on education. We are a very compassionate country when it \ncomes to immigration. We naturalize almost 1 million people a year in \nthis country. It is part of what makes our country great. But we ought \nto recognize that we need to use both our heads and our hearts on a lot \nof these issues. It makes sense to me and I think to a lot of other \npeople to say: What do these immigrants bring to America that will make \nus better, and not just operate strictly on the basis of compassion, as \nin, what do they need? This seems to be a system that helps us to \ncontinue to attract the best and the brightest people from around the \nworld through a legal immigration system.\n  Finally, Members of both parties believe we need a permanent solution \nto our transportation needs in this country. I come from the fast-\ngrowing State of Texas, where we simply don't have enough resources to \nbuild the mass transits and the highways and deal with the \ntransportation needs we have in order to continue to grow our economy \nand create jobs. What we have done, sadly--and both parties are \ncomplicit in this--is one temporary bandaid after another, making it \nvery hard to plan. We have just put patches on it, and then we come \nback and--sort of like the movie ``Groundhog Day'' we do it all over \nagain 6 months or a year later.\n  None of this is going to be easy. Nobody told us it would be easy, \nbut we need to do it anyway. We need to vote, and we need to come up \nwith solutions.\n  This is only a partial list of some of the bipartisan, smart ideas \nthat could become law pretty quickly with the right leadership. I am \nhopeful that after the first of the year in the new Congress, we will \nlook for opportunities--and I am confident we will--to work together to \nput legislation on the President's desk to show we can actually \nfunction and hopefully regain some of the public's lost confidence in \ntheir government and in self-government itself.\n  So the question is, What do we do if the President continues to give \nvery little indication that he is going to be a partner in this effort? \nWe need to do our job anyway. His initial reaction in 2014 has been to \nflout the will of Congress and the will of the American people. I know \nthe temptation is to say we are going to retaliate for the President's \naction which we consider unlawful. I think we need to make a measured \nand prudent and appropriate response. There needs to be consequences \nwhen one branch usurps its power under the Constitution. But we don't \nneed to fall back into the same sort of dysfunction we were in \npreviously that got us to where we are today.\n\n  So governing is not about having the executive branch or the \nlegislative branch see how much they can get away with on their own. \nThat is not our Constitution. That is not our form of government. It is \nabout having the two branches working together to try to find common \nground and proposing and negotiating policies that serve the national \ninterests--not the interests of one political party or the other but \nthe interests of the country as a whole.\n  In January I hope to demonstrate that the newfound confidence voters \nhave in Republicans is well-founded, not in the sense that we receive \nany mandate--believe me, I don't believe that for a minute, but I do \nbelieve people are looking for responsible alternatives to the status \nquo, and I believe sincerely that, working together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, the Senate and the House and the President can demonstrate \nthat we can actually do our jobs and govern. None of us can do it \nalone. We can and we must demonstrate that we are able to do our job \nand function. But, again, in order to move the country forward, in \norder to find solutions to the problems we have on so many fronts, we \nare going to have to do this together. I only hope the President \nreconsiders his record and his attitude about trying to go it alone \nbecause we know that is not going to end very well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe tax extenders package the House is likely to vote on today.\n  Unfortunately and sadly, it looks as though we have reached another \nlow point in the world of dysfunctional Washington politics. The House \nwill vote on what is being called a 1-year retroactive extension of \ndozens of expired tax laws. This bill contains everything from the \nresearch and development tax credit, to the wind production tax credit, \nto the new markets tax credit, and they have let us know that this is \nthe best bill they could cobble together. But in reality this is not a \n1-year extension; it is a 3-week extension of expired tax laws until \nthe end of this year--3 weeks until the end of this year. On January 1 \nall of our tax laws will expire again. No one in the real world would \never run an enterprise in this manner.\n  It is bad enough that we do extenders for 2 years without making them \npermanent, but to say the best we can do is a 1-year extension and to \nknow that really it is only a 3-week extension makes no sense at all. \nIf the purpose of this bill is to encourage investments in business or \nour communities, how does a 1-year retroactive bill make any sense at \nall? If the purpose of the bill is to provide greater certainty for \nfamilies and for businesses, how does a 1-year retroactive bill \naccomplish that? Only in the land of flickering lights--in Washington, \nDC--where we are barely keeping the government running, does it make \nsense.\n\n  I thought we had reached a new low 2 years ago when we voted on the \nso-called fiscal cliff deal--when the Bush tax cuts were expiring and \nthere was a bipartisan deal that was meant to, among other things, \navoid the sequester. That bill passed at 2:30 in the morning; then, 90 \ndays later, the sequester went into effect--the very thing we were \nsupposed to be protecting against. That deal is sometimes touted as a \ngreat act of bipartisanship. The only thing bipartisan about it was the \nconfession that the two parties couldn't figure out how to actually get \nour fiscal house in order. Had we known that night that the sequester \nwas going to go into effect 90 days later--had we known that that \nnight--there is no way there would have been 92 ``yes'' votes for that \ndeal. There is\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\nno way it would have passed. And we are still living with it today.\n  Coincidentally, the last time we passed tax extenders, it was part of \nthat deal. The fiscal cliff deal at least provided a 2-year extension \nto these temporary tax laws. Here, it turns out we will be lucky if we \nprovide 3 weeks of certainty.\n  Many of the people I represent say this bill is only marginally \nbetter than no bill at all, and they reasonably wonder why in the world \nwe wouldn't just do another 2-year extension. They prefer more \ncertainty than that to plan for their businesses and for their \ncommunities. Instead of doing the short-term House bill, the Senate \nshould instead take up the bipartisan bill the Senate Finance Committee \nreported over 6 months ago. I always hear people in this body lament \nthe lack of regular order, and I lament the lack of regular order. This \nbill represented a great attempt at regular order and it got the votes \nof Republicans and Democrats on the Finance Committee. We had a markup, \nand we voted on amendments. Some passed, some didn't. And then we voted \nthe bill out to the Senate floor 6 months ago.\n  The Ways and Means Committee in the House didn't hold a markup on the \nHouse bill they are considering today. It is my understanding the House \nwill be allowing few, if any, amendments. So why is that bill in any \nway preferable to the Senate bill, where we did the work of \nlegislating? Our 2-year bill deserves a vote here on this floor.\n  Among dozens of provisions that are important to families and \nbusinesses in Colorado and across the country, I wanted to highlight \ntwo today. The first is the credit for wind energy. The wind PTC and \nITC--the production tax credit and the investment tax credit--have \nalways enjoyed broad support from both sides of the aisle, ranging from \nits original cosponsor, Senator Grassley from Iowa, to my friend and \ncolleague from Colorado, Mark Udall. And I should say that nobody has \nbeen a greater champion for wind or more relentless over the years in \nsupport of the wind industry in Colorado and those high-paying jobs in \nour State than Mark Udall.\n  If enacted into law, the Senate version of the PTC and ITC for wind \nwill continue to drive job growth in Colorado. We are not talking about \nsome fly-by-night experiment here. This isn't some Bolshevik takeover \nof the United States. These are jobs--manufacturing jobs and other \nhigh-paying jobs--right here in the United States.\n  In Colorado, we have 5,000 people working in this industry. In \nColorado, Vestas, which manufactures wind turbines, employs over 1,400 \nworkers across 4 factories--from Pueblo all the way up I-25 to Brighton \nand Windsor. These are not just manufacturing and design jobs in urban \ncenters, but construction and operations jobs at the actual wind farms.\n  I visited one of these turbine farms in Peetz, CO, a couple of years \nago. It was a little scary because we climbed up--I climbed up--to the \nvery top of the wind turbine. I thought we were done climbing, but then \nthey opened a hatch in the top of this thing and they said: Senator, it \nis time to go out and see what this looks like, which I did, standing \non the top of this wind turbine housing in the shoes I wear on the \nfloor of the Senate. Even though I was hooked up, it was a little \nscary.\n  The guy who took me there was telling me he had been able to come \nback to his home community--a rural community in Colorado--and work in \nthis high-paying job because the wind industry was there. This was \nsomething he never would have imagined as a kid, but now he has real \nopportunity, and there are thousands of people just like him all over \nmy State who are concerned the political conversation here has \ndecoupled once again from their concerns and has become about the \ninternal politics of Washington, DC, and not what is actually going on \nin places such as rural Colorado or in rural places all across the \nUnited States.\n  This industry drives economic growth across our State--from the \nconference rooms of tech startups in Boulder and Denver all the way to \nthe 6,000-acre Kit Carson wind power generating site just west of the \nKansas State line.\n  The production tax credit has driven $105 billion in private \ninvestment. This is actually amazing when you think about it, given the \nfact there has been so much uncertainty associated with it--$105 \nbillion. It has opened up 550 industrial facilities and provided $180 \nmillion in lease payments to rural farmers, to ranchers, and to \nlandowners who host wind farms.\n  The mention of those rural farmers and ranchers brings me to the \nsecond provision of the EXPIRE Act that I would like to highlight: the \ntax incentive for conservation easements.\n  Private land conservation is critical in States such as Colorado. \nHealthy grasslands, open landscapes, and abundant wildlife are a \nfundamental part of what is to be in the West and in Colorado. In the \n2014 farm bill, we worked really hard to build a strong conservation \ntitle.\n  The easement incentive in the Senate finance bill is an important \ncomplement to the work in the farm bill. This incentive accounts for \nthe true value of conserved land, which allows family farmers, \nranchers, and moderate-income landowners to preserve land for our kids \nand for our grandkids to enjoy.\n  In Colorado, we have landowners lined up to take advantage of this \nvery well-designed program. It opens up conservation opportunities to \npeople who might be land rich but cash poor--producers who feed this \ncountry. This is land we have to keep in production. But when you are \nliving in a place where the value isn't calculated properly, and there \nis a high value associated with it and you don't have the money to be \nable to put it into easement, this program can help you do that.\n  If we do that, we get to hold on to our farms and ranches in our \nStates. But here we are again considering a bill that extends these \nbenefits for only 3 weeks. If it is good policy for 3 weeks, why isn't \nit good policy for 2 years? If we pass the House bill, we are telling \nthe farmers and ranchers across States such as Colorado that we don't \nvalue long-term conservation, that we don't take it seriously.\n  The loss of this tax incentive would mean less land across the West \nwould be protected--again, a voluntary program. This isn't telling \nanybody they have to do anything with their farms and ranches; it is an \noption for them if they want to use it. More wildlife habitat will be \nlost, water quality will suffer, and Colorado's scenic beauty, which is \ncritical to our way of life and our economy, will be threatened.\n  If we pass the House bill, people's jobs across Colorado will be \nplaced at risk. And this is all due to Congress's failure to do its \njob. We can do better than that. We should, at this late hour, \nreconsider this and pass the Senate bill--pass the EXPIRE Act. We \nshould pass a bipartisan piece of legislation that came out of the \nFinance Committee through regular order 6 months ago. We have had \nplenty of time to consider that. Then we should come back and we should \ndo comprehensive tax reform and give our country a Tax Code that is \nactually worthy of the entrepreneurs who are out there working every \nday to invent our future. The last time the Tax Code--this might be of \ninterest to the pages here today--the last time the Tax Code was \nupdated in this country, I was in college. I was in college. What are \nthe chances that today's Tax Code reflects the American economy as it \nactually is, to say nothing of the global economy as it actually is? \nThe chances are zero. This is the work we have been sent here to do. It \nis hard, but that is what we are supposed to be doing here.\n  I hope in the new year there is going to be a big change around this \nplace, and I hope all of us use that change to the advantage of the \nAmerican people by putting ourselves back to work. They are working \nhard. The least we can do is work together to actually align our \nlegislation and our regulation to the world as it actually exists \nrather than one that existed 50 or 100 years ago.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the chance to speak today on these \nimportant issues to Colorado.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Major David Wilson\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this is a bittersweet moment for me, \nbecause Maj. David Wilson, who has served in my office in an exemplary \nway in the Air Force Fellowship Program, will be leaving my office this \nweek. He has been there for the past year. He has been an incredibly \nvaluable member of my staff.\n  I would like to encourage my colleagues to join me in thanking my \nmilitary fellow for his exemplary service to the Senate and to wish him \nwell in his next endeavor at the Pentagon. Maj. David Wilson has \ndedicated his life to serving our Nation. David was commissioned by the \nU.S. Air Force in 2002 as a graduate of the Air Force Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps at Texas Tech University.\n  David has served in Texas, Montana, and Germany and has been deployed \nto Kuwait, Cuba, and Liberia. He has served the Air Force in a wide \nrange of missions, from personnel and readiness to executive officer \nand deployed squadron commander. While on Active Duty, David has earned \na master's degree in international relations.\n  Major Wilson joined my office as part of the Air Force Legislative \nFellowship Program. I know my colleagues familiar with that program \nknow how valuable it is. It is a year-long program that offers those in \nthe military an opportunity to learn about the legislative process \nfirsthand. But for me he has been an additional valuable member of my \nstaff who has advised me on defense issues. He has been very helpful on \nso many issues.\n  My staff and I will truly miss Major Wilson. David hit the ground \nrunning. When he joined the office, he started contributing \nimmediately. He is personable, hard-working, and enthusiastic. He has \nbeen a key member of the staff, providing me with concise, \nstraightforward guidance on some of our most sensitive defense-related \nlegislative issues. He has advised me on issues ranging from how to \nbest address claims backlogs and other problems at the Veterans' \nAdministration to military strategies against Islamic State terrorists.\n  I know the Presiding Officer joins me in knowing the complications \nand concerns we get from our veterans community, particularly on delays \nin getting claims heard. I thank Major Wilson for helping us to \nunderstand how we could better serve our veterans in this country.\n  David has drafted innovative legislation to improve the recruitment \nof our Guard and Reserve Forces, which I hope to introduce soon. David \nhas worked extremely hard to ensure that Maryland veterans have \nadequate and timely access to the services they need.\n  I think our Nation's greatest resource is its young people, \nespecially those who have joined our All-Volunteer Force to defend our \ncountry and our way of life. Many times we take the opportunity to \nthank those who wear the uniform of our Nation for defending our \nprinciples. We think about what is happening around the world and \nrecognize that in the United States we can pray to the God we want \nwithout fear of intimidation. In other parts of the world they would \ncut your head off for that.\n  We can express our opposition to government peacefully. We can have \nan election where the outcomes are in the hands of the voters, and we \ncelebrate that. In other countries they lock up people for dreaming \nthat. Our military makes sure we preserve those freedoms.\n  The Air Force should be proud of the extraordinary talent they have \nin Maj. David Wilson. My staff and I still refer to David as ``Major,'' \nbut in fact he has been selected to the rank of lieutenant colonel 2 \nyears below the promotion zone, which is quite an accomplishment. Fewer \nthan 1 percent of the officers up for promotion get promoted 2 years \nearly. So this is a rare accomplishment. It is not surprising in this \ninstance, given David's drive, ambition, and talent.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Major Wilson on his \ngraduation and thanking him for his service to our country. I also wish \nto take this opportunity to thank David's wife Susan and daughter Ella \nfor sharing him with the Senate. We have been enriched by his presence. \nI know of the late hours he has worked and the sacrifices he has made \nto his family.\n\n\n                      Millennium Development Goals\n\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to be appointed by the President to be \none of the two Senate representatives to the United Nations for the \n69th United Nations General Assembly Session. Senator Ron Johnson of \nWisconsin is the other member. The two of us have visited New York \ntogether. We have talked about how we can best represent the \nlegislative branch of government at the U.S. Mission in New York to \nfurther the objectives the United States has within the United Nations.\n  Just recently I visited New York. I had a chance to meet with Helen \nClark, who is the U.N. Development Program Director, the former Prime \nMinister of New Zealand, a person who is instrumentally involved in \ndealing with the development programs within the United Nations.\n\n  I mention that because we are now at the conclusion of the 2000 \nMillennium Development Goals. I want to mention that for a moment \nbecause our goals were to reduce poverty, increase the stability of \ngovernments. As the Presiding Officer knows, yes, these are core U.S. \nprinciples. The Presiding Officer has been very active in Africa, has \ndone an incredible job in Africa in pointing out the need for reducing \npoverty and increasing stability.\n  These are our core principles. That is why we do it, our humanitarian \ngoals--yes, absolutely, our participation. But it is also important for \nour national security goals. Because if we have nations that are \nprosperous, that include their people in the prosperity of their \nnation, have good governance, it is going to be a more stable \ngovernment and it will help us have partners whom we can rely on to \nhelp us deal with world stability, rather than have to call upon our \nmilitary to restore order.\n  This helps us reduce our need for conflicts around the world. So the \nU.N. programs dealing with the Millennium Development Goals were well \nreceived when they were conceived a decade ago. There are eight \nspecific goals. What is interesting about the eight specific goals is \nthey had specific, achievable objectives to achieve by 2015.\n  It was basically to reduce poverty and disease by next year, cutting \nin half the number of undernourished individuals on this planet to deal \nwith child mortality and maternal health. It was interesting that we \nrecognized last decade that we could deal with some simple issues, such \nas dealing with infection at birth, dealing with nutrition, dealing \nwith how we deal with an infant being able to breathe properly through \nsimple devices and that we could significantly reduce infant mortality \nand we could significantly improve maternal health.\n  So we set those goals. We set the goals of improving primary \neducation because we knew education was an opportunity for children to \nbe able to succeed. Gender equity and equality was a huge issue. \nSecretary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, was our leader on \nthis issue globally.\n  Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The United States \ntook a leadership role in the PEPFAR Program that made a consequential \ndifference in dealing with the spread of HIV/AIDS. Environmental \nsustainability was one of our Millennium Development Goals because we \nrecognized that to be perhaps the greatest challenge on how we are \ngoing to deal with the sustainability of our environment with the \nchallenges of global climate change.\n  We also recognized that we needed global partners for development. \nThese are all part of the Millennium Development Goals. We recognized \nthese are not just goals of each nation working together within the \nUnited Nations to achieve, but it also involves private foundations. It \ninvolves international organizations, NGOs, all working together in \norder to achieve these objectives.\n  Guess what. Now that we are reaching that plateau in 2015, we can \nlook back and say we accomplished a great deal for this planet, a 15-\npercent reduction in extreme poverty since the Millennium Development \nGoals were established. That is an incredible accomplishment. We now \nhave safe drinking water in so many parts of the world that did not \nhave safe drinking water when these goals were developed.\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n  Gender disparity in education has been dramatically reduced. It has \nbeen estimated that since the Millennium Development Goals were \nestablished, we have saved--100 million babies have survived who would \notherwise not survive. That is an incredible accomplishment we have \nbeen able to achieve since the development of these goals.\n  Yes, there is much more that needs to be done. Every year about 6 \nmillion babies die needlessly at birth. We can do much better and save \nmore children. The Ebola crisis in West Africa teaches us that we still \nneed to deal with basic health services. In so many countries in the \nworld the spread of Ebola was because they were not prepared to deal \nwith basic health care needs. They could have dramatically reduced the \nspread of the Ebola virus.\n  We still have, unfortunately, widespread corruption affecting our \nMillennium Development Goals in countries around the world. Quite \nfrankly, we cannot accomplish what we want in a country--that is, get \ntheir agriculture sustainable, develop the health clinics they need, \ndeal with the gender equity--if they have corrupt government.\n  So dealing with the issue of good governance is clearly an area we \nneed to improve. We are now talking about the post-2015 development \ngoals, Millennium Development Goals. The United Nations is working on \nthat. Helen Clark, whom I talked to, is working on that. They have some \nworking documents in which they are prepared to come together, as they \ndid for the original Millennium Development Goals, which offer again \nadditional opportunities.\n  We need to build on what we have done and make sure we have \nachievable goals. I want to mention a couple of areas that I hope will \nbe included in the post-2015 Millennium Development Goals. First, we \nneed to deal with the realities of the current threats we have. The \nEbola crisis points that out.\n  It is interesting that Nigeria had a few cases of Ebola, but they \nwere able to eradicate it. One of the reasons they were able to \neradicate it is because they had a health clinic set up from the PEPFAR \nmoney that was made available through what we did with HIV/AIDS. The \npoint is this: Let's use this opportunity, this crisis of Ebola, to \nmake sure we have basic health care services in all our countries so we \ndo not have another Ebola-type crisis in the future. That should be \nclearly one of our development goals.\n\n  Let's deal with good governance by having anticorruption guidelines. \nIn my work as Chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, we have workable \nways we can deal with corruption in countries and how we can fight \ncorruption. Our trade negotiators right now are dealing with countries \nthat are developing countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and are \nlooking at how we can improve good governance in countries through \ntrade legislation. We can be the leader in dealing with good governance \nand anticorruption issues. It should be a Millennium Development Goal \npost-2015.\n  We need to have specific targets in educating boys and girls on \nhealth access and food security, climate change, good governance. The \nUnited States can be a leader. I do want to point out--and the \nPresiding Officer is very much aware of this--we have taken steps, this \nadministration and this Congress, to pave the way for the post-2015 \nMillennium Development Goals. For example, we have the Feed the Future \nInitiative, where we help small farmers, particularly women, in dealing \nwith sustainable agricultural products.\n  We do not just give food to the poor, we are looking at changing the \neconomics within the country so they can have sustainable agriculture. \nThe Global Development Lab that Administrator Shaw has proposed, again \nthe Presiding Officer is one of the leaders on that. But here what we \nare doing is we are taking the USAID development assistance dollars and \nwe are leveraging it with work already being done by our academic \ncenters in America that are active internationally.\n  I am proud of the work Johns Hopkins does globally. I am sure many \nMembers of the Senate know of the great work done by their academic \ncenters with private companies. Why private companies? Because they get \nmarkets. They are interested in working with us to help sustainable \neconomic progress in other countries, which helps us and allows our \ndevelopment assistance to be leveraged and to go further.\n  We need to be a leader in the post-2015 goals for millennium \ndevelopment within the United Nations.\n  I wish to underscore this last point. We need to do this because that \nis who we are--our values. Our values are humanitarian. We believe we \nhave a responsibility to help, and that includes globally. But we do it \nbecause our national security also depends upon it.\n  We really understand that our national security is more than our \nsoldiers and our weapons. It is very important to those who serve in \nour military. But our diplomacy, development assistance, and having \nstable governments globally help us become a more stable society and \nhelp us with our own national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to be involved with us. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Johnson at the United Nations as we pursue many \ndifferent missions. I hope one that we will pursue is the continuation \nof Millennium Development Goals post-2015 to continue to make progress \nin reducing world poverty and hunger.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in quorum calls \nbe equally divided between the Democrats and the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Release of Guantanamo Detainees\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, to discuss an issue that has been spoken about on \nthis floor over the last several years many times, but it continues to \nbe a problem. The Senator from New Hampshire has been very focused, as \nhave I, on this issue, which is the release of detainees from \nGuantanamo and the fact that we know that not only are there dangerous \nindividuals there who should not be released, but we also know these \nindividuals are returning to the fight, and they are scheming and \nplanning and intending to do harm to America and Americans. So we wish \nto visit this issue again.\n  I wish to start off by saying that it is well-founded in our Nation's \nhistory that the United States has the authority to hold enemy \ncombatants until the end of hostilities in order to prevent their \nreturn to the battlefield. For the past several years, each National \nDefense Authorization Act that has been signed into law by the \nPresident has recognized this principle and made clear that any Al \nQaeda-affiliated terrorists, whether foreign or American, who takes up \narms against the United States can be held under the law of war.\n  Because Congress authorized the use of military force against these \nterrorists shortly after they attacked us on September 11, 2001, \ndetention within a military framework is often the best means of \ncollecting valuable intelligence to prevent further terrorist attacks, \nwhile ensuring they remain on the sidelines for the duration of the \nconflict.\n  There are fundamental failures of the administration in the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  First, when the President announced the closing of the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo in January of 2009, he left our Nation without a \nclear policy for detaining and interrogating suspected terrorists. \nWithout such a policy, including one that identifies a facility for \nholding terrorists who are captured outside of Afghanistan, the \nintelligence community's ability to conduct ongoing intelligence \noperations has been severely limited.\n  Second and even more alarming is the ill-advised release of these \nGitmo detainees back to the battlefields from which they came. I would \nsuggest to\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nthe Senator from New Hampshire that we are doing material harm to our \nnational security efforts by purging the Guantanamo facility, \nparticularly without a long-term plan for guaranteed monitoring, and I \nknow she is going to address this issue. In fact, those who remain at \nGuantanamo Bay today are not low-level fighters who were in the wrong \nplace at the wrong time; they are some of the most hardened, determined \nextremists we have encountered and remain singularly focused on \nbringing violence to the United States and our allies.\n  Shockingly, many of the detainees who are being transferred were \ndetermined to be too dangerous to transfer by the administration's own \nGuantanamo Review Task Force. Yet many of them are still being \ntransferred. I have been to Guantanamo on several different occasions, \nthe most recent time being about 3 months ago. I can attest once again \nthat these truly are the most hardened and the most dangerous \nterrorists who exist today, particularly who are, obviously, in \ncaptivity. As we see these individuals on the screen, in their cells, \nwe can see in their eyes that criminal activity is occupying 100 \npercent of their thoughts and that they truly are determined that they \nare going to, one of these days, get out of that facility and return to \nthe battlefield.\n  There was one particular anecdote where the leadership at the \nfacility and I were engaging in a conversation, and it was close to the \ncell of one of the individuals. All of a sudden we realized that \nindividual was telling other cell mates that he was trying to hear what \nwas going on in our conversation. It has gotten that sophisticated on \ntheir part when it comes to trying to figure out ways to communicate \nwith the outside the ideas they have about killing and harming \nAmericans and planning and scheming to one day, as I said earlier, \nleave that place and reengage in the fight.\n  Instead of working with Congress to develop commonsense policies to \nenable our national security personnel to detain and interrogate \nterrorists, this administration is releasing them back with little \nthought to their future actions. In this haphazard fashion, there is no \nuniform procedure for the continued monitoring of these individuals--\nindividuals, I might add, who have already demonstrated a propensity \nfor violence. Each country accepts them on their own terms with varying \ncommitments and cooperation, making further monitoring by the \nintelligence community and our partners nearly impossible.\n  This is neither a safe nor a sustainable way of ensuring the national \nsecurity of the United States, yet it has become an all too common \npractice in this administration. We know for a fact that a number of \nthese former detainees are returning to the battlefield with renewed \nzeal to wage war against our American way of life.\n  According to the Director of National Intelligence, an additional \nfour former Guantanamo detainees were confirmed to have rejoined the \nfight between July of 2013 and January of 2014, raising the combined \nsuspected and confirmed recidivism rate to 29 percent. In addition, \nalthough the next report has not been released, we know this number \nwill increase.\n  We constantly face new plots and operatives looking for ways to \nmurder Americans, such as the foiled May 2012 AQAP plot that put \nanother IED on a United States-bound aircraft. Thankfully, this plot \nand others did not materialize. But we are not going to always be that \nfortunate, especially in the absence of meaningful interrogation of \nterrorists and their imminent return to the battlefield.\n  We know that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, today \nrepresents one of the biggest threats to the United States homeland, as \nwell as personnel serving overseas. They are continually plotting \nagainst our interests and seeking new recruits, especially among our \nown citizens as well as former Guantanamo detainees.\n  Explosives experts, such as Ibrahim al-Asiri, continue to roam free, \nposing a tremendous threat to the safety and security of U.S. citizens. \nIt is Mr. al-Asiri who is the bomb-making expert who has attempted to \ndevise bombs that cannot be detected by the equipment in airports, so \nthat they can hopefully place a bomb either inside an individual or on \nan individual who can secure a seat on an airplane without that bomb \nbeing detected as they go through the various checkpoints at airports \naround the world.\n  Additionally, as the Senator from New Hampshire again will allude to, \nthis proposed closure of Guantanamo Bay presents significant risks for \nthe United States as well as Yemeni efforts to counter AQAP inside of \nYemen.\n  A substantial portion of the detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay \nare, in fact, Yemeni citizens. Transferring these individuals to a \ncountry plagued by prison breaks, assassinations, and open warfare at \nthis point could prove catastrophic. These detainees would likely \nrejoin several other former Gitmo detainees who have returned to the \nfight in Yemen, further destabilizing the country, and worsening an \nalready tenuous security situation.\n  The most recent example of a totally failed and dangerous policy on \nthe part of this administration is the exchange of the Taliban Five \nback in May. That decision, to release five individuals who now wake up \nevery morning thinking of ways to kill and harm Americans, was wrong. \nThis administration clearly and callously failed in its obligations of \nnotifying Congress. It appears they did not comply with this \nrequirement because they knew there would be objections to the release \nof those five individuals from both sides of the aisle here in the \nSenate, as well as across the Capitol on the House side. This \nadministration clearly decided they wanted to intentionally release \nthese individuals in spite of the fact that we had included language in \nthe previous Defense authorization bills requiring specific \nnotification to Congress in advance of them doing so.\n  In addition to simply violating that notification requirement, the \nadministration violated the Antideficiency Act by obligating funds that \nwere not legally available. While the President has a habit of ignoring \nlaws relating to domestic policies such as health care and immigration, \nthis overreach will likely directly threaten the lives of our citizens \nand servicemembers in Afghanistan.\n  In the wake of the President's bold defiance of congressional \noversight, I wrote the White House requesting the declassification of \nthe 2009 Guantanamo Bay review task force assessments for the Taliban \nFive. I also requested, on the floor of the Senate, that the \nadministration release these files so the American people can know what \nI know, and what the Presiding Officer knows, and decide for themselves \nif that was the right decision.\n  Today I renew that request and I call on this administration to \nfulfill its failed promises of transparency and show to the American \npeople the very real stakes they are gambling with in their attempts to \nempty Guantanamo.\n  Nevertheless, this dangerous trend continues unabated, even amidst \nbipartisan calls for greater oversight after the Taliban Five release.\n  In November alone, seven detainees were transferred, three to the \ncountry of Georgia, two to Slovakia, one to Saudi Arabia, and another \nto Kuwait. Some of these countries have previously had detainees sent \nto them. We have mixed reaction as to the reengagement or the oversight \nthat is provided in those countries. Some of those countries have never \nhad a detainee they have taken possession of. We have no idea what kind \nof supervision they are going to exercise over these individuals.\n  Whether it is in Iraq, Afghanistan, or in other parts of the Middle \nEast, Americans have fought and died in the war against Al Qaeda. Our \nNation may be weary of war, but threatening elements still remain. \nThose five individuals, the Taliban Five to whom I alluded, are clearly \nthreats to the United States. I urge President Obama as well as my \ncongressional colleagues and the American people not to abandon the \ngains we have made in this fight against terrorism since 9/11. We must \nremain steadfast in our resolve to defeat extremists who oppose \nfreedom, democracy, and our American way of life.\n  I look forward in my remaining days here in the Senate to working \nwith colleagues such as my friend from New Hampshire and other Members \nof this body as we continue to face this growing threat.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, for \nhis incredible leadership on the Intelligence Committee, on the Armed \nServices Committee, and his deep commitment to ensuring that our \ncountry remains safe, that our freedoms are protected. I daresay from \nthe time I have been in the Senate, Senator Chambliss is one of the \nmost knowledgeable people in this body about the threats we face, how \nwe address those threats, and how we ensure that America remains safe. \nI thank Senator Chambliss for his incredible leadership in this body, \nnot only on the issue of how do we address ensuring that the detainees \nwho are held--who are very dangerous--at Guantanamo Bay do not present \nadditional threats to our country and to our allies, but on so many \nissues, ensuring that our intelligence officials have strong \ninformation and oversight to ensure that America remains protected.\n  I rise in support of what my colleague from Georgia has just talked \nabout. If we look at what is happening around the world, the recent \ndevelopments with ISIS, combined with the continuing threats we face \nhere at home from Al Qaeda and its affiliates, it underscores the \ncontinuing need we have for a military detention facility that is \noutside the United States of America, that prevents enemy combatants \nwho are at war with us from returning to the battle, and allows us a \nsecure location to gather intelligence, to ensure that when we capture \na member of Al Qaeda, or when we capture one of its affiliates that is \nin a position where the organization is threatening the United States \nof America that we take the opportunity to ensure there is a full and \ncomplete interrogation of those terrorists to make sure we know \neverything they know, to ensure we can prevent future attacks, and that \nthe United States of America is protected.\n  So I would argue, as we look at what is happening around the world, \nthe need for this detention facility actually has become more apparent. \nYet what we have seen with the administration, as Senator Chambliss has \nso eloquently outlined, is there has been a push--there was a political \npromise made in the President's campaign to close Guantanamo Bay. \nDespite having a policy as to how we are going to handle the capture of \nthese enemy combatants, one that he worked with Congress on, and how we \nwill ensure the full interrogation of those combatants to ensure \ninformation we need to protect our country, we have seen a rush to \nrelease people from Guantanamo Bay that has been accelerated recently, \nas my colleague from Georgia talked about, where the Department of \nDefense has announced the transfer of seven detainees fairly recently.\n  Some of those detainees were reportedly assessed to be high risk. \nThere are also questions about what are the conditions the countries \nthat are taking these detainees are going to ensure so they do not \nreturn to the fight, where we have direct evidence of a 29-percent \nreentry rate with those who have been released from Guantanamo Bay, not \njust under this administration but under prior administrations, who are \nconfirmed or suspected of having reengaged in terrorism.\n  There is nothing that must appall our troops more than to be on the \nbattlefield, or our intelligence officials or our allies, to \nreencounter a terrorist we had safely detained at a detention facility, \nat Guantanamo Bay, and to see that person again and to know they \ncontinue to be a threat to the United States of America and to our \ninterests.\n  I would urge, I hope, my colleagues, now more than ever, that it is \nimportant we have that detention facility there that is safe, secure, \nand we can ensure that those who are captured, who want to do us harm, \nmembers of Al Qaeda terrorist groups--that we can ensure they cannot \nget back in this battle against us.\n  I specifically want to talk about the country of Yemen, because as a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee--and Senator Chambliss supported \nthis effort--we passed an amendment in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that would have prohibited the transfer of Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees to the country of Yemen until December 31 of 2015. That \nprovision was removed during the conference committee. I am being told \nwe will not have a chance to debate that issue on the Senate floor or \nto amend the Defense authorization as it comes to the floor because--\nthis is something that I cannot understand, why this provision was \nremoved and why the administration would want the ability to transfer \nGuantanamo Bay detainees to Yemen.\n  Let's talk about what is happening in Yemen. Last May, President \nObama, in my view unwisely, lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers \nto Yemen. Since that decision was made, between the date of the \nPresident's and the administration's order that we could potentially \nrelease detainees to Yemen--let me outline what has happened in Yemen \nsince then.\n  That country has continued to be a place where there is instability, \nlack of government control, and, in fact, between November 24 and \nDecember 2 of 2014, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula reportedly \nclaimed responsibility for 17 attacks in 8 Yemeni provinces.\n  I have a laundry list of very dangerous attacks that have occurred in \nYemen. One of the most troubling things that has occurred--as we think \nabout those who are present at Guantanamo who are very dangerous \nindividuals, a number of them are Yemeni. If they were to be \ntransferred back to the country of Yemen--for example, in February of \n2014, militants attacked Yemen's main prison, killing 7 and enabling 29 \ninmates to escape, including 19 members who were convicted members of \nAl Qaeda.\n\n  So I don't know why the administration would seek to transfer \nGuantanamo detainees to this country, where there have been prison \nbreaks and where there have been multiple incidences of violent attacks \nby Al Qaeda. Yet this provision got dropped from the Defense \nauthorization even though it had the support of the Senate committee. I \nam very troubled by that.\n  I am very troubled we will not have an opportunity to debate that on \nthe floor. I would hope the administration would look very closely at \nthe record of what has occurred in Yemen since the President has made \nthe decision to end the moratorium on transfers to Yemen because it is \nan incredible list of dangerous activities and prison breaks by members \nof Al Qaeda.\n  So there is no way if we transfer someone from Gitmo to Yemen there, \nwe can guarantee that those individuals will not get back in the fight, \nthat they will not escape from any prison we put them in because that \ncountry cannot secure their security.\n  I want to talk about a very important issue as we look at this issue \nof the administration's rush to close Guantanamo; that is, the issue of \nISIS.\n  There have been reports that a certain number of former Guantanamo \ndetainees may be fighting with ISIS. We all saw--with horror--the acts \nof ISIS, how brutal they are, and the brutality that they have taken \nout on Americans, including one of my constituents. We all know ISIS is \na group the President himself has said we need to defeat.\n  I have written the President and asked him about these reports. In \nfact, I wrote a letter to President Obama and requested that all \ninternational transfers be suspended until we could know more about \npotential Guantanamo detainees whom we released who may be getting in \nthe fight in support of ISIS. It was recently reported that one former \nGuantanamo detainee has pledged his allegiance to the leader of ISIS \nand is recruiting fighters for ISIS in northern Pakistan.\n  If that is true we need to revisit not only ensuring that we aren't \ntransferring dangerous detainees from Guantanamo to countries such as \nYemen--and allowing them to be in a position to get back in the fight--\nbut that we are also ensuring that we have a moratorium on transfers \nuntil we understand how many of these detainees may actually be joining \nISIS and present a threat to us.\n  This issue--as we look at the national security challenges we face \nnow--we have to reevaluate. I would hope the President would reevaluate \nthe campaign promise he made in light of the national security threats \nwe face. Now is not the time to be closing\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nthe facility of Guantanamo when we are presented with so many threats \naround the world--not only from Al Qaeda but from ISIS--and we need a \nsecure facility to ensure that those who are there now, who are \ntremendously dangerous individuals, don't get back in the fight to \ncontinue to harm us and our allies. Also, we need to ensure that if \nfuture enemy combatants are captured who are members of Al Qaeda or its \naffiliates, that they have a secure place where they can be held and \nfully interrogated.\n  I again thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership on this \nissue and on so many national security issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                   Prevention and Public Health Fund\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to be joined with my \ndistinguished friend and extraordinary colleague Senator Harkin of Iowa \nto support continued funding of the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  He has been a leader in this area, so I am particularly privileged to \nstand with him on behalf of a fund that is absolutely necessary to \naddress prevention of serious and chronic diseases. It is fiscally and \nmorally and absolutely essential that we approach health care in this \nway.\n  I am going to ask for permission to continue to speak. I am not sure \nwhat the allotted time is. If there is no objection, I ask unanimous \nconsent for the time through 5 o'clock for myself, Senator Harkin, and \nothers who may join us in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Our Nation currently spends 75 cents of every $1 on \nhealth care for the treatment of preventable conditions.\n  These diseases can be stopped and prevented in people through simple, \ncommonsense measures. Yet a meager 3 cents of every $1 goes toward \nthose treatments, therapies, and practices that can help prevent the \ndiseases that are so wasteful to our economy, to individuals, and their \nlivelihoods.\n  Our young people are on track to be the first generation of Americans \nto live a shorter, unhealthier life than their parents. The \nresponsibility to change the course of this history is in our hands.\n  One step this body--led by Senator Harkin--has taken is to establish \nthe Prevention and Public Health Fund. It is the only dedicated Federal \nfund for the prevention and improvement of our Nation's public health. \nPrevention is the most effective way to improve the health of Americans \nwhile reducing health care costs in the United States. This funding \nsupports efforts to reduce our Nation's rate of infant death, cancer, \ndiabetes, heart disease, and tobacco use. They are the killers and they \nkill unnecessarily and avoidably.\n  Sadly, many Connecticut residents suffer from those very same chronic \ndiseases I mentioned. Thirty percent of Connecticut residents have high \nblood pressure, 9 percent have diabetes, 21,000 residents of \nConnecticut are diagnosed with cancer annually, and 16 percent still \nuse tobacco.\n  The Prevention and Public Health Fund invests in a broad range of \nevidence-based activities--not speculative, not abstract, conceptual, \ntheoretical--including community and clinical prevention initiatives \nthat can help stop all Americans from developing debilitating and \nchronic disease in the future.\n  So far grants from this fund were awarded to support four Connecticut \nprojects, including mental health and addiction, diabetes management in \nolder and disabled adults, and the establishment of an electronic birth \nregistration system to improve the ability to track the health and \nwell-being of infants. It sounds pretty rudimentary--and it is--using \ntechnology to track the health and well-being of infants.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a hard-hitting \nanti-tobacco media campaign--funded from this fund--focused on the \ndestructive health effects of smoking. It is not only effective, but it \nis supported by the efforts that we have advocated on prevention in \nhealth management.\n  Over the next 3 years this campaign is expected to save the country \n$170 million in nonincurred health costs and lowered productivity that \nresults from smoking. The CDC has estimated that this campaign will \nassist 50,000 tobacco users to quit smoking.\n  I know from my own work in suing the tobacco companies and \nestablishing the fund to support exactly these kinds of efforts, that \nmillions of Americans across the United States want to quit. They have \ntried repeatedly. Ninety-nine percent of all smokers want to quit and \nalso try to quit, but quitting is hard because nicotine is one of the \nmost powerfully addictive drugs known to man and cigarettes are a \npowerfully effective nicotine delivery tool.\n  These 50,000 tobacco users who quit smoking are better off, not only \nin their health but their pocketbooks. They save countless dollars that \nthey would otherwise squander on unhealthy tobacco products. They are \nhealthier, their families are happier, and they save themselves from a \nlifetime of addiction and disease. The preventive efforts of the CDC as \na result of this fund are preventive in stopping young people from \nbeginning to smoke as well.\n  It is monumental, it is historic, and it is a fund that should be \nfully supported by Congress. The fund accorded the CDC the ability to \nrun another tobacco education campaign called ``Tips from Former \nSmokers.''\n  According to a recent study, this campaign led 1.64 million Americans \nto attempt to quit smoking. Those who have completely quit smoking as a \nresult of the campaign added half a million quality-adjusted life years \nto the population of the United States.\n  I know these numbers sound abstract and obtuse. They are real lives, \nand they have been saved from the evils of tobacco addiction and \nsmoking, which in turn could cause cancer, heart disease, and all kinds \nof preventive diseases.\n  This funding is essential to running the local departments of health \nin many areas of our Nation. Workers at those departments of public \nhealth are in the forefront of preventing infectious diseases, an issue \nthat most recently came into focus as part of the domestic Ebola \nresponse.\n  Without adequate funding for these departments, the people most \nclosely tasked and most immediately responsible for providing services \nand information to people in the time of a crisis may be unable to \nrespond when communities are most in need.\n  We must change the focus of our health care from sickness and disease \nto wellness and prevention.\n  We grew up, many of us, with our mothers telling us that an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure. That is not only an adage that is \ncommonly repeated, it is commonly proved in everyday life.\n  I strongly encourage my fellow Members to support the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund to help ensure the future well-being of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I yield to my colleague Senator Harkin, one of the leaders in this \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for his very \nexcellent, profound statement and for taking a leadership position on \nthis very crucial issue.\n  It is obviously well known I am retiring in 3 weeks. The Prevention \nand Public Health Fund of which the Senator spoke so eloquently just \nnow is going to continue, and it is going to need people such as the \nSenator from the State of Connecticut to take that kind of leadership \nposition.\n  I believe people are catching on to it around the country, but there \nare still those who say: People get high blood pressure, they get \nborderline diabetes, they have high cholesterol. These things just sort \nof happen--sort of like they are preordained.\n  Chronic diseases are not preordained. As the Senator said, 75 percent \nof the money we spent was accountable for preventable chronic diseases \nand conditions. As the Senator so rightly said, what we need to focus \non is keeping people healthy, not paying for it later on when they are \nin the hospital. That is something that this Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund is making strides on.\n  People have perhaps a mistaken idea that health care only occurs in \nthe doctor's office or in the exchange between doctor and patient or \nhealth care provider and patient. But we know that\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\n it takes place in all aspects of life--in the workplace, in the \ncommunities in which we live, in our schools, in our homes. It has to \nbe something that is sort of pervasive in our society.\n\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut that I have often said in America \nit is easy to be unhealthy and hard to be healthy. It seems to me that \nought to be turned around. It ought to be easy to be healthy and harder \nto be unhealthy. That means the simple things in life, such as kids \nwalking to school. If they have a school in their neighborhood, they \nshould be able to walk to school and back. I often talk about when my \nkids went to school here in Virginia when we moved here from Iowa many \nyears ago. We had a high school 1 mile from our house, but the kids \ncouldn't walk to school. Why? There was no sidewalk. It was a busy \nstreet, but there was no sidewalk. Simple things like that.\n  Things such as the Senator mentioned, making sure people get their \ncheckups every year. The prevention fund does that. It makes sure of \nthat. The money we put in the Affordable Care Act provides for annual \ncheckups and vaccinations for people with no copays and no deductibles. \nI am told that now over 100 million people have taken advantage of that \nin this country--no copays, no deductibles. They can go in for a free \ncheck and get their cholesterol checked, a blood pressure screening, \nand all that done on an annual basis.\n  We also have to be cognizant that our kids need to have better \nphysical opportunities at school and better food at school. With the \nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 we started to change the way we \nprovide foods for our kids--healthy foods, free and fresh fruits and \nvegetables in schools all over America. These are the things that make \nit easier to be healthy--easier to be healthy.\n  There are the quitlines the Senator spoke about, which have been \nenormously successful, and the ``Tips from Former Smokers.'' We have \nthe data on that from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nSo we know they are working.\n  So again, I wish to thank the Senator for his focus on this and wish \nhim well in the future in being sort of the champion on this because \nthere are a lot of pulls around this place. I think everyone here would \nsay: Yes, I am for health care; I am for keeping people healthy. We all \nget that. But there are so many pulls around here on how to appropriate \nmoney and what we do that sometimes this gets lost in the shuffle. So I \nam encouraged and pleased the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nwill be focused on this Prevention and Public Health Fund. It is making \nchanges all over this country in profound ways--in profound ways--and \nin our communities.\n  Our communities are now getting together. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, the communities in Maine are now getting together and thinking \nabout what they can do as a community to provide for more healthy \nactivities and encouragement for people in their communities, and they \nare getting grants from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to do \njust that. Communities all over America are beginning to think about \nthis and taking action.\n  It is simple things sometimes. A small community in Iowa--a very \nsmall town--had a retirement home for the elderly, but they didn't have \nanyplace for the elderly to exercise. So they built a walking path. \nThey put park benches along the way and a couple of little shelters so \nthey could come right out the door and walk. I don't know how far it \nis--maybe a mile or two. So it is just simple things like that. Before \nthey had no place to go at all to get that kind of exercise.\n  So again, this Prevention and Public Health Fund, I hope, will remain \na priority, and I hope the Senator from Connecticut will continue his \ngreat leadership in this area. I thank him for that and for his \nexcellent statement. If on the outside I can ever be of help in any \nway, let me know. But I know it is in good hands with the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I want, again, to thank my great friend, Senator \nHarkin, for the legacy of public health advocacy that he will leave for \nall of us. I pledge to him that I will carry on, among many others, I \nam sure, that legacy and advocacy.\n  The Senator mentioned that it is easy to be unhealthy and harder to \nbe healthy. Part of the reason is lack of awareness and education, and \nperhaps, in some instances, even a lack of income and wherewithal. Just \nlet me pose the question to him of whether that impression is true.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my friend will yield, I think that is absolutely true. \nFirst of all, it is true that a lot of times low-income people don't \nhave access to a more healthy environment. The food deserts we call \nthem in our inner cities, where they do not get the fresh fruits and \nvegetables and items like that. That has to be addressed also, making \nit easier for them to be healthy. Again, it is an awareness.\n  I would say to my friend one other thing, and I hope my friend will \ntake a look at what is now undergoing a trial period. It is something \nthat was put in the last farm bill as a trial period for food stamp \nrecipients--people who are on what they call food stamps, which are not \nfood stamps anymore, as the Senator knows--to provide incentives for \nlow-income people, people who use food stamps, to purchase more fruits \nand vegetables rather than just starches, fats, and sugars. That \nproject is ongoing now. So I would say to the Senator that perhaps next \nyear he might want to take a look at that with the Secretary of \nAgriculture and see how that project is doing.\n  Again, this is just a trial, an experiment, to see what we can do to \nincentivize people who are on food stamps to use them more for more \nhealthy foods. But it is that lack of awareness. The Senator is \nabsolutely correct.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. My impression also is--and perhaps the Senator has \nsome views on this--that, in a way, we have a responsibility in this \nbody to create that awareness and to spend the money on what should be \nregarded as an investment. It is spending, and it involves funding. But \nreally the way to look at it is as an investment in education, in the \nclinics and the doctors and the services that can make Americans \nhealthier and save us dollars over the long term--not only in the money \nspent on truly preventable diseases but also avoiding the suffering and \nthe pain that is involved in many of those diseases, whether it is \ncancer or heart disease or diabetes, which are connected to so many \npreventable conditions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend. I remember Dr. Andrew Weil, who is \nvery well known in this country and a good friend of mine, once made \nthe statement sometime ago in a hearing that the default state of the \nhuman body is to be healthy. The body wants to be healthy. After all \nthese millennia of changes, the body wants to be healthy. The problem \nis we put all these obstacles in the way.\n  I think that is true of people. People want to be healthy. They may \nnot know that some of their lifestyle choices, some of what they do is \nprovoking their illnesses. So I think it is our job to make people more \naware of that and to help to provide some assistance, to provide some \nincentives for them to have a more healthy lifestyle.\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut, people will be here, I hope, for \nthe next highway bill. We haven't been able to get one for a long time. \nI was here for the last one. I had an amendment I thought was going to \npass. It was simply this: Any time Federal funds are involved in \ncommunities for streets or roads or highways or bridges or whatever, \nthere must be incorporated in the plan provisions for walkways or bike \npaths along the side. I didn't say they had to build them. I just said \nthey had to be put in the plans.\n  They are doing that in Europe, by the way. Every road, every street \nbuilt has a walkway or a bike path--both for walking or biking.\n  Someone here objected to it, and we didn't get it. But I still think \nthat would be something, again, to make people more aware. If they are \nincorporated in the plans, they might see it doesn't cost that much \nmore to add it on to a road or bridge or whatever--the streets we are \nbuilding in this country. Again, it makes it easier for people to be \nhealthy--just a little thing like that. So I hope the Senator would \ntake a look at that the next time the highway bill comes up.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I certainly will pledge to do so and \nwill\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nthink of the Senator from Iowa when we do, hopefully, consider the next \nsuch highway bill. But let me just say, in conclusion, for myself, I \nwas not going to mention the ``R'' word--the retirement word--because \nit seems almost impossible to imagine this body without the Senator \nfrom Iowa not only because of his advocacy of the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund but also his constant reminding us and his unceasing \nadvocacy for better public health, for championing the interests of \nordinary working men and women. So I thank him for that legacy to me \nand for so many others.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                  International Disability Rights Day\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see my friend from Tennessee here on the \nfloor, but I want to take a few minutes on another subject.\n  Today, December 3, is International Disability Rights Day--\nInternational Disability Rights Day. It is observed around the globe as \na day to think about, consider, and support more fully inclusion of \npeople with disabilities in all aspects of our societies, to provide \nthe support and the accommodations for people with disabilities to get \na good education, to get employment, and to be able to enjoy all \naspects of life with their families and their friends in all societies \naround the world.\n  This date commemorates this fight for equality and opportunity and \naccess for people with disabilities all around the globe. In 150 \ncountries and the European Union, they have ratified the United Nations \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a day to \ncelebrate a future of increased opportunities and inclusion for people \nwith disabilities.\n  I am proud of the fact that we in America have been the leader in the \nworld on disability rights and inclusion. Beginning with IDEA--the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--and followed up by the \nRehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, we helped set \nthe framework for equal opportunity and full participation for \nindividuals with disabilities. Most of the world now shares those \nprinciples, and they have shown their support by signing onto this \ntreaty--this convention. But there is a difference between signing on \nto principles and implementing them.\n\n  By ratifying the CRPD, as it is known--the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities--we can play an important role in helping \nother countries actually implement that treaty, that convention, those \nprinciples.\n  Under our system of government, the President of the United States \nhas already signed for the United States on this treaty, but under our \nsystem of government, under our Constitution, that must be ratified by \na vote in the Senate, a vote requiring two-thirds of those present and \nvoting--not two-thirds of the Senate, two-thirds of those present and \nvoting. That is what it says in the Constitution.\n  As we all know, 2 years ago this month we brought this treaty up for \na vote in the Senate, and it failed by six votes. I think at that time \nthere was a lot of misinformation about it. But under our system, it \nhad to go back to the White House, it having died that Congress. It \ncame back this Congress under the great leadership of Senator Menendez. \nWe had further hearings on it. The bill was reported out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee this summer. Yet we cannot bring it to the floor \nbecause of some objections by a few on the Republican side--not every \nRepublican, just a few.\n  I always want to point out that we had courageous Republicans \nsupporting this. Ever since the adoption of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, Senator McCain has been a stalwart supporter of the \nrights of people with disabilities. Senator Barrasso from Wyoming, \nSenator Kirk from Illinois, Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire, Senator \nMurkowski of Alaska, and Senator Collins from Maine have all been \nsupporters. That is as it should be. Disability policy has never been a \npartisan issue. In this body, in the 30 years I have served here, it \nhas never been a partisan issue.\n  I am sorry the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \nseems to be caught up in some kind of partisanship, and that shouldn't \nbe. I was hoping we might bring it up for another vote before we left. \nI asked consent to do so, and it was objected to by the junior Senator \nfrom Utah at that time. So this Congress will adjourn once again \nwithout ratifying this convention.\n  Last evening I was privileged to share an honor by the U.S. \nInternational Council on Disabilities with Professor Patrick Quinn, a \ncitizen of Ireland, who was very instrumental in drafting the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the United \nNations. He pointed out that much of what they did was based on the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and that it would send a bad signal \naround the world if we aren't going to join with the community of \nnations in helping them implement the principles. As I said, we can \nsign on to the principles, but implementing them is quite another \nstory. That is where we can be very helpful.\n  Some people say that we can do that on our own, that we don't need to \nbe a part of this treaty. But we don't have the wherewithal to go to \nevery country and do that. We don't have that many personnel. We have \nbudget constraints too. But if we join with other nations--and there \nare other nations that are very good at implementing disability policy, \nboth in the European Union--and I might mention that great nation of \nIreland. They have been very good at implementing disability policies. \nWe could work with other countries, and when we go to other countries \nto help them implement these principles so that people with \ndisabilities can have a fair place in their societies, an equal place \nin their societies, it is better if we speak a common language--not the \nUnited States going in and telling them ``Here is what you should do'' \nbut go into a country with other nations and say ``Here is what we do. \nHere is what we do together. Here is what we can do to help you \nimplement the principles on which you signed the treaty.'' It is a \nshame we can't ratify it.\n  Again I point out, as I have many times, that it has broad support in \nour society. Think about this. We have a measure coming before the \nSenate--that doesn't go before the House, just the Senate. We have a \nmeasure that is supported by the following: The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--Tom Donahue has been a stalwart supporter of this from the \nvery beginning. We have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Business \nRoundtable, led by a former Republican Governor of Michigan, John \nEngler, came out in strong support of this. The veterans groups all \nsupport this. We have all of the faith-based groups. In fact, on \nNovember 10 of this year, we received a letter from the National \nAssociation of Evangelicals supporting this treaty. The high-tech \nindustries. All of the disability groups without exception support \nthis.\n  I must also mention that one of the strong supporters who has poured \nhis heart into trying to get this adopted is our former majority leader \nof the Senate, Bob Dole. I would also point out that every former \nRepublican leader of the Senate supports this treaty--Bob Dole, Trent \nLott, and Bill Frist. Every former President of the United States, from \nJimmy Carter, to George H.W. Bush, to President Clinton, President \nGeorge W. Bush, and President Obama--all support this. So we would \nthink this would be a slam dunk, but there are a few who have blocked \nthis from coming up. Over 800 disability, civil rights, and faith \ngroups, 20 top veterans organizations, and I mentioned the Chamber of \nCommerce and the Business Roundtable--all support this.\n  It is sad that on this International Disability Rights Day, I am sad \nto say, it looks as though the clock is running out and we will not \neven vote again on it this year, let alone adopt it.\n  Next year I will not be here. I am retiring next year. My friends on \nthe Republican side will take over the Senate. I hope they will pick up \non this and take this treaty--move it through their committee and bring \nit out on the floor. It should not be a partisan issue. If there are \nsome things that need to be done with the reservations, understandings, \nand declarations, fine. There were some changes made this last time to \naccommodate the concerns\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\nof people who were concerned about homeschooling. There is a whole new \nthing that was put in there on homeschooling.\n  I am hopeful we will continue our efforts to pass this and to become \na part of this international effort.\n  People wonder: The United States--we are so good on disability \npolicy, we can help people with disabilities all around the globe. I \ncan't say how many times I have had people who have talked to me in the \npast, young people who are students in universities who got some kind \nof a grant to go overseas to study but can't do it because of \naccessibility issues in other countries. They just can't get around. \nThey can't find adequate housing. So it is still part of discrimination \nglobally, and, again, we should be a part of it.\n  So I take the floor on this International Disability Rights Day to \nask that this Senate in the future take up the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities, ratify it, and let's become a part of the \ninternational effort to work with every other country in the world to \nimplement the kinds of policies we have in this country that provide \nequal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency to people with disabilities--the four great goals of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. We can do this, we should do it, \nand we should do it with our friends around the globe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I wish to \nacknowledge once again my gratitude for Senator Harkin and his \nleadership for these past 2 years that I have had the privilege of \nworking with him as ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and to acknowledge once again that there has been no \none in this body on either side of the aisle who has been a greater \nchampion for Americans with disabilities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for those kind remarks. Let me say \nagain what a pleasure it has been to work with the Senator from \nTennessee for the last few years. In the last couple of years, we \nbrought a lot of meaningful legislation through our committee, signed \nby the President. In fact, as my friend from Tennessee pointed out, we \nhad 21 bills through our committee signed by the President--the most \nproductive committee I think in the entire Congress; I know in the \nSenate.\n  So as I retire, the Senator from Tennessee, I hope, will be taking \nover the HELP Committee, and it will be in good hands. The Senator is a \nperson of good will and good heart and good mind. After all, he has all \nthe background needed--former president of the University of Tennessee, \nformer Secretary of Education, former Governor, and, of course, U.S. \nSenator. So the HELP Committee will be in good hands with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                Inland Waterways Trust Fund Fee Increase\n\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives is expected to pass \ntonight legislation that should be very good news to Americans who care \nabout their jobs and Americans who care about the condition of our \ninland waterway systems.\n  Inland waterway systems aren't on the front page of the U.S. \nnewspapers until a lock closes or something happens and the cargo can't \nget down the river, and then it is big trouble. Which is the case in \nTennessee with the Chickamauga Lock, an old lock that the Army Corps of \nEngineers says could close. It is in such bad shape, and if it were to \nclose it would throw 150,000 heavy trucks on I-75 and disrupt the \neconomy in all of eastern Tennessee. That same picture applies in many \nother parts of our country to these important waterways: The \nMississippi, the Missouri, the Tennessee, and the Ohio--rivers that \ncarry so much of the heavy cargo that provides income and jobs for so \nmany American families.\n  Tonight the House of Representatives is expected to enact the third \npart of a three-part plan that was envisioned in the American \nWaterworks Act of 2012, which would provide a permanent, long-term \nsolution to having the kind of inland waterway system that a great \ncountry such as the United States deserves. I wish to speak for a \nmoment about the effect that has not just on our country but on my home \nState of Tennessee.\n  For our country, it would be hard to imagine how we could carry cars \nand coal and agricultural equipment from the great Midwest and the \nSouth to the rivers to be shipped overseas without the barges that \ncarry that equipment, millions of tons of cargo every year, and it is \nusually cheaper and faster than many other forms of transportation. \nThat means more jobs and more money in the pockets of Americans who are \nable to work for industries that are competitive.\n  The legislation the House is expected to pass will provide $260 \nmillion for inland waterway projects across the country over the next \n10 years. It is important to note that this fee is paid entirely by the \nowners of the big commercial barges that use the locks when they go \ndown the rivers, and that none of it would be paid by the fishing boats \nand recreation boats which also use the locks. In other words, the big \ncommercial barges are going to pay more to get through the locks \nfaster, to save money and to save time, and that is good for the \nfishermen as well, without any cost. This is the third step in the \nAmerican Waterworks Act that was proposed in 2012.\n  This step would increase by 9 cents the way the fee is calculated \nthat the big barge companies pay to go through the locks. The barge \ncompanies have volunteered to do this. They have been pleading with the \nU.S. Congress, saying, ``Please raise the fee we pay to go through the \nlocks so you can use the Corps of Engineers to replace the locks so we \ncan go through faster and cheaper.'' So the House is taking steps to do \nthat tonight. The fee will increase from 20 to 29 cents per gallon of \nfuel used and, as I said, $260 million of that over the next 10 years \nwill go to help repair these locks.\n  The first two steps in the plan of the American Waterworks Act were \nenacted by law earlier this year as part of the Water Resources Reform \nand Development Act. Step 1 was to take the Olmsted lock in Ohio and \ntreat it separately, because it was soaking up all the money that might \nbe available for all the other locks in the country. Step 2 was to \ncreate a prioritization of the locks, so we didn't come here every year \nand say my lock is more important than your lock. And, in fact, with \nthat, the Chickamauga lock in Tennessee became No. 4. And Step 3 is the \nuser fee I talked about earlier.\n  What difference does this legislation mean for the State of Tennessee \nand the Chickamauga lock? Well, for years the Chickamauga lock has been \nsubject to year-by-year efforts by those of us in Congress to find a \nlittle money to repair it, to keep it from closing, all knowing full \nwell that if we didn't replace it, it would one day soon close. Those \ndays are over. This is a long-term solution that says, No. 1, the \nOlmsted lock which has been soaking up the money has been reduced, \nChickamauga lock is a fourth priority in the government, and now we \nhave money paid by the big barge owners that, when combined with the \nannual appropriations, should make it possible to begin to replace \nChickamauga lock beginning in the year in 2016. That would mean it \nwould still take several years to replace the lock. It would mean it \nwould still cost about half a billion dollars. But it would mean that \ninstead of year-by-year appropriations and guessing games that the Army \nCorps of Engineers can have a long-term plan and begin to do the job, \nand those who are making plans to invest in our part of the region--not \njust in Chattanooga but in eastern Tennessee--can know if they do that, \nthe lock would be there to help provide low-cost transportation for \nwhat they manufacture and what they grow.\n  I want to thank a variety of people who have taken great leadership \nin this. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, and I have been \nthe joint sponsors of this legislation in the Senate. We are very \nhopeful that the House will do its work tonight and the Senate will do \nits work next week and that the bill will go to the President before \nthe end of the year and this will be law by the end of the year. So I \nthank him for his leadership.\n  I also want to congratulate Congressman Fleischmann of Chattanooga \nwho\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\nrounded up a group of Republican Members to support this effort, and \nCongressman Duncan from Knoxville. Speaker Boehner has been very \nhelpful, and Congressman Camp has been very helpful.\n  In the Senate I would like to thank Senator Vitter, who is the \nranking member of the Environment & Public Works Committee for his \nleadership on this effort, and I would like to thank Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, and Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, for \ntheir cooperation on this.\n  Nothing is ever done in the U.S. Congress until it is finally done. \nSo this is passing the House tonight and it is expected to pass the \nSenate next week, which is very good news for Americans who depend on \nthe inland waterways for their jobs, and in Tennessee where change--\ninstead of a year-by-year appropriation, it is an effort, it is the \nfirst chance we have had to have a long-term solution to the \nreplacement over the next several years of Chickamauga lock beginning \nas early as the year 2016.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Kearney and Pappert Nominations\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise and ask unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise this evening to talk about two of our judicial nominations who \nare before the Senate today. We have gotten through one vote, and we \nwill be having several more on a number of judges. The two I will speak \nabout are Mark Kearney and Jerry Pappert, and I know my colleague \nSenator Toomey is with us and I will make some remarks and I will \nobviously be here for his remarks as well.\n  First and foremost, I am grateful to be working with Senator Toomey \non these nominations as we have on others. It is a long and difficult \nprocess for everyone, ever more so if you are a candidate, someone who \nputs yourself forward to be a U.S. district court judge. We are \ngrateful that individuals are willing to do that, but it does not work \nunless we work together here in the Senate, and Senator Toomey and I \nhave been working together over several years now. We have got one \nadditional nomination after this, we hope, by the end of the year.\n  I would like to give a little bit of biographical background on both \nof these nominees. Mark Kearney is currently managing shareholder at \nElliot Greenleaf & Siedzikowski, where he has worked since 1990. He has \nspent almost a quarter of a century in a firm that does a wide variety \nof legal matters. I know this firm well and I know the work they do on \nlitigation and all kinds of complex litigation. Mark has broad and \ndiverse experience in that firm. Previously he worked at the Elliot \nMannino & Flaherty firm, going back and forth in his days at the Elliot \nGreenleaf & Siedzikowski firm.\n  After law school he clerked in the Delaware Court of Chancery \nfollowing his legal training. Of course that is a court that has a high \ndegree of specialization. A lot of business matters and obviously \ncorporate matters come before that very well-known court in Delaware.\n  Mark Kearney is also obviously very active in his community and I \nhave known him for a couple of decades now. He serves on various \ncharitable and civic organizations including director for Legal Aid of \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Bar Institute as well, and \nthe Montgomery County Bar Foundation.\n  Finally, in that vein of service to his community, he has worked as a \nvolunteer child advocate of the Montgomery Child Advocacy Project since \n2007 and served as director of that organization from 2009 to 2012. \nMontgomery County is one of our largest counties by way of population, \njust bordering Philadelphia. It is a big county that has challenges as \nany county of its size, and to have a judge--or nominee whom we hope \nwill become a judge after our voting--to have spent that time with \nchildren in an advocacy position is a great testament to Mark's \ncommitment.\n  So whether you focus on his academic credentials as someone who had a \nwide variety of matters come before him as a lawyer in a big firm, \nwhether it is volunteer work and therefore his commitment to service, \nMark is well prepared and I believe one of the best nominees we have \nput forward for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania.\n  I have known him a long time. When I make a decision about whether to \nsupport a particular candidate for judge of any court, but especially a \ndistrict court judge, I look at their academic training and experience \nand whether it is experience as a lawyer and advocate or in some cases \na lawyer as well as a judge. You have to make an assessment of \nsomeone's character, their integrity, their judicial temperament, all \nof those qualities and attributes you would want to find in a judge. On \nall those, Mark Kearney is someone I know personally who possesses \nthose attributes and qualifications. But I also know him as someone who \njust by virtue of his record that we can recite here is well prepared \nto serve as a district court judge.\n  I would ask my colleagues to give him on this vote all the \nconsideration that is warranted.\n  Jerry Pappert, more formally Gerald Pappert--I think I am allowed to \ncall him Jerry until he becomes a judge--is someone I met in State \ngovernment. I was in an elected position--it is now 18 years ago I was \nelected, and early in my term I was having a meeting with the attorney \ngeneral, Mike Fisher, who is now on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. \nAttorney General Fisher brought his chief of staff, his first deputy, \nas they called it in that department, to a meeting with my chief of \nstaff and we sat down at a restaurant to have pizza one night to talk \nabout how our offices could work together, even though they don't have \nan overlapping jurisdiction. But it was one of those meetings you never \nforget. It was the first time I met Jerry Pappert. I knew then of his \ncommitment to service, because he was serving in the top position in \nthe State attorney general's office. Years later he became an attorney \ngeneral when there was a vacancy. He served as the attorney general of \nPennsylvania.\n  He currently serves as the chairman of the Pennsylvania Banking and \nSecurities Commission in Harrisburg. Previously he was a legislative \nappointee to the Commonwealth Financing Authority and Department of \nCommunity and Economic Development, a very important authority which \nmakes determinations about where to invest tax dollars--economic \ndevelopment dollars--across Pennsylvania and how to make those \ndifficult decisions about where dollars should go and how to grow the \neconomy.\n  From December of 2003 to January of 2005, as I mentioned, he was the \nattorney general of the State, and prior to that serving as first \ndeputy. As attorney general he was in the National Association of \nAttorneys General, dealing with issues that relate to Pennsylvania and \nlaw enforcement and prosecution, but also on national issues that are \ncommon to all the States. So I know Jerry well and I know him to be \nsomeone of the highest caliber and integrity and commitment to service \nand commitment to justice. His long and significant history of service \nto our Commonwealth prepares him well to serve his Commonwealth, but \nalso a Federal district court position as a U.S. district court judge.\n  I can say the same of Jerry that I said of Mark Kearney, in terms of \nhis qualifications, experience, but also his character and his \nintegrity. I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about both of \nthese candidates and certainly am grateful to have a chance to work \nwith Senator Toomey on moving these nominations forward and we hope \ntonight bringing them to a conclusion upon confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to offer my support as well to the two nominees to serve as \njudges for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, Jerry Pappert and Mark Kearney, whom we are scheduled to \nconfirm in a short time.\n  Let me start by thanking Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley \nfor facilitating this process and handling this at the committee level, \nand\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\nI want to thank Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for bringing these \nnominees to the Senate floor. I also want to take a moment to thank my \ncolleague from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, \nfor all the work he and I have been able to do together. The \ncollaboration we have had has been very constructive and it has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Casey. In the 4 years I have been in the \nSenate, we have confirmed 11 district court judges. We have been able \nto place a judge in the Reading courthouse in Berks County which had \nbeen vacant for 3 years. We were able to place a judge in Easton \ncourthouse in Northampton County which had been vacant for 10 years. \nWith the confirmations that I am certainly hopeful about tonight, Mr. \nPappert and Mr. Kearney, that number will rise to 13 members of the \nFederal bench from Pennsylvania in just the past 4 years.\n  We have one additional district court nominee, Joseph Leeson, \nawaiting a vote from the full Senate, and I am looking at a speedy \nconfirmation of his candidacy as well.\n  Before I speak on the two nominees before us this evening, I want to \nbriefly note how pleased I was that on November 20 the Senate confirmed \nWendy Beetlestone to serve on the District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. She was confirmed unanimously by voice vote \nand I think that was a testament to her strong qualifications. I am \ndelighted that Senator Casey and I were able to see that to completion.\n  Let me say a couple of words about Jerry Pappert.\n  Senator Casey spoke about Mr. Pappert. Jerry Pappert is eminently \nqualified for this post. He is a graduate of Notre Dame Law School and \nhas an extensive and diverse legal background. He is currently a \npartner at Cozen O'Connor, which is a practice that has an emphasis on \ncommercial litigation.\n  Prior to that he was the general counsel at Cephalon, where he \noversaw all of the company's litigation, financial transactions, and \nintellectual property issues.\n  Not only has he handled a very wide range of issues in the private \nsector, but Mr. Pappert has also demonstrated his dedication to public \nservice. As Senator Casey pointed out, he was a very successful \nattorney general for Pennsylvania for 6 years. He has successfully \nargued cases before the U.S. and Pennsylvania Supreme Courts. He won a \nlandmark case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Booth v. Churner, which \nset forth the administrative exhaustion requirement for a prisoner \nseeking to sue in Federal court.\n  Mr. Pappert has also enjoyed bipartisan support in the Senate. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee successfully voted him out of committee on a \nvoice vote back in September.\n  Mark Kearney is the other gentleman we will be voting on in a short \ntime. He is a graduate of Villanova University School of Law and a very \nsuccessful attorney. As Senator Casey pointed out, he is a managing \nshareholder at Elliott Greenleaf & Siedzikowski, where he has been for \n24 years and practices commercial litigation.\n  Mr. Kearney is highly respected by his colleagues. He received the AV \npeer review rating in the Martindale-Hubbell system--the highest \nrating. He has also taken time to give back to his community. He put a \nlot of time and energy into an issue that is very important to me; that \nis, protecting children from dangerous predators. Mr. Kearney has \nworked with the Montgomery County Child Advocacy Project, representing \nabused children, and I commend him for that service.\n  Mr. Kearney has also enjoyed bipartisan support in the Senate. He was \nvoice voted out by the Senate Judiciary Committee, reflecting unanimous \nsupport for his candidacy.\n  It is clear, and I believe strongly, that both Mr. Pappert and Mr. \nKearney have the experience, acumen, and commitment to public service \nthat will make them excellent additions to the Federal bench. I am \npleased to speak on their behalf, and I am grateful to Senator Casey \nfor the cooperative effort that has gotten us to this point.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of these two \noutstanding individuals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nhas expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6292-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF DAVID J.

Mr. President, one of Vermont's longest-serving \njournalists, Sam Hemingway, recently retired after a distinguished 37-\nyear career with the Burlington Free Press. His career at the paper \nspans a period of our State's history filled with interesting stories, \nand Sam covered so many of them.\n  During the course of those many years Sam captured the pulse of \nVermont, whether through his personalized columns or his probing \nreports. Sam's institutional memory was a rich and vital resource for \nthe newspaper and for his readers. His writing talents, his reporting \nskills and his ability to make personal connections will be sorely \nmissed.\n  Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in extending all best wishes to \nSam and his family as they begin a new chapter in their lives.\n  I ask that this Burlington Free Press article sketching Sam's tenure \nand retirement plans be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 7, 2014]\n\n                   Hemingway To Retire After 37 Years\n\n              (By Adam Silverman, Free Press Staff Writer)\n\n       Sam Hemingway, a reporter, editor and columnist who is \n     among Vermont's most well-known journalists, will retire from \n     the Burlington Free Press after a career of more than 37 \n     years.\n       ``You don't know how much this place means to me,'' he told \n     the staff in announcing his departure Tuesday afternoon, \n     ``and I will miss you, and I will miss this work, so much.''\n       A self-described ``generalist,'' Hemingway's award-winning \n     coverage stretched from the rejection of a controversial \n     shopping mall development in Williston in 1977, through the \n     illegal shipping of arms from a Vermont business to South \n     Africa in violation of the apartheid-era embargo, to a weeks-\n     long trip to embed with the Vermont National Guard in \n     Afghanistan in 2010, among numerous examples across portions \n     of five decades.\n       ``There's a great thrill, if you're into journalism, if \n     it's in your blood, to be present in moments of great \n     importance and to write stories that actually make a \n     difference,'' Hemingway said Tuesday in an interview before \n     addressing his colleagues.\n       ``When you work for a paper like this, in a state like \n     Vermont, if you do a story and do it well, with the idea that \n     this is going to turn the rock over and show something that \n     people need to know about, there will be results,'' he \n     continued. ``You can help make something happen. That's a \n     great feeling.''\n       Free Press Executive Editor Michael Townsend praised \n     Hemingway as a colleague and a journalist.\n       ``With his breadth of experience, Sam knew where to find \n     the information,'' Townsend said. ``He had a great eye for a \n     hard news story. He was dependable, productive and engaged. \n     We will miss his unique style.''\n       Hemingway, 66, wanted to be a newspaper reporter since \n     boyhood in New Haven, Conn. With the help of a ditto machine, \n     he produced a newspaper for his neighborhood. Coverage \n     included missing dogs, families' vacations plans and who \n     might have been suffering from the measles.\n       He edited his high-school newspaper and then studied \n     journalism at Syracuse University in New York before moving \n     to Vermont in 1971. He helped start the Lamoille County \n     Weekly in Johnson, spent a year teaching journalism at \n     Johnson State College, and then began freelancing for the \n     Burlington Free Press.\n       He joined the staff in 1977, when he was assigned to \n     provide full-time coverage of the debate over the Pyramid \n     Mall proposal percolating in Williston. Hemingway attended 54 \n     night meetings regarding the Act 250 development-control law \n     over two years before the project was rejected.\n       Then came the story Space Research Corp., a North Troy \n     weapons manufacturer that was breaking an international \n     embargo to sell millions of dollars of artillery and shells \n     to South Africa--possibly with the backing of the CIA. \n     Hemingway recalled sneaking onto the military base at Camp \n     Lejune, N.C., with a colleague and knocking on the door of a \n     suspected CIA agent said to be involved--and then departing \n     in a hurry when the agent called base security. Eventually, \n     two company officials were convicted of related crimes.\n       As with his more recent coverage, including of teen girls \n     from the Burlington area lured into working as prostitutes in \n     New York, of the priest sex abuse claims against the Roman \n     Catholic Church, of the heroin epidemic sweeping Vermont, \n     Hemingway's reporting exposed a rarely seen underbelly of \n     Vermont.\n       ``If you didn't shine a light on it, the cases might or \n     might not have reached a point where people went to jail,'' \n     Hemingway said. ``But there's more assurance that justice is \n     going to be meted out.''\n       Hemingway is perhaps best known for his column, which he \n     wrote from 1989 to 2005 (with a yearlong hiatus to cover the \n     presidential campaign of former Gov. Howard Dean).\n       ``It was wonderful to have a voice,'' Hemingway said. ``The \n     great thing about that column was it wasn't just a political \n     column, it wasn't just a crime column, it wasn't a slice of \n     life, it wasn't a feature--it was all of those things. And it \n     would change. Sometimes it was first-person. Sometimes it was \n     personal. Sometimes it was investigative. I broke stories in \n     the column. And it was very well-read.''\n       The column aimed to give a voice to the powerless, \n     Hemingway said.\n       ``It was average folks,'' he said, ``and that was the whole \n     point of the column: to be an outlet for people who weren't \n     newsmakers who maybe had trouble with government or a problem \n     or a personal issue, somebody who lost a kid in a traffic \n     accident.''\n       Hemingway's work earned him 11 Best of Gannett awards from \n     the Burlington Free Press' parent company, along with \n     citations for excellence from the New England Newspaper and \n     Press Association, the Vermont Press Association and others.\n       The time is right to step away, Hemingway said. He has been \n     thinking of stepping away for some time, and he's ready for a \n     change.

Try to \n     keep looking for the stories that need to be done. . . .

Mr. President, Vermont is a farming State: dairy, \nlivestock, vegetables or fruit, farms across Vermont are known for \ntheir innovative and sustainable approaches to farming and food \nproduction.\n  The dairy industry in particular is known throughout Vermont, and far \nbeyond. Dairy cows are a familiar sight for those who live in or visit \nour State, and Vermont farms have been recognized both domestically and \ninternationally for their dairy-based products. The cheese-making \ntradition in Vermont dates back to the early 1900s, when Vermont dairy \nfarmers sought uses for their surplus milk. Since those early days, \nmany farms have developed methods for artisanal cheese production.\n  Recently, Jasper Hill--a celebrated farm in Greensboro Bend, VT--won \ninternational recognition at the World Cheese Awards in London, when \nits Bayley Hazen Blue cheese won the award for the ``World's Best \nUnpasturized Cheese.'' Besting more than 2,600 submissions, Jasper \nHill's award-winning blue cheese also took home a Super Gold award. Six \nother cheeses produced by Jasper Hill also won awards. And two other \nVermont cheese makers--Grafton Village Cheese and the Vermont \nCreamery--were also recognized.\n  Some might skip over a story about the World Cheese Awards. But in \nVermont, we take pride in the products we produce from the livestock \nnurtured and raised on Vermont's rich land. Farming remains a fabric of \nour American story, and in Vermont, it is a tradition that has spanned \ngenerations.\n  Congratulations to the Cellars at Jasper Hill, to Grafton Village \nCheese, and to the Vermont Creamery for their recent recognitions. They \nrepresent the quality and high standards that are a hallmark of the \nVermont brand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a story recently featured \nabout these dairies on Vermont Public Radio be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Vermont Public Radio, Nov. 17, 2014]\n\n   Cellars at Jasper Hill Wins ``World's Best Unpasteurized Cheese''\n\n                          (By Angela Evancie)\n\n       Before a recent batch of the Cellars at Jasper Hill's \n     Bayley Hazen Blue cheese was finished aging, before it was \n     ready to sell, and before it would be crowned--or rinded?--\n     ``World's Best Unpasteurized Cheese'' at the World Cheese \n     Awards in London, its makers knew they had something special.\n       ``I'm not lying when I say we were excited about it at a \n     young age,'' Vince Razionale, sales and inventory manager for \n     Jasper Hill, said by phone Monday. ``We tasted it on day 50, \n     and this particular batch was one that we thought was really \n     on point.'' (So on point, they thought, that it merited an \n     Instagram post.)\n       The more than 250 international cheese experts who judged \n     the 26th annual World Cheese Awards this weekend agreed. \n     Bayley Hazen Blue was selected from more than 2,600 cheeses, \n     first winning a Super Gold award and then its ``World's \n     Best'' award.\n       It isn't the only superlative Vermont can add to its list \n     of aged-milk achievements; Grafton Village Cheese also earned \n     two Super Golds, for its Shepsog and Bismark cheeses, while \n     Vermont Creamery took home one gold for its Bijou goat's milk \n     cheese, and seven bronzes. Six other cheeses by Jasper Hill \n     also won awards, including gold medals for its Cabot \n     Clothbound and Moses Sleeper. ``Ten years ago, American \n     cheese was something to be laughed at in England. Now, \n     collectively, we're a force to be reckoned with.''--Vince \n     Razionale, Jasper Hill Farm\n       Vermont cheese has certainly made a notable debut on the \n     domestic stage. Vermont's Secretary of Agriculture Chuck Ross \n     recently noted that cheeses made here have been named ``Best \n     In Show'' at the American Cheese Society Conference for the \n     past two years: Jasper Hill's Winnimere in 2013, and the \n     Farms for City Kids Foundation's Tarentaise Reserve this \n     year.\n       But Razionale says the international acclaim shows how far \n     cheese making, in the U.S. in general and Vermont in \n     particular, has come.\n       ``Ten years ago, American cheese was something to be \n     laughed at in England. Now, collectively, we're a force to be \n     reckoned with.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6297-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ALAN GROSS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the fifth \nanniversary of the unfair arrest and imprisonment of an American \ncitizen in Cuba from Maryland, Mr. Alan Gross. I stand with his wife \nJudy, and their two daughters in calling for the immediate release of \nMr. Gross by the Cuban government.\n  In 2009, Mr. Gross went to Cuba as a contractor for the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development. On this visit to Cuba, he wanted to \nassist Cuba's Jewish community by improving their access to the \ninternet. With a background in social work, he dedicated his career to \nhelping others around the world.\n  The Cuban government arrested Mr. Gross on December 3, 2009. He was \nheld for 14 months without being charged with a crime. He was \neventually charged as a spy and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n  At 65 years old, Mr. Gross' physical and mental health has suffered \nseverely over the past 5 years. He has lost a significant amount of \nweight and developed several painful medical conditions. His contact \nwith his family is extremely limited, compounding his anxiety. On his \nbirthday, May 2, 2014, Mr. Gross made several statements that \ndemonstrated the mental strain and anguish that he feels daily. \nFollowing the death of his mother in June, he was visited by his wife \nJudy and said his goodbyes to her. Mr. Gross's current physical and \nmental state is at a critical point. The Cuban government must allow \nhim to come home to the United States.\n  Judy Gross has never given up. She continues to put pressure on the \nCuban government, speaking out against the poor treatment of her \nhusband. She is a true inspiration, continuing her fight despite the \nhealth and financial challenges that her family has felt.\n  Every day I think of and pray for the Gross family. I pray that they \nare reunited soon. If Cuba wants to improve relations with the United \nStates, they need to release Mr. Gross now. I thank my colleagues for \nstanding with me and calling for the release of Alan Gross. I look \nforward to the day that we welcome him home to Maryland, and most \nimportantly, to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6297-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6297-S6298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last week I released a staff report \nthat found litigation missteps at the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission are costing taxpayers millions, while at the same time EEOC \nfaces a deep backlog of discrimination complaints.\n  The report finds that the EEOC has had a recent pattern of pursuing \nquestionable cases through sometimes overly aggressive means and as a \nresult has suffered significant court losses that are embarrassing to \nthe agency and costly to taxpayers.\n  Courts have found EEOC's litigation tactics to be so egregious they \nhave ordered EEOC to pay defendants' attorney's fees in 10 cases since \n2011. The courts have criticized EEOC for misuse of its authority, poor \nexpert analysis, and pursuit of novel cases unsupported by law.\n  While the agency has pursued high-profile lawsuits without a \ncomplainant, in March 2014 EEOC reported almost 71,000 unresolved \ncomplaints of discrimination from individuals who filed charges. The \nagency's litigation has recovered almost $200 million less for victims \nthan under the previous administration over the same timeframe.\n  The report finds that EEOC also has suffered from a troubling lack of \ntransparency. In the past 2\\1/2\\ years, EEOC has ignored calls from \ncurrent Commissioners and Congress to allow public review of \nsignificant and controversial guidance prior to its adoption. Also, the \nOffice of General Counsel has, since 2010, failed to issue its standard \nannual report, and the agency is being sued for violating the Freedom \nof Information Act.\n  Certainly, the EEOC of today has had successful enforcement efforts \nand court victories for victims of discrimination, but this report \nfinds the agency is increasingly demonstrating poor judgment and using \nquestionable tactics in pursuit of cases that are not fulfilling the \nEEOC's objective of protecting employees from workplace discrimination.\n  The full report, ``EEOC: An Agency on the Wrong Track? Litigation \nFailures, Misfocused Priorities and Lack of Transparency Raise Concerns \nabout Important Anti-Discrimination Agency,'' may be viewed on the HELP \nCommittee's website, http://www.help.senate.gov/.\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the report's executive summary and \nkey findings printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions--Ranking Member Lamar Alexander (R-TN) Minority Staff Report, \n                             Nov. 24, 2014]\n\n  EEOC: An Agency on the Wrong Track? Litigation Failures, Misfocused \n  Priorities, and Lack of Transparency Raise Concerns About Important \n                       Anti-Discrimination Agency\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) serves \n     an important role in our nation's workplaces. Under the \n     leadership of five commissioners and a general counsel, EEOC \n     is charged with protecting employees from discrimination at \n     work through enforcement of equal opportunity employment \n     laws. The commission investigates allegations of \n     discrimination and seeks to mediate cases, allowing lawsuits \n     to go forward if settlements are unsuccessful. The general \n     counsel pursues allegations of discrimination in court and \n     has been deputized by the commission to initiate litigation \n     in many instances. The commission also issues guidance to \n     inform the public about how it believes employers should \n     interpret and apply the laws.\n       Today's EEOC, however, is pursuing many questionable cases \n     through sometimes overly aggressive means--and, as a result, \n     has suffered significant court losses that are embarrassing \n     to the agency and costly to taxpayers. Courts have found \n     EEOC's litigation tactics to be so egregious they have \n     ordered EEOC to pay defendants' attorney's fees in ten cases \n     since 2011. The courts have criticized EEOC for misuse of its \n     authority, poor expert analysis, and pursuit of novel cases \n     unsupported by law. Several courts have openly criticized \n     EEOC for its failure to satisfy pre-litigation requirements, \n     such as attempting to resolve discrimination disputes out of \n     court; yet, the general counsel is leading an effort to \n     prevent court review of such requirements.\n       These court losses also have come at a significant cost to \n     victims of workplace discrimination. While EEOC's monetary \n     recoveries for victims through settlements are up, EEOC's \n     litigation has recovered almost $200 million less for victims \n     than under the previous administration over the same time \n     frame. In March 2014, EEOC reported almost 71,000 unresolved \n     complaints of discrimination from individuals who filed \n     charges with EEOC.\n       EEOC also has suffered from a troubling lack of \n     transparency. In the past two and a half years, EEOC has \n     ignored calls from current commissioners and Congress to \n     allow public review of significant and controversial guidance \n     prior to its adoption. Also, the Office of General Counsel \n     has, since 2010, failed to issue its standard annual report, \n     and the agency is being sued for violating the Freedom of \n     Information Act.\n       This staff report will first explain the background and \n     operation of EEOC. Next, the report will explore costly \n     rebukes of EEOC's recent litigation practices. The report \n     will also discuss the ways in which EEOC has shown a lack of \n     transparency.\n       Today's EEOC has had successful enforcement efforts and \n     court victories for victims of discrimination, but this \n     report finds the agency is increasingly demonstrating poor \n     judgment and using questionable tactics in pursuit of cases \n     that are not fulfilling the EEOC's objective of protecting \n     employees from workplace discrimination.\n\n\n                              key findings\n\n       EEOC's Office of General Counsel frequently initiates \n     litigation without the benefit of a commission vote. In FY \n     2012, only three of 122 lawsuits filed by EEOC were brought \n     to the commission for a vote. According to a former EEOC \n     general counsel who served from 2003 to 2005, this represents \n     a significant departure from the previous commission.\n       EEOC has been sanctioned by courts and ordered to pay \n     attorney's fees ten times since 2011 for untenable litigation \n     and litigation strategies. (See Appendix 1.)\n       Monetary awards pursued in litigation for victims of \n     discrimination are down from previous years. In FY 2012 and \n     2013, EEOC recovered $44.2 million and $38.6 million, \n     respectively--the lowest recovery amounts in the past 16 \n     years.\n       As of March 2014, EEOC had 70,781 unresolved discrimination \n     charges pending.\n       EEOC's credibility is at risk. As one commissioner \n     described, EEOC's ``reputation and credibility has . . . \n     suffered from several recent lawsuits where [EEOC was] not \n     only sanctioned, but openly chastised by the courts.''\n       A federal court reprimanded EEOC for being ``negligent in \n     its discovery obligations, dilatory in cooperating with \n     defense counsel, and somewhat cavalier in its responsibility \n     to the United States District Court.''\n       EEOC caused a small employer to spend $100,000 attempting \n     to comply with requests for information that, according to a \n     federal judge, ``EEOC had no authority to obtain.''\n       A unanimous three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Tenth Circuit found ``[t]he EEOC continued to \n     litigate . . . claims after it became clear there were no \n     grounds upon which to proceed.''\n       EEOC is not consistently meeting its statutory mandate to \n     attempt to resolve discrimination disputes out of court. One \n     court found EEOC ``blatantly contravene[d] Title VII's \n     emphasis on resolving disputes without resort to \n     litigation,'' and another found EEOC ignored its obligation \n     to conciliate. EEOC's general counsel is leading the fight to \n     prevent court review of such efforts, and the U.S. Supreme \n     Court is reviewing the issue this term.\n       Successful conciliations (i.e. resolution of a case outside \n     of court) have decreased from 8,273 during the first five \n     years of the previous administration to 6,967 during the same \n     time period in the current administration.\n       Despite Office of Management and Budget best practices \n     found in an agency bulletin and support from a majority of \n     commissioners, EEOC does not allow the public to review or \n     comment upon its draft guidance, even in cases of novel, \n     significant or controversial guidance. This is especially \n     concerning because in two cases last year, the U.S. Supreme \n     Court rejected substantive positions found in EEOC guidance.\n       Unlike prior years, EEOC's Office of General Counsel has \n     only published one annual report since 2010. These reports \n     summarize the activities and litigation record of the Office \n     of General Counsel.\n       EEOC is being sued for failing to meet statutory deadlines \n     imposed by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and EEOC's \n     own FOIA regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6298-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING COLONEL ELIOT NATHANIEL PEARL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

On July 12, 2014, Colonel Pearl died at the age of 95 \npeacefully at his home in Silver Spring, MD.\n  Today, Colonel Pearl's family will lay him to rest at Arlington \nNational Cemetery with full military honors in recognition of his 36 \nyears of service to our Nation. In 1939, Eliot graduated from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Instead of becoming a doctor, \nEliot chose to serve his Nation during World War II, much to the \nchagrin of his father. He was commissioned into the Army Air Corps and \nserved as a cryptographic message center officer. Colonel Pearl served \ntwo active duty tours in World War II and the Korean war including a \ndeployment to Panama. Colonel Pearl was also one of the founding \ninstructors of the Department of Defense's cryptology schoolhouse.\n  After Colonel Pearl separated from active duty service, he continued \nto serve our Nation in the Air Force Reserve for another 25 years \nconcurrently working as a cryptologist at the National Security Agency, \nFort Meade, MD.\n  On August 16, 1978, Colonel Pearl retired from the Air Force. He was \nawarded the American Theater Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal, \nand National Defense Service Medal.\n  We continue to live safe and free because of individuals like Colonel \nPearl. He committed his life to serving our Nation while in uniform and \nas a civilian. Eliot defended our Nation and led the way for the next \ngeneration that will secure our future.\n  Colonel Pearl's beloved son David and his beloved second wife Joyce, \npreceded him in death. He is survived by his sons, Mark A. Pearl \n(Pamela), Scott M. Pearl (Renee) and Geoffrey B. Anthony Pearl; five \nloving grandchildren: David, Vincent, Samuel, Anthony and Daniel; his \ndevoted sister Eva Erony; his first wife Thelma Pearl; his loving niece \nSusan Erony (Jay Jaroslav); and his nephew Alan Erony.\n  As we say goodbye, we also say thank you for your service that keeps \nour Nation strong and free.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a New \nJersey company, Louis Berger, and to draw the Senate's attention to the \n30th anniversary of CHELBI, Louis Berger's successful engineering, \ndesign and infrastructure partnership in the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Louis Berger was established in 1953 and has in the years since \ndeveloped into a multidisciplinary global consulting firm founded on \nits dedication to engineering excellence.\n  Today it has partnerships in major infrastructure projects spanning \nthe globe, including in North America, Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin \nAmerica, and the Middle East.\n  More than just undertaking projects, though, one of Louis Berger's \nfounding principles is to transfer knowledge to people in the local \ncountries and communities in which it operates to ensure the long-term \nsustainability of its projects.\n  For example, in 1984, Louis Berger undertook a groundbreaking \npartnership known as CHELBI--a joint venture between Louis Berger \nInternational and China Highway Planning and Design Institute, HPDI, \nConsultants.\n  This partnership created a new pathway for knowledge sharing in \nengineering design between the United States and China, and to millions \nof dollars for the U.S.--and New Jersey--economy.\n  Over the past 30 years, CHELBI has provided international and \ndomestic consulting services for more than 600 highways, bridges, and \nother projects in over 30 provinces and cities in China, totaling more \nthan 10,000 kilometers, including the 36 kilometer long Hangzhou \nBridge, one of the longest ocean-crossing bridges in the world.\n  CHELBI also fosters international communications and cooperation \nbetween the Chinese consulting engineering field and counterparts in \nWestern countries and projects beyond China.\n  In fact, it is my understanding that the partners in CHELBI have \nagreed to extend their historic venture for another 10 years beginning \nin 2014.\n  So today I would like to recognize the cooperation in engineering \ndesign between the United States and China since 1984, as encompassed \nby CHELBI's work, including its partners at Louis Berger and China \nHighway Planning and Design Institute, HPDI, Consultants.\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\n  The continued exchange of knowledge and coordination of work in large \nscale infrastructure projects in China and around the globe help to \nbetter connect people within and between countries and is of tremendous \nbenefit, both for the countries where these infrastructure projects \ntake place but also for U.S. global leadership in engineering \nconsultation and design.\n  CHELBI is to be commended for 30 years of productive work--and I \nwould like to express my continued support for initiatives undertaken \nby the venture and the benefits that such cooperation and coordination \nprovides to both the United States and China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6300-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6300-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6300-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2040.

Res. 540\n\n       Whereas in 2007, September 15 of each year was established \n     by the United Nations as the International Day of Democracy, \n     a day set aside to review the state of democracy in the \n     world;\n       Whereas democracy is a means of government that makes \n     manifest the free exercise of certain inalienable rights, \n     among them being the freedom of assembly, the freedom of \n     association, the freedom of the press, and the freedom of \n     speech;\n       Whereas democracy allows for participatory governance, \n     mobilizing citizens to strive for their version of the good \n     and instilling hope that the aspirations of the people may \n     one day be realized;\n       Whereas an analysis of 84 independent studies shows that \n     democracy has a favorable impact on the formation of human \n     capital, the rate of inflation, the level of economic \n     freedom, and the stability of political institutions;\n       Whereas democracy promotes tolerance and respect by \n     recognizing the human dignity of all people and is necessary \n     to the full realization of the values enshrined in the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n       Whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development (OECD) defines ``civil society'' as associations \n     around which society voluntarily organizes itself and which \n     represent a wide range of interests and ties, including \n     community-based organizations, indigenous peoples' \n     organizations, and non-government organizations (NGOs);\n       Whereas a vibrant civil society is an essential element of \n     democratic societies and plays a key role in providing \n     transparency, ensuring the legitimacy of elections, \n     advocating for marginalized groups, and making clear the will \n     of the people;\n       Whereas, since 2012, the International Center for Not-for-\n     Profit Law has identified 69 new restrictive measures in over \n     50 countries hindering the ability of civil society \n     organizations (CSOs) to freely operate;\n       Whereas of the 98 countries for which data is available, \n     research presented in a 2013 article for the Journal of \n     Democracy explains that 12 prohibit and 39 restrict foreign \n     funding of domestic NGOs;\n       Whereas in 2000, the Community of Democracies was founded \n     ``to bring together governments, civil society, and the \n     private sector in the pursuit of a common goal: supporting \n     democratic rules and strengthening democratic norms and \n     institutions around the world'';\n       Whereas in 2011, the United States joined other like-minded \n     governments to establish the ``Lifeline: Embattled Civil \n     Society Organizations Fund'' to provide small grants to CSOs \n     for immediate needs and to support short-term advocacy \n     projects;\n       Whereas, through the Open Government Partnership, 63 \n     countries have committed to protecting the ability of CSOs to \n     operate in a manner that is consistent with the rights to \n     freedom of expression, association, and opinion;\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n       Whereas in September 2013, on the sidelines of the United \n     Nations General Assembly, the United States launched a \n     coordinated multilateral effort encouraging countries to \n     stand with civil society and push back against growing \n     restrictions on CSOs;\n       Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights \n     to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association stands on \n     the front lines of civil society protection, documenting \n     extensive global threats to civil society and strengthening \n     international norms; and\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to its stand \n     with civil society by developing new mechanisms to combat \n     restrictions on civil society and bolster civil society's \n     efforts to support democracy around the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the International Day \n     of Democracy;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of civil society to the \n     healthy development of nations;\n       (3) celebrates the invaluable contributions civil society \n     has made to the creation, strength, and preservation of \n     vibrant democracies and democratic institutions;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     protection, advancement, health, and sustainability of \n     democracy throughout the world;\n       (5) condemns the use of restrictions, coercion, threats, or \n     force to impede the activities of civil society \n     organizations;\n       (6) recognizes the important multilateral work of the \n     Community of Democracies, the ``Lifeline: Embattled Civil \n     Society Organizations Fund'', the Open Government \n     Partnership, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the \n     Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association to \n     protect global civil society;\n       (7) recognizes the important role diplomacy plays in \n     defending global civil society and creating new openings for \n     civic space;\n       (8) emphasizes the value of programs of the United States \n     Government in protecting civil society and defending civic \n     space, including the work by the Senior Advisor for Civil \n     Society and Emerging Democracies and the Bureau of Democracy, \n     Human Rights, and Labor of the United States Department of \n     State, and the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID);\n       (9) calls on private sector partners and other governments \n     to develop new tools and leverage existing technologies to \n     support the efforts of civil society; and\n       (10) encourages the people of the United States and the \n     world to observe the International Day of Democracy, \n     September 15, 2014, with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/03/senate-section/article/S6307-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE LIFE, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND LEGACY OF LOUIS ZAMPERINI\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 593, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 593) designating December 13, 2014, \n     as ``Wreaths Across America Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator King in submitting S. Res. 593 to designate December 13, 2014, \nas Wreaths Across America Day. Since its inception 23 years ago, the \nWreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition of \ndonating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir remembrance \nwreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes buried at Arlington National \nCemetery, as well as at veterans' cemeteries and memorials in every \nState and overseas. In the program's first 23 years, more than 1.7 \nmillion wreaths have been placed in honor of those who have served our \ncountry.\n  On this December 13, thousands of volunteers across the river in \nArlington, throughout our nation, at such overseas locations as \nNormandy, and on our Navy ships at sea, will carry out the mission of \nWreaths Across America to ``Remember, Honor, Teach.'' This will be the \nculmination of a week-long procession between Maine and Virginia, with \nstops along the way to spread a message about the importance\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nof remembering and honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of \nthe United States about the sacrifices made by Veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  This year, as in years past, the Patriot Guard Riders, along with \nother patriotic groups and Maine's First Lady Ann LePage, will escort \nthe tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths from Maine to \nArlington National Cemetery. America's trucking industry will continue \nto support Wreaths Across America by providing drivers, equipment, \nfuel, and related services to assist in the transportation of wreaths \nacross the country to more than 1,000 locations.\n  In recent years, Wreaths Across America has provided some 130,000 \nwreaths to Arlington National Cemetery. To mark Arlington's 150th \nanniversary, the goal this year is to decorate each of the 230,000 \nVeterans' graves and memorials on that hallowed ground. Thanks to the \ngenerosity and gratitude of the American people, this goal will surely \nbe achieved.\n  The origin of Wreaths Across America is an inspiring example of that \ngenerosity and gratitude. During the Christmas season in 1991, Morrill \nand Karen Worcester took time during their busiest season to donate and \ndeliver 5,000 wreaths from their company in Harrington, ME, to \nArlington National Cemetery to honor the heroes who lie at rest there. \nAt first, a small band of volunteers laid the wreaths quietly and with \nlittle notice. In recent years, however, the Arlington Wreath Project \nhas grown to become a national phenomenon. The people of Maine are \nproud that this heartfelt gesture of America's gratitude began in our \nstate.\n  Wreaths Across America honors our departed heroes, but it does even \nmore. It tells the Veterans still with us that we honor their service. \nIt tells our men and women in uniform today that we are grateful for \ntheir courage and devotion to duty. It tells the families of those \nserving our country that they are in our thoughts and prayers. And it \ntells the families of the fallen that we share their grief.\n  Throughout human history, the evergreen wreath has been offered as a \ntribute to heroes. On December 13, we will again offer this enduring \nsymbol of valor and sacrifice. In this season of giving, we will pay \ntribute to those who have given us the most precious gift of all, our \nfreedom.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
