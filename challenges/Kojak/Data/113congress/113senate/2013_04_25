Have \nregard for Your covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of \nthe haunts of violence. Your foes have roared; they have roared within \nYour holy place; they set up their emblems there. They said to \nthemselves: We will utterly subdue them. But it is God who executes \njustice, putting down one and lifting up another. For in the hand of \nthe Lord, there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed. God will pour a \ndraught from it, and the wicked of the Earth shall drain it to the \ndregs.\n  Lord, You were favorable to Your land. Restore us again, O God of our \nsalvation. Will You not revive us again, so that Your people may \nrejoice in You? Let me hear what the Lord will speak. Peace. God speaks \npeace to the people, to the faithful, to those who turn to the Lord in \ntheir hearts. Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet. Righteousness \nand peace will kiss each other. Faithfulness will spring up from the \nground, and righteousness will look down from the sky. It is You who \nhave said so, O God.\n  Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2981-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable William M.

Mr. President, thank you.\n  Every April a large blue-and-gold banner flies above the entryway at \nOld South Church, with words from Isaiah: ``May you run and not grow \nweary, walk and not faint.'' Old South Church sits on the finish line \nfor the Boston Marathon, a distinguished and historical spot that has \nearned its name, ``Church of the Finish Line.''\n  Today I welcome Rev. John Edgerton of Old South Church, the Church of \nthe Finish Line, and thank him for coming here to share his faith, \nresilience, and fortitude.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, on the Sunday before the marathon, Old South \nChurch welcomed athletes, friends, families, supporters, and marathon \nvolunteers into the church for the annual premarathon ``Blessing of the \nAthletes.''\n  On Marathon Monday, just after 12 p.m., the bells of Old South Church \nrang in the men's winner of the Boston Marathon, Lelisa Desisa Benti, \nas he crossed the finish line.\n  Later that day two blasts from hidden bombs rocked the crowded final \nstretch on the Boston Marathon. One explosion occurred mere feet from \nthe front of the church. In an instant, Old South Church, the marathon \nchurch, the Church of the Finish Line, joined the rest of Boston in \nhelping, comforting, and praying.\n  The Old South Church was first gathered in 1669 by a group of \ncolonists who wanted to create a more inclusive and welcoming \ncongregation. Since then, it has played an integral role in Boston's \nhistory. Meetings that led to the Boston Tea Party were held at the \nchurch, and in the 19th century church members were active in the \nabolitionist movement.\n  Although Old South Church was closed for more than a week following \nthe explosion, its ministry remained\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nopen. This past Sunday I attended an interfaith service, jointly \nperformed by Old South Church and other local religious institutions, \nat the corner of Boylston and Berkeley Streets, a few blocks from the \nsite of the bombing. I stood with hundreds of worshipers from a variety \nof faiths in downtown Boston, praying, signing, remembering. This \nperseverance and dedication to faith and community is why Boston has \nnot grown weary; it is why Boston has not fainted; it is why Boston is \nstrong.\n  Reverend Edgerton, thank you for the blessing you brought to the \nSenate today. I join you in praying for our hometown and for our Nation \nas we face the challenges ahead. The qualities you and your church \nexemplify, the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, the power of \nhealing and prayer, and the strength of community are what will bring \nBoston through these difficult times. I am honored that you joined us \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2982-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 799\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this morning to join \nSenator Warren in honoring our guest Chaplain from Boston, Rev. John \nEdgerton, and I thank him for his words this morning.\n  In the wake of the recent tragedies in Massachusetts, I am glad to \nwelcome a representative of Boston's spiritual community to deliver our \ninvocation today. Reverend Edgerton's church, the Old South Church, is \nlocated on Boylston Street, not more than 100 yards past the finish \nline of the great Boston Marathon.\n  Since the first marathon 117 years ago, the Old South Church has been \nknown as the Church of the Finish Line. Every year, the Sunday before \nPatriots' Day, the Old South Church holds a service to bless those \nrunning the marathon the very next morning. The service this year \nincluded the theme music from ``Chariots of Fire'' and the Olympics as \nwell as a prayer for the athletes. Marathoners from around the \nCommonwealth, Nation, and world congregate at the Old South Church \nseeking community, faith, and strength for the upcoming race.\n  Last Monday explosions rocked the finish line at Boylston Street and \nbrought chaos to the front door of the Old South Church. For over a \nweek the church's doors remained closed, as did much of the \nneighborhood, as investigators scoured the block for evidence. But \ntoday, as we pray here for those lives lost and those still recovering, \nOld South Church will open its doors once again and pray for our city, \nour Commonwealth, and our citizens.\n  As we do in times of hardship and heartbreak, we rely on the guidance \nof community leaders such as Reverend Edgerton and take comfort in \ntheir words. It is through their guidance and wisdom that we find the \nstrength to rebound from tragedy and to find hope to move forward.\n  In churches all across Massachusetts this week, from the Back Bay to \nDorchester and from Medford to Stoneham, bells will toll in their \nsteeples and worshippers of all faiths will gather to remember the \nlives of Officer Sean Collier, Lingzi Lu, Krystle Campbell, and Martin \nRichard, and to pray for the scores who were injured.\n  Again next year, we look forward to the Sunday before Marathon Monday \nwhen runners will again gather at the Old South Church to receive their \nblessings before the running of the 118th Boston Marathon. We will \nalways remember, and we will recover. We are thankful to have leaders \nsuch as Reverend Edgerton to guide us as we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2982-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2982-S2983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE BOSTON BOMBINGS\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 115, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 115) commending the heroism, courage, \n     and sacrifice of Sean Collier, an officer in the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department, \n     Martin Richard, an 8-year-old resident of Dorchester, \n     Massachusetts, Krystle Campbell, a native of Medford, \n     Massachusetts, Lu Lingzi, a student at Boston University, and \n     all the victims who are recovering from injuries caused by \n     the attacks in Boston, Massachusetts, including Richard \n     Donohue, Jr., an officer in the Massachusetts Bay \n     Transportation Authority Transit Police Department.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COWAN. I am honored to join the senior Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts in this resolution to honor those who \nwere injured or who lost their lives last week as a result of the \nattack on the Boston Marathon and during the manhunt to apprehend the \nsuspects.\n  In this resolution the Senate commends the heroism, courage, and \nsacrifices of Sean Collier, an officer in the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology police force, and Richard Donohue, Jr., an officer in the \nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority police force.\n  Officer Collier was a 26-year-old native of Wilmington, MA, and was \non the force for just over a year in his dream job, a police officer. \nBefore joining the ranks at MIT, Officer Collier served as a civilian \nemployee with the Somerville Police Department, and likely because of \nhis outstanding service at MIT he was going to be invited to return to \nSomerville in June of this year, this time as an officer.\n  On Thursday evening last, Officer Collier was murdered in the line of \nduty, allegedly by the men suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings of \nlast week. MIT Police Chief John DiFave said the following about \nOfficer Collier:\n\n       Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work \n     as a calling. He was born to be a police officer.\n\n  Officer Collier was compassionate and stood out for his ability to \nconnect personally with the students and community he served. We will \nnever forget his devotion to protecting the community of MIT and \nserving as a police officer. He will be sincerely missed. I honor the \nexemplary service of Officer Collier and I extend my deepest sympathies \nto his family.\n  Last week MBTA police officer Richard Donohue, Jr. was working to \nprotect the public at the Boston Marathon, and early Friday morning he \nraced to assist Cambridge police as they pursued the suspect who shot \nan MIT officer in Watertown, MA. What Officer Donohue may not have \nknown was that officer down at MIT was his friend and fellow police \nacademy classmate Sean Collier.\n  In the ensuing gun battle, showing remarkable courage and disregard \nfor his own safety, Officer Donohue endured a barrage of gunfire and \nexplosives unleashed by these suspects, and he himself was seriously \nwounded. Officer Donohue is recovering from his wounds and remains in \ncritical but stable condition. I wish to thank Officer Donohue for his \nservice, and I wish him a speedy recovery. As he heals, our thoughts \nare with the entire Donohue family, especially his wife Kim and their \nyoung son, who are a constant presence at his hospital bedside.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 115) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate operates by cooperation and \nconsent. So it is unfortunate that we could not reach an agreement \nyesterday to consider amendments to the Marketplace Fairness Act, a \nmeasure that will provide parity between brick-and-mortar retailers and \nonline stores.\n  A few Senators have held up this important legislation--and I mean a \nfew--legislation which proponents have advocated for 11 years. The able \nsponsors of this bill--Senators Enzi, Durbin, and Alexander--are \ncontinuing to work to get an agreement on a list of amendments upon \nwhich the Senate could vote.\n  Three-quarters of the Senate support this measure. A number of those \nwho do not vote with us do not oppose this legislation, they are doing \nit for other reasons. This is overwhelmingly important legislation, \nbut, as we saw with the background check measure and the other gun \nmatters last week, here in the Senate a minority of Senators can block \neven measures with overwhelming support. We found that on background \nchecks. This bill is no exception. Despite 75 votes to proceed to the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, just a few individual Senators are vowing to \nderail this legislation. Absent consent, we will vote on closure on \nthis measure an hour after we convene tomorrow.\n  I remain open to an agreement to consider amendments to this \nlegislation. The proponents of this legislation have worked for a long \ntime to move forward. They worked all day yesterday and the day before \nto come up with a list of amendments. No one is trying to prevent \namendments, except a handful of Senators. I am eager to conduct an open \ndebate on this bill, but time is winding down. One way or another we \nare going to finish work on this measure before we leave for our \ninstate work period, even if it takes the weekend. Those people--that \nhandful of people--should understand that. The calendar is simply too \nfull to allow this important measure to hold over until next month.\n  The Senate must complete work on job-creating water resource \nlegislation and a farm bill during the May work period so we can move \nforward on the immigration debate in June. We have had eight Senators \nwho have spent days, weeks, working on an immigration bill. We have a \nbipartisan bill coming to the Senate with a system to fix our broken \nimmigration system, just like we have a bipartisan bill on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  The only way we get things done around here is with Senators working \ntogether. The immigration bill is a good example of that, and this bill \nis a good example. We cannot let a few people stand in the way of \nfairness. That is what this is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2983-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week one of our most senior \nDemocratic colleagues, a primary author of ObamaCare, referred to the \nlaw's implementation as ``a train wreck.'' He warned: ``Small \nbusinesses have no idea what to do.'' They have no idea ``what to \nexpect.'' He also expressed concern that the health insurance exchanges \nfor consumers and small businesses could turn into a fiasco. I agree \nwith him. I think just about everyone in my conference agrees with him.\n  Here is the difference. This is not some grand revelation to \nRepublicans. We have been saying this since day one. We said a \ngovernment takeover of health care would raise health care costs and \npremiums. We said it would raise taxes on the middle class. We said it \nwould force millions of Americans to give up insurance plans they liked \nand wanted to keep. We said it would bury families and small businesses \nin a literal mountain of regulations, and we said it would cost our \ncountry jobs. We shouted these things from the rooftop throughout the \nhealth care debate. A few of us have even said it would be a ``train \nwreck.''\n  Until now, the President's allies mostly ignored or brushed off our \nconcerns. But do you know what. With each passing day, it appears \nclearer and clearer that we were right to sound the alarm.\n  Only now are Washington Democrats starting to come around to the \nreality of what they passed. Perhaps they thought a ``yes'' vote on \nthis bill would somehow magically cure our country's health care \nchallenges without any cost increases, without hurting the middle \nclass, and without the massive, unnavigable bureaucracy that is being \nerected literally as I speak.\n  That is the problem. That is why we are stuck in this mess. Our \nconstituents did not send us here to robotically fall in line behind \nbad legislation and then pat ourselves on the back for ``doing \nsomething.'' They sent us here to eventually elevate public policy and \nto think about the medium- and long-term consequences of our actions.\n  Look, ObamaCare's mounting challenges shouldn't come as much of a \nsurprise. It is not just that Republicans have warned about them for so \nlong or that experts echoed our concerns. A lot of the problems in this \n2,700-page bill should have been pretty self-evident right from the \nstart.\n  In some ways I am glad to see more and more Washington Democrats and \ntheir allies come around to the reality of what they have done.\n  Earlier this year Democrats helped us repeal the CLASS Act, for \ninstance. Last month, the Senate voted overwhelmingly, 79 to 20, to \nrepeal the law's job-killing medical device tax. Last week we saw a \nunion reverse course and come out for repeal of the law. I would hope \nmore would come out and join us in repealing it in its entirety, root \nand branch. I am optimistic we will see more common sense take root in \nthe days to come as the country learns more about this law and the harm \nit is causing families, businesses, and taxpayers. I suspect we will.\n  When administration officials are reduced to hoping that the law's \nimplementation will not amount to ``a third world experience,'' then \nyou know there is trouble on the way.\n  That is why I have also called on the President to address the Nation \nand give an honest accounting of what many Americans can expect as this \nlaw starts to come online: the higher costs, the premium increases, the \ntaxes, the loss of health care plans they like and want to keep. All of \nthat is happening. We asked him to do this in his State of the Union \nspeech. He should have, because the longer he waits to lay out the \ntruth for the American people, the more people are going to get \nblindsided by all of this. That is simply not right. The President \nshouldn't waste any more time. In the meantime, Americans can rest \nassured Republicans will keep working to repeal this law. I hope more \nof the President's allies will join us in this fight as well, because \nall of us owe our country better than this.\n  For the sake of my constituents in Kentucky and for the sake of \nAmericans across the country, I urge my friends on the other side to \njoin with Republicans and stop the train wreck, stop this train wreck \nbefore things get even worse.\n\n\n                        Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n  On the matter currently before the Senate, I wish to make the \nfollowing observation about the Internet sales tax bill.

Mr. President, a recent Washington Post headline has \ngrabbed national attention. It reads: U.S. Government spends $890,000 \non nothing.\n  It almost sounds like a bad joke, but this is no laughing matter. The \nPost reported:\n\n       This year, the government will spend at least $890,000 on \n     service fees for bank accounts that are empty. At last count, \n     Uncle Sam has 13,712 such accounts with a balance of zero.\n\n  The American people are no strangers to reports of excessive \ngovernment waste, from robotic squirrel research to Moroccan pottery \nclasses. This latest example, however, comes at a particularly \nfrustrating moment, as thousands of Americans are stuck waiting for \nhours in airport terminals with delayed fights--the result of the \nFederal Aviation Administration's decision to furlough thousands of air \ntraffic controllers due to sequestration. The Post astutely noted:\n\n       If you are a federal worker on furlough this week--or an \n     airline passenger delayed by federal furloughs--you might \n     want to save your blood pressure and go read another story.\n\n  Federal law requires the government to reduce overall spending by 5 \npercent in each agency, totaling $85 billion for the remainder of this \nfiscal year. While the $890,000 currently spent on unused bank accounts \nmay seem like a drop in the bucket, it nonetheless proves there is \nplenty of fat to trim in Federal spending. We can do that, and we can \ndo it without directly impacting essential government services and \njobs.\n  The same holds true with the FAA. Similar to many Nebraskans, I \nremain concerned about the Federal Government's failure to effectively \ntarget these required but necessary budget cuts. Of particular concern \nis the FAA's complete mismanagement of the cost reductions which has \nresulted in unnecessary travel delays all across this Nation. Since \n1996, the FAA's operations budget has grown by an astounding 109 \npercent, from $4.6 billion to $9.7 billion. A mere 5-percent budget cut \nwould simply return the FAA to the 2010 funding levels.\n  Despite 2 years to prepare for these budget reductions, the FAA chose \nto provide Congress and the airline industry with less than 1 week's \nnotice regarding its plans to furlough its workforce, showing complete \ndisregard for the traveling public.\n  The FAA has insisted on targeting air traffic controllers, rather \nthan solely focusing on lower priority personnel to ensure morale. I \nwonder if anyone has checked in with the folks waiting in airport \nterminals--and waiting in those terminals for hours--to determine their \ncurrent morale. The FAA has 47,000 employees, of which 15,500 are air \ntraffic controllers. While I appreciate the hard work of many Federal \nemployees, air traffic controllers should be the last ones on the FAA's \nbudgetary chopping block.\n  Rather than selectively ratcheting up the pain of Federal budget cuts \non American citizens with these long delays, the FAA should, instead, \nfocus on cutting its $500 million consultant slush fund or the $325 \nmillion spent on supplies and travel.\n  For months, the administration has argued it lacks the flexibility to \ntarget the required budget cuts in a smart, responsible manner--in a \nsmart, responsible manner--that mitigates the impact on the public. To \nthat end, I have cosponsored several legislative efforts to provide \nthis administration with the tools to ensure that essential Federal \nemployees continue to provide these vital services, such as our control \ntower operations.\n  Most recently I cosponsored the Essential Services Act, which would \nsimply require each Federal agency head to identify and exempt \nessential employees from any furlough policies by using the same \nstandards that were created by multiple administrations during previous \ngovernment shutdowns.\n  Unfortunately, the President and my Democratic colleagues continue to \noppose any of these measures to both achieve needed savings without tax \nhikes and preserve our important government functions.\n  Notably, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta recently testified at a \nSenate hearing that he does, in fact, have discretion to prioritize the \nspending cuts. If that is true, then it appears the FAA is more \ninterested in scoring political points rather than cutting its $2.7 \nbillion in nonpersonnel operation costs.\n  I am very disappointed in Administrator Huerta's lack of \nforthrightness with this Congress. When asked at the same hearing about \nthe FAA's possible furlough strategy, Mr. Huerta provided only general \nstatements. Hours later, FAA officials provided detailed furlough plans \nto airlines--a disturbing move to hide the ball from lawmakers, who \nwere left without the opportunity to mitigate the impact of these \nextensive furloughs.\n  I stand here ready to work with the President and any of my \ncolleagues who are committed to making these budget cuts in a smart, \neffective, and efficient manner, a manner that preserves essential \ngovernment services.\n  I thank the chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious problem \nconfronting the American traveling public and our economy, and later \ntoday I will be introducing a bill to remedy this problem. I am very \npleased to be joined by several of my Senate colleagues as original \ncosponsors, including Senator Mark Udall, Senator Risch, Senator \nRoberts, Senator Isakson, and I expect several more cosponsors to join \nin this effort over the course of the day.\n  As the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have followed the issue of FAA delays and furloughs \nvery closely. In fact, the first thing this morning I met with \nSecretary of Transportation LaHood and FAA Administrator Huerta to \ndiscuss this problem and my proposed solution.\n  The challenges the FAA faces this fiscal year are daunting. Not only \nis the agency operating under a continuing resolution but sequestration \ncompounds the problem. It is important that sequestration be \nimplemented in a way that ensures safety and minimizes the impact on \ntravelers as well as on jobs in the hospitality and airline industries.\n  The FAA recently announced its plans to achieve its sequestration \nsavings by implementing furloughs of air traffic controllers, closing \ncontract towers, eliminating midnight services, among other cuts.\n  I personally believe the FAA had other choices and could have avoided \nmany of these disastrous outcomes, but there is no doubt that personnel \ndoes make up a great deal of the agency's budget and that some \nfurloughs undoubtedly would have been necessary. Whether it was \nnecessary for the FAA to concentrate so many of the cuts in the area of \nair traffic controllers is an entirely different question. In any \nevent, my bill would restore funding for these essential programs and \nwould do so--and this is an important point--without increasing the \nfunding for the FAA or for the Department of Transportation.\n  Let me give a little bit of background. The FAA began furloughing \n47,000 employees this past Sunday, including nearly 15,000 air traffic \ncontrollers. This is essentially 10 percent of its\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\nworkforce, which equates to one furlough day per biweekly pay period \nfor approximately 11 days through September 30. The FAA also plans to \neliminate midnight shifts in more than 70 control towers across the \ncountry and will close more than 149 air traffic control towers at \nairports with fewer than 150,000 flight operations or 10,000 commercial \noperations per year. In addition, the agency is slated to reduce \npreventive maintenance and equipment provisioning and support for all \nNational Airspace System equipment.\n\n  These are simply irresponsible cuts that have real and detrimental \nimpacts on the traveling public, on the airline industry, on the \nhospitality industry, and they will cause widespread delays to the air \ntransportation system. It is estimated as many as 6,700 flights could \nbe delayed each day, more than double the worst day of flight delays \nlast year.\n  In fact, there is one estimate that just since Sunday, 5,800 delays \nhave occurred because of the actions taken by the FAA. This reduction \nin staffing of air traffic controllers has been the primary cause of at \nleast one out of every three delays since the furloughs began, and the \nproblem is only going to get worse.\n  To give an example: On Monday there were 2,660 delayed flights, of \nwhich 1,200 were due to the furloughs. What is even more troubling is \nthis is only the beginning, and soon we will be approaching the peak \ntravel season. Some airports may experience delays of up to 3 hours \nduring peak travel times, and we know these delays cause a ripple \nthroughout the entire system. What is going to happen is that air \ntravelers are going to decide to cancel trips and will not even bother \nto go on brief vacations because they don't want to spend 3 hours \nsitting on the tarmac waiting for their flights to take off.\n  The FAA acknowledges these service reductions will adversely affect \ncommercial, corporate, and general aviation operators. The agency \nexpects that as the airlines estimate the potential impact of the \nfurloughs, they will be forced to change their schedules, cancel \nflights, and lay off employees. At a time when our economy is already \nfragile, that is the last thing we need to happen.\n  The legislation I am introducing with several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senator Mark Udall, is called the Reducing Flight Delays Act \nof 2013. Here is how it would work: It would provide the Secretary of \nTransportation with the flexibility to transfer certain funds to \nprevent the furloughs of essential employees at the FAA, and certainly \nair traffic controllers qualify as essential employees.\n  Specifically, it would give the Secretary the authority to transfer \nan amount not to exceed $253 million to prevent the furloughs of the \nair traffic controllers and other essential employees in order to \nreduce flight delays and at the same time to maintain a safe and \nefficient national airspace system. Our bill would accomplish this goal \nby allowing a one-time shift of unused moneys in the Airport \nImprovement Program to the operations account.\n  I first raised this idea of using the AIP carryover balances as a \nsolution at our Republican policy lunch on Tuesday. Since that time, \nmany of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have indicated \ninterest in this approach.\n  I want to emphasize our legislation has been vetted by the general \ncounsel offices at both the FAA and the Secretary's office, so we know \nit works. Secretary LaHood told me this morning it is an effective, \nworkable solution.\n  I want to explain further exactly how this would work. Each year \nfunds are distributed according to a formula under the Airport \nImprovement Program to airports across the country, but each year there \nare moneys that cannot be used by these airports by the end of the \nfiscal year. Those moneys come back to the FAA in Washington, and they \nare then usually reallocated through a competitive grant program.\n  Last year it was as much as $700 million that came back to Washington \nto be reallocated. This year the amount of unused funds is estimated to \nbe approximately $400 to $450 million. So we would take $253 million of \nthat $400-plus million and use those funds to avoid these very damaging \nfurloughs. The rest of the funds would, as usual, be reallocated to \nairports that need them through a competitive grant program.\n  I want to be clear: This is the discretionary portion of the Airport \nImprovement Program. It in no way affects the entitlement funds that \nairports are guaranteed to receive. The program has sufficient funding \nto support this effort. Moreover, this is a one-time shift. It does not \nin any way provide a permanent change in this program.\n  There would also be sufficient funds to fully fund and continue \noperating the contract tower programs, which so many of our \ncolleagues--particularly Senator Moran--have supported and been \nconcerned about.\n  This is a commonsense solution. It doesn't involve additional money. \nIt is a one-time shift of unused moneys. It does not make a permanent \nchange in the Airport Improvement Program. It will solve the problem, \navoid the need for these delays, for layoffs, and avoid harming our \neconomy at a time when we can least afford to do so.\n\n  The Airport Improvement Program is a very important program. It does \nsupport infrastructure at our Nation's airports. We are simply taking \nthe unused funds that are generally reallocated and instead using a \nportion of these funds to avoid these disastrous implications of the \ndirection the FAA has chosen.\n  Our bill should be recognized as a one-time solution in order to \navert these serious national impacts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I hope we can act very \npromptly to solve this problem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2985-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 743, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 743) to restore States' sovereign rights to \n     enforce State and local sales and use tax laws, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Enzi) amendment No. 741, of a perfecting nature.\n       Durbin amendment No. 745 (to amendment No. 741), to change \n     the enactment date.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending on the floor is S. 743. This is a \nbill which, in its simplest terms, will allow the States to ask \nInternet retailers, when they sell in the State, to collect sales tax. \nCurrently, every State requires consumers to pay the sales tax, but it \nis not collected at the point of purchase. So this legislation will \nrespond to a 20-year-old Supreme Court decision that said to Congress: \nYou have to write a law to do this. This is the law.\n  Senator Enzi and I, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, as well as Senator Lamar \nAlexander, we have all worked together on this legislation on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  This measure was before the Senate last week. It is not a long bill; \nit is 11 pages. It is certainly within the grasp of any Senator to \nsecure and read it and understand it. It is very straightforward.\n  We have had efforts made on the Senate floor to delay consideration \nof this measure. We have taken three votes on it over the past month or \nso. The first\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nvote under the budget resolution was a generic vote: Do you support the \nidea or not? Seventy-five Senators voted in the affirmative--a dramatic \ncommitment from the Democratic side and a majority commitment from the \nRepublican side to this measure. We then faced a vote on cloture--in \nother words, closing down the debate--on the motion to proceed. We had \nthat vote on Monday. Seventy-four Senators voted to proceed. Yesterday, \non the actual motion to proceed: 75 Senators. So this is clearly an \nissue where a substantial majority of the Senate believes we should \nmove forward and pass this legislation.\n  We have invited our colleagues--Senator Enzi and I have--if they have \namendments, to file their amendments. They have had 6 days--6 days--to \nprepare the amendments and file them. The deadline is an hour and a \nhalf from now for filing amendments. So far we have received 31 \namendments.\n  We sat down last night and said: Let's pick a good number of these \namendments. Call them. Let's debate them. Let's vote on them. Let's act \nlike the Senate. Let's see how that works.\n  We started to do that. We came up with a list. Included in that list \nare amendments being offered by people we know are going to vote \nagainst this bill, so they are not friendly amendments. They are \nadversarial amendments. But that is all right. Isn't that what we are \nhere for--debate it out; express your point of view; we will express \nours; let's vote. I think that is fair. No one can criticize us for not \nbeing open to that. We are not trying to fix the outcome. We are ready \nto bring this to full debate. But when we contacted the Senators who \nare opposed to the bill and said, call your amendments, they said, we \nare not ready.\n  I wish those Senators who said they were not ready could meet the \nSenators we run into in the hall who say, when is this going to end, \nwhen can I go home, because the two of them need to get in \nconversation. We want to do this in a timely, thoughtful way because it \nis a critically important issue. But we cannot do it unless our \ncolleagues will come to the floor of the Senate and offer their \namendments.\n  Yesterday we had one amendment we thought was simple and easy. It is \nan amendment that said: We will not impose across America a tax for you \nto use the Internet--the Internet Freedom Act it is called. It is \nbipartisan. Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat, and Senator \nBlunt of Missouri, a Republican, came together and offered to extend \nthe current policy of the United States on Internet freedom.\n  Senator Enzi and I looked at that and said: We can put that in this \nbill. That is something with which we agree. We are not imposing any \nnew taxes in this bill--none. So that is certainly a statement of \npolicy with which we would agree.\n  We brought this to the floor, and a Senator from Oregon came and \nobjected to considering that amendment yesterday. So yesterday, no \namendments. Now we are told that as to any amendments we bring to the \nfloor today, there will be more objections.\n  I do not think this makes the Senate look very good. I do not think \nthis is in the best interests of this institution nor our government. \nWe were elected to roll up our sleeves and go to work and address the \nproblems facing this country. We understand that with 100 people there \nwill be differences of opinion. We are supposed to engage in civil \ndebate on the floor and then vote. But to lunge from one filibuster to \nthe next and have Members coming to the floor and objecting to \namendments puts us in a terrible position.\n  I have served in the minority, as Senator Alexander and Senator Enzi \ndo at this point. The one thing you really want in the minority is a \nchance to offer an amendment, to express your point of view, even if \nyou lose. Now we are offering that opportunity, and unfortunately there \nis a resistance to it. Well, we are going to try it. We are going to \ntest it. If the people who are going to continue to try to block any \ndebate on this bill want to come forward, I hope they will face \nquestions from colleagues as to what their intent is.\n  Ultimately, we will finish this bill before we go home. If it means \nstaying through the weekend--if that satisfies some Members--we will do \nit. But it is a terrible waste of opportunity. We have gone 2 straight \ndays with no votes on amendments. And Senators Enzi, Alexander, \nHeitkamp and I believe it is time for the Senate to be the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 3 times Senators have voted, either \nwith 74 or 75 votes, in favor of this legislation--a majority of \nDemocratic Senators and a majority of Republican Senators. On Monday we \nwere ready for amendments, but the small group of Senators who oppose \nit objected. On Tuesday we asked to have time given back so we could \nbegin amendments. There was an objection. On Wednesday the Senator from \nArkansas asked for a 10-year moratorium on Internet taxes, and there \nwas an objection. And we are ready today, as we will see.\n  Sometimes we Republicans feel as though Democrats keep us from \noffering amendments. Whether that is ever true, this is different. In \nthis case, Democrats and Republicans--a small group--are blocking the \nmajority of us, Democrats and Republicans, who want to go forward with \nthe bill and who have been ready to consider amendments since Monday.\n  We respect the points of view of those 24 or 25 Senators who disagree \nwith us, but with 3 votes of 74, 75 votes, can we not have our \namendments, bring this to a conclusion, send it to the House of \nRepresentatives, and let it go through the process it needs to go \nthrough?\n  So this is different. This is both sides--a small group--blocking \namendments the large majority on each side wants to move forward with.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 771, \noffered on behalf of myself and Senator King, and I would ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am only doing it, I would advise my \ncolleagues--who I know feel strongly about it--Chairman Baucus wanted \nto be able to address this issue. That is the purpose of my \nreservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me express my frustration and dismay \nover the objection that has been lodged against considering a very \nreasonable amendment to this bill.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. It is offered by the Independent \nSenator from Maine, Mr. King, and me. It has widespread support. It is \na very reasonable amendment that simply gives businesses more time to \ncomply with the provisions of this bill. It is consistent with the \npurpose of this bill and does not undermine it in any way. It simply \nrecognizes that 90 days is simply too short a period of time for \nimplementation of the software and other changes that would be required \nunder this legislation.\n  I think there is, however, a broader issue. This is a bipartisan \nbill--a bill that I am a cosponsor of, a bill that has widespread \nsupport, a bill that the Governor of Maine strongly supports because of \nthe revenue it would bring in that is now lost to the State even though \nit is owed to the State.\n  It is a bill that has widespread support among Main Street retailers \nwho see customers come into their stores, take up the time of their \nclerks, and then whip out an iPhone to order the exact same merchandise \nonline solely for the purpose of evading the sales tax that is due on \nthe item.\n  So this bill is a matter of fairness. It imposes no new taxes. In \nfact, there is a prohibition on taxing the Internet. As Senator \nAlexander has pointed out and Senator Durbin has said--and Senator \nEnzi, who has worked so many years on this bill--this bill has \nwidespread, bipartisan support.\n  Here we are stymied by a small group of Members on both sides of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nwho will not even allow us to debate and consider a bipartisan \namendment that simply delays the effective date of this bill by a year \nto allow businesses more time to make the software changes they need to \nmake in order to ensure they are in full compliance with the bill.\n  We have reached a very disappointing and unsatisfactory result if \nthat is where we are. If there is opposition to our amendment, I am \nsure the opponents would have every opportunity to speak against our \namendment and to vote against our amendment. But to not allow our \namendment to be considered, which is completely relevant to this bill, \nan amendment that simply alters the date of implementation, is beyond \nmy comprehension. I do not understand it. I think it is wrong. I think \nit is what frustrates the American people. It is an example of the kind \nof gridlock that is very frustrating to the American public.\n  The only good thing I can say about this gridlock is it is bipartisan \nin this case. But that is a very small comfort indeed. So, again, all \nour amendment would have done, had we been allowed to consider it, is \nput a 1-year delay in the final implementation and also say \nimplementation could not begin during the retailers' busiest time of \nthe year; that is, the holiday season.\n  This was intended to provide adequate lead time for retailers to \nundertake the complex steps that may be needed: the software changes, \nthe training, et cetera. Retailers are going to have to begin early \nanyway, but with this 1-year delay we know they will be prepared to \nfully implement the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  Again, it is very disappointing to me that this commonsense amendment \nthat is designed to improve the underlying bill cannot be considered at \nthis time. I have been very pleased to work with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator King, on this amendment. He may have some comments as \nwell. I also wish to thank the sponsors of the bill for working very \nhard with us on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the comments \nfrom the senior Senator from Maine on this amendment. I consider it \nvirtually a technical amendment. It simply changes the implementation \ndate under the bill so that companies will have adequate time to be \nsure they integrate the software supplied by the States into their \nsystems and also integrate the definition of which items in their \ninventory are covered and not covered according to different \ndefinitions across the country.\n  As we know, the software is to be supplied by the States. This is \nsimply, as I say, a change in the implementation date in order to \nensure that our online retailers are able to serve their customers \nadequately and without any interruption of service or otherwise have \nproblems.\n  I too am puzzled by what is going on here. When I came to Washington \nin January, I knew in many cases the Senate had to get 60 votes in \norder to move forward with legislation under rule XXII. This is a piece \nof legislation that has actually had three votes so far. Each one has \nbeen between 70 and 75 votes. If we cannot do anything with a three-\nquarters majority, then I think the American people are going to say: \nWhat gives? Nothing is going to happen even on a piece of legislation \nthat gets over 70 votes on three consecutive times.\n  I have listened to the debate. I have listened to the arguments from \nthe Senators from three of the four States. I do think it is \ninteresting--there are four States in this country that do not have \nsales taxes. Three of the four are strenuously objecting to this bill; \none of them is not. In fact, one of the Senators from the State of \nDelaware indicated that he believed this could be an advantage to his \nState because people would come to Delaware rather than buy something \nonline and avoid the sales tax in a neighboring State.\n  There is nothing in this bill that will compel the citizens of Oregon \nor Montana or New Hampshire to pay a sales tax. Something has been \nargued that this is somehow coercive on companies in those States to \ncollect the sales tax. I would respond by saying if they do not want to \ncollect the sales tax, they do not have to sell into those States that \nhave a sales tax. There is no coercion. They are voluntarily marketing \ninto Maine or Vermont or Texas or wherever there is a sales tax. If \nthey want to avoid the strictures of this bill, they can do so \nvoluntarily.\n  To me, this makes total common sense. I will conclude with a story \nthat was in our Portland newspaper just this week with regard to this \nbill of a real-life company that I, in fact, shop at, Johnson Sporting \nGoods.\n  The proprietress was talking about people coming into her store, \nlooking at items, feeling them, trying them on, deciding if they liked \nthem, and then walking out and buying the wetsuit or the scuba \nequipment or whatever it was online. She said: We have become a \nshowroom for Internet marketers. The problem is if this keeps up, we \nare not going to be here anymore.\n  It is just fundamentally unfair to our retail community in our towns, \nwhich make up the backbone of the commercial district in every town in \nAmerica, that they are being put at a disadvantage, a 5- or 6- or 7- or \nwhatever percent it is disadvantage with regard to the sale of \nproducts.\n  I, frankly, am puzzled. I just do not understand the vehemence of the \nopposition from the nonsales-tax States. I guess in those States one \ncannot even utter the words ``sales tax,'' let alone do something that \nwill not burden their citizens in any way, shape, or form except for \nthe companies that will collect a sales tax under the software that is \nprovided by the States. So I do not understand why we cannot move \nforward with these amendments.\n  We are here, I thought, to do the Nation's business. I think we \nshould do so. So I rise to support the amendment. I hope we can move to \nthe consideration of the amendment and other amendments that will come \nforward and move this bill through the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nthe Senators from Maine. I think it makes a lot of sense. It is \nsymbolic too. Here we have a bipartisan amendment, we have a Republican \nSenator and an Independent Senator. The Independent Senator is a former \nGovernor, as I once was.\n  The reason I support the amendment is because it gives more time for \nanybody who might be affected by this amendment to adjust to it. That \nis never a bad idea--almost never a bad idea in the Senate.\n  It gets us to our goal a few months later than we had thought. It \nmakes sure those who might be affected can adjust. Of course, many \npeople who call my office are surprised to learn that it does not \naffect anyone unless they have revenues of more than $1 million a year. \nSo about 99 percent of people who sell things online or in catalogs are \nnot affected.\n  Of course, it does not affect Internet taxes; we have a law against \nInternet taxes. In fact, another bipartisan amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and the Senator from Missouri was to extend the 10-year \nmoratorium on Internet taxes. That was objected to.\n  The Collins-King amendment is imminently reasonable. I think it \nstrengthens the bill. It is offered in a good spirit. Some may wish to \ngo faster, but I think it is sensible and reasonable. I fully support \nit.\n  I would reiterate that we were ready to accept amendments on Monday, \nbut there was an objection--not a partisan objection but by Democrats \nand Republicans, a small number.\n  We were ready on Tuesday to go ahead with amendments, but there was \nan objection, a bipartisan objection to going forward. We were ready on \nWednesday with a bipartisan proposal to put on the 10-year extension of \nthe Internet tax, but there was an objection.\n  This is like--I have used this before, but this is like joining the \nGrand Old Opry and not being allowed to sing. This is what we are \nsupposed to do. We are supposed to bring up these bills, consider \nreasonable amendments, and vote on them.\n  We are at noon on Thursday. We have not been allowed to do what we \ncould have finished on Tuesday. So I greatly respect the Senators on \nthe other side. I know their feelings; we have strong feelings too. As \na former Governor, I do not think it is any of Washington's\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\nbusiness to continue to keep us from making decisions about our own \ntaxes and tax structures. Some people say they do not trust the States. \nMost of the people in my State do not trust Washington to make \ndecisions about spending. We do a heck of a lot better job of making \ndecisions about taxes and spending and collections than people do here.\n  So we pretty well made up our minds. Three times now we have had 74, \n75 votes for this bill. We are ready to proceed. We have several \namendments that have been filed, some by those who oppose the bill. \nThat is fine. Bring them up. Let's vote on them. They may make good \nsense, just like this amendment makes good sense.\n  So I thank the Senators from Maine for being constructive, for making \na commonsense proposal to the bill. I support it. I hope that very soon \nwe can debate it and vote on it and finish this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I objected to the last amendment for a \nvery simple reason. The author of the amendment is making my case. This \namendment makes my case. What is my case? My case is this bill should \ngo to committee. It has so many problems, unthought-through, unintended \nconsequences. This amendment recognizes that. This amendment says \ndelay; delay for a year. Why delay? Because there are so many problems, \nbecause there are so many problems.\n  The way to solve the problem is for us to deal with the problem in \ncommittee. That is the solution. I have made that point many times, \nmany different places: the floor of the Senate, different private \nmeetings. Finally, people are starting to realize all of their problems \nwith this bill. Slowly they are starting to read it. Slowly they are \nstarting to think about it. Slowly it is starting to sink in: Oh, my \ngosh, I did not think of that. Oh, that problem too affects businesses, \nnot just businesses in nonsales-tax States, businesses across the \ncountry, all cross the country.\n  This amendment makes my case. This amendment seeking a 1-year delay \nmakes my case that there must be problems; we have to delay this bill. \nThat is the basic reason I think we should not pass this bill. We \nshould send it to the committee.\n  I pledge to Members, my colleagues, my friends, the Finance \nCommittee, which I chair, will hold a markup on this bill in the next \nwork period. I made that pledge. I made that pledge. We can work on all \nof the problems this bill creates and solve them the best we can during \nthe markup.\n  I have heard no good reason we should not go to the committee. This \nbill was placed straight on the floor calendar, no committee \nconsideration, none whatsoever--none. The Committee of jurisdiction had \nno opportunity to look at this bill, none. I think it should, \nespecially when I make a pledge that we will mark it up in the next \nwork period after this next recess.\n  What reasons have I heard why we should not do that? I have heard \nnone whatsoever.\n  All the reasons I have heard are: Well, gee, Senator, we asked to do \nthis a while ago, several months ago. That is no answer. I say now we \nwill do it. I, for the life of me, can't understand why we don't solve \nthis in the right forum. The right forum is the committee of \njurisdiction. We can't do this on the Senate floor without hearings, \nwithout consideration.\n  Senators who have been here a couple of years know the good \nlegislation we have passed around here is legislation from the \ncommittee, where staffs go over all the different amendments and they \nwork things out. The Senators work things out, and they try to find \ncompromises, solutions, not for the first time on the floor when the \nSenators make speeches. They don't think and look for solutions on the \nfloor of the Senate. They just make speeches.\n  I am suggesting the good place we don't make speeches is in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Finance Committee, where we can work out \nsome of these problems. That is the reason I have been objecting and \nwill continue to object. This is a travesty, the way this bill is being \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I feel compelled to respond to the \ncomments of my good friend and colleague from Montana. First, let me \nsay I am sorry to learn of his decision to leave the Senate, to retire \nfrom the Senate, because I have enjoyed working with him over the \nyears.\n  I do want to make several points. Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who \ncame to the Senate the same year I did in 1997, has been talking about \nthis bill for at least a decade. He has introduced it many times \nbefore. There has been ample opportunity for there to be consideration \nby the committee, and the committee chose not to consider his bill. \nThis is not a new concept in any way. It has been talked about and \ndebated at length over the past decade.\n  Moreover, I would note the amendment I have offered, along with my \ncolleague from Maine, does not in any way change the basic thrust of \nthis legislation. In fact, both Senator King and I are cosponsors of \nthe underlying bill.\n  If this bill were so problematic for retailers across the country, \nwhy would it have the support of so many retailers across the country? \nWhy would it have the support of national organizations representing \nretailers across the country?\n  This is not a complicated bill in concept. What it says is if a \nretailer is selling into another State, it needs to collect the sales \ntax and remit it to that State. That is not a complicated concept.\n  This issue has been litigated before the Supreme Court, another \nindication it is not a new concept, that it has been carefully \nconsidered. The idea that somehow this bill has sprung out of nowhere \nwithout proper consideration is not supported by its long history.\n  In fact, during the budget resolution when we voted on this measure \nand it received such a strong vote--I think it was something like 70 to \n75 votes--I went over to Mike Enzi and congratulated him because he \nfinally had gotten a preliminary vote on legislation he had been \nworking on for literally more than a decade.\n  I don't think this is a complicated concept. It is not creating a new \ntax; it is not imposing a new tax; it is not taxing the Internet. All \nit is doing is making sure States that have sales taxes receive the \nrevenue they are owed. That is not a complicated concept.\n  Is it going to require retailers to make changes in their software, \nparticularly large retailers that are selling all over the country? \nKeep in mind, this bill exempts small retailers. It exempts those with \nsales of under a million dollars, so they are not affected at all. Is \nit going to require some changes to be made in software and training by \nlarge retailers? Yes, it is. That is why we have offered this \ncommonsense amendment to improve but not change the underlying bill \nthat says rather than giving 90 days for businesses to comply with the \nsale, let's give them a year so they can fully get the software changes \nmade and installed, their staff trained, and ensure full, complete, and \naccurate compliance. That is all the Collins-King amendment does. It \ndoes not in any way change the thrust of this bill or the underlying \nprovisions of this bill. It simply allows more time for compliance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, first let me join the Senator from \nMaine in expressing to the Senator from Montana my regret that he is \nretiring. He has had a long and distinguished career here, and I have \nenjoyed working with him and look forward to working with him the rest \nof this year and next year. He has a history of independent thinking \nand working across party lines, which is valuable in the Senate.\n  On the point the Senator from Maine made--and I see the Senator from \nMontana may want to say something, so I will be brief. The bill as \nproposed, the Marketplace Fairness Act, the pending act, has a 6-month \nimplementation period. This would add 6 months to that so there would \nbe a total of a year for implementation of the bill. This is a \nreasonable period of time.\n  As far as the bill going to Finance Committee, it has been in the \nFinance Committee. Nothing would have pleased the sponsor of the bill \nmore than for the chairman and other members of the committee to bring \nthe bill up, mark it up, and send it to the floor, but they didn't do \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\n  As Senator Collins said, Senator Enzi has been introducing different \nbills for the last decade or so. But he introduced this very basic \nbill, about 11 or 12 pages, S. 1832, on November 9, 2011. It was \nreferred to the Finance Committee. In April of 2012 there was a Finance \nCommittee hearing on State and local tax issues, including the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. The Senator from Montana referred to that in \nhis remarks the other day, so there was some other hearing on this very \nbill in April of 2012. That is a year ago.\n  Then the Senate Commerce Committee in August held a full hearing on \nthis bill involving many Senators with a lot of testimony, and I was \nthere. It is certainly arguable that the Commerce Committee is at least \nas involved in this issue as the Finance Committee, because while the \nParliamentarian has sent it to the Finance Committee, it has nothing to \ndo with the Tax Code, zero. In any event, that is where it has been.\n  In this Congress, the Marketplace Fairness Act was introduced, this \nvery 11-page bill, in the second month of this year and referred to the \nFinance Committee. Sixteen Senators have asked for it to be heard and \nmarked up.\n  It is certainly the prerogative of the chairman to decide in a busy \ncommittee what he has time to do and not to do. It certainly seemed to \neveryone that the Finance Committee had become a dungeon for the bill \nand not a place where it was likely to ever come out. I believe that is \nexactly why rule XIV is in the Senate rules, to allow the majority \nleader to take a bill, bypass the committee, and bring it to the floor. \nOne that has had this much thought, this much consideration, is an \nexcellent candidate for that.\n  The cure for that, it seems to me, is to take these amendments and \nwork them through, consider them on the floor, debate them, vote them, \nand continue the process. Send the bill to the House and let the House \ndo what it will, have a conference if it is necessary. There are plenty \nof opportunities to deal with the bill.\n  The point is the Finance Committee ought to have the bill. The \nFinance Committee has had the bill. The Finance Committee wouldn't act \non the bill. Now we are past the point of sending it back to the \nFinance Committee. It is before us. It has votes of 74 or 75 Members of \nthe Senate. It has the majority of each side. We have been ready ever \nsince Monday to consider the amendments that have been offered to the \nbill by both proponents and opponents of the legislation.\n  I would hope the Senators who oppose the bill will not object to the \namendments but will participate in the process and allow us to move \nforward on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First, I want to deeply thank my two colleagues who \npreviously spoke, Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Alexander of \nTennessee, for their nice, warm compliments. I deeply appreciate that. \nIt means a lot to me because they are both very fine Senators. They are \nterrific, as a matter of fact.\n  A couple of points to clear the record. Senator Collins said Senator \nEnzi has been working on this bill for about a decade. That is not \naccurate. There was an earlier bill called the streamline act, or \nsomething like that. I have forgotten what it was. It was an attempt at \na compact among States to address this issue. They worked on it and \nworked on it and worked on it for close to a decade and then couldn't \nagree. I think 24 States agreed, the remaining States did not agree, so \nthat was the end of that.\n  This bill is to ram through what other States would not agree to and \nto try to find ``the lowest common denominator.'' That is basically \nwhat this bill is, a new bill. This bill has had, to my knowledge, no \nvetting at all by any committee in any significant way.\n  This bill has been referred to the Finance Committee. As the Senator \nfrom Tennessee points out, the Finance Committee has not reported out \nthe bill. That is true. Frankly, we know one good reason why it hasn't \nis because we have been meeting very frequently at the staff levels. My \nstaff of the Finance Committee with the staffs of those who are \nsponsors of the bill are working out different potential and actual \ncomplexities and problems of the bill. There have been a lot of \nmeetings.\n  I asked my staff, if someone were to be a fly on the wall, were those \nmeetings in good faith? They were in good faith to try to find the \nanswers to the questions. The answer is yes. That is their belief. \nThere have been a lot of meetings to try to work out some of these \nproblems which clearly exist.\n  Obviously one big problem is represented by the amendment that has \nbeen--not offered but consent was asked that it could be offered, \nasking for a 9-month delay. I cannot think of any reason for a 9-month \ndelay except to say, hey, 90 days isn't working. That is just an \nexample of some of the problems and imperfections of this bill that \ncould have been addressed in committee, and there are many of them. \nBut, no, this bill didn't go to committee.\n  I stand here again and tell the world, the Senate Finance Committee \nwill report out this bill in the next work period if it has an \nopportunity to do so and work out all of these different problems, \nrather than trying to willy-nilly ram this through the floor and \npreventing changes from being corrected in a good, solid way.\n  Let me make a prediction. Those who are for ramming this bill on the \nfloor without letting it go to committee are doing themselves a \ndisservice, because it makes it more likely this bill will not become \nlaw. If the proponents of this bill want this legislation to become \nlaw, what they should have done is say yes, let's go to the Finance \nCommittee; the chairman of the Finance Committee has agreed to take it \nup; he has agreed publicly to markup, not just a hearing. We have had a \nhearing already. We would have a markup on this bill in the next work \nperiod. Then the differences would be worked out and some of the \nproblems solved. Then the bill comes to the floor, and it will not be \nopposed, probably, at least not in the same way it is opposed now. Then \nit will more than likely be passed by the other body or at least worked \nthrough the other body. That is the better way to do it.\n  This way, not going to committee and straight to the floor, reduces \nthe probability that this bill is going to become law. I, frankly, am \ngoing to object to other amendments because I do not believe the proper \nway to do legislation is only on the floor and not go through the \nproper development in committee.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, this is a challenge the States have \nbeen confronted with since 1992--a challenge of trying to get equity \nfor Main Street businesses. The Supreme Court told us that Congress is \nbest equipped to make a determination on how we implement something \nthat would level the playing fields for Main Street businesses under \nour notion of what constitutes appropriate regulation and controls of \ninterstate commerce.\n  The challenge was passed over 20 years ago to Congress, and the Main \nStreet businesses have been waiting for 20 years for equity, for \nfairness, and for a system that does not discriminate against them. \nOnly in Washington, DC, could waiting 20 years for a solution we are \ndebating today be considered ramming something through Congress. Only \nin Washington, DC, can a 20-year delay for equity and justice and \nfairness in our tax policy be considered too soon for a debate.\n  This is an 11-page bill. This is a very simple bill. I can attest, \nhaving been here only a short period of time, to the fact that most \nSenators have very capable staff. Quite honestly, most Senators have an \nenormous capacity to read this 11-page bill, understand it, and \nappreciate what the bill says and to make a determination. In fact, \nthis concept--just in concept--received an overwhelming vote from this \nbody. This bill, in consideration now in two votes, has received an \noverwhelming show of support because colleagues know their Main Street \nbusinesses have waited too long. They know we need to accomplish \nsomething. We need to move forward.\n  We need to do what is easy because we have so many hard things to do \nin the Congress. We have a budget out of control, we have an energy \npolicy we need to prepare for the future, and we have challenges with \nsequestration and\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nmaking sure we are making the right investments in our future. We have \nbig issues. I would suggest that what we are looking at, albeit a small \nissue in this body, is a big issue for Main Street businesses.\n  We heard from a woman just a couple days ago--a woman named Teresa--\nwho runs a little pet food store. She has trained all of her people on \nwhat is great nutrition. So when clients or customers come in, she can \ntalk about the age of their pets, she can talk about what the \nnutritional problems are and give them advice and then, she said, only \nto watch them walk out the door with that advice and order that product \non the Internet.\n  One might say that is competition or whatever. But she is not afraid \nof competition. Her challenge is that if they buy in her store, the \nsales tax her city and State will charge is 9\\1/2\\ percent. So she is \nimmediately at a 9\\1/2\\-percent disadvantage. Yet they use her \nexpertise.\n  I would like someone to explain to me how we can't be moved by a \nstory such as that and to correct the inequity; how we can't be \nsophisticated enough as legislators to read an 11-page bill and \nunderstand what it says with all the staffing we have.\n  I am confident, as we go forward, we are doing what is right. Any \nState that doesn't want to participate, any State that doesn't want to \ncollect remote sales tax in this fashion, either streamlined or under \nthe alternative process provided in the bill, does not have to pursue \nthis collection mechanism. They can continue to do what they are doing.\n  The bill talks about a remote seller who has sales over $1 million. \nThis young woman said to us, when she was talking about her pet store, \nthat she also runs a little online business. We asked: How would you \nfeel? She said: I could only hope for $1 million of online sales. I \nwould be glad to collect the tax if that was my business. She is a \nsmall businesswoman.\n  So if we can't bring equity now, then when? We have been waiting 20 \nyears. We have an opportunity to show this country and show those Main \nStreet businesses, show our friends and neighbors who support the \nLittle League, who support our school newspapers, who support our \ncommunities, that someone in this body cares. In fact, the majority of \npeople in this body cares. In fact, a supermajority of this body cares, \nand we are listening to you. Maybe, in some small way--in some very \nsmall way--we will have told them Washington is still a place where \npeople will listen and respond and actually get something done. That is \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for her comments and her involvement for over 20 years. I feel \nlike a newcomer, with just the 12 years I have been trying to get this \npassed. Wyoming has recognized the need for it and has had the desire \nfor it. We were one of the first to join the streamlined sales tax \neffort, and I think we were joined by a number of our surrounding \nStates. The purpose of that, of course, was to make it simpler so it \nwould be easier for people to collect the tax.\n  I wish to congratulate the Senators from Maine for putting forward \nwhat I consider to be kind of a phase-in part. Of course, there are a \nlot of people who would like to have it done a lot faster than that, \nbut this would allow 1 year for people to get their program up and \nrunning. Part of that time would be taken by the free software that has \nto come from the States. It will take them a while to get that \ntogether, although everybody is hearing from eBay a little bit, and \neBay already has one of those sales tax programs. It costs 15 bucks a \nmonth if you want to collect sales tax in the States, so it isn't like \nit is something impossible.\n  I know L.L.Bean is going through a major computer switchover right \nnow, so they know how difficult that is, and if it were compounded at \nthe same time by having the sales tax collected, it could create some \ndifficulties. In checking around, we have gotten the suggestion there \nbe 1 year allowed before they had to start collecting the taxes.\n  There is another small provision that says from October 31 through \nDecember 31 there wouldn't be a conversion because that is the \nChristmas season. In retail, that is the big season. If they can't \nconcentrate on their customers at that point in time, they are not \ngoing to make their money. It makes the whole year just in those couple \nof months there. So there is an exclusion the program wouldn't go into \neffect during that period of time.\n  So there is this kind of a phase-in for everybody to get everything \nready. I know it is a lot more time than what States would like to \nhave. They would like to begin collecting the taxes in 90 days, if they \nwere able to get their program in place in 90 days. But we think that \nis reasonable. They brought that to the floor, but it was objected to \neven getting to debate it. So we don't get to vote on that.\n  Around here a lot of times people say: It is a filibuster if you \ndon't get to, and if there is cloture, then everybody ought to vote \nagainst cloture until everybody gets their amendments. How can you do \nyour amendments if one person can object--and has. I think there would \nprobably be three or four who would object, maybe six or eight who \nwould object. But it is hard to do the amendments, and that should \ndefinitely not be the reason for anybody to vote against final cloture \non this bill and get it enacted. Hopefully, we can still get some \namendments through the process. Anything that is germane after cloture \ncan still be voted on.\n  I know there are a lot of proposals out there. Some of those \nproposals, of course, deal with something other than what would be \ngermane to this bill. There would be major changes in the tax structure \nin other ways. We have tried to keep this to an 11-page bill. We tried \nto keep it simple, keep it to one topic. It is something anybody can \nread and understand. In fact, I don't remember a bill that has had \nlanguage quite as clear.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for all his \nconcentration. He looked at the 80-plus page bill we had, which had a \nlot more stuff in it, and said why don't we make this into a States \nrights bill. Once we took that approach to it, it made all the language \nmuch simpler. We just needed some basics for them to have to \nparticipate, and so that is why it is an 11-page bill. We will not see \nan 11-page bill come through here very often. I would guess some of the \namendments being proposed--that have nothing to do with the collection \nof sales tax--are probably more extensive in pages than what this bill \nis.\n  We are hoping people will stick to germane and relevant--or at least \nrelevant; that is a little broader than germane, and we can do some \namendments.\n  But if there is going to be an objection--and I was just in a meeting \nwhere I was assured this is going to happen, and there is going to be \nan objection every time, no matter what the amendment is--I am very \ndisappointed in that.\n  I do want to point out there is a small seller exemption. If you are \na retailer and you do less than $1 million of sales online during a \nyear, you don't come under this bill. You don't do anything different \nthan what you are doing right now. For a lot of small businesses, $1 \nmillion would be a lot of money. I have heard some proposals that maybe \nwe go to $10 million or $20 million. That affects some big retailers \nthat don't want to do it. But to small retailers, $1 million is a lot \nof sales when it is just the ones that are done online. We are not \ntalking about their total sales--what they do in their stores. We are \njust talking about the ones where they put up their Web site and they \nget orders and they ship out those orders. If that exceeds $1 million, \nthe next year they would have to start collecting it.\n  So not only, with the Collins amendment, would there be 1 year built \ninto the time before they would have to start doing it, there would \nalso be another year before they would hit the $1 million, and if they \ndo not hit the $1 million, then they have another year and another year \nand another year until they do. Of course, having been a small \nbusinessman, I am pulling for all of them to exceed $1 million.\n  Most small businesses I know would be so tickled to hit $1 million \nthey would think maybe this wouldn't be such a bad deal. This is \ndefinitely giving some emphasis to online sales. It is much easier now \nto get a Web site. In\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\nfact, the Small Business Administration has been going from State to \nState to State and providing people who will do free Web sites for \npeople who attend a seminar on how to do online sales. I commend the \nSmall Business Administration for doing that. I think it has helped a \nnumber of businesses that haven't been able to expand beyond the few \nthousand dollars they are selling in their own stores to increase their \nsales. We hope everybody gets to exceed $1 million.\n  There is another part of that $1 million that is kind of interesting. \nIf you are a nursery--and we heard an example of a nursery last night--\nand you are doing big sales, the chances are pretty good some of those \nbig sales are to other nurseries. If a product is sold to somebody else \nto be resold, there isn't a sales tax. So that wouldn't count in the $1 \nmillion.\n  We did hear an example during the press conference of a contractor in \na State and the other contractor got all his stuff online and from out \nof State and on a $150,000 contract was able to undercut him by 10 \npercent. It was just a $150,000 project--a category that small \nbusinessmen specialize in--but he was beat out by an out-of-State \nperson who didn't pay sales tax on the products they were bringing into \nthe State and using in construction.\n  So we do have a small seller exemption. There is also simplification \nin the bill, and I would be happy to go through that. We haven't had \nany suggestions for more simplification, at least from those who \nunderstand what the simplification is. One of the reasons that is \nfairly simple now is because computers have come a long way. I don't \nknow how many people here have purchased something online, but when you \ndo, you put in your address where you want something shipped, and when \nyou go over to see what the bill is going to be, not only will there be \nthe price of the product, but there will be a sales tax. In a number of \nStates, people have volunteered to collect it, and for the number of \npeople who have volunteered to collect it, we really appreciate that.\n\n  I cannot believe that Senator Collins' request to bring up an \namendment that would allow a phase-in, that would give everybody extra \ntime, would be objected to, but, as I said, when we checked we found \nout that everything is going to be objected to, which will bring us to \na cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I know the Senator from Louisiana is \ncoming. When he comes, I will be through.\n  I say to the Senator from Wyoming who just said that apparently there \nis an intention to object to any amendment, just to review, we started \nMonday.\n  We could have started amendments Monday if there were no objection, \nbut there were objections, bipartisan objection.\n  On Tuesday we said that instead of going the full 30 hours of debate, \nlet's give the time back and let's start the amendments. Bipartisan \nobjection.\n  On Wednesday we brought up the bipartisan proposal of Senator Blunt \nand Senator Pryor to extend the moratorium on the Internet tax. There \nis already a moratorium on taxing the Internet. You cannot have it. \nThat is the law. We were going to extend it for 10 years. Objection.\n  Then today Senator Collins and Senator King say: Instead of \nimplementing this in 6 months, let's do it in a year. Objection.\n  If it continues this way--and I say to the Senator from Wyoming, this \nis the way I figure the procedure--if there is no consent, always \nobjection to any amendment from both a few Republicans and a few \nDemocrats, then we will have a vote on cloture tomorrow. That would be \ntomorrow afternoon, I guess--tomorrow morning. Probably for the fourth \ntime, 74 or 75 of us will vote for the Marketplace Fairness Act. Then \nwe will stay here until Saturday afternoon for the full 30 hours, and \nwe will have a vote on the two amendments and final passage. That will \nbe Saturday afternoon. And probably another 74 or 75 votes for that, I \nhope. That is what will happen if a few Democrats and a few Republicans \ncontinue to say: No amendments.\n  I want to make sure no one on our side of the aisle stands up and \nsays they, the Democrats, are blocking amendments, because they are \nnot. Most Democrats and most Republicans want to offer and vote on \namendments. A few Democrats and a few Republicans say no. I believe \nthat is where we are procedurally, if that persists.\n  I completely respect the point of view of other Senators. I never \nquestion a Senator's vote. That is his or her prerogative, and it is \ntheir prerogative to keep us here until Saturday afternoon if that is \nwhat they wish to do. But that is not really a very good way for the \nSenate to work when we have three-fourths of us, a majority on both \nsides of the aisle, who are for something and we are ready to move \nthrough it with amendments and improvements and debates. This is not a \ngood procedure, but it is procedure.\n  This is the season for parades in Tennessee. On weekends and Fridays, \nI go home. I have a rule of thumb: Walk in parades. I put on my red-\nand-black plaid shirt that I walked across Tennessee in. I walked in \nthe Saint Patrick's Day parade in Erin. I walked in the Mule Day parade \nin Columbia--100,000 people there, lots of mules there. I always try to \nwalk at the front of the Mule Day parade for obvious reasons. And \ntomorrow I was looking forward to walking in the parade at the Paris \nFish Fry. But if we continue to object to every amendment to this bill, \nI will not get to walk in the Paris Fish Fry tomorrow, but we will pass \nthe bill on Saturday, and I suspect we will pass it with 74 to 75 \nvotes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2991-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2991-S2992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL PEDIATRIC BRAIN CANCER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \ndesignating September 26, 2013, as ``National Pediatric Brain Cancer \nAwareness Day.''\n  Childhood is a time for growing--growing bodies, growing minds, and \ngrowing hearts. It is a time for bike rides that end in skinned knees \nand sleepovers in backyard forts. It is a time for wondrous stories of \nNeverland and family board games. It is a time to learn the difference \nbetween right and wrong and the difficult discipline of homework. It is \na time--a very brief time--given to us by God to live without fear or \nphysical pain or without burdens and responsibilities.\n  For too many children, though, childhood is very different. Too many \nchildren in this country are forced to grow up far too quickly. The \nstark realities of hunger and poverty mature them and some have no \nchoice but to learn the hard lessons of courage from the cruel, \nunyielding teacher of sickness.\n  Despite this hasty transition from storybooks to the harsh realities \nof life, these children remain beacons of hope. They inspire us. They \nchallenge us to overcome our own trials which seem trivial in \ncomparison to the heavy burdens they shoulder. They prompt us all to \nbelieve in the power of miracles because they have no other choice.\n  One such child is a friend of mine. He is a personal hero. His name \nis Jack Hoffman. Jack Hoffman is a 7-year-old boy. He was born and \nraised in Atkinson, NE.\n  Jack's early years passed like those of many children his age who \nlive in Nebraska communities. He learned to fish and hunt. He went for \nlong bike rides. He played sports. He started school. He made friends \nwith many of his classmates. I am willing to bet little Jack has also \nhad a fight or two with his siblings.\n  But childhood for Jack took a quick and unexpected turn on April 22, \n2011--almost exactly 2 years ago--when Jack suffered a life-threatening \nseizure. Upon examining him, doctors had shocking news: Jack had brain \ncancer.\n  Jack immediately underwent surgery to remove this cancerous mass on \nhis brain, but the surgery did not bring\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nabout the results they hoped for. As doctors desperately sought an \nanswer, Jack's young body continued to be riddled with seizures. Within \n5 months, he endured a second brain surgery which removed 95 percent of \nthe remaining tumor. But despite this success, in April 2012 the MRI \nshowed that Jack's cancer had returned and doctors determined it was \ninoperable. So Jack quickly began 60 weeks of chemotherapy, employing \nan outdated regimen used by doctors for over 25 years.\n  Unfortunately, diminished research funding for pediatric brain cancer \nhas stunted medical advancements, so treatment options remain limited. \nBut Jack and his parents didn't despair. They remain hopeful and \ndetermined to discover God's will in their hardships.\n  In a recent Omaha World-Herald story, Jack's father Andy is quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       I don't know why God chose Jack to have this. But I do know \n     that we can make something good out of it, and that's promote \n     the improvement of treatments of this disease.\n\n  So the Hoffmans set out, they set out on a mission to raise awareness \nfor pediatric brain cancer.\n  This is a rare but devastating disease that poses unique health and \ndevelopmental problems for the 3,000 child patients who are diagnosed \neach year. Jack and other children suffering from brain cancer endure \nseizures, difficulty speaking, and trouble with their balance. The \nlist, unfortunately, goes on. They spend long periods of time away from \ntheir families, friends, and classmates. They miss school, they miss \nfootball games, and they miss out on childhood.\n  The Hoffmans' fundraising efforts through the Team Jack campaign have \nyielded over $300,000, and it is all for pediatric brain cancer \nresearch.\n  Although there are countless worthy charities across our country, my \nhusband Bruce and I feel a special connection with Team Jack, and we \nhave worked very closely with the Hoffman family to increase awareness \nof pediatric brain cancer.\n  While Jack and his family have been friends of mine for many years, \nhe was first introduced to most Americans when he became an overnight \nfootball star--complete with his own trading card--and he did this at \nthe Huskers spring football game on April 6, 2013. Jack suited up with \nfootball pads and a No. 22 jersey, and little Jack ran 69 yards. He \nscored a touchdown in front of 60,000 screaming fans in our Memorial \nStadium in Lincoln, NE.\n  In a single dash across the gridiron, little Jack Hoffman touched the \nhearts of millions of Americans, and that includes 7.6 million YouTube \nviewers, and he increased awareness of pediatric brain cancer.\n  It didn't take a touchdown, though, to make Jack a hero. He smiles \nthrough the pain. His courage and his resilience represent the very \nbest of the human spirit and the very best of our Nation.\n  I admire the Hoffmans for their unwavering commitment to transform \nthis very personal trial into a force for good. I am deeply grateful \nfor all they have done to find a cure.\n  Today the Senate commends the Hoffmans, Team Jack, and all those \nAmericans who work tirelessly to battle and bring attention to \npediatric brain cancer. The resolution Senator Klobuchar and I are \nsubmitting recognizes the unique struggles of pediatric brain cancer \nfor their patients and their families. It commends scientists, \nresearchers, and health care providers working to modernize and improve \nthe diagnosis and treatment options; and, importantly, it designates \nSeptember 26, 2013, as ``National Pediatric Brain Cancer Awareness \nDay'' to encourage efforts toward the early diagnosis and treatment and \nultimate cure for this disease.\n  So at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. Res. 116, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 116) designating September 26, 2013, \n     as ``National Pediatric Brain Cancer Awareness Day''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S2992-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2992-S3014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT OF 2013--Continued\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Sequester\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I wanted to spend a minute as we have had a lot of \ndiscussions over the pain that is being caused by the American \ntraveling public and businesses on the FAA. We heard the majority \nleader say we couldn't do the sequester because we still have the same \namount of money, and there is no way we could cut the $40 billion out \nof our budget over the next 6 months.\n  I thought I would just draw a little comparison for us so we could \nactually see the Federal budget, and then we could make a comparison to \nthe average family budget. Here is the Federal budget. This is last \nyear's Federal budget. We spent $3.7 trillion, we took in $2.46 \ntrillion, and we had a deficit of $1.32 trillion. We added to our total \ndebt, so we have come to a total debt now of $17.57 trillion. The \nsequester cuts are $85 billion, and $85 billion sounds like a lot of \nmoney.\n  Now let's compare it to the average family household in America. The \nmedian household income in America last year was $53,000. By the way, \nin real dollars that is less than what it was in 1989--less than what \nit was in 1989.\n  If we spent money in households the way the Federal Government spends \nmoney, we would have spent $81,000. We would have only earned $53,000, \nbut we would have spent $81,000. We would have had an annual credit \ncard debt that we would have chalked up of $28,000 doing exactly what \nthe Federal Government does, which would have made our total credit \ncard debt $375,000.\n  We are spending $81,000, and if we cut the amount of spending in the \nsequester as a percentage of the total Federal budget as to the median \nfamily income in America, we would have cut $182. That kind of puts it \nin perspective.\n  How many families would continue to be able to operate this way? They \nwouldn't. No credit card company would continue to give them $28,000 \nworth of credit card debt. They certainly wouldn't let them run up \n$375,000 and then say: Oh, by the way, what are you doing about getting \nyour finances in order? Your response would be: I have cut $182 out of \nmy budget this next year.\n  What we are seeing is a farce when we talk about we can't cut $44 \nbillion or $88 billion out of the Federal budget over a year's period. \nIt is an absolute farce.\n  Then when you talk about the FAA, in fact, they have less controllers \nnow than they did in 2010. If you look at the budget requested in 2013, \nthere is about a $300 million difference between the sequester level \nand, actually, it is the same as in 2010.\n  What the FAA and the administration are telling us is there is no way \nthey can possibly do anything to associate less inconvenience and less \ndelayed flights. Yesterday there were 6,800 flights delayed to make it \nhurt.\n  I want to enter something into the Record that came up on my \nwhistleblower site. This is an employee of the FAA and what they were \ntold in a meeting on Monday by management. Here is what they were told.\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n  ``I hope this is the appropriate channel to contact you through.'' I \nam not going to say who works for the FAA and asked me to e-mail you. \nWe want to ``let you know that the FAA management has stated in \nmeetings that they need to make the furloughs as hard as possible for \nthe public so that they understand how serious it is. Due to this there \nis management trying to make everyone take the same furlough day so \nthat the FAA shuts down completely on that day. Union employees are \nsupposed to be able to pick their furlough day, but are being pushed by \nmanagement to take the same day as everyone else. Example, recently \nthere was a meeting between''--and I am not going to say between which \ngroup of employees, but at the FAA, ``management, and union where the \nunion reminded a manager that he cannot force them to take off the same \nday. A union employee wants Wednesdays off so another employee, under \nthe managers orders, tried to make the union employee change his mind. \nWhen the union employee asked why, the other employee said to prove a \npoint. I do not know if any of this information is useful or not. If it \nis I'' will contact you with more information.\n  Well, the fact is, if that is really going on, that the management at \nFAA is trying to make union employees all take the same day off, what \nis that about? Is that about airline travel in America or is that \ntrying to make the sequester hurt? Is that about $182 out of your \nbudget and we can't even do that?\n  We have the government's management manipulating a program so that it \nhurts the American public? How cynical, how un-American is that.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to submit this e-mail for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n     Sent: Wednesday, April 24, 2013 8:16 AM\n     To: Coburn, Whistleblower (Coburn)\n     Subject: FAA Furlough\n       Sen. Coburn: I hope this is the appropriate channel to \n     contact you through. My wife works for the FAA and asked me \n     to email you for her. She wanted me to let you know that the \n     FAA management has stated in meetings that they need to make \n     the furloughs as hard as possible for the public so that they \n     understand how serious it is. Due to this there is management \n     trying to make everyone take the same furlough day so that \n     the FAA shuts down completely on that day. Union employees \n     are supposed to be able to pick their furlough day, but are \n     being pushed by management to take the same day as everyone \n     else. Example, recently there was a meeting between \n     employees, management, and union where the union reminded a \n     manager that he cannot force them to take off the same day. A \n     union employee wants Wednesdays off so another employee, \n     under the managers orders, tried to make the union employee \n     change his mind. When the union employee asked why, the other \n     employee said to prove a point. I do not know if any of this \n     information is useful or not. If it is I can get my wife to \n     contact you with more information.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is another from an FAA supervisor: I am an air \ntraffic control supervisor. I am writing you because I don't want to \nlose my job but, more importantly, I don't want to see safety across \nthe Nation be deteriorated at the risk of the lives of aviators. Sir, I \ndon't need to remind you about the importance of safety and would like \nto talk to you about what could have happened on the day OSU played OU \n16 February 2013. Please call me day or night.\n  The fact is there is a bigger story behind that, which I will make a \nspeech on tomorrow, to actually detail what is going on.\n  When we hear there is no risk to safety, and here is a supervisor \nsaying there is, what are we doing? This is a contrived farce to make \nthe American people think we can't cut $182 out of an $81,000 budget, \nput in simple family budget terms, or we can't cut $85 billion out of a \n$3.7 trillion budget.\n  When we get down and look at it in those terms, everybody in America \nknows it is possible to do that. Everybody knows all it takes is some \ncommon sense and the utilization of priorities that are in the best \ninterests of the country, not the best interest of any political party \nor political philosophy, to actually accomplish this.\n  I must say I am disappointed in the Department of Transportation. I \nam disappointed in the FAA that they would be so callous as to carry \nthis forward.\n  I also want to make some comments about the remarks of the majority \nleader 2 days ago about the tea party. I have to say I adamantly \ndisagree. The tea party people I know from Oklahoma and the Midwest \nlove our country. They want an effective, efficient government. They \nwant a government that follows the Constitution. They want the rule of \nlaw to be supported all the time.\n  He related and compared them to anarchists. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Are there some crazy opinions on both sides of the \nextremes in both parties? You bet. But the vast majority of people in \nAmerica understand over the last few years they have had to do more \nwith less at the same time the government is doing less with more.\n  To indict a group of people who care just as much about this country \nbut see a different way of solving the problems, who say we should live \nwithin our means, that we shouldn't borrow against our children's \nfuture, that we should follow the Constitution, that we should follow \nthe enumerated powers, that we should honor the Bill of Rights--that we \nshould honor the Bill of Rights asking us to do the very things that \nour oath calls on us to do--to me, the fact that the majority leader \nwould attack that group of people as a class and relate their motives \nto that of anarchy is very shameful. They even make the comparison, but \nit is also made out of ignorance.\n  Everybody in this country wants the best in the long term. There is a \ndifference in our view of how we get there, but there is no difference \nthat we do have a Constitution, and it is not un-American to think we \nought to honor our oath to that Constitution; that we ought to truly \nfollow the Bill of Rights and not pass laws that abandon it; that we \ntruly ought to embrace the enumerated powers.\n  Over the last 3 years the GAO has shown us where $250 billion a year \nin waste is, and yet the Congress has done nothing. Senator Feinstein \nand I eliminated $6 billion a year in terms of the ethanol blenders \ncredit. That is the only thing that has gone through in 3 years that \neven comes close to addressing what the GAO has recommended out of $250 \nbillion.\n  You can understand why people might be cynical of Washington--because \nwe don't have our nose pointed in the right direction. We continue to \npass laws that ignore the enumerated powers.\n  One of the results of that is $250 billion of duplicative programs \nwhich have no true metrics on them. If they were all working, that \nwould be fine. But, in fact, most aren't.\n  I think it needs to be countered that there are a lot of disparate \nviews in our country, but the motivation behind them is really love of \ncountry. Whether they are on the hard left or on the hard right, it is \njust a different path. To compare that group of people to anarchists is \nboth insensitive, inaccurate, and outrageous. What we need in our \ncountry today is leadership that pulls us together, not leadership that \ndivides us further. What we are seeing is just the opposite.\n  I would ask my fellow Americans if they think on a comparative basis \nwe couldn't cut $182 out of an $81,000 budget, if that is too much, \nespecially since the fact that this budget has grown 89 percent in the \nlast 10 years while their income has gone down 5 percent. Which is the \nbetter way? Should we raise your taxes and spend more of your money or \nshould we actually decrease and eliminate tremendous amounts of \nwasteful, ineffective, and inefficient government spending and not \nsacrifice the future of our children?\n  I don't think the answer is complicated. I think most of America \nwould agree that we could get $182 out of $81,000. That is the \ncomparative ratio of $85 billion out of $3.7 trillion and what we heard \nthe majority leader say that is impossible to do. It is only impossible \nto do this because we don't want to do it.\n  I have spent 8 years outlining waste in the Federal Government. Very \nfew of my colleagues have helped eliminate that waste. The reason is \nthey are double minded. In their hearts they want the best for the \ncountry, but they also want to get reelected. Every one of those \nduplicative, wasteful programs has a constituency.\n  So parochialism trumps patriotism in the Senate. That is the only \nexplanation for why we haven't addressed\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nwhat the GAO has plainly said is duplication, waste, and actual \nstupidity.\n  When we have over 100 job training programs, 47 for the nondisabled, \nand all but 3 of them do exactly the same thing, and most of those do \nnot have a metric--in fact, none of them have a metric to say whether \nthey are effective--and we will not reform it, we are saying we do not \ncare; we cannot cut $182.\n  When we have 110 teacher training programs, and none of those has a \nmetric, across 9 different agencies, not in the Department of \nEducation, and none of those has a metric. We spend about $4 billion a \nyear on them, and we do not know if they are effective and we will not \nconform them into 1, even if it is a role for the Federal Government, \nor into 2, and eliminate and get some consolidated savings, what we are \nsaying is we cannot cut $182 out of an $81,000 budget.\n  You see, the problems are not insolvable. There is no attempt being \nmade to solve them. So we get a choice, America gets a choice: Continue \nto operate as we are, and what we are actually going to do is put \nhandcuffs on our children and shackle their legs and take away the \nopportunity of a life equal to ours. We are stealing that from them.\n  When we have the majority leader of the Senate say it is impossible \nfor us to cut $182 out of an $81,000 budget, what we are saying is our \npriorities are wrong. I can go through the list. We have 204 science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math programs. Twenty-one different \nagencies run those. Half of them are at the Defense Department. None of \nthem has a metric to see if they are working. They are well intended. \nWhy do we have 204 science and technology programs? Nobody can answer \nthat question. We just have them because somebody saw a need but did \nnot look to see what we were already doing or make what we were already \ndoing work. It is not rocket science. It is common sense. There is not \na thimbleful of it in Washington. There is not a thimbleful of common \nsense in Washington; otherwise, we would be addressing these programs. \nWe would not have a statement saying there is no way we can cut $85 \nbillion out of a $3.7 trillion budget. America does not believe that.\n  Now we have sequester and a refusal by the administration to even \naccept flexibility if we were to grant it, or any request for \nreprogramming to make it better for the American people. What we have \nis a political stunt by the FAA that not only inconveniences travelers \nbut puts people at risk, markedly affects business, and changes \npeople's lives. When you think about those people who are not going to \nmake the funeral of one of their loved ones because of this stunt or \nare not going to be at a graduation because of this stunt or the \nairlines and the significant losses they are incurring every day \nbecause of this stunt, you have got to ask: Who in the world is leading \nthis country and where did they get their motivation? It is an \nembarrassment.\n  The fact is the Senate has not acted in the best interests of the \ncountry in the long term, and what we have denied--the fact is we \ncannot cut $182 out of an $81,000 budget. We cannot do that; it is too \nhard. But nobody in America believes that. Nobody believes it. So what \nwe do is call up all of the heart-wrenching things we can to say how \nterrible it is but do not talk about the real fact that we are living \nway outside of our means. We are living on the backs of our children. \nEvery day we are stealing their future and we refuse to admit to the \nvery real concept that that is morally wrong. It is especially morally \nwrong when we, if we did our jobs properly, would not be doing it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand there are going to be \nobjections to amendments, but I am going to offer them anyway and let \npeople object. One of the ways the Senate is running now is that we \nhave spent 3 days doing nothing, so I am going to talk about my \namendments. If they get objected to, fine. But the fact is the American \npeople should know what we are doing rather than spending all our time \nin quorum calls.\n  So I will be calling up several amendments. If they are objected to, \nI will spend the time talking about those amendments. I have no \nintention of losing the floor until I have finished calling up all my \namendments and talking about each of them.\n  I just gave a talk on the tremendous waste that is in this \ngovernment, but there is a lot of other waste and ways to solve it. \nMost of these amendments have bipartisan sponsors or have had in the \npast, and they are about good government. I understand there will be \nobjections, and that is fine. Members can defend the objection and the \nfact that there are not going to be any amendments on the bill, but I \nam going to offer mine anyway.\n  The first amendment I would like to call up is amendment No. 753 and \nI ask unanimous consent for its consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any objection to setting \naside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will discuss amendment No. 753, and I appreciate the \nobjection by the Senator from Illinois to that amendment.\n  We have over $4 billion owed to the Federal Government by Federal \nemployees in past due taxes. I am not talking about taxes that have \nbeen adjudicated or settled or that have been worked out. I am talking \nabout taxes owed today that haven't been paid. The Federal Government \nhas the ability to garnish those wages, but they will not.\n  The way we get rid of a $1 trillion deficit is $1 billion at a time. \nOn active Federal employees right now there is $1.1 billion in tax \narrears and $2.2 billion from retired. That is undisputed. I am not \ntalking about disputed. This is undisputed and hasn't been paid. So if \nthere is an agreement that has been worked out, if they are working it \nout, that is fine, this amendment does nothing.\n  We are laying off people at the FAA. A portion of these people at the \nFAA, whether it be in communications or a secretary or whatever, owes \nthe Federal Government thousands of dollars, but we are asking somebody \nelse to take a furlough day rather than either terminating this other \nindividual or garnishing their wages. Something is wrong with that \npicture.\n  This amendment says we are going to do that. We are going to actually \nenforce the rule of law and we will apply it equally to Federal \nemployees as we apply it to everybody else in this country.\n  This will save, over the next 2 to 3 years, about $3 billion. Yet I \ncan't bring up this amendment. I understand the dynamics that are \nongoing. I have no personal animosity toward Senator Baucus or Senator \nDurbin for objecting to the amendment. I know what is happening. But \nthe fact is we can't bring up an amendment to save us $3 billion.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is going to pass this body. Everybody \nknows that. But what we can't do is the regular work of the American \npeople and we can't get a vote on an amendment that would actually save \nus $3 billion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Oklahoma is my friend, and we have \nworked together on many occasions. I wish to state for the Record, \nbecause he knows it and I wish to put it on the Record, that we have \nwhat is called a blue-slip problem. There are no Federal taxes as part \nof the underlying bill. In fact, no taxes--no new taxes. If we add a \nprovision, which the Senator has suggested--and he has six or eight \namendments each dealing with the Internal Revenue Code, and many of \nthem very meritorious--they would be objected to and the bill would be \nrejected in the House because revenue measures have to originate in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  So it is a technical, procedural objection and does not reflect my \nfeelings about the substance or about the sponsor.\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that, but I think this amendment has no \ntechnical problem because it does not raise new revenues. It is simply \na direction for performance of the Federal Government, which is the \nmarketplace fairness. We are directing what will happen to the States \nand the involvement of the Federal Government in it. So there may very \nwell be a blue-slip problem with some of the others, but I don't think \nthere is with this one.\n  The point is here we sit. I just gave a speech saying it is $182 out \nof a $81,000 budget we say we can't cut. That is the equivalent family \nsituation I just lined up here, and here is a way to get $3.2 billion \nthat is owed and due back into the Federal coffers and we are not going \nto allow it.\n  So we could allow the amendment and then table it. The fact is we \ndon't want to do that either. In talking to my House colleagues, it is \ngoing to be a while, if ever, if this bill actually sees the light of \nday. So we ought to be voting on the things that will actually make a \ndifference.\n  I don't disagree it is unfair on the Marketplace Fairness Act. I \nthink the exclusion level is way too low for any business to be able to \nafford to comply with it, but that is another story. The very fact is \nwe are not doing what we could do to collect the revenue we are due \nnow. This is an example of just saying: Start enforcing the law. Start \nusing the tools at hand at the Treasury and the different agencies. Yet \nwe are not going to get to vote on that. We ought to vote. If they want \nto table it, fine, but not to allow an amendment to come up? We are not \npostcloture, but we are not allowing an amendment, which means I don't \nhave the right to modify a bill or even have a vote on modifying the \nbill.\n  I understand what is going on, but I think that is a significant \namendment. Most Americans don't know Federal employees who are actively \nworking today owe that kind of money to the Federal Government. Yet \nnothing is being done about it and no consequence for not paying. I \nguarantee if you are out there and you are not paying, you are feeling \nthe full force of the IRS.\n  I ask unanimous consent to bring up amendment No. 751 and set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate I have to object, but I want the Senator from Oklahoma to \nplease explain the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Can I actually have it read and then the Senator from \nIllinois object after having it read?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Whatever way the Senator from Oklahoma wishes to explain \nit. I will object at this point.\n  I am sorry, I understand that can't be done.\n  Mr. COBURN. All right. Let me explain a minute, and the Senator can \nobject ahead of time or later. It doesn't matter when.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is an amendment to require a report from the \nTreasury Department on the abuse of tax-exempt status by charitable \norganizations. What we have seen in studies by the GAO and the IG is \nthat many professional athletes set up charitable organizations and \nthen use them inappropriately to pay the expenses of their lives. All \nwe are asking from the IRS is to take a good look at this. Let's not \nallow this aspect of a very well-intended tax law to be utilized to \nskirt expenses and taxes.\n  On March 31, 2015, ESPN investigative unit ``Outside the Lines'' \nreleased the findings of an in-depth look at 115 different charitable \norganizations founded by prominent athletes. They gave extensive \ndetails of that investigation. What they outlined was that 74 percent \nof these nonprofits fell short of one or more of the acceptable \nguidelines for nonprofit operating standards. That means they are \noperating outside the law or do not meet the requirements for a \ncharitable organization. Yet nothing has been done about it.\n  Here again they are asking for oversight, asking for us to do the \nright thing, asking us to get the money that is actually due the \nFederal Government. We are not going to get a vote on it. We are not \ngoing to have an ability to vote on it. We are not going to direct the \nIRS to actually do that and actually recapture some of the money that \nis actually due to the Federal Government.\n  All it is is a study: Tell us how bad this problem is and what you \nare going to do about it. How are you going to fix it? But, no, we are \nnot going to do that. We are going to continue to allow the process to \ngo on so that some of the most wealthy people in our country continue \nto pay less taxes than what they owe because Congress is dysfunctional.\n  I am not going into the individuals who were named in the ESPN story. \nI think it created quite a stir in the media. Yet we have seen no \naction either in the House or the Senate in this area. All we are \nasking with this amendment is the number of charitable organizations \nthat existed 10 years ago; the number that had their tax-exempt status \nrevoked each year since 2007; the number and nature of the allegations \nof the problems made to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to \ncharitable organizations that were founded in this area of expertise \nfor charitable organizations and what the IRS has done about it over \nthe last 6 years; a description of the challenges the Internal Revenue \nService faces in trying to enforce and oversee such organizations; the \nnumber of criminal investigations of charitable organizations conducted \nby the IRS since 2010--in other words, what are you doing about the \nproblem--and then finally an explanation of any problems the Internal \nRevenue Service has had with the U.S. attorneys in prosecuting criminal \nviolations of tax-exempt and charitable organizations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to say I would vote for that in a second and \nI am not ruling out the possibility of agreeing to allow the Senator to \noffer this as an amendment to the bill. Please let us see if it raises \na blue slip issue, which we mentioned earlier, which is a procedural \nissue, which means if it has a revenue measure in it initiated in the \nSenate, it would be subject to a blockage or objection in the House, \nwhich we are trying to avoid.\n  This is a measure Senator Enzi worked on for 12 years. I have worked \non it for several years. We would like to get this measure up for a \nvote and for approval in the House. If the Senator from Oklahoma is \noffering a measure that would not jeopardize that, I am at least going \nto entertain that idea, and I will talk to my staff about it.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate the comments of my colleague, and question.\n  The next amendment I would like to call up is amendment No. 767, \nwhich requires all legislation to be reviewed before it is considered \nby the Senate to determine whether duplicative or overlapping programs \nare created. I ask that that amendment be called up and the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is one that doesn't get anything as far as a blue \nslip. What we now have is 3 years' worth of reports by the General \nAccountability Office showing at least $250 billion in questionable \nprograms that are markedly duplicative of one another. This is multiple \nareas, and I have them now memorized and all the new ones too. It is \nlayer after layer, agency after agency, program after program.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. All this says is that before we \ncreate another program in the Senate, we have a report from the \nCongressional Research Service: Does this duplicate a program that is \nalready out there? If we continue doing what we are doing, we are going \nto continue to get GAO reports that we are creating programs that \nduplicate what we are already doing.\n  It is not the fact that maybe our intent is good, it is the fact that \nwe don't know what is out there now--except GAO does now--and how will \nwe ever know until we put a requirement on ourselves to quit creating \nnew duplicative programs? What the commonsense man would say is that if \nyou have programs that are doing things and they are not working, don't \ncreate another one, fix the ones you have. Yet we\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nrefuse to do that. Committee after committee refuses to do the \noversight.\n  There is a bill sitting right now awaiting our determination, coming \nfrom the House, that reformed 36 job-training programs that the GAO \nsaid were failing and were duplicative and didn't have the metrics, and \nthey converted those to 6, 36 out of 47 because the committee that did \nthis, the SKILLS Act, only had jurisdiction over them. They created six \nprograms, and they put metrics on it. We spend $19.8 billion on those \n47 programs. We are going to achieve wonderful savings. But the most \nimportant thing we are going to do with the SKILLS Act is we are \nactually going to give somebody a skill with the money we spend rather \nthan wasting 80 percent in the job-training programs we have, and that \nis what the oversight says. When you look at it, that is what it says.\n  For us to not continue adding to the problem, this is an amendment--\nit does not have a blue slip problem, so what is wrong with considering \nthis amendment? I ask my colleague, what is wrong with considering this \namendment? This is common sense. It works. It will actually cause us to \nnot do stupid things in the future. It will actually help us to be \nbetter stewards of the public's money. Yet we are going to object to \nbringing it up.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just to restate, we are going through--I think the \nSenator has six or eight amendments. We are going through those in a \ngood-faith effort to find those which would complement what we are \ndoing and not create a problem substantively. My objection at this \nmoment should not be taken as an objection beyond this moment. We would \nlike to work with the Senator in good faith to do this.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank my colleague. I will make my mark on what I am \ngoing to reoffer in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 766 and have the \npending amendment set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I do not know the \nsubstance of the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to let the Senator object ahead of time, as he \nobviously is going to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object. It is a good-faith objection. I hope the \nSenator understands.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every 4 years the Federal Government spends $200 million \nso both political parties can have a party. We are $17.4 trillion in \ndebt as we speak at this moment. That is $50 million a year. The way to \nget rid of a billion-dollar debt is $50 million at a time. The way to \nget rid of a trillion-dollar debt is $1 billion at a time. Do we really \nhave the capability right now to borrow $200 million every 4 years for \nparties for the Democratic and Republican conventions and charge it to \nour children? All this does is put in a prohibition that we are not \never going to do that again. That is not a wise expenditure of taxpayer \nmoney. It is probably not constitutional. It has never been challenged. \nIt certainly does not fall within the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution, article I, section 8. So it is another way of saving us \nsome money.\n  I would just repeat my point. We have the FAA out there intentionally \ncausing pain and harm to the American public today, and we have the \nSenate intentionally not doing what will solve those problems--\nintentionally not doing what will solve those problems. We are not \ntrying to find the waste. We are not offering bills to eliminate the \nwaste. We are not offering bills to eliminate duplication. We are not \ntrying to refine programs to make them better. We are not trying to \nsave Medicare and we are not trying to save Social Security--the very \nthings that are very important in terms of what is getting ready to \nhappen to us.\n  We cannot point to the administration and say they are cynical \nwithout pointing to ourselves as well. Here is $200 million that we \nspend every 4 years. Why don't we quit spending it? If the political \nparties--I have never been to a political convention in my life, but if \nthey want to have a party, they ought to pay for it and we should not \ncharge it to Dick Durbin's grandkids or Mike Enzi's grandkids or Tom \nCoburn's grandkids or anybody else's grandkids, which is what we are \ndoing.\n  We are probably not going to get a vote on this amendment either, \nwhich shows again that our focus is not on what is most important for \nour country; our focus is on us. We have not set about to solve the big \nproblems for our country.\n  This is a no-brainer. There are not many people other than those \npeople in the political hierarchy of each party who would be against \nthis. Yet it is not even going to get a vote. What does that say to the \nAmerican people? Sure, it is only $200 million. Two hundred million \ndollars. Two hundred thousand thousands. We talk about millions as if \nthey are nothing. Most of our fellow citizens will have trouble making \nthat amount of money in their lifetime, and we flip it off as nothing.\n  This is a simple amendment. It has been objected to. I understand. I \nhave no animosity toward my colleague. I understand what is going on. \nBut do we really want to solve problems for the American people or do \nwe just want to play this game some more? It is disturbing. It has to \nbe disturbing to the average American.\n  In the last 5 years the average Oklahoma family has truly struggled \nto get by, and we have been one of the more fortunate States. But they \nmade very hard choices about their priorities. They have had kids go to \nan instate school who didn't want to because they couldn't afford to go \nto an out-of-State school. They have driven a car 2 or 3 years longer \nthan they wanted to and put money into an old automobile because they \ncould not afford to go the other way. They have changed the way they \nenjoy themselves as a family because of what we have done. They have \nmade hard choices. They have gone through the priorities in their lives \nand said: What is important based on the amount of money we have?\n  That is not just in Oklahoma; in every State in this country they \nhave done that. Everybody has done that but the Federal Government--the \nFederal Government. And once we do take $182 out of a $150,000 family \nbudget, which I showed an example of earlier, what we are told is, we \ncan't do that. There is no way. It is impossible. We can't do that.\n  Then we have a demonstrated, overt exacerbation of something that was \nnot caused by the sequester, that could have been averted, to prove a \npoint that we cannot cut a penny from the Federal budget.\n  When $100 billion a year in Medicare and Medicaid fraud is ongoing in \nthis country, we are talking about trimming the availability of \nMedicare services to seniors, and we have not solved that problem. We \nare not believable anymore; we are not trustworthy anymore.\n\n  This is a very simple, straightforward amendment. I know $200 million \ndoesn't sound like much in Washington, but it is a ton in Muskogee, OK. \nI will offer my amendment again and there will be objections. What will \nprobably happen is that I will not have a chance to offer it again \nbecause it is not germane to the bill, and then when we get \npostcloture, it will be ruled nongermane.\n  We will not have a chance for Senator Durbin or Senator Enzi to \nobject in the future because of the rules we are operating under. We \nare not going to have any amendments until we get postcloture, which \nmeans everything I have talked about so far is not even going to be \nconsidered.\n  We could consider them. We could allow them to be voted on. We could \ndemonstrate to the American people we are actually interested in trying \nto solve some of the problems up here, but we decided we will not do \nthat. It is pretty frustrating to me as a Senator, but it has to be \nterribly disappointing to the average American.\n  I have just outlined about $5 billion worth of savings with the four \namendments I have talked about. We are not going to get to vote on \nthem. Now, $5 billion is almost Oklahoma's entire State budget for 1 \nyear. This is easy, simple stuff to do. Mark my words, we will never \nvote on one of these amendments associated with this bill. Since we \ndon't have real amendment opportunities anymore in the Senate, they\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nwill only come forward when the majority leader decides he wants to \nvote on them. He has been very recalcitrant in offering to vote on \nhardly anything that will actually make a difference in our future in \nterms of finances.\n  I am going to talk about the other amendments I wish to bring up. I \nwill not make the Senator from Illinois object to them, so I will just \ntalk about them.\n  Amendment No. 29, which I will not call up, is an amendment on \nsomething I think is terribly unfair. If this amendment were passed, it \nwould only save us $90 million a year. Does anyone realize the \nProfessional Golfer's Association is a tax-free organization? They \nraise billions of dollars every year, but the money that goes into the \nPGA is tax free--that actually goes into the organization. They are a \n501(c)6 tax-exempt organization. Not only does it include the PGA tour, \nit includes the National Football League, the National Hockey League, \nand it includes the LPGA.\n  Can anybody tell me why they are tax-exempt other than it is under a \nloophole we have created? So if they were not tax-exempt and they paid \ntheir taxes as other organizations that are in the business of making \nmoney, the IRS would collect about $95 million more a year from just \nthese four organizations.\n  Professional baseball saw the light and gave this up. They said it \nwas not right. They did it a number of years ago. They said it is not \nright. Yet we continue to allow the well-heeled in our country to take \nadvantage of the Tax Code as we raise taxes on everybody else. I think \nthis is something we ought to fix.\n  A lot of my colleagues on my side of the aisle don't like this. I \nthink it is inherently unfair that the very profitable sports \norganizations in our country don't pay taxes on the income their parent \norganizations make. I am not saying they don't do some positive things.\n  The President talked about paying your fair share. This is one that \nis not fair. Let's make it fair. Let's collect that money. It is not \ngoing to make any difference in what they do.\n  There are a few more organizations to add to this list: The ATP, WTP, \nthe U.S. Tennis Association, Professional Rodeo and Cowboy Association, \nthe National Hot Rod Association, as well as the ones I mentioned \nearlier also get this benefit.\n  People say this is going to impact their teaching certification or \ntheir charitable activities. They already have a 501(c)3. All of these \norganizations have a 501(c)3. They have a (c)6 just so they don't have \nto pay taxes. They have a charitable organization for all of their \ncharitable stuff as well as their certifications.\n  This amendment will take the extra $90-some million and give it back \nto the American people. By giving that money back, it is giving it back \nto our kids because that is $90 million we are not going to borrow \nagainst their future.\n  The final amendment I will mention is on subsidies for millionaires \nfor gambling losses. I will admit to Senator Durbin that this one does \nhave a blue slip. For anyone who reports $1 million in adjusted gross \nincome a year in this country, they have an unlimited amount of \ngambling losses they can offset against that.\n  I am not a big fan of gambling. If it was a great business, we would \nall be gambling and be better off, but we are not. Most of us are \nlosers when we try to gamble. The fact is the high rollers in this \ncountry get to deduct their gambling losses, and it is a large amount \nof money.\n  We also don't have any cutoff in terms of taking advantage of a lot \nof other expenses, which is for a speech another day, but here is one \nthat is not necessarily great for society, yet we incentivize because \nwe give an unlimited availability of deduction for the very wealthy. It \nought to be something we change.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not much of a gambler myself. I make a voluntary tax \npayment every once in a while and buy a lottery ticket, although I \nrealize I will never win.\n  Refresh my memory--and the Senator probably knows this--do I recall \nthat the only deduction for gambling losses is against gains in \ngambling and not against ordinary income?\n  Mr. COBURN. It is against gains in gambling. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Nevertheless, we give an advantage to those with an \nadjusted gross income of $1 million or more a year. What we have done \nis given the well-heeled and well-connected an advantage the average \nAmerican citizen cannot do. I cannot recall, but this morning I read \nthe exact amount of revenue. The point is it is the principle.\n  Over the next few months will--regardless of this bill, its outcome--\nthe Congress start addressing the real problems facing our country? We \njust passed $740 billion worth of increased income taxes and payroll \ntaxes at the end of the year. Supposedly we will start cutting $85 \nbillion over the next 12 months. We will see if that actually happens, \nas we have grown the government 89 percent over the last 10 years, \nwhile the average American family income has declined 5 percent over \nthe same time.\n  I made the statement earlier--and it can be checked on any Web site--\nif we go by inflation-adjusted dollars, the average American is where \nthey were in 1989. If we look at the size of government, it is almost \nfour times that size. It doesn't seem to me we are accomplishing a \nwhole lot as far as elevating the prosperity of Americans, but we have \ncertainly elevated the prosperity of the Federal Government, and we \nhave certainly undermined the prosperity of our children.\n  I am worried about our country. I am worried about the loss of \nconfidence in this body. I am worried about our abandonment of common \nsense. I am worried about the fact that we ignore the enumerated power \nand then we wonder why we get GAO reports that talk about the \nduplication and things that are not effective.\n  There is a great role for government in a lot of areas in this \ncountry, but in many areas we are not effective and certainly not \nefficient. The reasons our Founders put the enumerated power in was so \nthe decisions that could be made on so many things would be made at the \nlocal level so it would be done effectively and efficiently.\n  When we have this year's GAO report showing that there is $98 billion \nworth of duplicative waste--$250 billion over the last 3 years of \nduplicative waste--and we don't do anything about it, what we are \nsaying is it is not important. The future is not important, having the \nconfidence of the American people is not important, our kids' future is \nnot important, and don't worry, we will be able to pay all the debt \nback.\n  I will close with this: There are a lot of biblical principles about \npaying interest and going into debt. Last year we paid about $223 \nbillion in interest costs. If we took our historical pattern over the \nlast 30 years of what our interest is, we are actually paying the same \ninterest we were 25 years ago on one-fourth the debt.\n  If we took our historical interest rate, which is about 5.88 percent, \nand applied it to where we are today, what we would see is our interest \ncosts would be $880 billion a year. That is going to happen to us \npretty soon. Nobody knows for sure when, but interest rates are not \ngoing to stay at zero for the Federal Government. We are not going to \nhave the Federal Reserve continuing to print money, and if we do, then \nthe value of our dollar is going to decline and we will all get taxed \nthrough the decrease in value of whatever we have or hold.\n  The point I want to make is that the interest payment doesn't help \nthe poorest person in this country, it doesn't help the single mom, it \ndoesn't help the kid in Head Start, it doesn't help our schools, it \ndoesn't help our military, it doesn't help our foreign service. It \ndoesn't help anybody except the person who has our debt.\n  Don't we have an obligation to not let that happen? Don't we have an \nobligation to start addressing the very real problems in front of us? \nNot one dollar we pay in interest helps anybody in America in the long-\nterm net way.\n  Last year the Chinese dumped $250 trillion of our debt. We ought to \nask ourselves why. Their perception is that as their currency \nappreciates, our currency is eventually going to depreciate.\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\n  As my friends in Oklahoma say, one of the reasons we are doing so \nwell right now is we are the best-looking horse in the glue factory. We \nlook good because everybody else is looking so bad. We are lulled into \na position of thinking we, in fact, can get away with continuing to do \nwhat we have done for years in Washington when, in fact, we cannot.\n  I appreciate the time on the floor and my colleagues' consideration \nof my amendments. I understand what is happening. I am not happy about \nwhat is happening in the Senate. I think we ought to be working on \nsolving real problems. They are the biggest problems in front of our \ncountry. Saving Medicare is important. In 13 months, Social Security \ndisability is going to be out of money. Those people who are truly \ndisabled are going to see a cut in their benefits. We are not going to \nbe able to address that.\n  The time for us to be acting is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and have enjoyed working with him the entire time he has \nbeen here. He brings up a lot of important issues, part of which is the \nfinancial shape our country is in right now. I noticed his comment that \nwe are the best-looking horse in the glue factory and so people are \npouring money into the United States.\n  I went to one of the bond issue auctions where we and some people \nfrom other countries were willing to take a negative interest rate in \norder to buy our bonds, which means they think we are the best hope \nthere is out there. But that could change pretty quickly, and 5.88 \npercent is the average, which changes to $880 billion a year, which is \na lot more than we spend on defense. So we need to be looking at some \nof those issues.\n\n  It is difficult to get a bill up around here. It is difficult to get \na vote on an amendment around here. I know, because I have been working \non the bill that is on the floor for 12 years, hoping to get an \nopportunity on the floor. So I would love to give Senators all the \namendments they want; I was just hoping their amendments might be \nrelevant--not germane, necessarily, relevant--to what we are doing; \nthat it would be something about the sales tax collection. Those ought \nto come up. But when amendments are brought up as a result of \nfrustration because people haven't been able to bring them up before--\nor some have even been brought up before and voted down--I would hope \nthey would kind of constrain themselves on trying to make those an \namendment to this bill.\n  Yes, there ought to be an easier way to get things going around here, \nand I think that would be in kind of a bipartisan way. This is a \nbipartisan bill. It is even bicameral. We have Republicans and \nDemocrats on the House end working with us, conferring with us, \nhopefully, so something can be done, and here, of course, it is \nRepublicans and Democrats--more than half of the people--who are \nsupporting this bill.\n  As I said, I have worked for 12 years to get the bill to this point, \nand it usually gets blocked at the committee level. This time it didn't \ngo to committee. I prefer bills to go to committee, but if we can't get \nthem to committee and we get an opportunity to bring one up, we do.\n  One of the difficulties we have here is there are a lot of things \nthat have to be done in the Senate, there are a lot of things people \nwant to have done in the Senate, and there are a lot of things that \nhave tremendous appeal throughout the United States or at least among \ncertain people.\n  It is my understanding the next thing we are going to go to is water, \nand if my colleagues want to talk about a sensitive issue in the West, \ntalk about water. My State gets an average of 16 inches--yes, that is \nright, just 16 inches--of rainfall a year. Other States get 16 inches \nin a month. We are considered high desert, and we are conscious of our \nwater. So we will be interested in the water bill.\n  Following that, I think, is the immigration bill which has gotten a \nlot of publicity. There are a lot of people working on it, and there \nare a lot of opinions that I think are actually being worked into some \nkind of a bill.\n  Again, if we had a process where people could bring their bills up \nstep by step, we could probably go through with a lot more. Because one \nof the complaints around here is bills often wind up to be a couple \nthousand pages long and it is hard to digest that. It is hard to bring \nthe American people along on it. But the bill we are talking about here \nis an 11-page bill, and I think it is probably one of the most readable \nbills people have ever had to work on. An 11-page bill shouldn't \nprobably take very long around here, but it takes just as long as any \nother bill. So I am hoping for this one chance we have to shore up some \nof the State, county, and town revenues, particularly since they are \nnot going to be able to come to the Federal Government for money.\n  In fact, the Federal Government is taking money away from them right \nnow and is talking about even more ways of taking money away from the \nStates, the towns, the counties, and the municipalities.\n  What we did recently in that sequester bill is we took 5.3 percent \nout of the Federal Government's payment in lieu of taxes. They know \nthey own properties in the States that, if they were in private hands, \nwould result in property tax, but they are in the Federal Government's \nhands, and the States can't tax the Federal Government. But the Federal \nGovernment said, We know that is wrong, so we will pay a tax. The \nFederal Government decided what that tax would be and they don't raise \nit, so it has no relationship to the actual value of the property and \nwhat that property would raise if it were in private hands, which is \nwhy there are some appeals around here to sell off Federal property. \nBut this year the Federal Government said, Well, yes, we owe that, and \nwe haven't been increasing it so it is way below what the property tax \nought to be, but we are going to cut you out of another 5.3 percent. I \nknow people across America didn't have a choice of saving 5.3 percent \nof the money before sending it to the Federal Government, but the \nFederal Government is saying, For the taxes we owe, we are going to \ntake 5.3 percent out of it first. So there are a lot of things there \nthat are going to infringe on States and counties and municipalities.\n  I used to be a mayor so I know what the money is going to be used for \nand I know an essential part of that comes from sales tax--in States \nthat have sales tax--and in those States the property tax is usually \npretty low. But if they continue to lose revenue on the remote sales \nthat take their revenue away, they are going to have to probably raise \nsome of those taxes. I know there is a desire to force them to reduce \nsome tax in exchange for whatever tax they get from this, but they have \nbeen losing tax and they are going to be losing tax.\n\n  This is a States rights bill. That is how we got it shortened down so \nmuch. The States actually have to take some action in order to be able \nto do this. I hope we don't try to dictate to the States what they do \nwith whatever money they raise from this. But, again, that is a \npossibility on an amendment.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Oklahoma isn't on the Finance Committee \nanymore because there is the possibility, as we are doing tax reform \nright now, to talk about a number of these things he brought up, \nincluding gamblers who get to deduct their losses and the 501(C)(6) \ncorporations that are tax-free. We need to be talking about whether \nsome of those things should be tax-free, what their purpose is, where \nthe money goes, how much is in the private sector, and what it is used \nfor. Of course, I have been on the Finance Committee and I have been \ngoing through these discussions on reforming the taxes, and every time \nwe get into it, we think of a lot more things we could be spending \nmoney on. So sometimes we talk about raising the tax instead of making \nit fairer and simpler. The two things can actually be separate. The \npolicy of how we spend the money is supposed to be appropriation and \nauthorization from the committees. The committees say what they think \nthe money ought to be spent on and then the appropriators are supposed \nto stay within those limits. But that isn't the way it exactly happens.\n  If we are going to have fairer and simpler taxes, they are going to \nhave to be fairer and simpler. I know Senator Wyden has a principle \nthat is a\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\none-pager. That would be nice, if it were only one page to fill out for \nour taxes. Of course, that means getting rid of a lot of things we have \ncome to take as standard policy in our taxes. Again, a lot of those \ncould be handled another way and they could be more forthright and more \nhonest on what exactly we are doing, and probably fairer to the \nrecipients of some of the tax expenditures we get.\n  I appreciate the amendments brought up by the Senator. I hope others \nwill come and at least explain their amendments, but I hope they will \ntry to stick to amendments that actually affect the sales tax \nprovisions. If we try to put on some other kind of taxes or take off \nsome other kind of taxes, we are actually getting into the Ways and \nMeans in the House which has the right to start all of these kinds of \nissues, and they call that a blue slip. That means they object to it \nand it is done for. So if we end up with one of those for this bill, \nwhat it actually does is kind of kill the bill.\n  I am hoping after all the years of work that we don't kill the bill, \nparticularly since we found a way to simplify it and make it a States \nrights situation, so States have to take some action and so the States \nunderstand the action they are taking. I am hoping we can do that. But \nI appreciate those explanations and perhaps there are some of those \nthat somebody won't object to. I don't object.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, my friend and colleague from Utah \nSenator Hatch is going to give a speech in a moment. I would like to \nsay before he speaks that after he has spoken, I am going to ask for a \nunanimous consent which renews an earlier request but expands it, and \nthe request is going to be that we call up three amendments, two of \nwhich have been objected to already, and a third one, Senator Hatch's \namendment.\n  For my colleagues who are following this debate in their office, the \nthree amendments we are talking about are amendment No. 740, offered by \nSenators Pryor and Blunt, a bipartisan amendment that relates to the \nInternet Freedom Act, a 10-year extension, which was objected to \nyesterday; and then I will ask for consent that we go from that, after \nan agreed to time for debate, to amendment No. 771, offered by Senators \nCollins and King, another bipartisan amendment that relates to the \neffective date of the underlying legislation; and then, to Senator \nHatch, I would say that we are going to include in this unanimous \nconsent request his amendment No. 754, which I believe he is going to \nspeak to now on the floor, which relates to the substance of the \nunderlying bill, S. 743.\n  I am not asking for the consent at this moment but giving notice to \nmy colleagues that this is a request that will be made after Senator \nHatch has spoken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, on Monday, before the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the Marketplace Fairness Act, I came to the floor \nto discuss the need to reinstate the committee process in the Senate.\n  I have come to the floor many times over the past few months to talk \nabout the importance of restoring regular order. I know a number of my \ncolleagues share the same concerns. Yet here we are today debating \nanother piece of legislation that has not gone through the full \ncommittee. It has not gone through the full committee process, and, \nonce again, it appears we will be getting less than optimal results.\n  I think the legislation before us is a prime example of why regular \norder is so essential. The Marketplace Fairness Act is a complicated \npiece of legislation that deserves more thorough examination.\n  I think the bill is well-intentioned, and I am not fundamentally \nopposed to it. But make no mistake, there are problems with this \nlegislation as it is currently drafted, problems that likely could have \nbeen avoided if the Finance Committee had been given an opportunity to \nfully consider the bill.\n  I also understand the feelings of those who feel otherwise. But the \ncommittee chairman offered to have a hearing on a set date, a markup on \na set date, and go to the floor. I thought that was a pretty good \noffer.\n  I am not here today to talk about the process failures we have had \nwith regard to this legislation. I think I have made that point, and \nothers have as well. Instead, I am going to take a few minutes to talk \nabout just a few of the specific problems I see with this legislation \nand how I propose to fix them.\n  I have filed an amendment that would address some of my concerns. I \nbelieve my amendment would make this bill more workable for businesses \nand consumers around the country.\n  For example, my amendment would implement a 5-year sunset on the \ntaxing authority provided under this legislation. Like I said, this is \na complicated bill, and we are not precisely sure what the impact is \ngoing to be.\n  Whenever Congress deals with legislation this complex, unintended \nconsequences are to be expected. I believe we need to ensure that \nCongress has an opportunity to revisit these issues once we have had a \nchance to see how this bill is implemented. A 5-year sunset would \nprovide that opportunity, but that is not enough. If we are really \nserious about preventing unintended consequences, we need to change \nsome of the specific provisions of the bill.\n  One particular troublesome aspect of this bill is the preemption \nprovision. In order to downplay the need for regular order on this \nlegislation, proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act have repeatedly \nclaimed that the bill has been around in some form or another for over \n10 years. And, in a sense, that is true.\n  However, none of the previous versions of this bill--including the \nversion that was introduced just 18 months ago--have included a \npreemption provision.\n  Specifically, this provision states that this legislation ``shall not \nbe construed to preempt or limit any power exercised by a State or \nlocal jurisdiction under the law of such State or local jurisdiction or \nunder any other Federal law.''\n  At first glance this sounds innocuous, but why was it only added to \nthis latest version of the bill? Why was it not included in previous \ndrafts?\n  My concern is that this provision seeks to address an issue that the \nauthors of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement have been \nwrestling with for years, which is that States are reluctant to \nsurrender any taxing authority at all.\n  I always have been a proponent of States rights. I have fought hard \nto preserve the right of States to regulate issues within their own \nspheres in a number of contexts. But we need to recognize, with this \nprovision in place, we would be backing up State laws with Federal \nenforcement. By passing this legislation as it currently stands, we \nwould be essentially signing off on laws that have not even been \nwritten yet.\n  I think it is only reasonable to consider whether we should, after \npassing this bill, expect more aggressive State sales tax laws to be \nenacted with the promise of Federal authority to enforce them.\n  My amendment would help us avoid the potential problems with this \npreemption provision by simply striking it from the bill. As I stated, \nthis is a new provision that deserves more careful examination before \nbeing enacted into law.\n  If the Finance Committee had been given an opportunity to examine \nthis provision more thoroughly, it is possible these concerns could \nhave been addressed. But that is not the world in which we are living. \nUnder the current circumstances, this provision should be removed from \nthe bill.\n  I should point out that I am not the only person expressing concern \nabout the potential impact of enforcing new State sales tax laws with \nFederal authority. That is an important issue.\n  Earlier this week the Securities Industry and Financial Markets \nAssociation released a statement saying:\n\n       We believe the impact of this legislation on trade and \n     services has not been adequately explored by Congress. The \n     bill could\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\n     lead to unexpected costs being passed on to consumers of \n     financial services, including sales taxes on services or \n     state-level stock transaction taxes.\n\n  On Monday, I quoted from a letter delivered to Senators from the \nAmerican Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries that argued:\n  The legislation would allow states to impose a financial transaction \ntax that would apply to American workers' 401(k) contributions and \nother transactions within workers' accounts.\n  These are not concerns that can just be cast aside. These are experts \nin the financial services industry saying there is a set of problems \nwith the way this bill is drafted.\n  I am not saying the Marketplace Fairness Act will automatically \ncreate these new taxes on financial services. But unless we are sure \nthe legislation would prohibit such taxes, we may be handing a blank \ncheck of Federal power to States that are becoming increasingly \naggressive with regard to tax enforcement.\n  That is why my amendment requires the Government Accountability \nOffice to study whether, and under what circumstances, the authority \ngranted under this legislation might allow States to impose taxes on \nfinancial transactions or retirement contributions.\n  My amendment provides a simple, straightforward way to address a \npotentially serious problem with the Marketplace Fairness Act. My \namendment would also require the GAO to conduct a study on the costs \nincurred by remote sellers in complying with the new sales tax \nrequirements that would be imposed by States under this bill.\n  There are serious questions regarding the economic impact of this \nlegislation. We are talking about a bill that would impose new costs on \nbusinesses throughout the country--costs that will most certainly \nimpact the ability of these companies to grow and expand.\n  I do not need to tell you that these are perilous economic times.\n  What impact will the Marketplace Fairness Act have on job creation? \nWe simply do not know. This study would help provide us with some \nanswers. But we need to do more to ensure that this legislation will \nnot harm small businesses throughout the country.\n  Another concern I have with this bill is that it could potentially \ncreate a situation in which small remote sellers are routinely audited \nby multiple States at the same time. This would be a severe impediment \nto small business growth and job creation. I think we need to ensure \nthat this legislation does not impose administrative burdens that crush \nsmall remote sellers under an avalanche of paperwork.\n  To help address this concern my amendment would institute a 3-year \nstatute of limitations on State audits of remote sellers. This would \nprovide a uniform rule for State sales tax audits, one that mirrors the \ncurrent Federal statute of limitations in situations where fraud is not \nalleged.\n  One of the major driving forces behind this legislation is the fact \nthat over the years, the number of tangible goods purchased over the \nInternet has increased exponentially. Proponents of the Marketplace \nFairness Act believe it is necessary to level the playing field between \nInternet and brick-and-mortar businesses.\n  While this is a fair point, it does not address the issues \nsurrounding the sale of digital goods. Digital goods are often consumed \nin places that are not at the location of either the buyer or the \nseller. That being the case, applying State sales taxes to the purchase \nof digital goods presents a number of problems that are simply not \ncontemplated or resolved under this bill.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have spent time working on \nlegislation in this area. In addition, the Streamlined Sales and Use \nTax Agreement has also considered this issue. However, the legislation \nbefore us is completely silent on this and other matters.\n  These issues demand more consideration than will be possible under \nthis bill. That is why my amendment includes a carve-out for digital \ngoods. Exempting digital goods from the sales taxes authorized by this \nlegislation will give Congress an opportunity to examine this matter \nmore fully and provide a solution that makes sense.\n  Another problem with this legislation is that it does not take into \naccount the costs businesses will face as they transition into this new \nsales tax system. There is just no way around it. This bill represents \na change to longstanding policy that will require many companies to \nincur additional costs.\n  For example, as the bill stands as written, businesses that sell into \nmultiple States will likely have to incorporate multiple software \npackages into their operations or create their own program. Anybody who \nthinks about it can see that is a big set of problems.\n  Furthermore, an online retailer will still be required to pay \ninterchange fees on all transactions regardless of whether the amounts \ntransacted represent the tax or the price of the item purchased. My \namendment would help to address this problem by providing for \ncompensation for remote sellers that will be required to withhold and \nremit sales taxes as a result of this legislation.\n  A simple, fair system of vendor compensation will help businesses \novercome the difficulties of transitioning into the new sales tax \nregime. The amendment would phase out vendor compensation over a 5-year \nperiod. It would begin at 10 percent of amounts collected for 2 years, \n8 percent of amounts collected for an additional 2 years after that, \nand then 6 percent of amounts collected for 1 year. I think this is a \nreasonable provision. I think it would solve a lot of the problems \nfolks are raising on this bill.\n  This is a simple approach. It would go a long way to ensuring that \nbusinesses, particularly small businesses, are not unduly harmed by \nthis legislation. If you hadn't noticed, the common theme running \nthrough all of the provisions of my amendment is a desire to protect \nsmall businesses. I think we all want to ensure small businesses are \nallowed to grow, expand, and create jobs. While I do not think the \nproponents of this bill want to intentionally harm small businesses, I \ndo not think they have done enough to protect them from the burdens \nthis 11-page piece of legislation would impose.\n  Let me give you one more example. Businesses making less than $1 \nmillion a year in remote sales would be exempt from the sales taxes \nauthorized under this legislation. That may sound like a fair \nconcession, but it warrants further examination. First of all, previous \nversions of the bill set the exemption at $5 million a year. Why has \nthat number been reduced over time? Is it an arbitrary number that \nsounds good or is there a specific target in mind? These are the \nquestions I have when I look at that number. My concern with placing \nthe exemption at $1 million is it could subject smaller regional \ncompanies and individual sellers to sales tax burdens in States where \nthey only do a small amount of business. In our already fragile economy \nthe last thing we want to do is discourage the businesses from growing, \nexpanding, and creating new jobs. My amendment would set the exemption \nat $10 million a year in remote sales. It would also index the level of \nthe exemption to inflation to ensure it does not shrink as the years go \nby.\n  I recognize coming up with the exact definition of a small business \nis no easy task. Any number we use will necessarily be a rough figure \nbecause it has to encompass different industries and different business \nmodels. But setting the exemption at $10 million would protect small \nbusinesses in a number of different sectors and ensure we are not \ndiscouraging expansion and investment in those types of companies.\n  I have a number of concerns with the Marketplace Fairness Act as it \nis currently drafted. These are just some of the concerns I have. I \nhave more, but I thought I would at least make these concerns \nnoticeable by talking about them on the floor. My amendment would go a \nlong way toward resolving these concerns. I respect my colleagues who \nhave worked on this legislation over the years. But I want to work with \nthem to improve the bill.\n  I respect the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming, the distinguished Senator from Illinois. They are \nsincere, they are dedicated, they believe they are right. I wish to \nwork with them to improve this bill. Everyone knows if we pass this \nbill in its current form the House is not going to take it. So we may \nbe doing a thankless act here rather than working, as legislators \nshould do, to improve the bill, make it acceptable, hopefully make it \nso both\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nHouses will take it, and the President will sign it. But as you can \nsee, there are simply too many problems and too many unanswered \nquestions surrounding this legislation for me to support it as it is.\n  As I have stated, I believe these problems could easily be resolved \nby a simple return to regular order. Indeed, if the Finance Committee \nhad been given an opportunity to fully examine this legislation, many \nof these problems would undoubtedly have been solved already. There are \npeople who do not want this bill; I understand that. The chairman of \nthe committee does not want this bill. But he was willing, knowing he \nwould lose, to go ahead with a committee markup, a committee hearing, \nand a committee battle on the floor.\n  As I said, that is not the world we are living in. Once again, I want \nto work with my colleagues to improve this bill. I hope they will \nlisten to my concerns and consider the changes my amendment would make. \nIf no changes are made to this legislation, if it is forced through the \nSenate without any real improvement, I am going to have to vote no. \nThat is not where I want to be, but that is what I would have to do. We \nhave already missed some real opportunities to examine and improve this \nlegislation. I hope we can change course and take a good look at all of \nthese implications surrounding this particular bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside, and \nthat it be in order to call up the following amendments en bloc: \nCollins 744 or 771; Ayotte 759, as amended; Coats 765; Thune 765, with \na GAO study; Thune 778, with a GAO study; Coburn 753; Coburn 767; Thune \n743; Lee 768; Ayotte 763; Hatch 754; Portman 772; Cruz 794; Coats 797; \nPortman 792; Paul 755; Cruz 799; Ayotte 776.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that each amendment be limited to no \nmore than 1 hour for debate equally divided in the usual form; I \nfurther ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time on \neach of the amendments, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \neach amendment with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, this is the first time I \nhave seen this list. It has 17 Republican amendments on it. An hour \napiece with a vote would probably take us around the clock or close to \nit. I wish to review this list with the Senator from Utah and others \ninterested. I said earlier I was going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest. I will not make it at this very moment, but I will be making a \nunanimous consent request within minutes, which will include at least \ntwo of the amendments that are on his list, and it will be a starting \npoint. I will object to the request at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. COWAN. Madam President, I rise both early and late in my Senate \ncareer in strong support of the Marketplace Fairness Act, legislation \nthat Massachusetts-based merchants and Massachusetts municipalities \ntell me is long overdue.\n  First, let me congratulate Senators Durbin, Enzi, Alexander, and \nHeitkamp for their tireless efforts over many years on this issue. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this measure and to \ncontinue working with the House so we can finally see it enacted into \nlaw.\n  As I see it, in a sense, this legislation finishes the job that was \nstarted in the House by former Congressman, now Senator, Wyden and \nformer Congressman Christopher Cox, when they first introduced the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. That law, which Congress first enacted in \n1998, officially declared that the Internet and electronic commerce \nshould not bear a higher tax burden than traditional commerce.\n  Standing here in 2013, knowing how commerce has evolved, how consumer \nbehavior and expectations have evolved, and how technology itself has \nevolved, I am happy to report Congress largely has been successful. \nState tax laws do not discriminate against electronic commerce. These \ntransactions do not need any special protection from State tax \ncollectors. Quite the contrary. On the contrary. Now so much commerce \nroutinely is conducted on line, the pendulum has swung in the other \ndirection. It is time to ensure our State tax laws are uniformly \napplied no matter how a transaction is consummated.\n  For more than 300 years, New England Main Streets have been anchored \nby local merchants who not only offer consumers important goods and \nservices but are key employers for our communities. Those Main Street \nestablishments have always been and will always remain an important \npart of the fabric of our communities.\n  Today in Massachusetts, the retail sector employs 550,000 people in \n60,000 locations across our 351 cities and towns. They represent 17 \npercent of all the jobs in the Commonwealth--an important percentage, \nyet one which has declined from a decade ago.\n  Consumers today are fortunate to have unlimited choices, meaning \nextremely competitive pricing from retailers and great service in order \nto obtain and retain customers. That is good for both the consumer and \nthe economy, but it also means retailers necessarily must have very \ntight margins in order to stay competitive on price. Those tight \nmargins mean many small businesses thrive or die on a daily basis based \nupon consumer trends and purchasing decisionmaking.\n  Those of us in government should foster consumer choice and \ncompetition but, equally important, we must also take care to prevent \nunfair market incentives that drive consumers to spend or not spend at \ncertain establishments based upon government policy and decisions.\n  I find it interesting that many news reports about the bill we are \ndebating now seemed to lead with the headline ``tax-free shopping on \nthe Internet is about to come to a halt.'' Let's be clear about one \nthing. There was never such a thing as tax-free shopping over the \nInternet in States such as mine and so many other States that have a \nsales or use tax. Under the Commonwealth's sales and use tax law--and \nthe laws that exist in 44 other States in this Nation--if you owe a tax \nwhen you walk into a store to buy an item, then you owe a tax when you \ngo online, buy it, and have it shipped to your house. You heard me \ncorrectly. If you live in Massachusetts or one of the other 44 States \nthat collect sales tax, you owe taxes today on those Internet purchases \nalready.\n  For 45 years, Massachusetts merchants have competed against sellers \nin our neighbor State, New Hampshire, which has no sales tax. Some \nMassachusetts consumers choose to hop in their cars and drive up Route \n93 to make purchases. I understand the frustration of Massachusetts \nmerchants, particularly since the tax is still actually due to the \nCommonwealth in the form of a consumer-remitted use tax.\n  For the past decade, the growth in competition based upon sales tax \ncollection avoidance hasn't been from north of the Massachusetts border \nbut, rather, from desktop and laptop computers and today from smart \nphones and tablets. Consumers who are reeled in by the tax avoidance \nmarketing messages of certain sellers don't have to drive to New \nHampshire. Avoiding the State sales tax takes only a few keystrokes on \ntheir phones.\n  Billions of sales that otherwise would go to Massachusetts employers \nare annually sent elsewhere. Those losses are real for our Main \nStreets, for our retailers, our retail employers, for all our cities \nand towns, and the losses are growing every year. The annual sales tax \nloss in Massachusetts is currently estimated to be $335 million. That \nnumber grows to $400 million when you include lost income and property \ntaxes from declining employment and darkened storefronts. If we don't \nact, if we don't pass this bill, that number will grow to over $1 \nbillion by the year 2020. Allow me to repeat that. That is $1 billion \nin losses to my State.\n  A sale is a sale is a sale. With today's technology, it shouldn't \nmatter how it is transacted or where it is transacted. Government must \nbe blind and be a nonfactor in our competitive consumer marketplace and \nin our application of taxation to that market. We understand this fact \nin Massachusetts. Increasingly, many online sellers recognize this \nreality too.\n  Last year I worked with Gov. Deval Patrick to negotiate with \namazon.com\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\nto begin collecting and remitting the Massachusetts sales tax. Amazon \ndid the right thing for Massachusetts employers, workers, our schools, \nservices, and for our cities and towns. Amazon recognized that they use \nour infrastructure, the airports, the highways, and streets to deliver \ngoods to consumers. Furthermore, they understood that their customers \nwho purchase from them use those very same services in Massachusetts \nand enjoy our vibrant downtown. Amazon and many of the other businesses \nthat support this legislation have stores in multiple States. They have \nmade their online presence and their brick-and-mortar presence seamless \nto consumers. They already collect and remit applicable sales tax and \nfollow all the other business rules in the States where they do \nbusiness. If other States want to compete for their customers in the \ngreat Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they also should play by all of \nour rules, including the obligation to collect and remit our sales tax.\n  It used to be the case that if you wanted to reach a broader \nmarketplace, you opened a location there. You complied with all the \nState laws that applied in those jurisdictions because it was worth it \nto expand your reach and build a broader customer base. Why isn't it \nthe same thing now? Why have we been so unwilling to apply the same \nrules to online businesses that we do to businesses in our States?\n  This is not an unreasonable proposal. Every time a business opens a \nphysical space in my State, they set down roots there. They create jobs \nthere. They support our communities, and they contribute to the cost of \nlocal services. That means they collect and remit sales taxes on the \npurchases made by the customers who enter their front door. Every open \nbusiness in the Commonwealth and every consumer in the Commonwealth \nunderstands this relationship. Why should we allow an online business \ntransaction better treatment than we provide to our own folks? \nOutsiders should not be treated better than insiders. Everybody should \nbe treated equitably.\n  That is all this bill will do. It will allow a State government to \nrequire the same sales tax collection obligations of businesses that \nsell to State residents online that it does to businesses that sell to \nState residents on Main Street--nothing different, nothing more \nburdensome.\n  There has been a lot of misunderstanding about what this bill does, \nso let me try to clear it up. This bill will not create a new tax \nobligation for anyone who doesn't already have one. If you live in a \nState that already imposes sales and use taxes, online merchants will \nadd the sales tax to your purchase in the same way the neighborhood \nretailer does. If you live in a State without a sales tax, nothing \nchanges for you--nothing. If you don't pay a tax at a store on Main \nStreet, you won't pay one on the Web. It is that simple.\n  This bill will not crush small businesses. When I served in State \ngovernment, small business owners and their associations repeatedly \ncalled on us to beg Congress to level the playing field. Those same \nsmall business owners are the people who sent us here to represent \ntheir interests. When our bosses--the people--tell us they want us to \nact, they should not have to beg. We should act on the will of the \npeople.\n  Let me be clear about how this bill will work. Businesses that have \nless than $1 million in remote sales will be exempt from compliance. \nStates that want businesses to collect and remit the sales tax already \ndue will be required to provide those businesses with the software to \ndo it free of charge. The State will set up a simplified process so \nthat businesses only have one point of contact with the State on \ncollections and audits. No business will have to navigate the thousands \nof taxing jurisdictions opponents of this bill are so fond of \nasserting.\n  If a business really does not want to comply, it is easy: they can \nforgo the customers in that State. If they do, I assure you, those \nconsumers--a very resourceful group--will quickly fill that void with \nanother business that is willing to follow a State's business rules.\n  This bill will not impose a tax on financial transactions. I admit \nthat when I heard this assertion, it worried me and many of my \nconstituents, so I went back and I read the bill again. This charge is \nfiction.\n  The bill is crystal clear. I quote:\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as encouraging a \n     State to impose sales and use taxes on any goods or services \n     not subject to taxation prior to the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  I come from State government, as do several of my colleagues in this \nbody. Trust me, budgeting on the State level is a little different from \nthe process that plays out here in Congress. In Massachusetts we rely \non a combination of income taxes and sales taxes to cover the costs of \nthe services our citizens tell us they want and need and provide the \nappropriate measure of investments--in education, infrastructure, and \ninnovation--we know is necessary for a growing and prosperous State \neconomy. Sales tax revenues represent almost one-quarter of our total \ntax collections.\n  Sales taxes are a difficult revenue source, I understand, because \nthey are so dependent upon broader economic conditions. As we saw \nduring the recent recession, when people are out of work or believe \ntheir jobs are threatened, they pull back on spending. In fact, many \nsmall businesses in my State and in others, I am sure, were told by \nbanks that lines of credit needed to be tightened because consumers \nwere pulling back. It was an unfortunate domino effect that our Main \nStreet businesses are still struggling to overcome. Yet, as they were \ntrying to hang on, they also watched the customers walk into their \nstores, browse the merchandise, take out a cell phone, and walk out, \nopting to buy a product from an online retailer that could ignore the \nState sales tax collection. Guess what. Now there is an app for that.\n  Our States have limited sources of revenue and significant \nobligations and investments to fund. We know the reality of this \nsituation--that no matter how much our consumers prefer to shop online \nrather than on the street, they do not and cannot call a virtual \nambulance or an online firetruck. We need to do all we can to keep our \nbusinesses in business. We need to ensure them a level playing field in \nwhich to compete. We need to protect the integrity of our tax laws that \nensure we can provide essential services to our residents.\n  I have listened carefully to the objections to the bill that have \nbeen raised by others here on the floor, in the correspondence sent to \nmy office, and the many tweets on my Twitter feed. While I am \nsympathetic to some of the assertions made against this bill, \nrespectfully, I am not persuaded by them. There are just too many \nconsumers, small businesses, and struggling communities in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts that are shouldering an ever-growing \nburden because Congress has yet to join forces with the States to help \nus efficiently enforce our tax laws in a 21st-century marketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me first thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for an excellent statement in support of the legislation \npending on the floor.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that I am planning to make a unanimous \nconsent request on several amendments. I have asked Senator Ayotte from \nNew Hampshire to come forward with amendments to be included on this \nlist, and I am hoping she will do that momentarily. After Senator Paul \nof Kentucky, who is seeking recognition, concludes his statement, I \nwould like to make this unanimous consent request.\n  May I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he would be kind enough to \ntell me how long he will be speaking on the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. Between 3 and 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Without objection, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                          Neurofibromatosis 2\n\n  Mr. PAUL. My nephew Mark Pyeatt has neurofibromatosis 2, NF2, but \nthat is not who he is. He is an indomitable spirit, a courageous young \nman, a man who knows and faces each day certain that he is one with his \nGod. He is like many young people on Earth--he is in search of the \ntruth. He reads, he thinks, but he no longer hears.\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  Neurofibromatosis 2 is characterized by recurrent neurologic tumors. \nIts signature tumor affects the auditory nerves and destroys the \nhearing. Its relentless course eventually takes all of the hearing. I \nhave never heard Mark complain.\n  While my signing is only rudimentary, most of his immediate family \nare proficient, and at Christmas dinner for 40 family members, nearly \neveryone is trying to learn some signing. The grandkids sing, ``Happy \nBirthday, Jesus. I am so glad you came.'' The whole family is learning \nto communicate with their hands. I mostly like to learn insults so I \ncan taunt Mark on the golf course. I can't use most of the signs he \ntaught me on the Senate floor. I don't know this for certain, but I \nthink the seven words George Carlin said you can't say on TV, I think \nyou can't sign them on TV either. I love the way names for people in \nsign language are created only by the deaf. Mark's mother Lori is ``L'' \nto the ear because she is on the phone all the time. My wife Kelley is \n``K'' sweet. My middle son Duncan is ``D'' in a hoop because he likes \nbasketball.\n  Neurofibromatosis 2 is a rare disease. Some call it an orphan \ndisease. Orphan diseases face certain obstacles that others do not. \nMoney is typically allocated to research based on how prevalent a \ndisease is. For rare diseases, the resources are likewise rare.\n  In order for investors to invest in a cure for neurofibromatosis 2, \nregulatory obstacles need to be cleared. We need to allow foreign drug \nstudies to be accepted in the United States and not repeated. We need \nto have speedy approval of drugs that are already being used by the \ngeneral population in other countries.\n  My chief of staff's sister Karen has pulmonary fibrosis--another \norphan disease. She is 40 years old with a young daughter, and she is \nlikely only alive today through a fluke in the system. She takes a \nmedication that is part of an experimental trial in the United States \nbut has been on the general market in Japan for years. If she didn't \nlive near a research center and if her family couldn't afford to pay \n$1,500 a month out-of-pocket, she wouldn't receive this drug, even \nthough it is legal in Japan.\n\n  The drug should have been cleared already, but we are not doing a \ngood enough job of trying to get drugs cleared. It went through trials \nhere. It has already been approved in Europe and Japan, but 200,000 \nAmericans who have a rare deadly terminal disease are being denied this \ndrug.\n  We all want safety in the drugs and in the cures for disease. We all \nacknowledge this is a balancing act. We should all acknowledge the \nregulatory obstacles and burdens new drugs face in our country are \noppressive and counterproductive.\n  My hope is by putting a face to two orphan diseases--my nephew Mark, \nwith neurofibromatosis, and my staff member's sister Karen, with \npulmonary fibrosis--this situation will be made more personal. These \nare people who are close to our families, and we hope others will come \nto realize we must do something to get rid of government obstacles to \ncures for rare diseases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have reached out during the statement \nof the Senator from Kentucky to try and find the Senator from New \nHampshire. I know she has a busy schedule, and I couldn't find her to \nask her for her amendments to include on this list. I am going to go \nahead and make the unanimous consent request, and I give her my word \nwhen she comes to the floor I will be happy to amend it to include two \nof her amendments, which offer I made to her earlier and I wish to make \nagain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Enzi amendment be set aside \nand it be in order for the following amendments to be called up: the \nCollins-King amendment No. 771, the Pryor-Blunt amendment No. 740, and \nHatch amendment No. 754; further, that no second-degree amendments be \nin order to any of these amendments prior to votes in relation to the \namendments.\n  Unless someone has another suggestion, I am going to suggest we have \n20 minutes of debate equally divided between opponents and proponents \nof each amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, over the last few days, I have spent a \ngood chunk of my waking hours trying to find some common ground, some \nopportunity to bring both sides together. I have repeatedly put \nspecifics on paper and provided those specifics to the proponents of \nthis legislation. By and large--and I believe there is a little bit of \na Senate code when one talks around here--the response has been: They \nhave 75 votes, and that is kind of it. But I have been trying to deal \nwith the issues that have been raised.\n  For example, my colleague from Illinois sincerely believes that \nunless Oregon's small businesses are not coerced into enforcing out-of-\nstate laws, that Oregon is going to become a small business haven. He \nsays Oregon has to be coerced by this bill or it is going to be a small \nbusiness haven. I would just say to my colleagues that is not the \nreality of what we see in the Pacific Northwest every day.\n  Washington State has a sales tax. Oregon does not have a sales tax. \nSo if my colleague from Illinois was right, we would be seeing moving \nvans all the time coming across the borders from Washington State to \nOregon because somehow Oregon was going to be an Internet tax haven.\n  We all know States rights means States take different approaches with \nrespect to this issue. To me, what we ought to be looking at are \napproaches that bring people together. So I offered Senator Durbin a \nchance to test out this question of whether Oregon would be an Internet \ntax haven and try it out for a period of time. That was unacceptable.\n  So now this amendment includes the Pryor-Blunt legislation, which, \nfor example, says we ought to reauthorize the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \nColleagues, I wrote that legislation. It says in section 2 you can't \nhave discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. The Internet tax \nfreedom proposal Senator Durbin seeks to include in his base bill is \nbasically trying to add some sugar into a very bitter cup of coffee. He \nis taking our legislation, which has been a real boost for the economy, \nand trying to put it into this very bitter cup of coffee that is his \nlegislation.\n  I just don't think that makes a lot of sense. This bill is going to \nmake it possible--the base bill--for discriminatory treatment of \nelectronic commerce because online retailers in communities across the \ncountry are going to be subjected to burdens that brick-and-mortar \nretailers would not be subject to.\n  I know my colleague from Montana wishes to speak on this as well, but \nI would just close by saying I will have to object to the Senator's \nrequest because this particular amendment, including the bill I wrote, \nin effect, is akin to adding sugar to the bitter cup of coffee. The \nbase bill offered by the proponents undermines the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct by allowing the very discrimination on electronic commerce the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act was all about.\n  This effort needs more time to bring about some common ground. I will \nclose with this. Our technology policy over the last few years has been \nbuilt on three kinds of principles:\n  No. 1, we would take voluntary steps. We wouldn't use coercion. This \nbill uses coercion. In fact, it was the voluntary steps, starting with \nsome of the first laws that encouraged investment in social media, that \nwere so important. This bill moves away from any semblance of \nvoluntariness.\n  No. 2, I have outlined the discriminatory aspect of the legislation \nwhere we are going to have brick-and-mortar retailers not have to do \ncertain things that online people do.\n  Finally, No. 3, what is just breathtaking is this gives foreign \nretailers a leg up on a Montana business, on an Oregon business, and, \nfrankly, it gives a leg up on every business in the United States \nbecause the foreign retailer will not be subjected to what a business \nin our country is subjected to.\n  I know my colleague from Montana wants to speak on this issue as \nwell, so I am going to maintain my reservation\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nso my colleague can speak, but I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can object or not object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am happy the Senator from Oregon is \nobjecting. I am not going to get into how many times the Senator from \nIllinois and anybody else wrote the Finance Committee to work on this \nbill. That is frankly irrelevant, and it is not a discussion that is \nworth getting into. It misses the whole point. The whole point is \nwhether this is sound legislation. The whole point, in my judgment, is \nwe should try to find a process where we do make this sound \nlegislation.\n  I think I am known around here as not somebody to unnecessarily hold \nup legislation. I have been here it will be close to 36 years, and that \nis not my style. That is not who I am. It is not in my DNA. I am \nsomeone who wants to work out things fairly, work both sides fairly but \nnot stand and filibuster, not delay for the sake of delay or to try to \nget leverage. That is not what I do. I think, by and large, that is not \nvery productive.\n  I have said many times, and I will say it again, we can improve upon \nthis bill if we would go to the Finance Committee and work on the bill \nthe next work period and report the bill out. I have made that \ncommitment; that the Finance Committee will have a markup on this \nlegislation in the next work period and report it out so we can work on \na lot of problems that are in this bill. There are a lot of them.\n  One of the problems that comes to my mind--and I haven't had time to \nanalyze it; nobody has had time to analyze it because there is no forum \nfor it. Sure, Senator Enzi has worked on this for many years, but that \nwas another provision. That was other legislation which States rejected \nbecause they couldn't reach agreement. So Senator Enzi found another \nsolution, which is the bill he has introduced, and that has not ever \nbeen, to my knowledge, thoroughly examined in any committee.\n  One of the problems I have is audits--out-of-State audits. Nothing in \nthis bill protects States from an out-of-State audit which is \noppressive in duration. This bill says there will only be a single \naudit. How long is a single audit? How many years is a single audit? \nHow much pressure will an out-of-State taxing authority push on another \nState's seller--a single seller or a bunch of sellers? What is a single \naudit; a single audit for all the sellers in a State or a single audit \nper seller? This legislation doesn't say.\n  What is the enforcement provision? What if a taxing authority from \none State wants to go to another State, feeling that State is not \nliving up to the provisions of this bill? What protection does that \nState have from an out-of-State taxing authority, an out-of-State \naudit? There is none here, but there could be. There could be \nprotections if we go to committee and reasonably find a way to deal \nwith this.\n  Those are just some of the problems with this bill, and there are \nmany others that have not really been thought through--many others. I \nhave deep respect for Senators standing on the floor and pointing out \ntheir States are losing some revenue. I understand that argument. But \nmost of those States don't go the next step. Most of those Senators \ndon't go the next step. They have not read the bill. I have read it \nall. It is right here. It is 11 pages.\n  As I have pointed out, with respect to audits, with respect to \nenforcement, there is no protection whatsoever. There are some nice \nwishful words in this bill, but when we stop to think about it, if \nsomeone is a small businessperson, they start asking a lot of \nquestions. What does that out-of-State taxing authority do to me? What \ndoes it do to me, an out-of-State taxing authority?\n  We are not talking about a Federal taxing authority. We are talking \nabout an out-of-State taxing authority as it affects me as a seller in \nmy home State. Whether you are a sales tax State is irrelevant. Let's \ntake Massachusetts and a remote seller in the State of Massachusetts. \nLet's say, for example, some other State feels that remote seller in \nMassachusetts isn't properly adhering to the provisions of this bill. \nLet's say it is a California taxing authority and it goes to the remote \nseller in the State of Massachusetts and audits that remote seller and \nbrings an enforcement action against that remote seller in the State of \nMassachusetts--I don't know--or if you are a nonsales tax State, such \nas the State of Oregon or Montana.\n  There are a lot of questions. Frankly, I believe very strongly it \nmakes much more sense for this legislation to go to the appropriate \ncommittee where we can work on it, especially when the committee has \nmade a promise to report that bill out in the next work period. I grant \nyou it will be a short period of time to work on it, during the next \nwork period, but that is the compromise between those who want this \nbill up now--who want to ram it through, ram it through--with no \nsignificant committee consideration on the one hand and on the other \nhand having several weeks to work it out and report the bill to the \nfloor.\n  For that reason, I join my friend from Oregon in objecting to these \namendments. We can't write the bill on the floor of the Senate. We have \nto go to committees where we can work things out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I respect my colleagues from Oregon and \nMontana, but I respectfully disagree with the way they have described \nthe situation.\n  We are talking about asking Internet retailers around America, when \nthey make a sale, to collect the sales tax on that sale. That is it.\n  My colleague, Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota, was tax \ncommissioner in her State and took a case to the Supreme Court 20 years \nago about the collection of sales tax for remote sales--catalog sales, \nmail order operations.\n  She took the case to the Supreme Court, across the street, and 20 \nyears ago they said: Congress, you have to fix this problem.\n  She had hoped she found the solution, but they said, no, you can't \nfix it State by State. Congress has to fix this problem.\n  Here we are 20 years later. Senator Enzi of Wyoming has been working \non this issue for 12 years. I have joined him for the last 3 or 4, \npartnering with him in this effort. This is not a new issue. It is not \nnew to me, not new to Senator Heitkamp or anyone on the floor. As far \nas this version of the bill, this version of the bill was introduced, \nif I am not mistaken, in February--is that correct? This version of the \nbill, 11 pages--by Federal standards, this is not a big, complex piece \nof legislation.\n  We asked for hearings before the Finance Committee and we did not get \nour wish. We brought it directly to the floor. I wish it would have \nbeen heard before the Finance Committee. Perhaps they would have made \nsome adjustments or changes that might have been beneficial. But it \nreached the point where we said we have to get this done. After all \nthese years, we have to get this done.\n  Why do we have to get it done? First, understand if you happen to be \na person who has made a sacrifice and opened a small business in your \nhometown--think in terms of your sporting goods store to start with--\nyou invested your capital. You and your spouse are there every single \nday. You are part of the community, to sponsor that Little League team. \nThey came around asking for money for the United Way and you say our \nsporting goods store always gives to you. We are part of this \ncommunity.\n  Then the customers walk in the door and sit down and say I want to \ntry on that pair of running shoes, maybe try the next larger size. Do \nyou have a different color? Once they find the right running shoe, they \nsay, can I write down a few numbers here? And you know what happens \nnext. They walk out the door, go home, get on the Internet, and buy \nthat product without paying sales tax on it. So that sporting goods \nstore down on the corner or at the mall is a showroom for goods they \nare not selling.\n  We are trying to change that. We are trying to make sure if you sell \ngoods in a State, you collect the sales tax of that State. We do not \ncreate any new taxes. The tax we are collecting is already owed by the \nconsumer. We certainly do not create any new Federal\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\ntaxes whatsoever. It is just a matter of collection.\n  Why are we tied up in knots here? The two States represented by the \nlast two Senators to speak, Oregon and Montana, have no sales tax. \nThere are three other States that have no State sales tax: Alaska, \nDelaware and New Hampshire. You would think from their arguments, the \ncoercion they are talking about, we are trying to impose a sales tax on \nOregonians or Montanans. That is not true. If this bill passes, \nOregonians will not be required to pay a penny in sales tax whether \nthey buy over the counter or over the Internet. The only people who \nwill be affected by this are Internet retailers in that State who \nchoose to sell their products in States that have a sales tax. We put \nan exemption in this bill and said if your Internet retailer has less \nthan $1 million in sales the previous year, you are exempt; you do not \nhave to collect sales tax.\n  Let's take a look at the specific States that are objecting to this \nbill. Of the roughly 1,000 Internet retailers who will be affected by \nthis bill across the United States, there are 11 in the State of \nOregon. Five already collect sales tax. Let me read their names because \nyou will know them right off the bat: Adidas of Oregon already collects \nsales tax, Columbia Sportswear is already collecting sales tax, Nike is \nalready collecting sales tax, Harry and David--I have gotten that as a \ngift once in a while--already collects sales tax. Five of the 11 \nInternet retailers in Oregon already collect sales tax. This is no new \nburden on them.\n  What we are talking about, then, is six Internet retailers in Oregon \nthat I assume do not want to collect sales tax.\n  In Montana there are two Internet retailers with Web sales above the \nexemption in this bill--actually there are four in the list of Internet \nretailers, but one already collects sales tax and the other one is \nbelow the exemption level so they are not covered by this bill.\n  When I hear this objection about stopping this bill and the impact it \nis going to have on these States, we are talking about five businesses \nin Oregon, one or two businesses in Montana. That is what it is about.\n  But it is about much more, because these sales tax revenues are \nimportant to States and localities and local units of government. This \nis the money they use to avoid raising your property taxes and income \ntaxes. This is the money they use to provide basic services for the \npeople who live in the communities around these local stores and it is \na question of leveling the playing field for the businesses as well.\n  What happened today, happened yesterday, and this morning? We \nattempted to bring to the floor amendments to this bill--and I would \nsay that three of the five amendments we were bringing to the floor \nwere being offered by Senators who oppose the bill. We know it. They \ndon't want to see this bill pass. They want to try to change the bill, \nperhaps even jeopardize the bill. We are prepared to debate their \namendments. How much more fair can you be? We have opened this bill to \namendments, we have opened it to amendments that are critical of the \nbill, and the Senators object to our even debating them.\n  To the folks on C-SPAN, I am sorry, call for a refund because the \nSenate is not going to be the Senate today. We are not going to debate. \nWe are not going to vote. We are in the midst of a filibuster where we \nare trying to bring amendments to the floor for an actual debate and a \nvote on a bill and we are being stopped from doing that. Is that why we \nran for this office, so we can find ways to stop debate, stop \namendments? I think not. I think we are sent here to do a job. If \nsomeone has a good idea on this bill, I am ready to consider it. The \nInternet freedom amendment we talked about here is a bipartisan \namendment. Senator Pryor, a Democrat of Arkansas, Senator Blunt, \nRepublican of Missouri, came together and said we want to extend for 10 \nyears the prohibition against taxing people for using the Internet. I \nam for that. I am for that amendment. I want to consider it and I want \nto vote for it.\n  The Senator from Oregon said, oh, that is a spoonful of sugar in a \nbitter cup of coffee. For goodness sake, what we are trying to do is \nimprove this legislation, and if he has a good idea, offer it as an \namendment. We have opened it--Senator Enzi on the Republican side, I \nhave opened it on the Democratic side. Bring your amendments to the \nfloor. We are ready to debate them. But for the last 2 days \nconsistently, those from no-sales-tax States have stopped every effort \nto bring an amendment to a vote.\n  I think that is unfortunate. Eventually this matter will be brought \nto a vote. We have had three different votes already--75 votes in favor \nof it, 74 votes in favor of it, and 75 votes. Clearly a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate wants to finally meet the challenge the Supreme \nCourt gave us 20 years ago. We want to get this done. We put a lot of \neffort into it--no one more than Senator Enzi of Wyoming.\n  I thank Senator Alexander of Tennessee and Senator Heitkamp from \nNorth Dakota. I am going to yield the floor at this point and say to my \ncolleagues, I don't know what it takes for the Senate to be the Senate. \nThis notion of sitting here staring at one another, hoping we never get \nto a vote, is a disappointment, not only to those of us on the floor \nbut I think to those who have a lot more hope for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments on what \nhas transpired here this afternoon and for the last several days. One \nof the toughest things to do is to pass a bill. One of the easiest \nthings to do is to kill a bill. You can do that simply by creating some \nconfusion. Around here you can do it by applying some rules and \nsuggesting that part of the process could be backtracked and done \ndifferently and done over.\n  It is pretty hard to get a bill to the floor. It doesn't happen very \nmuch. It could happen easier, it could happen more often. When you get \none here, there are still a lot of ways to kill a bill and that is kind \nof what we are seeing because there are some people who say: Gee, if we \ndon't get our amendment, we are going to kill the bill. We are going to \nvote against cloture, which is the only way to move on in the Senate \nbecause we like debate, we like pretty much unlimited debate.\n  Debate can be constructive. There are things that need to be done on \nbills. I heard several good ideas. They have been objected to, so we \nare not going to get to actually vote on those. But one thing as an \naccountant that I want to bring up is this thing about audits, because \nthat can loom pretty strong for a business. Audit is something that we \nknow from the IRS and it is very scary. But the audits they are talking \nabout are not going to happen to nearly the extent they think they are \ngoing to happen. Somebody will have to be avoiding the sales tax \nentirely and they will have to have a very strong suspicion that they \nexceed $1 million online in a year before they will ever audit because \nit costs money to audit. Especially it would cost money if you went \nover the border to another State to audit. Then there are some \ndifficulties with being able to collect what is discovered in the \naudit. But it is only done when something seems very wrong.\n  One of my clients I worked with for 10 years had big sales in the \noilfield--lots of sales in the oilfield. We got audited on sales tax \nonce in 10 years. I am pleased to say they did not find anything. It \ntook them 2 weeks to do the audit and that was a very big business. It \nwas very technical stuff. Of course they looked at it because a lot of \nthem are very big sales. There are some confusing things in the sales \ntoo. But you have to have an audit in there for a little bit of \nhonesty. So that is why that is in there. But it is not going to be \nsomething the States are going to jump on because it has some costs.\n  If you are a government that wants to do audits--I remember when I \nwas in the Wyoming legislature they used to talk about how much return \nthey got out of their audit. They would get $20 or $30 to the $1 of \ncost. Consequently they used that as an argument for hiring even more \nauditors because they would find a lot more money. The intent of an \naudit is not to find $1 for every dollar that is expended. It is to \nfind $20 or $30, somebody who is violating the law in a big way so you \ncan afford the cost of the audit. That of course keeps all of the \npeople a little bit more honest. So audit has to be in here but audit \nis being blown out of\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nproportion, probably so we can try to kill the bill. I hope that is not \nthe intention.\n  They talked about needing to go to committee. I have gotten a couple \nof hearings on this in 12 years but have never been able to get a \nmarkup in the committee. This process has gotten this bill to the floor \nand I am hoping everybody will listen to their retailers and help out \non this bill and get it finished. I can tell you, being in charge of \nthis bill and one of the drafters of this bill, it is not a popularity \ncontest you are winning. It is just the right thing to do. It is what \nthe States need if they are going to have the revenue to provide all of \nthe services that are in the municipalities--whether it is police or \nfire protection or cleaning the streets or whatever is done there, plus \nall of the charitable work people in the communities do too, because \nthat is the sense of community they have so they contribute. All of \nthat is going to dry up.\n  If you ask your municipality how much money they get out of sales \ntax, I think the minimum one of them will say is 30 percent. Probably \nthe maximum is 70 percent. But that is a lot of budget and that is \ndeclining as the Internet grows and the sales happen without the tax. \nSo I hope people will help pass this bill and get this into effect. It \nis only an 11-page bill. That is a miracle around here. It is possible \nfor people to read the bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and appreciate the comments he \nmade. He is new to the Senate but he obviously read the bill. I am very \nimpressed with the comments he made. I hope people will help pass this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to respond \nto a couple of claims that have been made, especially with how they \nrelate to foreign corporations. I think there is a sense that foreign \ncorporations have absolutely no State tax obligations no matter what \nthey do in their State or what their presence is.\n  I want to clarify a couple of points. People argue that foreign \ncorporations that make remote sales will have an advantage over \ndomestic companies. We need to understand that is not true. The \nMarketplace Fairness Act treats foreign corporations the same as it \ntreats domestic corporations, and by that I mean corporations which are \nincorporated in the 50 States in our country.\n  All online retailers who make over $1 million in remote sales, \nregardless of where the retailer is located, must collect and remit \nsales tax to States that require it. States currently have and do exert \njurisdiction over foreign companies. In fact, States collect different \ntypes of tax from foreign companies even when those companies are \nexempt from Federal taxation.\n  Locating facilities--there has been a big argument here--means people \nwill now move their operations to Canada and operate out of a foreign \ncountry. That has its own brand of problems for any corporation that \nwould consider that, and I will outline some of those.\n  Locating facilities outside of the 46 States while still selling to \nthe U.S. consumers would actually increase some costs for retailers and \ncomplicate the sales process. Locating farther away from customers \nwould increase shipping costs. Many online retailers are moving their \ndistribution and other facilities closer to their consumers so they can \nbe more responsive to their customers. In fact, we are seeing 1-day \nshipping or same-day shipping.\n  International sales may be subject to duties. Foreign currency \nexchanges may be needed to conduct the sale, and so it is a whole brave \nnew world. It is a very complicated world.\n  The other thing is there is a big discussion about how to enforce it. \nStates can currently request information from Customs and Border \nProtection about international shipments into their States so they know \nwhat products are coming in and where they come from.\n  I want to take a moment to explain how this works. As my colleagues \nhave heard in this discussion on the floor, I, in fact, was the tax \ncommissioner of the State of North Dakota who initiated the action in \nQuill, but that is not the extent of my experience. I also spent a \ngreat deal of time--in fact, 6 years of my life--as a tax commissioner \ncollecting sales and use taxes.\n  We frequently have people go across the border and shop in Canada or \nspend a weekend in Canada. Their Customs reports are filed. We \ntypically would send a sales tax auditor up to review those Customs \nreports and send use tax collection statements out as a result of that. \nThat kind of compliance is already happening.\n  States also have enforcement options available to them to ensure that \nforeign corporation compliance is completed, including liens and other \nkinds of discussions.\n  I want to offer a CRS report on this issue, which said:\n\n       Finally, some have noted that U.S. based retailers may \n     respond to the expanded state tax collection authority by \n     shifting operations outside the U.S. to avoid the collection \n     burden. The costs of moving operations and increased shipping \n     costs, however, would seem greater than any benefit conferred \n     by avoiding the collection burden.\n\n  Again, as my colleagues have heard over and over, we have heard about \nhow expensive this is. Yet we have vendors out there. In fact, eBay is \ncharging no more than $15 a month to provide this service to businesses \nthey have.\n  Some may say, Well, that is all fine and good, Senator Heitkamp, I \ndon't believe that actually happens. I requested some information from \nour current tax commissioner in the tax department in North Dakota \nbecause I know a little bit about sales and use tax, and I know we \nactually have foreign corporations--Canadian corporations--that are, in \nfact, licensed or permitted as retailers.\n  In fact, the State tax department records show that in calendar year \n2011 we collected $1.6 million from Canadian companies that were \nregistered and actually remitted the tax. So anyone listening \nunderstands the level of business North Dakota is doing; our sales tax \nis 5 percent. There was a big leap in 2012 as we saw almost $3.8 \nmillion. That is, I am sure, due to Canadian companies supplying North \nDakota corporations and North Dakota businesses in the oilfield.\n  We already do this, and very many Canadian companies already know \nwhat these requirements are, just like a North Dakota domiciled company \nthat does business and takes advantage of the Canadian marketplace will \nbe subject to Manitoba taxes or subject to Sasquatchian taxes. We know \nwhat our obligations are.\n  It is very important that we do not mix concepts here. I think the \nSenate is a place where they do understand foreign tax treaties. But \nprovinces of Canada and States such as North Dakota are subnationals, \nwhich is their classification within trade law. They are not bound by \nvery many of these treaties. They are not obligated under these foreign \ntax agreements we hear over and over, and it is not make-believe. The \nreality is that in States such as North Dakota, we collect taxes from \nCanadian companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as soon as I \nfinish my brief remarks, the Senator from Montana be recognized to \nrespond to the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a partisan bill. There are times \nI am on the floor advocating for partisan advantage, but that is not \nwhat we have here. We have managers of this bill who have worked very \nhard for a long time, and this is where we are now. We are to a point \nwhere there have been a number of amendments offered, there have been \nobjections made, and so no amendments are allowed to be debated or \nvoted on, and that is where we find ourselves procedurally.\n  As the manager of the Senate, I am left with no option except to look \nto the next alternative to try and move things along, which will be \nafter midnight tonight. At 12:30 a.m. or 1 a.m. this morning, we would \nhave a vote on cloture on the bill.\n  I say to my friends who oppose this--and I know they believe in their \nopposition to it fervently--it is a big waste of time. We have had \noverwhelming votes twice. Whether we vote after midnight tonight or at \n6 p.m. this evening, it will still be the same result. So I would hope \nthose who oppose this\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nwill take a look at this and maybe arrive at a point so we can have a \nvote earlier. If that doesn't happen, everyone should understand we are \ngoing to come here sometime after midnight tonight and move forward on \nthis legislation. After that, of course, it is only a majority vote to \ncomplete this legislation.\n  The managers are still ready to allow amendments to be offered. It is \ngetting late in the day. The 30 hours is grinding to a halt. I hope we \ncan get something done and move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from North \nDakota a question. I guess I will ask the question through the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota would tell \nme where in this bill--and I have read it--a State would have the \nauthority to audit and bring enforcement action against a remote seller \nin any other country, such as China. Where in this bill does the State \nof North Dakota have the taxing authority to go to a remote seller in \nChina that is selling goods in North Dakota? Where in the bill does it \nsay that? What is the language in the bill which allows any State to \nbring enforcement action against a remote seller in any other country?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Montana, what \nthe bill exerts jurisdiction over is remote sellers. It does not \ndifferentiate whether they are foreign nationals or domestic \ncorporations. In State law we have the ability to enforce State laws \nagainst anyone who is obligated under the jurisdiction of the State to \ncomply. I will tell the Senator that the jurisdiction in here is not \nover States. It is not over Oregon or New Hampshire. It is over a \nremote seller. It does not differentiate anywhere in this bill in terms \nof a remote seller.\n  I will also tell the Senator that as the former tax commissioner of \nthe State of North Dakota, I have enforced State tax laws against \nforeign corporations just as foreign corporations have enforced their \nprovincial laws against North Dakota domiciled companies. It happens \nevery day in America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have another question. This is very \nsimilar to the context of this bill, and that is, I have asked the \nSenator from North Dakota many times to provide me with the authority \nfor that proposition. I am wondering if the Senator from North Dakota \ncould provide me the authority for that proposition rather than just \nasserting it. What is the authority? Is there a case? Is there a \nFederal law? Is there a Supreme Court case on that authority? I wish to \nknow.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, and my friend from Montana, we will \nprovide the citations and the Supreme Court cases that talk about the \nexertion of jurisdiction over foreign corporations by State taxing \nauthorities.\n  I will offer up this document which outlines that we are not parties \nto foreign treaties: Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., which is a 1941 \nSupreme Court case. Felt & Tarrant Manufacturing v. Gallagher, which is \na 1939 U.S. Supreme Court case.\n  It is a well-established and longstanding precedent in this country \nthat if a company is doing business as a foreign company in a State or \nin our jurisdictions, we have jurisdiction and can apply our State law \nand our State taxing authority over a foreign company that has \njurisdiction and nexus in our----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator just said the magic word. The Senator is \ntalking about States where there is nexus. I ask for the proposition \nwhere there is no nexus. That is the whole point of a lot of this \ndiscussion here.\n  The point in Quill is that in a State where there is no nexus, a \nsales tax cannot be enforced. Where there is nexus, it can be enforced. \nI will bet those cases the Senator cited have to do with whether a \nState is doing business in another State, and that is nexus. We are not \ntalking about that here. We are talking about remote sellers where \nthere is not nexus and not doing business in the State.\n  Let's say there is a remote seller in China selling merchandise in \nNorth Dakota. I will bet dollars to doughnuts those cases have nothing \nto do with remote sellers generally.\n  I will make a second point, that I think North Dakota will have a \nhard time enforcing the provisions of this bill in some province in \nChina. Is North Dakota going to go to Hunan Province and have the \nPremier of Hunan Province enforce this? I doubt it. It is not just \nChina, it is any other country.\n  The Senator is confusing nexus from remote sellers, and that is not \nthe point here. The point is remote sellers. That is just one of the \nproblems of this bill when we start looking at it and start thinking \nabout it and what is in it. That is why this bill should have gone to \ncommittee in the first place so we could correct it.\n  One other point, and I don't think this is understood by very many \nSenators. This is not just a nonsales-tax issue, by any stretch of the \nimagination. For example, let's say two States--and they are both \nsales-tax States. There is a remote seller in one State--let's say \nMassachusetts--selling to a State such as California, and both have \nsales taxes. Under this legislation, California State taxing authority \ncould audit the online seller in Massachusetts if it wants to and bring \nan action against that online seller in Massachusetts.\n  So this applies to remote sellers in all States. This is not just \nnonsales-tax States but all States. This bill allows all States to \nbring enforcement actions and audit actions against remote sellers in \nany State. This bill does that. That is what it provides. This is not \njust a nonsales-tax State question. This is a question that affects all \nsmall businesses, all remote sellers all around the country in addition \nto the point I mentioned earlier--and I cannot for the life of me think \nany State can bring an enforcement action in many countries around the \nworld where that remote seller does not have nexus in the State in \nquestion. This is another reason why this bill is fraught with problems \nand why it should have gone to committee in the first place.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I wish to clarify one point about nexus \nversus commerce clause, and I think it has been misstated about tax \njurisdiction.\n  There was a case decided in the 1950s called National Bellas Hess \nthat said remote sellers do not have nexus nor can we apply the \ncollection burden because of the commerce clause. When it was decided, \nwhat was decided is that, yes, North Dakota had nexus over Quill. We \ncould not apply the sales tax because it was in violation of the \ncommerce clause.\n  The nexus standards have changed from physical presence to economic \nactivity and that is why we are here. We cannot, in my opinion, as a \nbody--and as a lawyer who has studied this area--we cannot change the \nnexus standards by any statute in this body, so every State will have \nto defend their own application of nexus.\n  What we are talking about is not nexus; it is commerce clause \njurisdiction--the ability to apply it and not violate the interstate \ncommerce clause.\n  So I think we need to be very careful about our terminology.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from North \nDakota, if I may, in a colloquy for a few minutes on the subject, so we \nmay speak through the Chair to each other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota agree?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Montana has raised a good question \nabout audits. Let me say to the Senator from North Dakota, I wish to \npaint a picture, and I wish to ask the Senator from North Dakota to \nhelp me because she may be one of the newer Members of this body, but \nshe knows more about this subject than most of us put together because \nof her experience, with all respect to all the Senators already here in \nthe Senate. I wish to paint a picture of what would happen if we don't \nact.\n  We are talking about audits. We are talking about businesses. Let's \nthink about what we are talking about. I want to look to Washington \nfrom Nashville, TN, or from some other State\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\ncapital--the requests that States are making of us is that if I am a \nGovernor of Tennessee or a legislature, I want to be able to make the \ndecision myself as a sovereign State about whether people who sell in \nour State are treated in the same way.\n  A person may be a catalog seller or an Internet seller or a brick-\nand-mortar seller, but if an entity is going to sell in our State and \nwe have decided we are going to have a sales tax instead of an income \ntax, if we require the local business to collect the tax, we are going \nto require everybody who sells there to collect the tax. If an entity \nwants to sell in our State, that is what they need to do. If they want \nto drive in our State, they follow our speed limit. They follow our \ncriminal laws. If one lives in our State, they pay our income tax. If \nsomeone sells in our State, wherever they are in the world, we want \nthem to collect the tax and send it to us. That is what we are talking \nabout, treating everybody the same in that way.\n  So the obvious thing comes up: What about all these different \njurisdictions? We hear a lot about 9,600 taxing jurisdictions, and I \nlive in Maryville, TN. So the city might have a sales tax and the State \nmight have a sales tax and they might be different than what the next \ncity is.\n  So my question to the Senator from North Dakota is--what this law \ndoes is it streamlines these 9,600 jurisdictions. It simplifies the \nwhole process to make it easier for out-of-State sellers. It takes \nadvantage of the technology of the Internet so there could be a single \ntax return for each State, a single audit for each State, and States \noften work together with audits and there can only be one audit per \nyear; in other words, it reduces this burden.\n  Of course, if an entity is in Kansas and they are selling in \nTennessee, they may be subject to an audit and they file a report every \nyear electronically. But, according to this, there can only be one a \nyear.\n  What if we didn't pass this law? Let's say I am an enterprising \nGovernor of Tennessee, which I once was, and I say, the Senate can't \nget anything done. They can't even agree when they have 75 people on \nboth sides of the aisle who already have voted 3 times for the bill. So \nI have given up on them. So I am going back to the Supreme Court 20 \nyears later, after Senator Heitkamp wins as tax collector for North \nDakota, and I am going to say, back then, 20 years ago, we didn't know \nanything about the Internet and this case came to the Supreme Court and \nthe Court said it is too much of a burden on interstate commerce for \nyou to require out-of-State sellers with no physical presence in the \nState to do the same thing you already require your instate sellers to \ndo on taxes that are already owed--taxes that are already owed. I am \ngoing to go back to the Court and say things have changed. Times are \ndifferent. I can take my computer out and I can put in my ZIP Code and \ntype in ``Williams-Sonoma,'' figure out the sales tax I owe when I buy \nmy ice cream freezer online, and they can collect it and send it to the \nState of Tennessee. So it is not any sort of burden on interstate \ncommerce.\n  It is my right as a sovereign State to make everybody who wants to \nsell online or by catalog into the State of Tennessee--I am going after \nthem. I am going after them if they don't collect the tax. Then, my \nfriends in Mississippi see me do that and they do it too and then \nKentucky does it and then the next State does it and then all 9,600 \ntaxing jurisdictions go after this single remote seller.\n  They might come back to the Senate and say: Why didn't you guys do \nyour job a few years ago? Why didn't you simplify this system? Why \ndidn't you create something that was easy, which limited our liability, \nwhich made the States provide us with the software that makes this \nwork, which limited the audits to one a year, which limited the tax to \none per State? Why didn't you make it so even a smaller seller--99 \npercent of the Internet sellers are exempt from this act--a smaller \nseller wouldn't have to worry about it?\n  So I ask the Senator from North Dakota if she would respond, given \nher 20, 30 years of experience in this whole issue, am I exaggerating? \nWhat would it be like if the State of Tennessee got tired of the Senate \nnot being able to act after all this time and went back to the Supreme \nCourt and won the case and Tennessee and North Dakota and all the other \nStates started enforcing their laws against remote sellers?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, in response to my friend from Tennessee, \nthe first thing I will say is the tools we have today were not \navailable 20 years ago. The simplification, the immediacy of buying a \n$15 opportunity from e-bay so you can collect sales tax in all \njurisdictions on products that are unique to each State, that was not \neven a thought when we litigated Quill. Yet we came pretty close to \nconvincing the Court this should be allowed under the interstate \ncommerce clause. I think, at the end of the day, the Court decided that \ncase because they were concerned mainly about retroactivity. But now, \nif we compare the experience of 20 years ago to what we know in terms \nof data availability and the ease of administration today, which is \nbeing further streamlined by requiring a streamlined tax, one single \ntax base--what do I mean by that? The city of Fargo imposes sales tax. \nLet's assume for a moment we allow them to tax different products than \nwhat the State taxes. This requires one tax per product. We don't get \nto have different tax bases. So we have streamlined that piece that \nconcerned the Court at the time. When we think about it, local sales \ntaxes were not unique and were prevalent even at the time we litigated \nQuill.\n  This argument was overwhelming for the Court. They looked at the \nburden on interstate commerce, coupled with the potential of \nretroactive application, which would have meant huge audits where there \nwas no opportunity to collect, and said: You know what. We think this \nis better left to Congress. We share an obligation with Congress on \ninterstate commerce. We think Congress can do the right thing.\n  The world has changed since then. What we know that Internet sellers \nknow about us today is remarkable. Can we imagine litigation, I say to \nmy friend from Tennessee, where we show that we simply order--in my \ncase one plus-size blouse--and we get all kinds of plus-size ads on the \nside. Some people think that is kind of insulting, but I think it is an \ninteresting evaluation of how much these retail sellers know about us \nindividually. If they can know that, they can collect the sales tax.\n  The other piece of this that is new in this statute that I think \nfurther compels us is we are not talking about the small mom-and-pops. \nThe other reason why I am supporting this legislation is I have small \nbeekeepers who make wax candles and maybe they put those wax candles on \nthe Internet; maybe they make $20,000, $30,000 a year selling wax \ncandles. I don't want them, after further litigation, to have a burden \nof sales tax collection. They are small mom-and-pops, and we are \ntalking about $1 million.\n  So, in many ways, this legislation is prosmall business, it is \nprostreamlining tax. If we let this go back to the Court with a better \nargument than we are not burdening interstate commerce, with an \nargument that we can do it for $15 a month, the Court is going to be \npersuaded that there is no impediment to interstate commerce, and that \nis the risk we run by not acting and not acting soon.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her knowledge \nand her contribution to the debate. Of course, what she is emphasizing \nis that if we do act, we simplify things for the small businessperson. \nFor one thing, we exempt anyone whose revenues are less than $1 \nmillion. That, by some economists' studies, is 99 percent of all \nInternet sellers. If we don't act and a case is won in the Supreme \nCourt today, that is different than 20 years ago. There is no $1 \nmillion exemption--there is no $1 million exemption--and there is \nexposure to 9,600 tax districts if they win that case.\n  So the thing to think about is if we do our job, and the Supreme \nCourt said 20 years ago we are the ones to do it--and 74 or 75 of us 3 \ntimes now have indicated we think we should through this 12-page bill, \nwe will provide an exemption for virtually all Internet sellers, we \nwill create rules that simplify, and we will give States the \nopportunity to do what States should have the opportunity to do. My \nheavens, I hear some people say--and I have said this on the floor--\nWashington didn't trust the States to make these decisions about tax \nmatters. Nobody in Tennessee\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\ntrusts Washington to make decisions about tax matters. So what this \nbill does is say to the State of Tennessee or Delaware, it is your \nbusiness; you decide it. If what you want to do is collect tax from \nsome of the people who owe it and not all of the people who owe it--\nStates have the right to be right; States have the right to be wrong. \nThat is what the 10th Amendment is about. In some States, they will use \nthe money to pay teachers more for teaching well.\n  In the State of Ohio they have already decided if this passes, they \nare going to lower the income tax. The Governor of Idaho said he \nalready has his eye on a tax he would like to lower. If we can collect \ntaxes from everybody who already owes them--and that is the important \npoint to make. We are not talking about new taxes; we are talking about \ntaxes people aren't paying that they owe. So why should I have to pay \nmy tax, and if the Senator from Delaware is in the same similar \nsituation, why should he not have to pay? So in each State, the same \npeople ought to have to pay.\n  Art Laffer, the distinguished economist who wrote a good column in \nthe Wall Street Journal endorsing this idea of marketplace fairness, \nsaid the best tax, if there has to be a tax, is one that affects the \nlargest number of people at the lowest possible rate. If we have a 10-\npercent sales tax in Tennessee and 25 percent of the people who buy \nthings are not paying a tax they owe, they ought to be paying it. They \nought to be paying it. If they all pay it, we can lower the rate for \neverybody. That is what--we are not deciding that here; we are just \ndeciding the States could have the right to decide.\n  But the important point of the Senator from North Dakota is that if \nwe act, we are protecting the small seller by creating the $1 million \nexemption. We are protecting the small seller or any remote seller by \nsaying you have a limited liability, a limited number of audits, a \nlimited number of States to do it in, and if we don't act and the \nSupreme Court hears this case, Katy bar the door, and out-of-State \nsellers all over the world will be coming to the Congress and saying: \nWhy didn't you do your job?\n  So there is a good reason why we have a majority of Democrats who \nhave voted three times to express their support for this bill and a \nmajority of Republicans who have done the same. There is a good reason \nwhy leading observers across the country, from the chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union and others who don't like to see States \npicking and choosing between winners and losers--there is a good reason \nall of those people support this. And there is a good reason it is an \n11-page bill. It is a simple idea.\n\n  We have sovereign States. States make their own tax laws. Unless \nStates, by their tax laws, create an unconstitutional burden on an out-\nof-State seller, it is no business of ours. We should create the \nenvironment the court says to give them the freedom to make those \ndecisions for themselves. Some may do it one way, some may do it \nanother, but States have the right to be right, States have the right \nto be wrong, and we have the responsibility to recognize the \nconstitutional framework of our country which was created by sovereign \nStates.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have an attempt to move and rush \nthrough the Senate an immigration bill before the American people can \nabsorb what is in it. I think this is a very bad policy. The bill was \nintroduced at 2 a.m. 8 days ago. It was set for markup in the committee \ntoday. Our diligent staff has been trying to read it and absorb it, and \nthey are having a great deal of difficulty sifting through this \ncomplicated 844-page bill.\n  Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, has asked \nfor the bill to be put over for 1 week. Next week is a recess, so now \nit will come up in 2 weeks to be presented and passed out of committee.\n  On Monday, we had a hearing. I will not say it was a circus, but it \nwas impossible to absorb all the information. Twenty-three witnesses \ntestified, one right after the other, 5 or so minutes each. The \nSenators who were here on Monday--not a lot--had 5 minutes of \nquestioning and not much was resolved. They did not know what was in \nthe bill either. They were just testifying about policy, basically. \nNobody could explain exactly how the bill is going to work.\n  So people say: You should be able to handle a bill like that. You \nshould be able to read an 844-page bill.\n  So I just want to show why this is a pretty complicated process and \nwhy a piece of legislation such as this has to be carefully read. It is \nnot easy to do so.\n  So this is page 65 of the bill that I will show you. It deals with an \nissue I talked about yesterday. Secretary Napolitano issued a \nprosecutorial directive and guidance to ICE officers that was so \nupsetting to the ICE officers that they sued her and their Director, \nMr. Morton, in Federal court, saying she is directing them not to \nfollow plain U.S. law.\n  I brought it up in the hearing, and Chairman Leahy said: Well, a lot \nof people file lawsuits. Very few win. Well, yesterday or the day \nbefore yesterday, the Federal judge basically ruled in favor of the \nofficers and said a Secretary of DHS has no authority to issue \nguidelines that counteract plain mandatory Federal law. So, basically, \nthe Secretary was saying: Do not remove certain people from the country \nthat current law says must be removed. She was refusing to do what the \nlaw of the United States says. This is one of the reasons we have such \na problem reforming and fixing immigration law. It is because the \nAmerican people have little or no confidence in the willingness of our \nofficials to even follow present law, much less new law.\n  They have planned to fix this in the bill so now the Secretary would \nhave even more power. In the legislation we have already found maybe \n200 references to waivers and discretion of the Secretary. But look at \npage 65:\n\n       (B) Waiver.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretary may waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A)(i)(III) or any provision of section 212(a) \n     that is not listed in clause (ii) on behalf of an alien for \n     humanitarian purposes, to ensure family unity, or if such \n     waiver is otherwise in the public interest. Any discretionary \n     authority to waive grounds of inadmissibility under section \n     212(a) conferred under any other provision of this Act shall \n     apply equally to aliens seeking registered provisional status \n     under this section.\n       (ii) Exceptions.--\n\n  Exceptions to that.\n\n     The discretionary authority under clause (i) may not be used \n     to waive--\n       (I) subparagraph (B), (C), (D)(ii), (E), (G), (H), or (I) \n     of section 212(a)(2);\n       (II) section 212(a)(3);\n       (III) subparagraph (A), (C), (D), or (E) of section \n     212(a)(10). . . .\n\n  So if I am a Senator, and I am trying to protect the interests of the \npeople of the United States to understand what a piece of legislation \nmeans, I have to go back and read every one of those subparagraph \nexceptions.\n  This is gobbledygook. My staff tells me every time they go back and \nread it, they see more difficulty. I have not even had a chance to look \nat this. Oh, but do not worry about it, we have set up a vision. We \nhave a vision of this great immigration bill that is going to be \ncomprehensive and fix all our problems. Trust us. Do not worry about \nit. You will find out what is in it later. Right? Just like health \ncare, I guess.\n  This is not a way to do business. The immigration policy of the \nUnited States is just as important as the health care policy of the \nUnited States.\n  I am not going to consent to this bill. We ought to find out what is \nin it. It goes on more and more and more, this kind of gobbledygook.\n  Continuing:\n\n       (IV) with respect to misrepresentations relating to the \n     application for registered provisional immigrant status, \n     section 212(a)(6)(C)(i).\n\n  And it goes on.\n  It is not right to say that people who are concerned about the \nlegislation are\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nobstructing the process. We are trying to find out what the bill does.\n\n  A headline yesterday in the Christian Science Monitor said: How many \npeople will be made legal under this bill? It then quoted one of the \nsupporters of the bill as saying: We don't know.\n  So I asked at the Judiciary Committee this morning--one of the \nsponsors was there, Senator Schumer--I asked: Do you want to tell us \nhow many people are going to be legalized under the bill? Oh, we don't \nknow.\n  So we do not know that. We do not know answers to other questions, \nsuch as: How much will the bill cost the Treasury of the United States? \nWhat kind of expenses will be incurred? What is the total number of \npeople who will be admitted?\n  What we have discovered has revealed that the legislation fails to \nlive up to virtually all the promises that have been made about it so \nfar. I hate to say that, but that is the truth.\n  Let me list a few instances. These are promises we have been told are \ntaken care of or will be effectuated by the legislation if we just vote \nfor this good bill. Just vote for it. It is 844 pages. Just vote for \nit. Here are some of the things:\n  We were told the bill would be enforcement first. But the plan \nconfers immediate legalization in exchange for future promises of plans \nfor enforcement, many of which will likely never occur. We have plain \nlaw now that requires removal in lots of cases that the Secretary is \nfailing to follow.\n  In fact, a major loophole that jeopardizes the entire border security \nsection commands that the Secretary of DHS grant current illegal \nimmigrants permanent legal status and, therefore, a guaranteed path to \neventual citizenship after 10 years if just one of the so-called \ntriggers that is supposed to ensure enforcement is prevented from \noccurring by a lawsuit. So all they have to do is to keep an \nenforcement trigger tied up in court for ten years, and then the people \nare not going to be deported if the enforcement does not occur.\n  We were told the Secretary would be required to build a fence at the \nborder. We passed a law in 2007 that required 700 miles of double-\nstrength fencing at the border--not the whole border but 700 miles. How \nmany miles have been built since then? Thirty. Congress passed a law \nthat said we would do this enforcement in the future, but it has not \noccurred.\n  We were told the bill would reduce the deficit. We have been told it \nwill reduce the deficit and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. \nBut the effect will be to legalize large numbers of low-skilled \nimmigrants. Over half of those illegally here today do not have a high \nschool diploma and will add trillions to the unfunded liabilities of \nMedicare, Social Security, and the President's new ObamaCare health \ncare bill.\n  We are talking about trillions of dollars when Social Security and \nMedicare need to be strengthened, not weakened; and the numbers are not \ngoing to be disputed. It is not going to strengthen Social Security and \nMedicare, as many advocates say. It is going to weaken it, and it is \nalso going to weaken the financial stability of the ObamaCare \nlegislation.\n  We were told illegal immigrants would not have access to public \nbenefits, but the bill ensures that millions of illegal immigrants will \nimmediately be eligible for State and local public assistance. If \npeople need something, need health care, they are going to get it \nsomewhere. Some will get formal benefits in as short as 5 years and \nwill be eligible for all Federal welfare programs at the time of the \ngrant of citizenship.\n  We were told there was a 10-year path to green cards or permanent \nlegal residence and a 13-year path before one could become a citizen. \nBut 2 to 3 million of those who are in the country illegally are \nexpected to assert that they came into the country as younger people \nand, therefore, would be eligible for citizenship in 5 years under this \nremarkably broad DREAM Act provision that removes any age cap on the \npersons who can assert that they came as a youth. Even those who had \nbeen removed from the country can come back and claim the benefits of \nthis bill.\n  Illegal agriculture workers will also get green cards in 5 years. \nIndividuals working illegally in agriculture today would be able to get \nlegal permanent resident status in just 5 years. This would enable them \nto receive benefits of some kind. We were told this legislation was for \nillegal immigrants who have deep roots in the country. But the amnesty \nis extended to recent arrivals, including those who may have come here \nalone just over a year ago.\n  Millions would be legalized who overstayed their visas. People who \nare not even living in the country anymore could return and receive \nbenefits and legal status. Those who have been deported multiple times \ncould receive benefits under this legislation. That is just what is in \nthis complex 844-page bill.\n  We were told the legislation would curtail the administration's \naggressive undermining of Federal law. That somehow the law was going \nto be enforced more. But it provides the Secretary of Homeland Security \nwith even more discretion than she has today. It is filled with grants \nof waiver power and discretionary power. The American people are very \ndubious of the willingness of our government to do anything that would \nconsistently and effectively enforce laws.\n  I believe the American people's heart is right about the issue of \nimmigration. I believe the American people should be respected and \ntheir opinions valued. What are they saying? They say: We need a lawful \nsystem of immigration. People should be treated fairly. They believe in \nimmigration. Right now we are bringing in 1 million people a year \nlegally. The American people say that is about right, although a recent \npoll showed that over half of the American people believe that number \nis too high. They would like to see it brought down some at this time \nof unemployment and falling wages.\n  They still strongly favor immigration for America. They are not mad \nat immigrants. They do not hate immigrants. They do not dislike them. \nThey respect people who want to come to America. They understand the \ndesire of good people around the world who would like to come to \nAmerica. But what they are angry about is people in high office flatly \ntelling them time and time again: We are going to fix this system, we \nare going to make it lawful, and we will make it one that you can be \nproud of. Then they do not do it. They say they are going to build a \nfence, and it does not get built. They say they passed a law that \nrequires removal of certain people who violate the law; they do not get \nremoved. The American people are right about this. It is Congress and \nthe President who have not been fulfilling the right standard.\n  We were told there would be strict standards for amnesty, but the \nbill grants amnesty for those who have been convicted of multiple \ncrimes. There are a whole host of exceptions to ineligibility. We were \ntold the bill would make us safer. But Mr. Chris Crane, the head of the \nICE association, said it will not; that immigration officers have been \nundermined. They have voted--the 7,000-member association voted no \nconfidence in Mr. Morton, their supervisor. They filed a lawsuit for \nthe failure of their officials to allow them to enforce the law, \nbasically complaining about their supervisors directing them to violate \nthe law.\n  That is what they complained about. That is what the judge seemed to \ntake very seriously. We were told this would move us toward a merit-\nbased, high-skilled immigration system with a responsible future flow \nthat would be more effective in identifying people who could be \nsuccessful in America. This might be the biggest and most dangerous \nflaw of all. It does not look like it is going to move our numbers in \nany way in that direction.\n  The bill would remove limitations on the number of visas for spouses \nand children of green card holders. That would apply to both those here \nillegally and all current and future legal immigrants. It would clear \nthe 4.5 million illegal immigration backlog of people who filed to come \nunder chain migration, family migration. Only so many were supposed to \nbe admitted per year. You file and wait until your time comes up, then \nyou get admitted. So, apparently, the drafters of the bill felt bad \nbecause people said: You are giving people who came illegally advantage \nover those who have been waiting their time.\n  So how did they solve that? That is a pretty brilliant way to solve \nit. They\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nagreed to let everybody who has filed to come in immediately and exempt \nfrom them from the caps. That would solve the problem all right.\n  Those who are approved under the DREAM Act, persons who came as \nyounger individuals, can obtain green cards on an expedited status for \ntheir spouses and children. We have to be careful that we do not create \na system that allows aging parents to be brought to the country in \nlarge numbers. That will be a burden on us. Truly, we have to be \nthoughtful about that. We have to be responsible. As a member of the \nBudget Committee, we are looking at these numbers. We have to reduce \nour costs, not add to it wherever possible.\n  The agriculture worker program is expanded, giving the Secretary of \nHomeland Security almost unchecked authority to increase the visas to \nwhatever number he or she sees fit. Think about this: The Christian \nScience Monitor asked: How many will be illegal immigrants will be \nadmitted?\n  I asked the bill sponsors and supporters today in committee: How many \nwould be admitted over the next 10 years?\n  Under current law, we should be admitting about 1 million people a \nyear, the largest number any Nation in the world allows, to come into \nour country legally. That would be 10 million over 10 years. Under this \nbill, we believe the number would be 30 million-plus.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, I respect their work and their efforts. \nI know we have always valued immigration in our country, but it is time \nto create a system that serves the national interest, a lawful system \nwhere those who violate the law are not rewarded, those who do not \nviolate the law are validated, a system that brings in the kind of \nperson that has the best chance to be successful and not be a ward of \nthe State or charge of the State.\n  There are a lot of things that we really need to do: protect our \nnational security, have a system and a policy that we are proud of, \nthat is morally defensible. I am afraid this bill is not there. That is \nwhy I am concerned about it. I look forward to doing the best I can to \nexamine it carefully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the course of the next several \nweeks, I hope to come to the floor and visit with my colleagues about \nthe immigration bill that will soon be going through the Judiciary \nCommittee. Today I want to share my thoughts on the parts that deal \nwith the border security section of S. 744.\n  The immigration bill is very likely to allow millions of people who \nentered our country illegally or overstayed their visa to receive legal \nstatus and eventually green cards. However, it is very unlikely to \nresult in true border security. The bill provides that those in a \nprobationary status--and that is known in this legislation as \n``registered provisional immigrant status''--be given green cards as \nsoon as the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that four \nconditions have been satisfied.\n  On page 11 of the bill it lays out the process. The Secretary \ncertifies that the border and fencing strategies, and those strategies \nare ones that she wrote, are substantially deployed, operational, and \ncompleted. She also has to implement a mandatory employment \nverification program and electronic exit system at airports and \nseaports. The authors of the bill envision that this will happen in 5 \nor 10 years down the road.\n  There are three reasons this process is problematic: First, the \nSecretary has unbridled discretion to conclude that the four provisions \nhave been satisfied even if they have not been satisfied. The Secretary \ndetermines if the strategic plans are substantially deployed, \noperational, and completed according to requirements of the law. For \nexample, the Secretary could say she is using an electronic exit system \nby collecting visa and passport information even if that system is not \ntotally effective. The bill establishes no deadline for implementing \nany of these conditions.\n  Second, the bar is set very low for certifying that these conditions \nhave been met. One of the four triggers to green card is a summation of \na border fencing strategy. The bill defines in one sentence in section \n5 the contents of that border fencing strategy condition. At a hearing \non Tuesday before our Judiciary Committee, Secretary Napolitano \ntestified that fencing was not a priority of this administration.\n  Considering how sensitive of an issue this is, one would not think \nshe would say that. She did not really want $1.5 billion to be \ndesignated just for fencing. She implied that no more fencing was \nneeded. Well, ask the people down on the border if that is true. She \ntestified that the Department would prefer flexibility to use \ntechnologies other than fences. She stated that if she determined that \nlittle or no additional funding were necessary for fencing, she might \nthen be able to certify this condition very quickly.\n  Third, litigation could ensure that legalization could occur in 10 \nyears, regardless of whether any and all of the four border security \ntriggers in the bill are met. The bill does this in four ways: First, \ngreen cards can be issued if litigation of any kind prevents any \nconditions from being met. Second, green cards can be issued if the \nSupreme Court rules that the implementation of any of the conditions is \nunconstitutional. Third, green cards can be issued if the Supreme Court \ngrants review of litigation on the constitutionality of the \nimplementation of these conditions. I note that this provision is \nespecially ill-considered because it could trigger green cards merely \nbecause the Supreme Court agreed to review the condition's \nconstitutionally, a highly likely event even if the Court later upheld \nthat.\n  Fourth, the bill restricts litigation challenging one particular \ndecision of the Secretary to a constitutional challenge only. But that \nlimitation expressly does not apply to litigation challenging \nimplementation of the conditions. Litigation brought against the \nconditions can be based on any legal theory.\n  Under the bill, if any court in this country issues a stay on \nimplementing one of the conditions, then green cards are to be issued \nafter 10 years.\n  The bill does not specify what sort of ruling must prevent \nimplementation or even that the ruling be based on the merits, nor does \nthe bill require that appeals run their course, even if the appeal \nupholds the condition. It says that the Secretary ``shall permit''--and \nthis is mandatory language--``shall permit'' applications for \nadjustment to LPR status if ``litigation . . . has prevented one of the \nconditions from being implemented.''\n  Under the plain language of the bill, 10 days after the day that any \ncourt prevents any of the border security conditions from being \nimplemented, then, of course, the floodgates for green cards are to be \nopened. And nothing in the bill stops the administration from agreeing \nto a consent decree that prevents one of the conditions from being met.\n  Because I listened to over 7 hours of testimony on Monday and because \non Tuesday the Secretary of Homeland Security shared her thoughts, I \nsummarize to this one statement: During all that time, not one person \ndisputed the fact that legalization begins upon the mere submission of \nboth a southern border security and fencing strategy. Thus, the \nundocumented become legal after the plans are submitted despite the \npotential that the plans could be flawed and inadequate.\n  If enacted today, the bill would provide no pressure on this \nSecretary or future Secretaries to actually secure the border.\n  Secretary Napolitano has stated that the border is stronger than ever \nbefore. She even indicated that Congress should not hold up \nlegalization by adding border security measures and requiring them to \nbe a trigger for the program.\n  I am concerned that the bill we will be taking up repeats the \nmistakes we made in 1986. Maybe people will resent my referring to \n1986, but I do that because I went through this before, and we thought \nwe were doing it absolutely right in 1986. We didn't secure the border \nthen and assumed legalization alone would stop the flow of more people \ncrossing the border without papers.\n  Simply, we screwed up. We need to learn a lesson because the basis of \nthis whole legislation is that the borders will be secured. The people \ndon't want some phony language that allows the Secretary to circumvent \ncongressional intent.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to really understand what the bill does in \nregard to border security and, in the process, to make sure the same \nmistakes of 1986 aren't repeated and to insist that the border be \nsecured instead of trusting what the Secretary says.\n  In regard to this whole issue, there has been a lot of finger-\npointing going on in Washington in the past 2 weeks as it relates to \nimmigration. It is a lot like the weeks and months after 9/11. What \nwarning signs were missed about the brothers who bombed the Boston \nMarathon? Law enforcement and intelligence agencies tell conflicting \nstories. Bureaucracies are gearing up to do battle over who dropped the \nball. They are preparing their defenses. They are leaking bits and \npieces of information favorable to themselves.\n  Meanwhile, Congress and the public have a growing number of \nquestions. I have written to the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe FBI. Senator Paul and I have written on another matter to the FBI. \nBut the Senate Judiciary Committee has not yet received clear answers \nto our questions, and there are very serious questions about whether \nour government has forgotten the lessons of 9/11.\n  The most important of those lessons is this: When extremist fanatics \nsay they want to wage war against us, we should take them seriously. \nOur government was reportedly warned on multiple occasions that one of \nthese brothers had become a radical jihadist. Do we still have agencies \nfailing to follow up, failing to share information, and failing to \nconnect the dots?\n  In this morning's Washington Post, the editorial board asked, ``Is \nthe FBI focused enough on the real bad guys?'' The editorial pointed \nout that in addition to the older brother in Boston, several people who \nhave been investigated by the FBI have gone on to commit attacks. The \nPost cited 2 examples: the man who shot 2 soldiers at a Little Rock \nmilitary recruiting office in 2009 and the man who was accused of \nshooting and killing 13 people at Fort Hood later that year.\n  According to the editorial, ``Meanwhile, the FBI has devoted \nconsiderable resources to sting operations . . . sometimes on what look \nlike dubious grounds.'' For example, the FBI launched an elaborate \nsting operation in Boston against a man planning to attack the U.S. \nCapitol with a remote-controlled model airplane loaded with grenades.\n  The Post concluded:\n\n       In [some cases], it's not clear that a sometimes far-\n     fetched plot would have gone forward without the \n     encouragement and help of FBI informants.\n\n  That is a very good point. It may be easier for an FBI informant to \ndraw someone into a far-fetched plan, but it is harder to detect the \nreal terrorist plot, such as the one in Boston. Unfortunately, it is \nconnecting the dots that keeps us safe, not those easy sting \noperations.\n  Other warning signs about the older brother may have been missed \nbecause tips about him weren't shared between law enforcement. The \nolder brother's best American friend was murdered in an unusual triple \nhomicide. My office has been told that local authorities investigating \nthe murder were unaware of the warnings from Russia about his \nradicalization. Thus, those local authorities in turn apparently didn't \nknow they should make the FBI aware of the murder.\n\n  Four months later the older brother traveled to Russia, just as the \nRussian Government had warned us. The FBI claims it was unaware of the \nolder brother's trip, even though the Homeland Security Department says \nits systems alerted them to the travel. Did the Homeland Security \nDepartment fail to share that information with the FBI?\n  The immigration reform bill, with all of its bells and whistles, \ncan't make agencies share information with each other. That bill is \nsupposed to require background checks on the 12 million people who are \nin our country undocumented. Yet it seems we have a hard time doing \nsuccessful background checks just on those here legally.\n  Lack of information-sharing and failure to see real warning signs are \nprobably things that no bill will fix. What has to change is the \nculture, and, of course, that begins at the top. It requires true \nleadership.\n  At the end of the day, this is about much more than who dropped the \nball. It is about learning from mistakes and doing a better job next \ntime. In order to do that, we need real transparency about what \nhappened, not just talking points from agencies trying to deflect the \nblame.\n  The immigration bill before the Senate will make enforcement of \nimmigration laws more inefficient, time-consuming, and ineffective.\n  I would refer my colleagues to section 3502 of the bill. That section \ngoverns immigration court proceedings. Under current law, people here \nillegally who are going through removal proceedings are not entitled to \nlegal counsel at government expense, and the Justice Department is not \nrequired to provide that. However, this section opens the law wide, \nmaking taxpayers foot the bill for attorneys who will represent people \nhere who are undocumented. It provides that ``the Attorney General, in \nthe Attorney General's sole and unreviewable discretion, may appoint or \nprovide counsel to aliens in'' removal proceedings.\n  The heading of the section implies that court proceedings would run \nmore efficiently, when in actuality the goal is to ensure that people \nhere illegally have every opportunity to fight removal orders. Some of \nthese aliens could be dangerous. They certainly don't deserve free \ncounsel whenever the Attorney General is inclined. Making it harder to \ndeport aliens who should be deported will make it harder to deter \naliens from entering the country illegally. Of course, there are \norganizations, such as law firms, law school clinics, and others, that \nprovide pro bono legal services to aliens at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  The bill's language is just so astounding. There are very few \nstatutes that say that any government official can do anything in his \nor her ``sole and unreviewable discretion.'' That means no oversight. \nHowever, time and again throughout this bill this language pops up. It \nmeans that no court can stop what that official wants to do. That is \nhard to square with our principles of democracy and a government based \non the principles of checks and balances.\n  Ironically, the title for the section implies that this measure would \n``reduce costs,'' but in fact it only increases the costs for \ntaxpayers. This measure to provide legal counsel for people here \nillegally would be paid for from the newly created fund known as the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform and Trust Fund. This fund, on the date \nof enactment, will have $6.5 billion, which is transferred from the \nGeneral Treasury. How much will this section cost? We won't know until \nCBO scores it, but it won't be borne by the people in the removal \nproceedings, and that is going to be hard for the American people to \nswallow.\n  Anything that makes deportation harder or that makes deportation \nproceedings more likely to be about delaying tactics should be avoided, \nbut the immigration bill appears to desire those results as goals. We \nshould decline that invitation to mischief that is going to be a direct \nresult.\n\n\n                 Drug Prevention and Treatment Programs\n\n  Mr. President, I have long been a strong advocate for the responsible \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n  Throughout my career I have sent countless requests, letters, and \nconducted numerous investigations all in the interest of preventing \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. Today, we are confronted \nwith a government that is recklessly spending tax dollars and running \nup a huge Federal budget deficit and debt. We are also confronted with \nthe need to tighten the government's belt when it comes to this \nreckless spending.\n  One area where we need to do a better job of responsibly using \ntaxpayer dollars is through our drug treatment and prevention efforts. \nI have a strong commitment to ensure drug abuse does not flourish in \ncommunities throughout the country. I have championed numerous efforts \nto prevent drug abuse before it starts including my sponsorship of the \nDrug Free Communities grant program.\n  Drug abuse is very costly to society. The National Survey on Drug Use \nand Health estimates that 22.5 million Americans aged 12 and older used \ndrugs in 2011. This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed in \nan aggressive but wise manner.\n  Senator Feinstein and I requested the Government Accountability \nOffice\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nto conduct a study of the Federal drug treatment and prevention \nprograms that has recently been released. This report and another, \nwhich annually reports on the duplication or overlapping of Federal \nprograms, states that out of 76 drug abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms 59 or nearly 80 percent had evidence of overlapping efforts. \nIn Fiscal Year 2012, 4.5 billion taxpayer dollars were allocated to \nthese programs.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported that some programs, \nincluding the Drug Free Communities program, have a low risk for \nduplication because they have coordinated their efforts among their \nrespective administering agencies. However, 29 of the 76 programs \nsurveyed reported that no staff have coordinated with other agencies or \nprograms to reduce duplication. This is almost 40 percent of all \nFederal drug prevention and treatment programs. The report further \nstates that the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is \nresponsible for coordinating the government's anti-drug efforts, has \nnot systematically assessed drug abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms to examine the extent of overlap or opportunities for \ncoordination.\n  It is with disappointment that I learned that the President has \nproposed a significant increase in his Budget to many of these \nprograms. Specifically, the President has proposed a $1.5 billion \nincrease for drug treatment programs, which is an increase of 18 \npercent from fiscal year 2012. Many of these programs have good \nintentions and may even do good work, but in a time when we are making \nmany painful cuts throughout most federal agencies and programs to rein \nin spending should we be making such large increases?\n  Further, should we be spending more taxpayer dollars on programs that \nare duplicating efforts before they correct their problems? The last \nthing we need to be doing now is chasing good money after bad, and this \nis what the President is proposing with his budget.\n  Before we start increasing any program budget, we must first ensure \nthat program is responsibly tracking and utilizing every taxpayer \ndollar it currently has and not wasting it by duplicating the work of \nanother program. One example of success in eliminating duplication can \nbe found with the National Drug Intelligence Center.\n  This center had repeatedly been listed as a duplicating agency for a \nnumber of years. The funding for this center was eventually eliminated \nin fiscal year 2011 while the work of the center has been consolidated.\n  I am pleased that the Office of National Drug Control Policy agrees \nwith the recommendation of the Government Accountability Office report \nto assess the extent of overlap and duplication across all drug \nprevention and treatment programs by identifying where agencies can \nbetter coordinate their efforts. Yet these actions should have been \ntaken years ago. However, it is with disappointment that I saw no \nmention of any effort to assess prevention and treatment programs in \nthe President's recently released 2013 National Drug Control Strategy.\n  In fact, it appears that the President wants to expand many of the \nprograms that currently do not coordinate efforts in his strategy. An \nassessment must be done and actions must be taken to eliminate waste \nbefore any expansions take place.\n  Failure to adhere to the Government Accountability Office \nrecommendation will result in more wasted taxpayer dollars and less \nrecipients benefitting from those dollars. The people most vulnerable \nto drug abuse, our Nation's youth, require our best efforts with the \nlimited resources we have to ensure they receive the proper education \nand professional help so that they can grow into healthy adults. By \nfailing to carefully safeguard taxpayer dollars, we are failing our \nchildren and grandchildren. We must do better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, Senator Murkowski of Alaska is a strong \nleader on energy issues, and I am proud to work with her on the Energy \nand National Resources Committee. It is fitting that we are here \ndespite representing different States from different regions of the \ncountry to talk about an issue we believe can bring us together.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike can agree that when it comes to \nAmerican energy, we need a comprehensive, all-of-the-above strategy, \nand that is the only way we are going to succeed in securing homegrown \nand affordable sources of energy for the next generation.\n  In my view, oil and gas are not going away anytime soon. If renewable \nsources of energy are going to grow and become central players in the \nAmerican energy marketplace, we have to make sure they are operating on \na level playing field. Right now the playing field is anything but \nequal.\n  For nearly 30 years, traditional sources of energy have had access to \na very beneficial tax structure called Master Limited Partnerships. \nThis is a financing arrangement that taxes projects like a partnership, \na passthrough, but trades their interests like a corporate stock. This \nprevents double taxation and leaves more cash available for \ndistribution back to investors.\n  This allows limited partners and general partners to come together \nand invest capital in a Master Limited Partnership and form an \noperating company. For the last 30 years, that has been used in natural \ngas, oil, and coal mining, predominately in pipelines but also in \nfossil fuels.\n  Not surprisingly, this structure means MLPs have had access to \nprivate capital at a lower cost, and that is something capital-\nintensive projects, such as oil pipelines, badly need. Frankly, it is \nsomething alternative energy projects in the United States need more \nthan ever.\n  Let's work together and level this playing field. Let's remove the \nrestriction that allows only traditional energy projects, such as, oil, \ngas, coal, and pipelines, to form MLPs. It is literally in the original \nstatute that only nonrenewable forms of energy are eligible. In my \nview, we should open it up to include clean and renewable energy and \nthen let the free market take it from there. So this week, Senator \nMurkowski and I joined Republicans and Democrats from the House and the \nSenate to introduce the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act of \n2013--a bill that will do just that. We are grateful for the support of \nSenators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, as well \nas Congressman Ted Poe of Texas, Mike Thompson of California, Peter \nWelch of Vermont, and Chris Gibson of New York, who are original \ncosponsors.\n\n  Our bill does not change these benefits for traditional energy \nsources at all. It doesn't touch existing MLPs and their well-\nestablished benefits for coal and oil and natural gas; it just allows \nrenewable energy projects to compete fairly by also accessing this tax \nadvantage capital formation field. It gives an equal chance for success \nfor projects using energy from wind and the Sun, the heat of the Earth, \nand biomass; breakthrough technologies to consumers with affordable \nhomegrown energy for generations to come.\n  This bill is this year a new and improved version of the Master \nLimited Partnership Parity Act from last year. We introduced a version \nlast year that earned strong support from Republicans and Democrats, as \nwell as outside experts and the business community. This year we are \nexpanding the scope of the bill to also include additional energy \nprojects that qualify as MLPs: waste heat to power, carbon capture and \nstorage, biochemicals, and energy efficiency in buildings. We wanted to \ninclude a broader array of clean energy resources because that is how \nwe can get the best competition and deliver the most affordable and \nefficient energy to consumers from Delaware to Alaska and across our \nwhole country.\n  MLPs are complicated financial structures, but our bill is very \nsimple. It is just a few pages long. It makes one simple tweak to the \nTax Code to bring these renewable energy and clean energy projects into \nthe existing structures of MLPs. It is the embodiment of what I have \nheard from many colleagues in the last 3 years, that we should not be \npicking winners and losers in energy technology, and we should have an \n``all of the above'' strategy.\n  This change, in my view, will bring a significant new wave of private \ncapital off the sidelines and into the renewable energy marketplace. It \nallows the private sector to look at clean energy in a whole new way. \nToday, master limited partnerships have reached a market capitalization \nof close to $450 billion with about 80 percent of it devoted to \ntraditional energy projects--oil and gas--and the majority of that to \npipelines. Access to this kind of scale of private capital could drive \nthe investment that is essential to creating new jobs in a fast growing \nnew field.\n  It would also, in my view, bring some fairness, some modernization to \nthis well-established section of our Tax Code. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, our Tax Code hasn't been broadly modernized in decades. In the \nmid-1980s, Congress enacted provisions to establish MLPs for oil and \ngas, timber and coal, and midstream energy industries. This tax benefit \nhasn't been significantly changed, expanded, or modernized in nearly 30 \nyears.\n  Just to be clear, we are not talking about taking away any of these \nbenefits for any existing beneficiary industry, just updating them to \nrecognize the modern market reality of new energy technologies and to \nreflect the changing investment opportunities in the emerging markets \nof renewable energy. In fact, one of the lead cosponsors of this \nlegislation in the House, Congressman Ted Poe--Judge Poe--a Texas \nRepublican, said at a recent press event we did that over the course of \nhis career, he has represented as many oil refineries as any other \nMember of Congress. Yet he sees this as an efficient and effective \nopportunity to expand from its traditional use of pipelines of oil and \ngas to the broader energy marketplace of the United States, and he is \nconfident expanding this structure to include clean sources of energy \nwould create jobs.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, if she has seen \nthe same thing in Alaska. Does the Senator from Alaska see this as an \nopportunity that will help us grow an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy for the United States?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I say to my friend, the Senator from Delaware, yes. In \nfact, I view this as an opportunity. I view this as a positive \ndirection as we build out an energy policy that works for the entire \ncountry.\n  The Senator's question is specific to my home State of Alaska, an \narea that is known for its enormous potential with our fossil fuels, \nour oil, our natural gas, and the opportunities that have been \navailable to a State such as mine where we have the more traditional \nfossil fuels. But we are also a State that is rich with potential for \nrenewable energy resources whether it is geothermal, whether it is \nmarine\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\nhydrokinetic, whether it is ocean energy potential, harnessing the \ntides, harnessing the waves; whether it is biomass, whether it is wind, \nwhich we have abundant capacity for; whether it is solar, which we \ndon't often get a lot of credit for, but, yes, we, too, have solar.\n  So from my perspective as a Senator from Alaska, I am looking to try \nto find those areas where we can branch out, where we can move the \nenergy discussion to what we are all talking about now, which is an \n``all of the above'' policy. In order to truly have an ``all of the \nabove'' policy and to avoid picking winners and losers, as the Senator \nfrom Delaware has noted, then it is important that when we talk about \nhow we finance these energy projects--and we all know there are \nconsiderable dollars at stake with any energy project--then let's work \nto provide a level of parity, and that is exactly what this bill does.\n  My hat goes off to the Senator from Delaware. His leadership on this \nbipartisan measure is extremely important. I can recall when the \nSenator first came to talk to me about it, and I said: We need to \nreally do wholesome tax reform. I haven't changed my mind on that. But \nwhat I have recognized is that if we are to work to build out our \nenergy sector, if we are to work to advance our ``all of the above'' \npolicy, then we need to be a little more expansive in how we are going \nto look to the financing opportunities.\n  So I agreed to join the Senator from Delaware as a cosponsor of the \nMaster Limited Partnership Parity Act because fundamentally, at its \nbase, it is about fairness and opportunity. That is a pretty good place \nto be sitting.\n  I think too often in this Nation debates about our energy policy kind \nof devolve into this advocacy where we show preferential treatment for \none sector or another sector. As the Senator from Delaware and I have \ndiscussed, I am absolutely an advocate for an ``all of the above'' \napproach. I have spelled that out in a blueprint that I have shared \nwith so many of my colleagues called ``Energy 2020,'' which we released \nearlier this year. But I do think that with the legislation the Senator \nfrom Delaware has spearheaded, we have identified a way to further our \nprogress in that direction.\n  Right now, the oil and gas sector is able to benefit from the master \nlimited partnership structure, and it is a good thing because it has \nhelped to raise billions of dollars in private markets for much needed \npipeline infrastructure. We are going to need that as we work to keep \nup with the natural gas boom we are having in this country--how we \nbuild new infrastructure, how we take care of existing infrastructure. \nSo we need to have these financing mechanisms. That is all great. But \nwhy not expand that out to the renewable sector? Currently, as the \nSenator from Delaware points out, the law does not allow for that. It \nis time to fix that. So what we do with this legislation is extend the \nparity to the renewable sector so that businesses that are pursuing \ninvestments in biomass, energy efficiency, and other areas are able to \nstructure as an MLP.\n  I wish to pause here for a moment because I just came back from a \nbipartisan, bicameral meeting where we were talking about the energy \nagenda for this Congress moving forward. Of course, as a nation looking \nat a $16.8 trillion debt, everything we do we have to figure out how we \nare going to pay for it. When we think about the energy efficiency \ninitiative--and I note our colleague, Senator Shaheen from New \nHampshire, is on the floor with us.\n  Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have spearheaded a great piece of \nlegislation focusing on energy efficiency. We think about how we move \nthat forward because that is going to require dollars. Where do we find \nthose dollars? There are not enough rocks with enough money underneath \nthem to advance this. So if we can expand the opportunities for \nfinancing to include our renewables and to include energy efficiencies, \nthis is how we move it forward.\n  Bottom line, when we are talking about the dollars. This is only \ngoing to happen if the private markets think the math makes sense. The \ninvestments and the structures of the entities that are making them \nvery well might not occur, but, again, that is not our job. We are not \nhere to pick winners and losers. If it is good, if it works, it will \nhappen. But we are helping to provide a financing mechanism that is \nfair and creates opportunities. Our job, which this bill highlights, is \nto provide that level playing field. This is about equality of \nopportunity, not equality of outcome. We can't guarantee that outcome, \nbut what we can do is kind of level the playing field in terms of what \noptions are available.\n  This bill enables the renewable sector to structure a certain way. I \nam certainly glad to be supporting it with the Senator from Delaware. I \nthink we have some momentum. I was talking to some folks up in New York \nwhere I addressed an energy financial forum, and what everybody was \ninterested in was not what is happening on the R side; it was so much \ninterest in the master limited partnership and its ability to expand to \nother areas; how we can take a tool that has worked very well for us in \nthe oil and gas sector and push it out to renewables and efficiency.\n  So I think the momentum is there, and I applaud Senator Coons for his \nleadership in that regard.\n  The Senator from Delaware also mentioned the expanded scope. Again, I \nthink that is an important aspect of this bill. I am excited about \nwhere we are right now, and I look forward to working with the Senator \nfrom Delaware as we build out our renewable energy future here.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. I am \ngrateful for her joining me as an original cosponsor and for her being \na strong and engaged advocate for this approach at the conference in \nNew York and in conversations with colleagues and in the image she has \nlaid out. She has been a real champion for a commonsense, ``all of the \nabove'' visionary path forward that will move us on the committee and \nin the Congress.\n  As the ranking member of Energy and Natural Resources, the support of \nthe Senator from Alaska is central and significant. I am also glad the \nchairman is working with me. Senator Wyden, in a recent public setting, \nreferred to this as ``exactly the right approach.'' I believe, as does \nthe Senator from Alaska, the bill will unleash private capital; that it \nwill help create jobs, modernize our Tax Code, and make it more fair; \nand I think that is why it has earned support from Republicans and \nDemocrats in the House and in the Senate, but also at some senior \nlevels in the administration.\n\n  Former Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said the MLP Parity Act would \nmake ``a world of difference and have a profound effect on private \ncapital and investment.'' Our, hopefully, incoming Energy Secretary, \nErnest Moniz, also pointed toward the MLPs as a great opportunity to \nincrease clean energy financing and put it on a level platform.\n  This legislation has earned backing from business leaders, from \ninvestors, from outside experts, from academics. Two experts in energy \nfinance, Felix Mormann and Dan Reicher, from Stanford's Steyer-Taylor \nCenter for Energy Policy and Finance, shared their thoughts in an \neditorial in the New York Times.\n  They wrote:\n\n       If renewable energy is going to become fully competitive \n     and a significant source of energy in the United States, then \n     further technological innovation must be accompanied by \n     financial innovation so that clean energy sources gain access \n     to the same low-cost capital that traditional energy sources \n     like coal and oil and gas enjoy.\n\n  Our financial innovation has to keep up with our energy innovation. \nIt is just that simple. That is why more than 250 companies and \norganizations have recently signed a letter supporting our Master \nLimited Partnerships Parity Act. They range from Fortune 500 NRG to the \nAmerican Wind Energy Association, the Solar Energy Industries \nAssociation, the American Council on Renewable Energy, and many more.\n  Just one more quote, if I might. David Crane, who is the CEO of NRG \nEnergy, said:\n\n       The MLP Parity Act is a phenomenal idea. It's a fairly \n     arcane part of the tax law, but it's worked well and has been \n     extremely beneficial to private investment in the oil and gas \n     space. The fact that it doesn't currently apply to renewables \n     is just a silly inequity in our current law.\n\n  Well, one of the things the folks we work for expect us to do is to \nfind ways to move forward together, to find ways to nail down and \naddress inequities in\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nthe law, and this is one we can fix with a simple, straightforward \nbill.\n  I am so grateful for the cosponsorship of the Senator from Alaska and \nher leadership, and I agree with her that we are seeing growing \nmomentum behind this free market approach. Does the Senator from Alaska \nwish to add anything else as we advocate for this bill?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership \nas well as for the opportunity to speak to this issue on the floor \ntoday. As we talk about the momentum, I think we recognize that \noftentimes there will be good ideas that are discussed and debated but \noften don't get that full body support that allows a good thought to \nmaterialize into policy. I want to let the Senator from Delaware know \nhow committed I am to advancing this good policy.\n  The Senator mentioned the reference to financial innovation, and I \nthink, perhaps, in view of what we have seen in past years with a \nlittle bit of chaos on Wall Street and in our banks with derivatives, \net cetera, that some people might be concerned about this new financial \ninnovation. We are not recreating the wheel. This has been, as the \nSenator from Delaware points out, a financing mechanism that has been \navailable to a certain sector of the energy industry for a considerable \nperiod of time. And it has benefited them.\n\n  This is not financial innovation in that we are building something \nout of whole cloth and hoping it works. We know it works. What we are \ntrying do with this is contained in the title. This is bringing about \nparity, allowing for an extension of a good financing mechanism that \nwill benefit our energy sector throughout the country.\n  Again, I do not mean to repeat myself, but when we talk about an \n``all of the above'' energy policy, I think we need to appreciate that \nthere are some things we do from a policy perspective that hinder us \nfrom achieving that ``all of the above.'' When we put in regulatory \nhurdles or when we put in place limitations that would limit our \nability to move that ``all of the above,'' then we need to look \ncritically at that, we need to look at how we could address this. So I \nthink the effort, again, to allow for real fairness, equal opportunity, \nis critical to us.\n  I want to wrap up my remarks by saying that I think it is important \nthat what we are doing is allowing for this level playing field within \nthe energy sector. So we are not talking about stripping oil and gas \npipelines of their eligibility for the MLP status and replacing it with \nrenewables. This is not a swapping-out deal. I would not support that \nif that were the case. I would also not support it if it extended a \nfalse sense of parity by making, let's just say, only wind available \nfor MLP status or only solar. But, as the Senator has noted, this bill \nincludes it all.\n  We just had a hearing in the Energy Committee this week on \nhydropower. There is a great bill coming out of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I cannot wait until we get it to the floor. \nHydropower holds enormous potential for our Nation. When we talk about \nkind of the backbone of the American energy system, fossil fuels are \nkind of it right now, but then hydropower is by far the backbone of the \nrenewable energy sector. About 60 percent of our renewable energy comes \nfrom hydropower.\n  So what we are doing is opening this MLP structure to our renewable \nresources. But it goes beyond. It is kind of like the Ginsu knife: \nthere is more. It includes the marine hydrokinetics, the biorefineries, \nalternative fuels, biomass, energy efficient buildings, which I have \nspoken to, storage, solar, wind, and more.\n  Again, there is no guarantee that we are going to see billions of \ndollars of private capital that is going to flood immediately into \nthese sectors. We cannot guarantee the outcomes. But we are trying to \nensure equal opportunity across an enormous scope of energy sources.\n  I again thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue, his \nstick-to-itiveness. I do think that as we move the issues of tax reform \nforward, as we move more energy matters through the bodies of the \nCongress, folks will look at this as a sensible and rational way to \napproach how we build out an energy sector in this country of which we \ncan all be proud. I thank the Senator for his leadership, and I am so \npleased to be part of the effort.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Murkowski.\n  If we are going to lead on energy or in anything, we have to listen \nto each other and we have to work together. I have been so grateful for \nthe way Senator Murkowski and Senator Wyden have worked closely \ntogether and moved the Energy and Natural Resources Committee forward.\n  As the Senator referenced, we had a great hearing earlier this week \non the Shaheen-Portman bill--the energy efficiency bill on which \nSenator Shaheen of New Hampshire has worked so well with Senator \nPortman of Ohio--and also some bipartisan bills on hydropower.\n  It is my real hope that this strong bipartisan bill--opening up \nmaster limited partnerships to energy efficiency, to hydropower, and to \na dozen other clean and renewable sources of energy--this sort of \nsimple, straightforward, commonsense, bipartisan bill that creates \nopportunity, will allow the private sector to then marry up with the \ninnovations of researchers and help with the deployment of new energy \nsources.\n  At the end of the day, we in Congress--the Federal Government--have \nto set a realistic policy pathway forward to sustain innovations in the \nenergy market and then let the financial markets work to their fullest \npotential. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act moves us closer \nto that goal and that day.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for her leadership and for being here with \nme today, and I thank Senator Moran and Senator Stabenow, our original \nSenate cosponsors, and our House counterparts. By leveling the playing \nfield for fair competition, this market-driven solution can provide \nvital support to the kind of comprehensive, ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy we all need to power our country for generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I came to the floor this evening to \naddress what is known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, but before I do \nthat, I wish to applaud Senator Coons for his work on the master \nlimited partnerships legislation. I think it is a great bipartisan \napproach to one of our energy needs. I also applaud Senator Murkowski \nfor her leadership on the Energy Committee and for her willingness to \nwork in a bipartisan way to try to move an energy agenda from which \nthis country can benefit. I thank both Senators very much for their \nefforts, and I look forward to working with both of them on the \nShaheen-Portman energy efficiency legislation, which I know that \ncommittee heard this week. I really appreciate the efforts to move that \nforward as well. So I thank both Senators very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3016-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3016-S3018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I really came down to the floor today \nto continue my opposition to the Internet sales tax legislation that is \nbefore us.\n  The proponents of this legislation claim it is about ``fairness,'' \nbut when you really think about it, this bill is anything but fair. In \nfact, it creates an unfair situation for small businesses in a number \nof ways.\n  First, the legislation is particularly unfair for businesses in my \nState of New Hampshire and in the other four States in this country \nthat do not collect a sales tax.\n  I filed amendments, as I know a number of my colleagues have--my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, has filed a number of \namendments--that I hope can help address this issue. But I think it is \nimportant for everyone here, especially those who are concerned with \ncreating new redtape, to understand how this legislation is going to \naffect small businesses.\n  This proposal is going to put new regulatory burdens on small \ncompanies across the country, not just in New Hampshire. As a result, \nit is going to put those small businesses at a disadvantage, making it \nharder for them to compete with large online retailers.\n  As a former small business owner myself, I understand how time-\nconsuming regulations and compliance requirements can be. Make no \nmistake, the bureaucratic nightmare we are\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\ngoing to be creating for small businesses under this legislation is \nreal. I think it is worth talking for a minute about what that process \nis going to look like for the small online retailers.\n  In a recent piece for the Daily Beast, writer Megan McArdle went \nthrough what the process would be like for a small business. She \npointed to the SBA guidebook for small businesses when they collect \nsales taxes in multiple States. The guidebook tells small businesses:\n\n       Generally, states require businesses to pay the sales taxes \n     they collect quarterly or monthly. You'll have to use a \n     special tax return for sales taxes, and report all sales, \n     [all] taxable sales, [all] exempt sales and amount of tax \n     due. Not paying on time can result in penalties. As always, \n     check with your state or local government about the process \n     in your location.\n\n  McArdle points out that, despite claims from the proponents of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act that tax collection will be easy and \nstreamlined, the bottom line for a small business is that ``you've \nstill got to keep fifty states worth of records and file 40-odd states \nworth of returns.''\n  McArdle went on to say:\n\n       For Amazon--the actual target of these laws--this is \n     trivial. Their staff of crack accountants can probably roll \n     these things out before their Monday morning coffee break. \n     For a small vendor, however, that's a whole lot of paperwork.\n\n  And that is what this legislation is really about--those small \nbusiness owners who are working hard to grow their companies. They do \nnot need an additional paperwork burden to distract them from running \ntheir companies.\n  Let me provide one example. There is a small company in the town of \nEpsom, NH. It is called Michele's Sweet Shoppe. Michele's sells popcorn \nand other gourmet treats both at their brick-and-mortar store in Epsom \nand online. This is a small business that is growing, and it wants to \ncreate jobs. They sell locally in New Hampshire at their brick-and-\nmortar store, but a big part of their future strategy for growth is \ntaking advantage of new markets through the Internet.\n  Under this legislation, however, there is an arbitrary ceiling on \nthis company's growth because as they get closer to $1 million in \nonline revenue--as they have said to me--they are going to have to ask \nthemselves, is it worth going through the bureaucratic nightmare of \ncomplying with 46 different States' sales taxes? Unfortunately, for \nthem and for too many other businesses, the answer is more than likely \nto be no.\n  For Amazon and online retailers, this is not even a question. This is \nexactly the reason why this bill is good for big businesses and bad for \nsmall businesses. It makes it harder for small mom-and-pop stores to \ncompete.\n  Small businesses--certainly in New Hampshire and in most of the \ncountry--are really the economic engine of our economy. Two out of \nthree of the new businesses that are going to be created are going to \nbe created by small business. We should really think twice before we \npass this kind of legislation that will keep them from growing and that \nis really designed to help those big businesses.\n  I support a number of amendments to this bill. I would like to see \nthem at least voted on. I hope some might be adopted because I think \nthey would make the legislation fairer for small businesses. One of \nthose is a bipartisan amendment we have worked on with Senator Toomey \nto raise the threshold for small businesses under the legislation. I \nhave also filed an amendment to address a fundamental flaw in the \nlegislation that I think must be addressed because this legislation is \nanything but fair to States such as New Hampshire, States such as \nAlaska, Montana, the other States in this country that do not collect a \nsales tax.\n  This is a proposal that fundamentally violates State sovereignty. It \nenables one State to impose the enforcement of its laws on the 49 other \nStates and territories without their approval, and it provides zero \nbenefit for the non-sales tax States while it creates an additional and \nunnecessary burden on our small businesses. That is why I filed an \namendment to create an exemption for businesses in States such as New \nHampshire. States will be able to force New Hampshire companies to \ncollect sales taxes--especially when our States get no benefit \nwhatsoever--and this amendment is designed to prevent that.\n  I am disappointed this evening that it does not look as though we are \ngoing to be allowed to vote on any of these amendments, although I am \nstill hopeful that we might get a hearing.\n  I urge my colleagues, again, to think twice about this legislation. I \nurge them to look at the amendments when they are filed--if we are able \nto get an amendment process--and to think about supporting those \namendments so the legislation really could live up to its billing as \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act because right now it certainly does not \nmeet that standard for the State of New Hampshire and our small \nbusinesses.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I appreciate being here in the \nChamber to hear the comments from my friend the Senator from New \nHampshire. As she has noted, there is a small handful of States that \nfor a host of different reasons have chosen not to impose a sales tax \non their residents. As she has very well stated, this so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act is not fair. It is not fair to those States \nthat have put in place other mechanisms. Yet what we are doing through \nthis legislation that we have pending on the floor right now is to tell \nStates such as New Hampshire to tell States such as Alaska regardless \nof what your State chose to do, those who are engaged in online sales \nand activity are going to be scooped into the requirement of whatever \nState in which the individual purchasing your product lives.\n  To me, that is absolutely not fairness within the marketplace. I \nthink the people in Alaska, when they think about their marketplace, \nare looking at where they are and assuming their State's laws are going \nto be what they are dealing with. I thank the Senator for her comments, \nand in laying out very well how this measure impacts these few States.\n  Maybe that is our problem. Maybe we do not have enough of us in terms \nof those States that have opted to not move forward with a sales tax. \nWe are at a point in the evening where we had a vote to move on. We are \ntold we are going to be taking up this measure when the Senate returns \nin about a week. It is my understanding at this point in time there \nwill be no amendments allowed despite the efforts of many of my \ncolleagues to help address, to help bring about some fairness to this \nlegislative measure. We will not be allowed to do that. It is a real \nchallenge today as we discuss this, recognizing that these few States \nmight be impacted disproportionately in a way that I think does not \ndemonstrate any level of fairness.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. My friend from Alaska and I, as she pointed out, \nrepresent States neither of which has a sales tax. Would the Senator \nagree with me that if this passes it sets a dangerous precedent that \nsays at any point this Congress could impose on States such as ours, \ndespite what we have chosen to do in our home States, a tax we may \ntotally disagree with, and that that is a very dangerous precedent for \nus to set?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I would absolutely agree. As the Senator points out, \nit is Alaska, Oregon, Montana, Delaware, and New Hampshire that are in \nthis situation. Basically, if this legislation were to pass, the \nmessage to those within these States is it does not make any difference \nwhat your State laws are with regard to a State sales tax. It does not \nmake any difference, because we have made this directive back here that \nthere is going to be uniform application. I have a tough time with \nthat. I think our States may be somewhat similarly situated in the \nsense that there is a real sense of States rights, State sovereignty. I \nbelieve your motto is ``Live Free or Die.'' We feel pretty independent \nup North as well. I do feel this is a hard push against States' rights \nand their ability to impose local taxes within their State boundaries.\n  I am very concerned about the direction we have taken. I note again, \nfor\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nthe States without sales tax and use taxes like these five States my \ncolleagues and I have been talking about, and that are not members of \nthe Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, this legislation creates \nan inherent unfairness.\n  Again, I do think it is somewhat ironic that the bill's sponsors \nchose to call it the Marketplace Fairness Act. We have noted here on \nthe floor what the requirements under this legislation would mean. \nSenator Shaheen from New Hampshire has indicated exactly what it means \nto a small business. A remote seller in Alaska who makes an online sale \nto someone in Vermont who is a member of the Streamlined Sales and Use \nTax Agreement will have to comply, collect, and file a return in the \nState of Vermont. The seller otherwise has zero connection to Vermont.\n  So it does beg the question, is this fair? I would contend not. Does \nit present a burden on interstate commerce? Absolutely. The drafters of \nthis bill will argue it creates no new taxes, but I would also \nrespectfully disagree. This bill essentially forces States such as ours \nto adopt its requirements to ensure parity. Currently no State can \nimpose its local sales tax on another, short of meeting constitutional \nnexus requirements. So we have made clear that you cannot do that.\n  This legislation again scoops in everybody. States that wish to enter \ninto agreements with other States for this purpose are able to do so. \nLet those individual States decide whether they want to participate in \nthe Streamlined Use and Tax Agreement but do not mandate it. That is \nwhat this measure would do. Only 24 States could agree to do this.\n  You have to ask, is 24 States a mandate for Congress? I do not think \nso. Again, it begs the question, is this fair? Absolutely not. This law \npresents a backdoor mandate to States such as Alaska, such as New \nHampshire, to effectively adopt a sales tax. I think Congress has to \nrespect a State's right to determine how to implement and how to \nenforce its tax laws and not impose how it must do so.\n  The Senator has mentioned the burden on small business owners, and \nthe Senator spoke to an article that detailed some of the concerns. \nThis is an issue that has generated considerable interest in my State. \nI have had over 600 constituents who have written to me in opposition \nto this bill.\n  Here are a couple of the examples of the mail I am getting. I have a \nconstituent in Fairbanks, AK, who says:\n\n       I am a small business woman selling books off of my Web \n     site. I do not want to be a tax collector for other States. I \n     especially do not want my customers running off to other non-\n     tax parts of the world.\n\n  I have got another constituent who owns a business in Anchorage who \nwrites:\n\n       I do not support a measure that would allow individual \n     States to collect sales taxes on any on-line purchases \n     regardless of which State an on-line retailer is located. As \n     a small business owner, this legislation will affect me, \n     because I often have clients that start our transaction out \n     of State, and we do not have the staff to handle collecting \n     taxes for 50 States.\n\n  Then, finally, a constituent from Eagle River writes:\n\n       As a former small business owner, I am very aware of the \n     constant and increasing burden that government subjects our \n     businesses to. Requiring on-line businesses to collect \n     local sales taxes would be a horrendous administrative \n     burden that would undoubtedly cause many businesses to \n     fail. Governments at all levels should be trying to \n     encourage businesses to succeed, rather than trying to \n     squeeze every last dollar of revenue out of the businesses \n     and their customers.\n\n  These are three examples of some of the correspondence I have \nreceived from folks who are worried about the burden it is going to \ninflict on our small business owners. Of course, we hear this from all \nof the other States, certainly heard it just now from the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The communities I mentioned we have been hearing from are all on the \nroad system, as we call it in Alaska, are bigger communities. But in \nmany of our rural communities, for those that are offroad, where \neconomies are very limited, there is no major business, there are no \nbig stores. We have been encouraging folks in our villages to use the \nInternet to bring the world marketplace to your door, and to sell their \nproducts on line, and to sell--whether it is arts and crafts or \nwhatever it may be. So we are encouraging them to do this.\n  Now the concern we are hearing is, I do not want to be the one who is \nthe tax collector for California taxes. I am trying to get myself up \nand going and make a business, make an economy in a very small area.\n  I know there is a carveout or an exemption for the smaller \nbusinesses. I think that is critical. That is important. That is going \nto help the very small mom-and-pop operators. But I think we recognize \nit will have a burden on our small businesses, not only in Alaska but \naround the country.\n  The ability of a small business owner to comply with the reporting \nrequirements that will be required by this bill, which would include \nthe 50 States plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories, I \nthink deters new startups. I think it acts as a hurdle, if you will. I \ndo not think our businesses need that, particularly now. We already \nhave regulatory burdens that our small businesses are concerned and \nworried about. I do not think we need to impose that on these States \nthat have, again, made that determination that they would not apply a \nsales tax within their State boundaries.\n  So for these reasons, as well as so many of the reasons that have \nbeen outlined by others on this floor earlier, I cannot support this \nmeasure. We will see whether we have got the opportunity to have any \namendments in the week following our recess. Again, I feel it was \nimportant to express the concerns of many of the individuals I \nrepresent in the State of Alaska.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3018-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3018-S3020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I wanted to speak for a few minutes here \non the floor as we finish the business of this work period and we \nreturn to our home States for about a week. We will be back here on May \n6. At that time, I will continue this important conversation we are \nhaving on a number of issues. But one of them is this issue of \nimmigration, which was recently back in the news as a result of some \nefforts we have had here.\n  Let's begin by describing the reality the United States faces today. \nFirst and foremost, this is a country that does not need to be \nconvinced of the benefits of legal immigration, because virtually every \nsingle one of us, including those watching here now, the people who \nwork in this building and across this country, are all but a generation \nor two removed from someone who came here from somewhere else. So we do \nnot need to be convinced of the virtues of immigration, because we have \nlived them. We see them every single day. In fact, we read about them \nas well in terms of great innovations that have changed the American \neconomy and made this country different from any in the history of the \nworld.\n  There may be some debate, but not much, about the value, the \nimportance of legal immigration to the United States. The problem we \nface is we have a legal immigration system right now that is broken. It \nhas not worked well in a very long time. Efforts to reform it over the \nlast 20 to 30 years have failed.\n  Let me describe what is wrong with our immigration process. No. 1, it \nis bureaucratic and complicated. It is very difficult to navigate the \nlegal immigration process, the result of long backlogs and a \nbureaucracy that has to be dealt with.\n  You have to lawyer up just to legally come here. That comes with its \nown set of problems.\n  The second problem is the illegal immigration system, quite frankly, \nisn't based on the 21st century. It is actually based on the middle \npart of the last century and a very different economic time in our \nworld and certainly in our country.\n  That is why you are not going to get a lot of debate from people when \nyou\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nsay we need to have a legal immigration system that reflects the modern \nera, that reflects our global economy, that reflects our knowledge-\nbased economy. We need a legal immigration system that is good for \nAmerica's economy. That means a lot of different things.\n  For agriculture, it means the ability to find workers when they need \nthem, and that is usually most of the time--foreign workers who come as \nguests and work on a temporary basis or even on a year-round basis but \na way to access those workers in a legal way. It also means to continue \nthe flow of legal immigrants to the United States through a safe but \nreliable and nonbureaucratic process that is cost-effective and \nencourages people to come here legally. It also means, by the way, that \nin some industries and some sectors from time to time you will need \nguest workers, people who are not going to stay permanently but people \nwho fill in the gaps, particularly in times of very low unemployment \nwhen you cannot find a domestic worker to do that work. You need a \nlegal way to be able to do all these things.\n  Perhaps the most important initiative we need is a legal immigration \nsystem that is based on merit and on skill. Right now the legal \nimmigration system is based on whether you know someone who lives here. \nIf you know someone who lives here as a family member, they can bring \nyou with them. It is this term you hear a lot about: ``chain \nmigration.'' There is nothing inherently wrong with that. The problem \nis today our economy has changed, and our immigration system has to \nchange with it.\n  I think there is a growing consensus around the country that we need \na legal immigration system that is no longer solely based on whether \nyou know a family member who lives here but, rather, having one that is \nbuilt on whether you are going to bring a special skill, talent or fill \na certain void that exists in our economy today.\n  The second problem with our legal immigration system is that our laws \nare not being enforced. I can tell you that in the last 9 or 10 days \nsince we introduced a bipartisan bill that we are working on as a \nstarting point for this debate, if there is one thing that has become \nabundantly clear, it is the complete lack of trust people have in the \nFederal Government and its ability or willingness to enforce our laws.\n  I want you to know that of all the impediments that stand in the way \nof immigration reform, none looms larger than that lack of trust in the \nFederal Government. I would say that lack of trust in the Federal \nGovernment is pervasive across every policy, but it is especially \npronounced on the issue of legal immigration.\n  Too many people simply do not believe the Federal Government is \nenforcing the law or is willing to enforce the law. As a result, it is \ngoing to make efforts for immigration reform very difficult, unless we \nare able not just to convince people but to show people that the \nmeasures we are pursuing in immigration reform are efforts that once \nand for all will begin to deal with this problem effectively.\n  The third problem we have is this reality that we have millions of \nhuman beings living in this country illegally. Some came legally and \noverstayed the visa. They came and they were supposed to be here for 90 \ndays and they stayed. Others crossed the border illegally.\n  The point is, by the way, of the people who overstayed, that is about \n40 percent. In my home State of Florida it is much larger. The point is \nwe have millions of people living in this country right now who are \nillegally here, people who do not have a right to be here legally. No \none has the right to violate the immigration laws of the United States.\n  On the other hand, the decisions that created that problem were made \nin 1985 and in 1986, when I remind people that I was in ninth grade. As \na policymaker, what I now confront is this reality that we have 9, 10, \n11 million human beings living in the United States in violation of our \nimmigration laws. To add to that, most of these people have been here \nmore than a decade. They have children who are U.S. citizens. They may \neven own property. They work, they are here, and they are never going \nto go back. We have to deal with that fundamental reality as well.\n  With all that in mind, this is how I decided to get involved in this \nimmigration reform debate. Let me explain. There is very little \npolitical benefit to this issue, believe me.\n  No. 1, I would rather be on the floor debating issues such as taxes, \ndebt, and the impediment they place on our economy and its growth. I \nhope we can get to those issues. This is also an important issue, and \nit was an issue that was going to come up.\n  I remind Members of my party we are not the majority here. I wish we \nwere, and we will continue to make that happen. But we are not the \nmajority, and this issue is going to come up on the floor of the Senate \nwith or without us.\n  It is a legitimate problem the country faces. Therefore, I decided it \nwas best for us to be engaged and try to come up with something that \nworks. That is why I endeavored to get involved in this issue, and that \nis why I continue to be involved.\n  As a result, I have laid out some pretty clear principles about what \nI think immigration reform should look like. It should modernize our \nsystem. It should create real systems for enforcement so we never have \nthis problem again. It deals with the people who are here illegally in \na way that is compassionate and humane, true to our heritage as a \ncompassionate people but also in a way that ensures it is not fair to \nthe people who did it right and doesn't encourage people to do this \nwrong in the future. Those are my principles.\n  Based on those principles, I entered into negotiations with seven \nother Senators to work on a bill that begins as a starting point of \nthis debate. I have heard criticism about that process. People say, \nwell, it is a secret process; it is behind doors.\n  Let me clue everybody in on something. Every bill around here is \ndrafted at the beginning in someone's office. Most people here, when \nthey draft a bill or an amendment to bring to the floor, they don't do \nit in some auditorium. They are working on it in their office with \ntheir staff. That is just the starting point. That bill has to be \nfiled. We are not voting upon a sheet of paper. We are voting on a bill \nthat people read and analyze.\n  That is what this bill is. It is a starting point. It is eight \nSenators, four Democrats and four Republicans, who spent 2 to 3 months \nworking on a bill that we present to our colleagues and say this is \nwhat we were able to come up with. Now it is your turn to make it \nbetter.\n  We actually have a process to do that, and here is how this process \nworks. I don't mean to be patronizing, but it is important to remind \npeople of that process.\n  Here is how that process works. You file a bill. Committees hold \nhearings on that bill. Then they do what they call markup. Basically, \nwhat it means, for those watching at home, is a bunch of Senators sit \naround and they literally vote on changing the bill. People offer ideas \nabout how to make it better and how to change it. That is an important \nprocess. That has to happen, and it has to happen with this bill. Two \nweeks from today they will begin that process.\n  I have heard my colleagues come to the floor some and express \nconcerns about different provisions in the bill. I don't have time to \nrebut every point but, frankly, they raise some very valid points too. \nSuffice it to say, some of the concerns they have are not valid, and I \nthink we can address that with them. Others are just disagreements, and \nthey need to be worked out through the legislative process.\n\n  Here is my encouragement to my colleagues who don't agree with the \nbill we have crafted. Change it. Let's work on changing it. If you \nbelieve that what we have today is broken, if you believe the status \nquo on immigration is chaos and a disaster, if that is what you \nbelieve, as I do, then let's solve it. The way we solve it is by \nworking together. In essence, don't just be against it. Offer ideas to \nchange it.\n  For example, if you don't think the border security provisions of the \nbill we have drafted are strong enough or enforceable enough, offer \nsome ideas to change them. Right now I stand on the floor of the Senate \nand I ask any of my colleagues who have a bill to guarantee border \nsecurity to please bring it to my office. Please offer it as an \namendment. I continue to extend that offer. I am looking for ideas to \nimprove what we have drafted.\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\n  Quite frankly, I think we can get it to be even better. I think those \nof us who worked on it would agree. If people disagree with the way we \nmodernized the legal immigration system--let's say they think we don't \nbring enough high-tech workers or enough farmworkers--change it. File \nan amendment to change it.\n  Here is what I would say. Unless you actually believe we don't need \nto do anything--and listen, if you believe that is valid, that is \nfine--if you believe that what we have is OK, if you believe we don't \nneed to do anything about immigration, just leave it the way it is, \nthen that is fine. I respect that view. I disagree with it, but I \nrespect it.\n  If what you think that what we have is a disaster--and I think that \nis most of us--then let's work on it together to change it. In essence, \ndon't view the bill we drafted as something that is being shoved down \nyour throat, because it is not. View it as a starting point product \nupon which we can build something that I hope most of us can support.\n  If you are opposed to this bill or elements of it, try to change it. \nTry to improve it. That is why we have something called the amendment \nprocess. By the way, that is just in the Judiciary Committee. Beyond \nthat, it has to come to the floor of the Senate, where I expect there \nto be open debate, where I expect there to be an open amendment \nprocess. If it passes here, then it has to go to the House and we have \nto work with them to get a product we all agree on.\n  Here is my point. If you are going to be against anything no matter \nwhat we file or, no matter what, you just don't want to do immigration \nreform, then that is fine. If you believe, as I do, that our legal \nimmigration system is broken and needs to be modernized, then let's \nwork to change it. If you believe we need to be realistic about the \nfact that we have 11 million human beings in this country who are going \nto be here for the rest of their lives, whether we deal with them or \nnot, and that it is not good for America to have that many people here \nwhom we don't know, have no idea who they are, where they are, and many \nof them are not paying taxes, then let's work together to find a way to \ndeal with it.\n  If you believe our laws are not being enforced and we need to pass \nlaws that force the administration--this one and a future one--to \nenforce our law, let's change it. Let's work on something that comes up \nwith that.\n  I am all ears. I am open-minded about that and so are my colleagues. \nLet's not leave it the way it is. The way it is is chaos. It is bad for \nour country. What we have today is not good for the United States. Our \njob as policymakers is not just to come and criticize, our job is to \ncome and to make a difference. Our job is not just to come to the floor \nand make speeches or go back home and give speeches or do television \ninterviews, our job is not just to poke holes, our job is to plug holes \ntoo. Our job is not just to criticize but to make better. What we have \nnow doesn't work. It is not good for our country. We can't leave it \nthis way.\n  We have a chance now to truly improve it. This is not an effort to \nforce anything down anyone's throat. This bill we have worked on is a \nstarting point. It is not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. It never \nhas been. To pretend it is isn't fair. To pretend that somehow \nsomething is being crafted that is being forced down someone's throat \nwith no options to amend it or make it better, that is not true. You \nknow that.\n  I have talked to almost all of my colleagues here and extended an \nopen hand and said let's work together to make this better. I truly \nthink we have to.\n  Is this the most important issue America faces? No. We owe $17 \ntrillion, and we have no idea how we are going to pay it back. We have \nan economy that is not growing, and we need to do something about it. \nThis is an important issue and, by the way, it is related to that \nissue. There actually is a growing consensus that we have a chance to \ndo something about it once and for all.\n  Let's work together. Let's work together to come up with a solution \nthat modernizes our legal immigration system so it is good for our \neconomy, that once and for all forces the administration, this one and \na future one, to enforce our immigration laws. Once and for all this \nwill deal with the 11 million people who are here illegally in a way \nthat is fair and compassionate but also fair to the people who did it \nright and also in a way to ensure this never, ever happens again.\n  I hope when we come back in a few days we will begin to work on that \ntogether for the good of our country and the future of our great \nNation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this Friday, April 26, is ``World IP \nDay,'' when countries around the world celebrate the role of \nintellectual property in encouraging innovation and creativity. It is \nan opportunity for us to acknowledge the authors, artists, and \nmusicians who enrich our lives; the inventors whose work is \ntransforming our digital economy; and creators around the world.\n  Whether you are an inventor, a creative artist, or a small business \nowner protecting your brand, you deserve the benefit of your work. By \nprotecting those works, we incentivize future developments that benefit \nus all. As lawmakers, our goal must be to provide strong and effective \nprotections for creators, while ensuring that their creations can be \nappreciated, used, and enjoyed. This policy is central to the American \neconomy, where 35 percent of our GDP is generated by IP-related \nindustries. A vibrant intellectual property system fosters growth not \nonly in our country, but also around the world.\n  Earlier this month, I introduced legislation that would strengthen an \ninnovation program created by the Patent and Trademark Office, the \nPatents for Humanity Program. The Patents for Humanity Program rewards \na select number of exceptional innovators who apply their intellectual \nproperty to address global humanitarian needs. At the first Patents for \nHumanity Awards ceremony 2 weeks ago, I was proud to honor inventors \nwho had worked to improve the diagnosis of devastating diseases, supply \naccess to clean water, and\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\ncombat the spread of dangerous counterfeit drugs. Our patent system \nprotects that life-changing work and, in the case of the Patents for \nHumanity Program, helps promote its use for the global good.\n  As we find ways to incentivize and promote widespread innovation, we \nmust uphold the vital protections that allow innovators to grow and \nthrive. We must work to deter and prevent the theft of intellectual \nproperty, which hurts creators, costs jobs, and impedes economic \ngrowth. In our interconnected age, no country, or even group of \ncountries, can address that problem alone. More than ever, we need to \nwork together to recognize the value of intellectual property so that \ninventors and creators around the world may receive the benefit of \ntheir work and continue to create it.\n  We must also come together to streamline processes that will help \ninnovators to fuel growth in the future. Eighteen months ago, Congress \ntook an important step with passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents \nAct, which modernized our patent system for the 21st century and helped \nharmonize our laws with systems around the world. Last December, I was \npleased to expand on those improvements with passage of the Patent Law \nTreaties Implementation Act, which will help American inventors by \nsimplifying and expediting the process for obtaining patent protections \noverseas.\n  There is more Congress can do to improve the patent system and \naddress the problem of patent trolling, by increasing transparency and \naccountability. I intend to work in a bipartisan and bicameral manner \non legislation that will ensure the real party in interest of a patent \nis disclosed, protect unknowing and innocent purchasers of allegedly \ninfringing products from unwarranted suits, and continue to improve \npatent quality, and we will explore other means to make trolling \nactivity unprofitable.\n  Our intellectual property system supports the creative and inventive \ntalents of our citizens and provides the vital fuel of our economy. I \nhope others will join me in celebrating World IP Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3021-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA INVENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, In September of 2011 this body debated \nand passed landmark patent legislation which was subsequently signed by \nthe President and is now law.\n  The America Invents Act--AIA--updated, for the first time in many \nyears, the way patents are issued and prosecuted, and in some instances \nthe means by which businesses defend themselves against lawsuits filed \nby the ever-growing cottage industry of patent assertion entities.\n  The AIA made many important improvements to our patent law. But more \nneeds to be done. Even in just the short time since the bill passed, \nthe problem of so-called ``patent trolls'' has continued to grow \nexponentially. In fact, patent trolls cost operating companies $29 \nbillion in 2011 alone. Many of these suits are the result of poor-\nquality patents being asserted by highly litigious parties against \nordinary businesses, large and small, who are left with only \nunacceptable options: pay a costly licensing fee, settle a court case \nto avoid litigation costs, or expend millions in litigation fees in \nhope of prevailing at the end of the day in court.\n  This has been especially problematic in the universe of technology \nstartups--a booming industry in New York in particular. These small \nbusinesses have everything going for them--good ideas, smart employees, \nand loyal customers. But they risk being entirely undercut by a clever \npatent troll who takes advantage of them in court. In fact, I have \nheard from businesses that actually had to fold as a result of a single \npoor-quality patent lawsuit. This is anathema not only to a pro-growth \nbusiness culture, but also to the very principles of the intellectual \nproperty system.\n  I believe we can address this problem, and I believe there is a clear \nand simple way to do so; in fact, we have a model in Section 18 of the \nAIA. Section 18, the Schumer-Kyl provision, established a post grant \nreview by the experts at the PTO of covered business method patents--\nthe very patents which have been wreaking havoc in the courts and in \nboardrooms across the country. Section 18 allows a petitioner to \nrequest that the PTO review a covered patent and if they find it more \nlikely than not to be invalid, to take a second look at it and return a \ndecision promptly.\n  During debate of Section 18, I took the opportunity to make clear \nthat District Courts should stay proceedings in patent cases if the PTO \nis reviewing the same patents because the PTO decision regarding the \npatent's standing would prove dispositive in court and obviate the need \nfor further court proceedings.\n  I am pleased to note that district judges have been giving deference \nto the legislative history and that in at least 2 cases, have stayed \ntheir proceedings pending a PTO decision. Section 18 is not only \nproviding patent holders and accused infringers with an alternative to \ncourt, but judges are able to better manage their dockets through the \nuse of this new post-grant proceeding.\n  In the approximately 6 months since the process authorized by Section \n18 began, around 20 patents have been challenged through it at the PTO. \nAnd those cases are being considered at the PTO in a more cost-\neffective way than litigation.\n  It is apparent that Section 18 is working the way we intended; the \nonly problem with it is that it is too limited in two respects: first, \nit was only authorized as a temporary program and second the types of \npatents that are allowed to be considered under it are limited. For \nthis reason, I will be introducing a bill when we return from recess to \nimprove Section 18 by removing its temporary status and making more \n``likely invalid'' business-method patents eligible for review. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Leahy and my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee on legislation to improve further the patent \ngranting and patent prosecution system. A great place to start is to \nmake sure the experts at the PTO get a chance to review low-quality \npatents against relevant prior art so that they cannot be used as a \nweapon against legitimate business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3021-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3021-S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAUREEN AND MIKE MANSFIELD \n                               FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Senator Tester and I wish to recognize the \n30th anniversary of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation.\n  Nearly 30 years ago Congress passed legislation authorizing funds for \na foundation honoring Mike Mansfield. Mike was the pride of Montana, \nand represented the State in the U.S. Congress from his election to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1942 to his retirement from the Senate in \n1977. Mike Mansfield once said he reached the height of his political \naspirations when he was elected senator from Montana. Montanans \nremember him fondly as a national leader who put Montana first.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, respect and admiration for Mike Mansfield \nreached beyond his Montana roots to Washington, where he shaped the \ncharacter of the modern Senate as the longest-serving Senate Majority \nLeader. It also reached across the Pacific, where he combined his voice \nof wisdom and sense of moderation with his love of Asian culture and \nbecame the longest-serving U.S. ambassador to Japan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mike Mansfield was enamored with the Far East when he \ntraveled there as a young United States Marine in the 1920s. This early \nexperience shaped his outlook on the Pacific Basin and the world. He \nwent on to teach East Asian history at the University of Montana, and \nwas a leading expert on Asia while in Congress. He then continued his \nlife of public service as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 1977 to 1989. \nHe and his wife Maureen shared a love for Asia and a commitment to \nbuilding relationships that would support strong U.S.-Asia relations.\n  Mr. TESTER. The Mansfield Foundation has been committed to carrying \nout this mission since it was established in 1983. For the past 30 \nyears, the Foundation has offered important opportunities for U.S. and \nAsian leaders in government and business to exchange views and build \nrelationships that strengthen cooperation between our countries. These \nexchanges, policy dialogues, and research and education\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nopportunities are the legacies of Mike Mansfield's passion for broader \ncultural understanding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For example, the Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program, a \ncenterpiece of the Foundation's work, has been building a corps of U.S. \nFederal Government employees with Japan expertise since it was \nestablished by Congress in 1994. This program allows U.S. officials to \ngain practical experience working in the Japanese government. More than \n100 Fellows representing 23 U.S. agencies and the U.S. Congress have \nentered the Fellowship Program since its establishment. The \nFoundation's other programs include:\n  Exchanges that allow U.S. and Asian government officials, researchers \nand policy experts to explore best practices, expand their contacts, \nand gain expertise and experience. The many exchanges organized by the \nFoundation include Washington, D.C. visits for members of Japan's Diet, \nKorea's National Assembly, and the Chinese government.\n  Policy dialogues that facilitate substantive discussions on complex \nU.S.-Asian issues including international trade, national security, the \nrule of law, energy and environmental challenges.\n  Programs that identify and foster new generations of American Asia \nexperts with the goal of strengthening dialogue, research, and \ncooperation between the United States and Asia into the future.\n  Research and education initiatives, including support for the Maureen \nand Mike Mansfield Center at the University of Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mike Mansfield served Montanans in Congress as a fair \nplayer who was focused on building consensus. He recognized the \nimportance of fostering relationships between the United States and our \nfriends across the Pacific. For 30 years, his vision for U.S.-Asia \nrelations has continued through the work of the Mansfield Foundation. \nWe are pleased to recognize the Foundation's 30th anniversary and to \ncommend the Foundation for its continued efforts to build bridges of \nunderstanding with the region that Mike and Maureen Mansfield long \nrecognized as the place ``where our future lies.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3022-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS TO WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I rise to honor \na man who dedicated his life to his family and community, Douglas \n``Doug'' Carpenter. On April 17, 2013, Mr. Carpenter passed away in his \nWatertown, SD, home at the age of 87.\n  Born in the small South Dakota town of Fedora, Mr. Carpenter was \nraised with his nine brothers and sisters. After graduating from Fedora \nHigh School, he enlisted with the U.S. Army and served as a bandsman \nfor 2 years during World War II. Mr. Carpenter's musical aptitude was \nrecognized on numerous occasions. He served over 20 years as first \nchair trombone and trombone soloist with the South Dakota Army National \nGuard.\n  Music became a focus of study for Mr. Carpenter. He graduated from \nDakota Wesleyan University in 1950 and, later, received his masters of \nmusic from the University of South Dakota. After meeting his loving \nwife, Donna, he taught courses including band and singing in Geddes, \nTripp, and eventually Watertown. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter \nraised a beautiful family and shared their love of music with students \nand the community.\n  Mr. Carpenter was the director of the Watertown Municipal Band for \nmore than 45 years, and was recognized for his musical achievements and \noutstanding dedication to his students. In 1975, he was elected Teacher \nof the Year. The same year he retired from teaching, 1987, the American \nBandmasters Association honored him and, in 1992, the South Dakota \nBandmasters Association inducted him into their Hall of Fame. The \nWatertown community acknowledged his expertise by granting him the \nprivilege of serving as the adjudicator for many parades, marching \ncontests, and music competitions.\n  The countless contributions and selfless dedication of Mr. Carpenter \nwill not be forgotten. I extend my deepest condolences to the Carpenter \nfamily; his children Barry Carpenter, Kay Prchal, Lee Ann McCallum, and \nDavid Carpenter; his nine grandchildren, two great grandchildren, two \nsisters, and many nieces and nephews.

Madam President, today I wish to speak with great \npride about a high school in my home State of West Virginia and the \nimportant role it is playing in our American democracy--Meadow Bridge \nHigh School in Fayette County.\n  For the 12th year in a row, 100 percent of the senior class at Meadow \nBridge High School is registered to vote. This is a truly incredible \naccomplishment, and I am unaware of any school in our great State--or \nany school anywhere in the country, for that matter--that has \nregistered every student in their senior class every year for the past \n12 years.\n  Young voters eligible to vote today are 44 million strong--more than \none-fifth of the country's electorate--and they are changing the face \nof American democracy.\n  They are engaged in their communities, they are passionate about \nissues, and they are politically aware. In the most recent elections, \nthey have turned out in record numbers.\n  They may be the future of our country, but their voices--and their \nvotes--count NOW.\n  This is just what West Virginia's own Jennings Randolph expected when \nhe was working relentlessly in the Senate to win passage of the 26th \nAmendment to our Constitution--the Amendment that lowered the voting \nage in America from 21 to 18. It became law in 1971, and our country is \nall the better for it.\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n  Every vote counts. And every voter has not only a right but also a \nresponsibility to take an active role in our electoral process.\n  I tell young people all the time that you cannot just sit on the \nsidelines--you have to get in the game and get active, especially when \nit is the future of America that is at stake. Democracy is not a \nspectator sport.\n  When I served as Secretary of State in West Virginia, from 2000 to \n2004, one of my top priorities was to educate our young people about \nthe electoral process and encourage them to get involved. That was the \npurpose of the Sharing History and Reaching Every Student Program, also \nknown as the SHARES program.\n  I am proud to say that before I left the office of Secretary of \nState, we had registered 42,000 high school students to vote. And, of \ncourse, those efforts have continued for the past dozen years since the \nSHARES program began, but nowhere more successfully than at Meadow \nBridge High School.\n  It would be remarkable enough if 100 percent of any high school \nsenior class was registered to vote. But to accomplish that 12 years in \na row is truly extraordinary--not just a testament to the dedication of \nthe school's staff but also a reflection of the students' commitment to \ntheir community and civic responsibility.\n  In fact, Principal Al Martine reports that the students themselves \nnow take on the challenge of reaching the 100 percent registration \nmark. It's a matter of pride and patriotism.\n  The right to vote is so precious because it is the right by which all \nour other rights are protected.

Madam President, my colleague, Senator Mike Crapo \njoins me today in recognizing the extraordinary life of Robert Earl \nHolding.\n  Idaho has lost a great visionary with his recent passing. As an \nentrepreneur, he saw potential in many businesses, including the Idaho \nresort Sun Valley.\n  Earl Holding came from modest means. It is well-documented how he \nstarted his business empire with the purchase of a motel called Little \nAmerica in Green River, WY. He expanded the chain and added gas and oil \nbusinesses that operate in the western United States.\n  Earl purchased the Sun Valley Resort in 1977 and he had a long-term \nvision for the resort that was business as well as a labor of love.\n  Restoring Sun Valley Resort to its glory days took great attention to \ndetail and substantial investment. He built ski lodges with stunning \nviews, added high-speed quad lifts and state-of-the-art snowmaking \nequipment. Earl worked to create a superb skiing experience that \nbrought Idahoans and out of staters to its slopes to an extent that \nwasn't possible in the past. His focus on excellence resulted in Sun \nValley being regularly ranked as a top snow skiing destination.\n  His transformation of Sun Valley, coupled with his involvement in the \n2002 Winter Olympics and the hosting of the 2009 International Special \nOlympics at the Sun Valley Nordic Center, led to his induction into the \nU.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in 2011.\n  Earl renovated the Sun Valley Lodge more than once and upgraded the \nresort's golf course. He made Sun Valley into a year-round resort that \nallowed area businesses to expand and create new jobs. Local \ngovernments and residents have greatly appreciated his vision and long-\nterm commitment to the resort.\n  Sun Valley is a special place to my wife, Vicki, and me. Our whole \nfamily has spent numerous nights in the Sun Valley Lodge--a tradition \nwe continue to this day. It was always a pleasure to run into Earl and \nhis wife, Carol and sit and talk in such a beautiful place. They were \nvery gracious and it was always an enjoyable time with them.\n  We cannot forget in every step of the way, he had a wonderful partner \nin Carol. They were a great team and for every story of Earl waiting \ntables, there is a story of Carol cleaning rooms. For 64 years, they \nwere partners in every sense of the word. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith Carol and their three children during this time.\n  Earl Holding was a devoted husband and father and an accomplished \nbusinessman. He had integrity in his business dealings and was loyal to \nhis employees. He valued his customers and he was generous in many \nways.\n  Idaho and America has had a great man pass from our midst, but we are \nall better off because of his presence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3023-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3023-S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FREDRICK MAYER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I would like to speak today \nabout a remarkable constituent of mine, Mr. Fredrick Mayer. His story \nis one of truly incredible bravery, and Mr. Mayer is one of the great \nunsung heroes of World War II. His selfless patriotism and unique \nservice to the United States merit our recognition.\n  Born to a Jewish family in Germany, Mr. Mayer was forced to flee the \nrise of nazism in his home country, and as a young man he immigrated to \nthe United States with his family. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, \nMr. Mayer enlisted in the U.S. Army. There, his talents were quickly \nrecognized, and Mr. Mayer was soon recruited into the Office of \nStrategic Services, OSS--a predecessor to the CIA. Once in the OSS, Mr. \nMayer was presented with an unimaginably dangerous mission--to be \nclandestinely sent back into Nazi territory to collect critical \nmilitary intelligence from behind enemy lines.\n  Mr. Mayer accepted his mission with full knowledge that as a Jewish-\nAmerican spy, he would almost surely be killed if he was captured. \nHaving escaped Nazi Germany only years earlier, he also accepted this \nmission with a unique appreciation for the injustices that were being \ndone by Nazi forces and with a deep sense of duty to help his new home \ncountry--the United States--put an end to those injustices.\n  What happened next is perhaps best told in the words of Mr. Mayer's \ncommanding officer in a May 31, 1945, written assessment of Mr. Mayer's \nperformance:\n\n       Technical Sergeant Mayer parachuted into enemy occupied \n     territory and remained there for three months, gathering \n     secret intelligence and rallying Austrian resistance \n     elements. During this period Technical Sergeant Mayer \n     exhibited not only the highest degree of courage under \n     constant risk of his life, but remarkable qualities of \n     leadership and organization which made it possible for him to \n     contact and win the support of anti-Nazi elements of all \n     classes and walks of life, and eventually to arrange the \n     surrender of Innsbruck to American troops.\n\n  Ultimately, Mr. Mayer spent nearly 3 months living behind enemy \nlines, often wearing a German officer's uniform and using forged papers \nto move openly without capture. In that guise, Mr. Mayer covertly \norganized a network of anti-Nazi Austrians and clandestinely collected \nvital intelligence that was then relayed by his radio operator to OSS \nheadquarters in Italy. According to now unclassified documents, Mr. \nMayer collected and relayed information on a wide array of critical \nsubjects--important Nazi war factories, schedules relating to the \nmovement of Nazi troops and material to and from the battlefront, the \nstatus of Nazi defenses at key tunnels, bridges, and highway \nbottlenecks, and the whereabouts of Mussolini, Daladier, and Hitler.\n  In one case, intelligence gathered by Mr. Mayer about the assembly \nand schedules of 26 military trains that were being sent to the Italian \nfront led to the trains' destruction and blocked the Brenner Pass \ncompletely until well after the war ended.\n  After months of successful operations, Mr. Mayer was betrayed by one \nof his contacts. He was then arrested by the Gestapo and brutally \ntortured while in captivity. Nevertheless, throughout the harsh \ninterrogations, Mr. Mayer refused to give up the location of his radio \noperator.\n  As a prisoner, Mr. Mayer was able to use his language skills and \nquick thinking to convince his captors to grant him a meeting with \nsenior Nazi officers, and as American troops approached, he helped \npersuade the Nazi\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\ncommanders to surrender Innsbruck--likely preventing a final battle \nwith U.S. forces that would have resulted in even greater casualties.\n  In the end, Mr. Mayer led what is now regarded as one of the most \nsuccessful OSS covert operations of World War II--Operation GREENUP. \nHis bravery, remarkable in any context, is even more noteworthy given \nhis willingness to selflessly return to enemy territory, not far from \nthe childhood home he was forced to flee. He did this to help win the \nwar, and he did this in service to the United States.\n  Mr. Mayer is now 92 years old and lives in Charles Town, WV. He is a \nvery humble man who does not brag about his wartime accomplishments. \nThankfully, that deep humility does not mean that his amazing story has \nbeen lost, and I am honored to recognize Fred's service here \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3024-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GIFFORD PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, today I wish to \nremember Gifford Phillips, who passed away on April 17 at the age of \n94. Over the course of a long life, Gifford was a truly great champion \nof the arts. He was also a friend to all who had the good fortune to \nknow him. My wife Jill and I count ourselves among that very fortunate \nnumber.\n  Gifford was born on June 30, 1918, in Chevy Chase, MD, into a \nprominent family. He began life with great advantages, but also with a \ngreat loss. His father, James Phillips, died that same year from the \ninfluenza epidemic when Gifford was just 4 months old.\n  The Phillips family has long been a dedicated benefactor of the arts \nin our country. The Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, was begun in \n1921 by Gifford's uncle, Duncan Phillips. Duncan founded the museum in \nmemory of his brother, James, and their father, who had died in 1917. \nMourning these profound losses, Duncan Phillips found solace in art. \n``Sorrow all but overwhelmed me,'' he later recalled. ``Then I turned \nto my love of painting for the will to live.''\n  Gifford no doubt also learned these lessons well: that privilege \nwithout generosity is hollow, that life brings the pain of grief but \nalso the joy of art. He lived his life in a way that reflected that \nunderstanding. In doing so, he was a credit to a renowned family, and \nhe helped enrich the culture of our nation.\n  His life as an art philanthropist began early, when he donated a \npainting by Cezanne to the Phillips Collection in memory of his father. \nGifford and Joann, his wife of 60 years, were not just avid collectors \nof art but tireless advocates for art. Richard Diebenkorn. Mark Rothko. \nClaire Falkenstein--these are just a few of the contemporary artists \nthey championed.\n  Gifford was a successful businessman, but it was his passion for the \narts and his political activism that seemed to most animate his life. \nAs a patron of the arts and as a political activist, he wanted to share \nhis advantages with others. And he had a great deal of fun along the \nway. He was a prominent supporter of George McGovern's Presidential \ncampaign in 1972 and, to his delight, earned a place on President \nNixon's enemies list.\n  Like his Uncle Duncan, the words ``founded by'' often precede his \nname. Gifford founded Frontier magazine, a west coast political \nmonthly, with editor Phil Kirby in 1949. He published it until 1966, \nwhen it merged with the Nation magazine. He was the founding chairman \nof the Contemporary Art Council at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art \nin 1961.\n  In 1989, he and Joann began the Chamiza Foundation in Santa Fe to \nsupport Pueblo culture. The Chamiza Foundation was recognized by the \nNew Mexico Legislature in 2009 for its efforts to sustain the cultural \ncontinuity of New Mexico's Pueblo tribes.\n  Gifford Phillips will be remembered for his generous spirit, for his \npassion for the arts, for his commitment to social justice. Gifford \nfound joy in art, in those lasting creations that inspire us, that move \nus, and that make us more fully human. He wanted others to share that \njoy, and it is his great legacy that people from all walks of life, for \ngenerations to come, will do so.\n  Jill and I were proud to call Gifford Phillips a friend. We extend to \nJoann and the Phillips family our sincere condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3024-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE FREDERICKSBURG BIG BAND\n\n Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am pleased to honor the \nFredericksburg Big Band for their significant contribution to culture \nand charitable organizations in central Virginia.\n  In March of 1966 the Fredericksburg Big Band was formed when a group \nof musicians gathered at the old American Legion Hall in Fredericksburg \nand began a revival of 1930s and 1940s big band music. They initially \nbegan playing simply because they enjoyed the music. Later that year \nthe band was asked to play for the King George Fall Festival and began \nmaking public appearances. Soon after, they had the idea of playing for \ncharities because these civic-minded musicians wanted to make a \ndifference for people in their communities. The mission of the band \nsoon became to provide music at charity events throughout the central \nVirginia area. The band continues that tradition to this day.\n  Since the inception of the band in March of 1966, it has performed at \nmany charity events in the central Virginia area and helped local \norganizations to collectively raise well over $2 million. Of notable \nmention are two long standing events: The Fredericksburg Big Band has \nperformed a September concert sponsored by the Salvation Army Women's \nAuxillary since 1988 and Fredericksburg Parks and Recreation has \nsponsored the Fredericksburg Big Band March concert at the University \nof Mary Washington since 1987 as a means for the band to give back to \nthe community.\n  The Big Band consists of local business and music professionals who \ndonate their time to the group's mission, including past directors \nPhilip Heim, DuVal Hicks, Richard Phillips, Joseph Ulman, and current \ndirector Stephen Sanford, who has been a member of the band since 1975. \nThe current members of the band are: Stephen Sanford, director; Ron \nPronk, Karen Blake, Jeremy Cooper, Terry Rooker, and John Robie on \nsaxophone; Paul Rawlins, Stephen Sanford, Earl Sam, and Jim Breakiron \non trombone; Marc Weigel, Kevin Shipe, James Canty, and Dave Greenfield \non trumpet; Kathryn Hichborn on keyboard; Frankie Blackburn on guitar; \nMichael Rinckey on string bass; Dave Fosdick and Ray Homoroc on drums; \nand Mary Jo Prouty as vocalist. Current substitutes include Luke Grey \non string bass, Gary Carper on trombone and Mike Sanders on trumpet.\n  Despite the many changes in the Fredericksburg Big Band membership \nover the past 47 years, their mission of supporting charitable \norganizations and their dedication to keeping the sound of the big band \nalive remains strong. I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in \ncongratulating the Fredericksburg Big Band on their civic-minded, \nphilanthropic success and dedication to the arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3024-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO W.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate my \nfriend Russ Ramsey as he completes his successful tenure as the \nchairman of the Board of the George Washington University. After 15 \nyears on the board of trustees--six as chairman--uss will step down \nthis June. Over the last few years he has overseen the remarkable \ngrowth and success of GW and worked to focus the institution on \nopportunities in Virginia, throughout the region, and around the globe.\n  He has presided over a renewal in GW's commitment to their Virginia \nScience and Technology Campus. That campus now totals more than 100 \nacres and includes 17 research laboratories in areas such as high-\nperformance computing, renewable energy, and computational biology. \nPerhaps most importantly, it is the home to GW's new School of \nNursing--the first of GW's 10 schools to be located in the \nCommonwealth. Chairman Ramsey has overseen the creation of a Virginia \ncommittee of the board of trustees, the development and acquisition of \nnew buildings on the VSTC, innovative partnerships with institutions \nlike the Textile Museum, and the redevelopment of Barcroft Field in \ncollaboration with Arlington County.\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\n  Beyond GW's efforts in Virginia, Chairman Ramsey has worked to \nelevate GW to the status of a world-class institution leading the \nsearch for GW's 16th president, Dr. Steven Knapp, overseeing a \nremarkable growth in fundraising, and guiding GW to make new \ninvestments in scientific research, technology transfer and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Russ Ramsey is himself a successful entrepreneur, having built \nmultibillion-dollar businesses primarily in the fields of investment \nbanking and money management. He is most widely known as cofounder of \nFriedman, Billings, Ramsey Group. In 2001, he founded Ramsey Asset \nManagement, a long/short equity hedge fund based in McLean, VA, where \nhe is chairman, CEO, and CIO today.\n  He attended the George Washington University School of Business on a \nbaseball scholarship and earned his bachelor of business administration \nin 1981. He is a native Washingtonian and lives with his wife Norma and \ntheir four children in Northern Virginia. Through the W. Russell and \nNorma G. Ramsey Foundation, they are actively committed to \nphilanthropic causes dedicated to at-risk families through education \nand health programs. The Ramseys are founding investors of Venture \nPhilanthropy Partners, which has invested nearly $80 million in \nnonprofits in the greater Washington area over the last 10 years.\n  Please join me in congratulating my friend Russ Ramsey for all of his \ncontributions to the George Washington University, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and the greater Washington region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3025-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING REBEKAH FORMAN\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

A bill to require a pilot program on an online computerized \nassessment to enhance detection of behaviors\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nindicating a risk of suicide and other mental health conditions in \nmembers of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I wish to take time to speak about an \nimportant issue that needs immediate attention, suicide among our \nservicemembers and veterans. Last year, we lost more servicemen and \nwomen to suicide than we lost in combat in Afghanistan.\n  In 2012, approximately 349 members of the U.S. military, including \nActive-Duty, Guard, and Reserve, committed suicide--more than the total \nnumber of servicemembers who died in combat operations. This number \ndoes not even include the more than 6,000 veterans we lost last year to \nsuicide. This is unacceptable. This has to end.\n  Today, I am introducing my first bill as a Senator, the Jacob Sexton \nMilitary Suicide Prevention Act of 2013. We are doing this to address \nthis pervasive issue. This bill seeks to better identify servicemembers \nstruggling with mental health issues and to ensure they receive the \nassistance they need before resorting to this tragic act.\n  I named this bill after a member of the Indiana National Guard, Jacob \nSexton, a native of farmland Indiana, who tragically took his life in \n2009 while home on a 15-day leave from Afghanistan. His death came as a \nshock to his family and his friends as well as his fellow Guard \nmembers.\n  This is a picture of Jacob while on duty. He is an American hero. He \ndid everything he could to serve his country and to help people from \nanother country, to help people around the world live a better life.\n  A couple months ago, I heard from Jacob's dad Jeff, and I have since \nlearned about his childhood in Indiana, Jacob's service to our Nation, \nand the big heart he always showed through his dedication to bringing \nwinter coats to all the kids he met in Afghanistan during his \ndeployment.\n  Jeff, along with his wife and Jacob's mom Barbara, has since become \nan advocate for suicide prevention. They want to make sure what \nhappened to Jacob doesn't happen to anyone else. They helped inspire \nthis bill, and I thank them for their dedication to preventing these \ntragedies for other parents and loved ones of men and women in uniform.\n  This is a collage made in honor of Jacob by his mom Barbara, and it \nis a reflection of who he was, the things he did, the people he served, \nand the wonderful spirit of ``can do'' and ``how can I help my \ncountry'' that permeated who he was. My hope is we can help men and \nwomen similar to Jacob who are struggling with mental health issues to \nget the help they need before they resort to taking their own life.\n  The facts on military suicides are stark. According to the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and the Centers for Disease Control, at least \n30,000 veterans and military members have committed suicide since the \nDepartment of Defense began closely tracking these numbers in 2009. It \nis important to note suicide is not necessarily linked to deployments \nabroad. Since the Defense Department Suicide Prevention Office began \nkeeping detailed records in 2008, less than half of suicide victims had \ndeployed and few were involved in combat.\n  Most of DOD's existing suicide prevention programs work within the \ncontext of deployments. As we draw down in Afghanistan and away from \nthe strain of multiple deployments, it is time to find a more \nintegrated solution that does not rely on the deployment cycle to the \nservicemember's mental health. Instead, research has shown that other \nrisk factors, such as relationship issues, legal or financial issues or \nsubstance abuse play a larger role in suicides than a servicemember's \ndeployment history.\n  We have heard this firsthand from crisis intervention officers right \nin my home State of Indiana. Further, many of these suicide victims did \nnot communicate their intent to take their own life nor did they have \nknown behavioral health issues. Given the facts before us, what does \nthe current mental health system look like? The current mental health \nsystems for both Active and Retired military rely on a servicemember's \nor a veteran's willingness to self-report suicidal thoughts and to seek \nout assistance. The backup to this system is if family members, peers \nor coworkers identify changes in behavior and then recommend their \nloved one or friend seek assistance.\n  How do we improve this system? The Jacob Sexton Military Suicide \nPrevention Act of 2013 would establish a pilot program in each of the \nmilitary services and also the Reserve components to integrate annual \nmental health assessments into a servicemember's periodic health \nassessment--or PHA. That is an annual review designed to track whether \na servicemember is fit to serve. The pilot program would expand that \nreview to include a more detailed mental health review and to identify \nthose risk factors for mental illness so servicemembers can receive \npreventive care and help.\n  By building on the system that monitors the member from induction to \ntransition into veteran status, an expanded review, including a mental \nhealth assessment, would create a holistic picture of a servicemember's \nreadiness to serve. The servicemember can carry this record with them \nas they leave the service, and it could help inform any future claims \nfor veterans' benefits.\n  The Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act would also integrate \na first-line supervisor's input. The first-line supervisor plays an \nimportant role in a servicemember's life and may be aware of \nrelationships or financial problems but not be able to address them \nunless the servicemember speaks up. Sometimes these problems affect \nperformance. The supervisor's input would help identify potential \ntriggers for stress and suicidal tendencies or problems in work \nperformance.\n  The results of the whole questionnaire would be reviewed by mental \nhealth specialists. If problems or risk factors are identified, \nservicemembers would be referred to behavioral health specialists for \nfurther evaluation and medical care.\n  I included in this legislation--and this is critical--privacy \nprotections to ensure information collected through the survey is used \nonly for medical purposes. It cannot be used for promotion, retention \nor disciplinary purposes. I strongly believe a servicemember should not \nbear any consequence for reporting on their mental health or trying to \nseek out mental health assistance.\n  Finally, as I think we should expect of all government programs and \nproposals, my bill would require an assessment as to whether it is \nactually working. To determine the effectiveness of the program and the \nways to move forward, this bill would require a report from the \nDepartment of Defense to Congress on the impact of the program in \nidentifying behavioral health concerns and interventions in suicides.\n  We have lost far too many men and women such as Jacob. Let us come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to honor the memories of Jacob and all \nthose Americans we have lost by working to improve our ability to spot \nwarning signs before it is too late. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation on behalf of those who sacrifice so much for our \nNation every day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 820. A bill to provide for a uniform national standard for the \nhousing and treatment of egg-laying hens, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Egg \nProducts Inspection Act Amendments of 2013 with Agriculture Committee \nChairwoman Debbie Stabenow and Senator Collins as original cosponsors.\n  This legislation establishes a single, national standard for the \nhumane treatment of egg-laying hens.\n  The bill text represents a historic compromise between the United Egg \nProducers, who represent about 90 percent of the eggs produced in the \nUnited States, and the Humane Society, the Nation's largest animal-\nwelfare organization.\n  The bill is supported by 14 agriculture and egg producer groups, the \nfour major veterinary groups involved in avian medicine, five consumer \norganizations, and hundreds more groups nationwide.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, voters started taking an interest in insuring \nthat\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\ntheir eggs were being produced humanely. This resulted in State level \nlegislation and a number of initiatives, including Proposition 2 in \nCalifornia, to reform the agriculture industry.\n  Many of these efforts were successful. State laws governing egg \nproduction were enacted in 6 states, and a patchwork of differing \nstate-based regulation has emerged.\n  Compounding the problem is the lack of a standard for egg labeling. \nThis makes it difficult for consumers to know exactly what they are \npurchasing and understand what the labels mean.\n  This situation has two principal effects.\n  First, the uncertainty stifles economic growth in this important \nindustry. Egg producers now face difficult choices when it comes to \ninvesting in their businesses. Why expand facilities and invest in new \ntechnologies when rules may change and invalidate your investment? Why \nexpand into new markets when those new markets may be closed to you in \njust a few short years?\n  Second, consumers are limited in their ability to make choices. At \nthe supermarket, consumers are bombarded with different labels, \n``humanely-raised,'' ``cage-free,'' and ``all-natural.'' But the \ndefinitions of these labels vary, and even when they are consistent the \nterms are vague. One person's ``all-natural'' may not be another \nperson's ``all-natural.'' One company's ``cage-free'' may not be \nanother company's ``cage-free.''\n  This legislation addresses both problems.\n  It increases the size of hen cages over the next 18 years and adds \nenrichments like perches and nests so chickens can engage in natural \n``chicken'' behaviors, like scratching and nesting.\n  It outlaws the practice of depriving hens of food and water, a once-\ncommon practice to increase egg production.\n  It sets minimum air quality standards for hen houses, protecting \nworkers and birds.\n  It establishes clear requirements for egg labeling so consumers know \nwhether the eggs they buy come from hens that are caged, cage-free, \nfree-range, or housed in enriched cages.\n  Farmers with 3,000 birds or fewer are exempted from the provisions of \nthis legislation.\n  Also, organic, cage-free and free-range egg producers will be \nunaffected by the housing provisions of the bill. However, they may see \nincreased sales, as consumers are able to more clearly tell what is \navailable on store shelves as a result of the labeling provisions.\n  The legislation offers significant phase-in time to allow producers \nto make the necessary changes in the regular course of replacing their \nequipment. It is my understanding that hen cages generally last 10 to \n15 years. So the 18-year phase-in included in the bill should offer \nsufficient time to implement changes to enriched cages.\n  This legislation is important in part because it represents a \ncompromise between old adversaries.\n  In this agreement, egg producers and the Humane Society have joined \nforces to meet consumer demand, address concerns of the animal welfare \ncommunity and resolve a decade-old struggle. The result is a bill \nwidely supported by the industry, animal welfare advocates and \nconsumers.\n  It is an example of commonsense cooperation in what has historically \nbeen a contentious space.\n  This bill also reflects changes already being made because of \nconsumer demand. McDonalds, Burger King, Costco, Safeway and other \ncompanies are already phasing in new humane handling requirements for \nthe production of the food that they sell.\n  Further, a survey by an independent research company, the Bantam \nGroup, found that consumers support the industry transitioning to \nlarger cages with enrichments by a ratio of 12 to 1.\n  Importantly, the Congressional Budget Office scores this legislation \nas having no cost, and a study by Agralytica, a consulting firm, found \nthat this legislation would not have a substantial price effect on \nconsumers. That means we can achieve these goals at little to no cost \nto taxpayers and consumers.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by leading scientists in the egg \nindustry, the American Veterinary Medical Association and the two \nleading avian veterinary groups. Studies show these new cages can \nresult in lower mortality and higher productivity for hens, making them \nmore efficient for egg producers.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the legislation was the subject of a \nJune 2012 Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. The hearing was \nattended by egg farmers from around the country--Georgia, Michigan, \nCalifornia, Mississippi, Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio--all united in \ntheir support for uniform regulations.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture himself suggested that the legislation \nis a good example of ``thinking differently,'' and possibly even a way \nto get more Americans to support the farm bill and other rural issues. \nAs he pointed out, egg producers deserve to know the rules of the road\n  The agreement in this bill is just the sort of reasonable thinking \nand compromise that we need more of in Washington.\n  I urge you to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 822. A bill to protect crime victims' rights, to eliminate the \nsubstantial backlog of DNA samples collected from crime scenes and \nconvicted offenders, to improve and expand the DNA testing capacity of \nFederal, State, and local crime laboratories, to increase research and \ndevelopment of new DNA testing technologies, to develop new training \nprograms regarding the collection and use of DNA evidence, to provide \npost conviction testing of DNA evidence to exonerate the innocent, to \nimprove the performance of counsel in State capital cases, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Justice \nfor All Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Justice for All Act, \noriginally enacted in 2004, was an unprecedented bipartisan piece of \ncriminal justice legislation. It was the most significant step Congress \nhad taken in many years to improve the quality of justice in this \ncountry. I am pleased to be joined this year by Senator Cornyn as an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation. I know that Senator Cornyn \nshares my commitment to ensuring public confidence in the integrity of \nthe American justice system.\n  It is fitting that we introduce this bill now, during Crime Victims' \nRights week, as we honor the victims of crime across the country, and \nreaffirm our commitment to seeking justice on their behalf. That \ncommitment feels particularly important now, in light of this year's \nhorrific events in Boston and Newtown. Nothing can eliminate the pain \ninflicted by those tragedies, but we can work together to ensure that \nthe needs of those families are met so that they can find healing and \nbegin to rebuild their lives.\n  This legislation takes important steps to strengthen rights for \nvictims of crime. For example, it establishes an affirmative right to \nbe informed of their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act and \nother key laws, and it takes several steps to make it easier for crime \nvictims to assert those rights in court.\n  In addition to being Crime Victims' Rights Week, today is National \nDNA Day and it is appropriate to acknowledge the power DNA testing has \nhad in improving our criminal justice system. One example of that \nimpact has been in the testing of rape kits. This legislation \nreauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction Act, which has \nprovided significant funding to reduce the backlog of untested rape \nkits so that victims need not live in fear while kits languish in \nstorage. That program is named after Debbie Smith who waited years \nafter being attacked before her rape kit was tested and the perpetrator \nwas caught. She and her husband Rob have worked tirelessly to ensure \nthat others will not experience the ordeal she went through. I thank \nDebbie and Rob for their continuing help on this extremely important \ncause.\n  The legislation also includes significant measures to improve the \nadministration of justice in our courts, including the use of post-\nconviction DNA testing. The bill is built on the work I began in 2000, \nwhen I introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which sought to ensure \nthat defendants in the most serious cases receive competent \nrepresentation and, where appropriate, access to post-conviction DNA \ntesting\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nnecessary to prove their innocence in those cases where the system got \nit grievously wrong.\n  The Innocence Protection Act became a key component of the Justice \nfor All Act. The act also included vital provisions to ensure that \ncrime victims would have the rights and protections they need and \ndeserve and that States and communities would take major steps to \nreduce the backlog of untested rape kits and ensure prompt justice for \nvictims of sexual assault. These and other important criminal justice \nprovisions made the Justice for All Act a groundbreaking achievement in \ncriminal justice reform.\n  The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an enormous \nimpact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them. Unfortunately, it \nis clear that simply reauthorizing the existing law is not enough. \nSignificant problems remain, and we must work together to address them.\n  In the years since the Justice for All Act passed, we have seen too \nmany cases of people found to be innocent after spending years in jail. \nA California man, Brian Banks, was exonerated after spending five years \nin prison for a rape he did not commit. He recently signed with the \nAtlanta Falcons and will realize his dream of playing professional \nfootball. Brian's story had a happy ending, but too many wrongly \nconvicted people are not as lucky. It is an outrage when an innocent \nperson is punished, and this injustice is compounded when the true \nperpetrator remains on the streets, able to commit more crimes. We are \nall less safe when the system gets it wrong.\n  To that end, this legislation strengthens the Kirk Bloodsworth Post \nConviction DNA Testing Grant Program, one of the key programs created \nin the Innocence Protection Act. Kirk Bloodsworth was a young man just \nout of the Marines when he was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to \ndeath for a heinous crime that he did not commit. He was the first \nperson in the United States to be exonerated from a death row crime \nthrough the use of DNA evidence.\n  This program provides grants to States for testing in cases like \nKirk's where someone has been convicted, but where significant DNA \nevidence was not tested. The last administration resisted implementing \nthe program for several years, but we worked hard to see the program \nput into place. Now, money has gone out to a number of States, and is \nhaving an impact. The legislation we introduce today clarifies the \nconditions set for this program so that participating States are \nrequired to preserve key evidence, which is crucial, but are given \nfurther guidance about how to do so in a way that is attainable and \nwill allow more states to participate.\n  This legislation takes important steps to ensure that all criminal \ndefendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, receive \neffective representation. It requires the Department of Justice to \nassist States in developing an effective and efficient system of \nindigent defense. I know as a former prosecutor, that the system only \nworks as it should when each side is well represented by competent and \nwell-trained counsel. Fifty years after the Supreme Court's landmark \ndecision in Gideon v. Wainwright, it is past time to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants have effective representation before government \nauthority takes away their liberty.\n  The bill also asks States to produce comprehensive plans for their \ncriminal justice systems, which will help to ensure that criminal \njustice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of \nthe system work together and receive the resources they need.\n  The bill reauthorizes and improves key grant programs in a variety of \nareas throughout the criminal justice system. Importantly, it increases \nauthorized funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement \nGrant program, which is a vital program to assist forensic laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting perpetrators.\n  In these times of tight budgets, it is important to note that this \nbill would make all of these improvements while responsibly reducing \nthe total authorized funding under the Justice For All Act and that \nmany of these changes will help States, communities, and the Federal \nGovernment save money in the long term.\n  I thank the many law enforcement and criminal justice organizations \nthat have helped to pinpoint the needed improvements that this law \nattempts to solve and I appreciate their ongoing support in seeing it \npassed.\n  Today, we rededicate ourselves to building a criminal justice system \nin which the innocent remain free, the guilty are punished, and all \nsides have the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to advance the \ncause of justice. Americans need and deserve a criminal justice system \nwhich keeps us safe, ensures fairness and accuracy, and fulfills the \npromise of our constitution. This bill will take important steps to \nbring us closer to that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nprovision of services for homeless veterans, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I rise to introduce the Homeless Veterans Prevention \nAct of 2013. I would like to thank Ranking Member Burr for joining me \nto introduce this bill. At a time when too many veterans are sleeping \nin the streets, in cars, and on couches, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has taken on an aggressive initiative to end homelessness among \nveterans by 2015.\n  This high level commitment has led to a 17 percent decrease in the \nhomeless veteran population between 2009 and 2012. These declining \nnumbers are a reflection of the combined efforts of VA and its Federal, \nState, Local, Tribal, and community partners as they work to eliminate \nveteran homelessness by 2015. However on one night in January 2012, an \nestimated 62,000 veterans were still without a place to call home. We \nmust continue to work toward removing any remaining barriers to housing \nfor veterans.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would reaffirm this \ncommitment by improving upon VA's programs to prevent and end \nhomelessness among veterans. VA's transitional housing programs for \nhomeless veterans must modernize to ensure that they are meeting the \nneeds of the homeless veterans they are serving. With increasing \nnumbers of women joining the military and eventually becoming veterans, \nVA is facing a growing homeless women veteran population. Many of these \nwomen are single mothers or have experienced military sexual trauma, \nmaking their housing needs even more complex.\n  The Government Accountability Office and VA's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral both found that homeless women veterans were not able to safely \naccess services through VA's transitional housing programs. The \nHomeless Veterans Prevention Act of 2013 would remove these barriers by \nrequiring grantees to ensure that facilities can safely serve the needs \nof the populations that will be living there. It also would allow VA to \nreimburse grantees for housing the children of homeless veterans, \nkeeping families together and encouraging parents to come forth and be \nhoused without having to worry about splitting their families up.\n  As VA focuses on resolving homelessness, instead of just managing it, \nhousing stability is increasingly a focus. This bill also modifies the \ntransitional housing program to allow VA to incentivize grantees to \navoid the challenges that veterans completing time-limited transitional \nhousing programs can face as they search for permanent housing. More \nspecifically, this bill allows VA to focus on housing stability by \nallowing certain transitional housing grantees to turn a portion of \ntheir transitional housing units into permanent housing units as \nveterans are stabilized and linked to support services.\n  Access to stable and safe housing is a priority, but it is also \ncritical to find ways to prevent homelessness among veterans who are \nat-risk of becoming homeless. This bill would also increase access to \nlegal services and dental care for our veterans, two things that \nhomeless veterans themselves have identified as unmet needs. Access to \nthese services would greatly increase their chances of finding gainful \nemployment, avoid foreclosure or eviction, obtain identification, and \ndeal with legal issues that have resulted from the criminalization of \nhomelessness, among other things.\n  Veterans have a number of services and resources available to meet \ntheir needs. At its very simplest, homelessness among veterans is \npreventable when all of these programs work together to lift a veteran \nup. Conversely, homelessness occurs when a veteran slips through the \ncracks. We cannot sit by idly and allow another veteran to slip through \nthe cracks. We must reach out and let them know when, where and how to \nget the help that they need and that they have earned.\n  This is not a full summary of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide.\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstrengthen the earned income tax credit and make permanent certain tax \nprovisions under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Brown and I are introducing \nimportant legislation to extend tax relief to working families: The \nWorking Families Tax Relief Act of 2013.\n  This legislation will ensure that taxes do not increase on working \nfamilies in the coming years, and will expand an effective incentive to \nwork.\n  The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2013 is pro-family, pro-work \nlegislation that would permanently extend critical refundable tax \ncredit provisions that have helped lift millions of working families \nout of poverty.\n  These provisions were only extended for 5 years in the American \nTaxpayer Relief Act, the same bill that permanently lowered the estate \ntax for the wealthiest Americans.\n  The Child Tax Credit, CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, \nare refundable tax credits that encourage work, help families make ends \nmeet, and lead to healthier and better educated children.\n  Both the Senate-passed budget and the President's FY 2014 budget \nrequest call for making these provisions permanent.\n  Consistent with the original goals for the EITC, the Working Families \nTax Relief Act would help the only group that our Tax Code pushes into \npoverty: childless workers.\n  The EITC was designed to help childless workers offset their payroll \ntax liability. In reality, employees bear the burden of both the \nemployee and employer portion of the payroll tax.\n  As a result, a typical single childless adult will begin to owe \nFederal income taxes in addition to payroll taxes when his or her \nincome is still significantly below the poverty line. These changes \nwill result in a full-time worker receiving the minimum wage to be \neligible for the maximum earned income credit amount.\n  This may sound complicated, but these CTC and EITC provisions have \nreal-world impacts.\n  An analysis of Census data showed that these CTC provisions lifted \n900,000 people above the poverty line in 2011, using a poverty measure \nthat counts not only cash income but also taxes and government \nbenefits.\n  According to recent estimates, letting the expanded CTC expire will \nincrease taxes on 12 million families who will see the size of their \nCTC credit shrink, and 5 million families will no longer be eligible \nfor the credit at all.\n  The EITC has long been one of the most effective anti-poverty \nmeasures in our toolkit. In 2011, according to the Internal Revenue \nService, the EITC lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, 3.3 \nmillion of whom were children.\n  In Illinois last year, 1 million taxpayers claimed the EITC and \nreceived an average credit of about $2,300. That money isn't a hand-\nout, it is food on the table, school clothes for children and maybe a \nlittle bit leftover to buy Christmas presents.\n  When Ronald Reagan signed the 1986 Tax Reform package, he had this to \nsay about its provisions that expanded the EITC:\n\n       The Earned Income Tax Credit is the best anti-poverty, the \n     best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of \n     Congress.\n\n  I could not have said it better myself.\n  I thank Senator Brown for his leadership on this, as a new member of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I look forward to working with him and many of my colleagues to \nensure that these provisions are included in tax reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Brown, Mr. Tester, Mr. \n        Casey, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n        Franken, and Mr. Johnson of South Dakota):\n  S. 837. A bill to expand and improve opportunities for beginning \nfarmers and ranchers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years we have witnessed with \ngreat regret the aging of America's farmers and ranchers and the \ndecline in the number of agricultural operations in our country. Simply \nput, our nation will be stronger and better if more beginning farmers \nand ranchers are able to succeed those who inevitably retire and leave \nthe business. We need new generations of farmers and ranchers to \nproduce critical supplies of food, fuel, and fiber, to care for and \nconserve our soil, water, and other natural resources, and to \ncontribute as members of healthy and vibrant rural communities. Many \npeople across America yearn for an opportunity to get a start and build \na successful agricultural operation, yet they face daunting challenges \nand obstacles.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help families and \nindividuals across our nation apply their talents, motivation, and \ndedication to start and continue farm and ranch operations and \nrevitalize rural America. Beginning farmers and ranchers will benefit \nfrom practical assistance in this bill, including effective training \nand mentoring, better access to and careful use of credit, enhanced \nsupport for conservation, and help in starting and succeeding in \nprofitable enterprises such as value-added businesses.\n  We have previously adopted a number of successful initiatives to \nassist beginning farmers and ranchers, including in the 2002 and 2008 \nfarm bills enacted\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nwhen I was proud to serve as chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry Committee. This bill will extend, build upon, and \nstrengthen existing programs and initiatives and ensure their continued \neffectiveness and success.\n  A key feature of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of \n2013 is to extend and strengthen the beginning farmer and rancher \ndevelopment program, which we enacted in 2008. In this program, USDA \nprovides competitively-awarded grants to qualified organizations that \ndeliver training and education for beginning farmers and ranchers. This \nnew legislation makes it a new priority for USDA to issue grants to \nsupport agricultural rehabilitation and vocational training for \nmilitary veterans and to deliver training and education to help \nveterans who are beginning farmers and ranchers. The bill also would \nextend and increase mandatory funding for this development program to \n$20 million in each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018.\n  This legislation also strengthens in several ways the assistance USDA \nprovides to enable beginning farmers and ranchers to assemble the \nfinancial resources they need to start and build a successful \noperation. It codifies in statute a microloan program in which young \nbeginning farmers and ranchers who qualify could borrow up to $35,000 \nfor operating expenses at reduced interest rates and with simplified \npaperwork. Also included in this bill is mandatory funding at $5 \nmillion a year to carry out the individual development accounts pilot \nprogram that was enacted in the 2008 farm bill. Grants under this pilot \nprogram would support State-level individual development account \ninitiatives to help beginning farmers and ranchers build savings that \ncan then be invested in their agricultural operations. Several other \nprovisions of the bill update and improve the existing USDA programs to \nhelp beginning farmers and ranchers obtain loans for operating \nexpenses, land purchases, and conservation practices.\n  To encourage and assist beginning farmers and ranchers in maintaining \nand adopting sound conservation practices, the bill extends and \nstrengthens several initiatives enacted in previous farm bills. Of \nspecial importance, the bill expands the options and financial \nincentives for maintaining conservation on land that comes out of \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, contracts if it is leased or sold to \nbeginning farmers or ranchers. Beginning farmers and ranchers would \nalso receive more help through the Farm and Ranch Land Protection \nProgram, enhanced whole-farm conservation planning and technical \nassistance, and increased advanced conservation cost-share payments.\n  Other features of the bill will help beginning and socially \ndisadvantaged farmers and ranchers better understand and utilize \ninsurance programs and risk management systems. In order to help \nbeginning farmers and ranchers build markets and increase income \nthrough adding value to their commodities, the bill enhances \nopportunities for beginning farmers and ranchers to receive USDA value-\nadded producer grants and provides new, increased mandatory funding for \nsuch grants. It also creates a special USDA veterans agricultural \nliaison position to focus upon helping veterans understand and benefit \nfrom USDA programs, especially those for beginning farmers and \nranchers.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of the initiatives we have previously \nenacted to help beginning farmers and ranchers create and pursue \nopportunities and realize their goals and dreams. By building on the \nsuccess of the existing programs, this legislation will lend more help \nto beginning farmers and ranchers and in doing so strengthen American \nagriculture, our rural communities, and our nation as a whole. I am \ngrateful to the cosponsors of this bill and urge all of my colleagues \nto support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 846. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \npermit leave to care for a same-sex spouse, domestic partner, parent-\nin-law, adult child, sibling, grandchild, or grandparent who has a \nserious health condition; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family and \nMedical Leave Inclusion Act. This bill, which I have also introduced in \nthe previous two Congresses, would extend the important protections of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act to grandparents, grandchildren, \nsiblings, adult children, and same-sex spouses and domestic partners \nthroughout America.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill with a coalition of Senators who \nare committed to ensuring justice and equality for all Americans. I \nwould like to thank Senators Leahy, Whitehouse, Sanders, Murray, Coons, \nGillibrand, Lautenberg, and Blumenthal for standing with me in support \nof the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act.\n  In 1993, Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to, among \nother things, protect American workers facing either a personal health \ncrisis, or that of a close family member.\n  People in the workforce who suffer a serious illness or significant \ninjury should be able to take time to heal, recover, and follow their \ndoctors' orders, without the added stress of worrying about their job \nstatus. They should be able to return to their workplaces strong, \nhealthy, and ready to be productive again. Thanks to the FMLA, they can \ntake the needed time knowing that their jobs will be there when they \nrecover.\n  Most employees, however, are not solely concerned about their own \nhealth and wellbeing. They are also concerned about the health and \nwellbeing of those they love. The FMLA gave workers with a child, \nparent, or spouse that was sick or injured, an opportunity to provide \nthe needed care and support, knowing that their jobs would still be \nthere when they returned.\n  When it was passed, the FMLA was an important and historic expansion \nof our nation's laws. Unfortunately, as families have evolved and \nexpanded, we've learned that the FMLA does not adequately nor equally \nprotect all American families. Under current law, it is impossible for \nmany employees to be with their loved ones during times of medical \nneed.\n  As I stated when I first introduced this bill, Congress followed the \nlead of many large and small businesses when it enacted the FMLA. \nTwenty years ago, many of these businesses had already recognized and \naddressed the need for employees to take time off to care for \nthemselves or a loved one that was battling a serious health condition. \nThese companies had put in place systems that gave their employees time \nto heal themselves or their family members, and ensured that those \nemployees would return to work as soon as they could.\n  The FMLA took the model these companies provided and brought the \nmajority of the American workforce under the same protections.\n  We once again have an opportunity to learn from the best practices of \nAmerican businesses who have adjusted their personnel policies and \nbenefit packages to better meet the needs of American families, as we \nfind them today. These businesses have assessed the composition of \ntheir workforces and realized that, in order to meet the evolving needs \nof their employees and enhance productivity, they needed to go one step \nfurther than the protections provided by the FMLA.\n  It's time that we do the same here in Congress, and recognize in law \nthat a healthy workforce, regardless of sexual orientation, is a \ncritical component of a healthy, modern, and efficient national \neconomy. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading civil rights organization \nthat strongly supports the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act, \nreports that at least 580 major American corporations, 17 States, and \nthe District of Columbia now extend FMLA benefits to include leave on \nbehalf' of a same-sex partners and spouses. Moreover, as of January 1st \nof this year, 47% of Fortune 500 companies provided health benefits to \nsame-sex partners.\n  When the FMLA was signed into law, it was narrowly tailored to cover \nindividuals caring for a very close family member. The law sought to \ncover that inner circle of people, where the family member assuming the \ncaretaker role would be one of very few, if not the only person, who \ncould do so. That idea has not changed.\n  What has changed are the people who might be in that inner circle. \nThe nuclear American family has grown,\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nsometimes by design, and sometimes by necessity. More and more, that \ninner circle of close family might include a grandparent or grandchild, \nsiblings, or same-sex domestic partners in loving and committed \nrelationships.\n  As the law stands right now, too many of these people are excluded \nfrom the protections of the FMLA.\n  In these tough economic times, when unemployment is high and those \nwith jobs are doing everything they can to keep them, we all know the \nvalue of job security. Hardworking Americans should not have to make \nthe impossible choice between keeping their jobs and providing care and \nsupport for loved ones in their time of need. Twenty years ago, the \nFMLA ensured that millions of Americans did not have to make that \nchoice. Now, the time has come to bring this protection into the 21st \ncentury and ensure that the security afforded by the FMLA is available \nto a broader range of American workers.\n  There are many who would understandably question what this kind of \nchange in the law would cost the business community. Ensuring that \nworkers can take the time they need to recover from a health emergency \nnot only benefits an individual family, it benefits the community where \nthe family lives and the businesses for which the family members work.\n  As I have stated in the past, the FMLA is already a very good law; it \nis already in place and it is working. It provides for unpaid leave \nwhen the need arises, and it only applies to businesses that have \nenough employees on hand to handle the absence of a single worker \nwithout too great a burden.\n  Ninety percent of the leave time that has been taken under the FMLA \nhas been so that employees can care for themselves or for a child in \ntheir care, and those situations are already covered under the law as \nit stands. What the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act would do is \nprovide a little more flexibility, and recognize that there are a few \nmore people in that inner circle of family who we might call upon, or \nwho might call upon us.\n  We can all agree that family is the first and best safety net in \ntimes of personal crisis. Families need to be given the realistic \nability to provide that assistance. What the Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act does is give those family members the ability to help \ntheir loved ones in ways that only they can, without fear of losing \ntheir jobs in the process.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act enhances the FMLA. Like \nthe FMLA when it was passed two decades ago, the Family and Medical \nLeave Inclusion Act is long overdue. Our legislation contains \nreasonable changes that reflect what many of our nation's most \nsuccessful businesses have already done and it accurately represents \nthe modem American family.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act is supported by over 80 \norganizations from the business, civil rights, LGBT, and labor \ncommunities, including: the National Association of Working Women; \nAFSCME; American Academy of Pediatrics ACLU; Families USA; Gay and \nLesbian Advocates and Defenders, GLAD; Human Rights Campaign; People \nfor the American Way; SEIU and; The Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act is the right thing to do, \nand I hope we can join together and pass it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary \nproceedings to be open to the public, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the PCAOB Enforcement \nTransparency Act of 2013 along with my colleague Senator Grassley. This \nbill will allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, \nto make public disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors \nand audit firms earlier in the process.\n  Slightly over 10 years ago, our markets fell victim to a series of \nmassive financial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and \nWorldCom. Public companies had produced fraudulent and materially \nmisleading financial statements, which artificially drove their stock \nprices up and misrepresented their overall profitability. Once the \nfraud was discovered, investor confidence plummeted, as did the markets \nthemselves. We all took a step back after this crisis and asked \nourselves how such massive financial fraud in public reporting \ncompanies could have gone undetected for so long.\n  The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted \na series of hearings on issues that were raised by the revelations \nraised by fraud at Enron and other public companies. The hearings \nproduced consensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak \ncorporate governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate \noversight of accountants charged with auditing a public company's \nfinancial statements.\n  In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by \nthe investigation and hearings, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct of 2002 in a 99 to 0 vote.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act ensured that corporate officers were directly \naccountable for their financial reporting and for the quality of their \nfinancial statements. The law also created a strong, independent board \nto oversee the conduct of the auditors of public companies, the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board.\n  The PCAOB is responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies \nin order to protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on \nthe financial statements of public companies. The Board operates under \nthe oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n  The PCAOB oversees more than 2,400 registered auditing firms, as well \nas the thousands of audit partners and staff who contribute to a firm's \nwork on each audit. The Board's ability to commence proceedings to \ndetermine whether there have been violations of its auditing standards \nor rules of professional practice is an important component of its \noversight.\n  However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the \nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority, and others, the Board's disciplinary proceedings \nare not allowed to be public unless the parties consent. Of course, \nparties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no incentive to \nconsent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus these \nproceedings remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In addition, the \nBoard's decisions in disciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be \npublicized until after the complete exhaustion of an appeals process, \nwhich can often take several years.\n  The PCAOB's nonpublic disciplinary proceedings create a lack of \ntransparency that invites abuse and undermines the Congressional intent \nbehind the establishment of the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright \nlight on auditing firms and practices, and to bolster the \naccountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public.\n  Over the last several years, bad actors have taken advantage of the \nlack of transparency by using it to shield themselves from public \nscrutiny and accountability. PCAOB Chairman James Doty has repeatedly \nstated in testimony provided to both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives over the past two years that the secrecy of the \nproceedings ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and that such \nsecrecy is harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and the \npublic at large.\n  In one example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary \nproceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports \non public companies without any of those companies knowing about the \nPCAOB disciplinary proceedings. In other words, investors and the \npublic company clients of that audit firm were deprived of relevant and \nmaterial information about the proceedings against the firm and the \nsubstance of any violations.\n  There are several reasons why the Board's enforcement proceedings \nshould be open and transparent. First,\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nas I have already noted, the closed proceedings run counter to the \npublic proceedings of other government oversight bodies. Indeed, nearly \nall administrative proceedings brought by the SEC against those it \nregulates public companies, brokers, dealers, investment advisers, and \nothers are open, public proceedings. The PCAOB's secret proceedings are \nnot only shielded from the public, but from Congress as well. How can \nthe public and Congress properly evaluate the Board's oversight of \nauditors and audit firms, and its enforcement program, when no one is \nentitled to know any of the details of these administrative \nproceedings, including whether a proceeding has even been initiated?\n  Second, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to \nshield conduct from the public as long as possible frustrates the \nprocess and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both \nlitigants and the PCAOB.\n  Third, agencies such as the SEC have observed the benefits of open \nand transparent disciplinary proceedings, which include the benefit of \ninforming peer audit firms of the type of activity that may give rise \nto enforcement action by the regulator. In effect, transparency of \nproceedings can serve as a deterrent to misconduct because of a \nperceived increase in the likelihood of ``getting caught.'' \nAccordingly, the audit industry as a whole would also benefit from \ntimely, public, and non-secret enforcement proceedings.\n  Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices, \norders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless \notherwise ordered by the Board. This would make the PCAOB's procedures \nsimilar to those of the SEC for analogous matters.\n  Increasing the transparency and accountability of audit firms subject \nto disciplinary proceedings instituted by the PCAOB is a critical \ncomponent of efforts to bolster and maintain investor confidence in our \nfinancial markets, and should better protect companies as well from \nproblematic auditors.\n  I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in taking the \nlegislative steps necessary to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's \nenforcement process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 851. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend to \nall veterans with a serious service-connected injury eligibility to \nparticipate in the family caregiver services program; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Caregivers Expansion and \nImprovement Act of 2013, which will address the important needs of \nveterans' caregivers.\n  For generations, as the men and women of our armed forces returned \nhome with serious injuries sustained overseas, their wives, husbands, \nparents and other family members stepped in to care for them. These \nfamily members have often provided this care at significant personal \nsacrifice. These caregivers' dedication to caring for the needs of \ntheir injured veterans has often resulted in lost professional \nopportunities and reduction in income.\n  Under the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010, important services and benefits were made available to seriously \ninjured post-9/11 veterans and their families. These changes improved \nthe lives of caregivers by giving them the support they need which, in \nturn, improved the lives of veterans. These services and benefits for \ncaregivers include a tax-free monthly stipend, travel expenses, health \ninsurance, mental health services and counseling, caregiver training \nand respite care for caregivers of seriously injured post-9/11 \nveterans. However, these services were not made available to pre-9/11 \nveterans with equally serious injuries and whose caregivers were in \nequal need of support.\n  Many caregivers of pre-9/11 veterans have been caring for injured \nveterans for years with no support from the federal government. It is \ntime to provide equal benefits to veterans and their family members \nfrom all eras. My legislation does just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting equal treatment of the \ncaregivers of our Nation's veterans and cosponsor my legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve health care furnished by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs by increasing access to complementary and alternative \nmedicine and other approaches to wellness and preventive care, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Veterans Health \nPromotion Act of 2013, which will address veterans' health and \nwellness.\n  The most recent statistics show that VA is providing health care to \nover 6.5 million individual veterans each year, including over 674,000 \nveterans from the most recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. These \nveterans are enrolling in VA at a rate of 56 percent, higher than any \nother group of veterans from previous conflicts. These veterans are \nreceiving some of the best health care this nation has to offer. They \ncan access this care at medical centers, outpatient clinics, vet \ncenters, mobile clinics and through telemedicine.\n  Despite this access to care, many veterans still struggle with their \noverall wellbeing. Therefore, it is not enough to treat veterans who \nare very sick. When we focus solely on disease and illness, we miss the \nbroader goal of wellness. We must expand our understanding of the care \noptions necessary to improve veterans' lives. Therefore, I am \nintroducing legislation which would do just that--expand veterans' \naccess a full spectrum of care including wellness and Complementary and \nAlternative Medicine--known as CAM.\n  VA has made significant strides in providing CAM at VA medical \ncenters. As the name describes, CAM therapies can serve as a complement \nto traditional care or, for some veterans, as an alternative. There is \na growing body of evidence to support the value of these therapies but \ngreater understanding can be achieved through the expansion of these \nservices to more veterans. The legislation I am introducing today would \ndo just that.\n  This expansion would occur through the Veterans Health \nAdministration's Center of Innovation, which is developing, \ndemonstrating and evaluating veteran-centered health care policies. To \ndate, VA has established five such centers. My legislation would \nincrease the number of these Centers of Innovation, establishing at \nleast one in each of VA's 23 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. My \nlegislation would create a total of fifteen pilot sites to provide CAM \ntherapies to veterans throughout the nation. Five of the pilot sites \nwould be located at VA's Polytrauma Centers, which care for veterans \nwith the most complex injuries. The remaining ten would provide CAM \ntherapies within primary care settings.\n  Additionally, my legislation would require VA to study barriers to \nproviding and promoting preventive and holistic approaches to health \ncare, including CAM and wellness, in the primary care setting. When we \nunderstand these barriers we can find a way to break them down, \nfurthering opportunities to enhance the overall health and sense of \nwellbeing among veterans.\n  The legislation would also authorize grants to state and city \nagencies, and community-based nonprofit organizations to provide combat \nveterans and their family members access to wellness programs. By \nleveraging these outside organizations while improving their \ncollaboration with VA, we can improve access to wellness programs \nwithout sacrificing VA's valuable model of care coordination.\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n  An important component for maintaining a healthy lifestyle is \nphysical activity. One of the best ways to improve the health of a \npopulation is to increase access to opportunities for physical \nactivity. When coupled with a healthy diet, physical fitness can help \npromote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes, heart attack and \nstroke. Therefore, my legislation would create a pilot program to \nprovide fitness center memberships for overweight and obese veterans, \nin consultation with their VA health care provider. The pilot program \nwould be over a 2-year period at 10 pilot sites. Additionally, the \nlegislation would require VA to partner with fitness centers to improve \naccess for veterans.\n  Finally, we must ensure CAM, wellness and fitness options are not \nonly available to veterans, but are also utilized by veterans. \nTherefore, my legislation would require VA to study the barriers that \nexist across VHA in providing and promoting preventative and holistic \napproaches to health care, to include Complementary and Alternative \nMedicine and Wellness, in the primary care setting in order to enhance \ntheir overall health and sense of wellbeing among veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I look forward \nto working with them to continue to improve health care access for our \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 117\n\n       Whereas, on average, a person is sexually assaulted in the \n     United States every 2 minutes;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice reports that more than \n     200,000 people in the United States are sexually assaulted \n     each year;\n       Whereas nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men have been \n     victims of rape at some point in their lives;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense received 3,158 reports of \n     sexual assault involving members of the Armed Forces in \n     fiscal year 2010;\n       Whereas children and young adults are most at risk of \n     sexual assault, as 44 percent of sexual assault victims are \n     under 18 years of age, and 80 percent are under 30 years of \n     age;\n       Whereas sexual assault affects women, men, and children of \n     all racial, social, religious, age, ethnic, and economic \n     groups in the United States;\n       Whereas women, men, and children suffer multiple types of \n     sexual violence, including acquaintance, stranger, spousal, \n     and gang rape, incest, child sexual molestation, forced \n     prostitution, trafficking, forced pornography, ritual abuse, \n     sexual harassment, and stalking;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the percentage of completed or \n     attempted rape victimization among women in institutions of \n     higher education is between 20 and 25 percent over the course \n     of a college career;\n       Whereas, in addition to the immediate physical and \n     emotional costs, sexual assault has associated consequences \n     that may include post-traumatic stress disorder, substance \n     abuse, major depression, homelessness, eating disorders, and \n     suicide;\n       Whereas only 41 percent of sexual assault victims pursue \n     prosecution by reporting their attack to law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       Whereas two-thirds of sexual crimes are committed by \n     persons who are not strangers to the victims;\n       Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars \n     long after the physical scars have healed;\n       Whereas, because of advances in DNA technology, law \n     enforcement agencies have the potential to identify the \n     rapists in tens of thousands of unsolved rape cases;\n       Whereas aggressive prosecution can lead to the \n     incarceration of rapists and therefore prevent those \n     individuals from committing further crimes;\n       Whereas national, State, territory, and tribal coalitions, \n     community-based rape crisis centers, and other organizations \n     across the United States are committed to increasing public \n     awareness of sexual violence and its prevalence, and to \n     eliminating sexual violence through prevention and education;\n       Whereas important partnerships have been formed among \n     criminal and juvenile justice agencies, health professionals, \n     public health workers, educators, first responders, and \n     victim service providers;\n       Whereas free, confidential help is available to all \n     survivors of sexual assault through the\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\n     National Sexual Assault Hotline, more than 1,000 rape crisis \n     centers across the United States, and other organizations \n     that provide services to assist survivors of sexual assault;\n       Whereas, according to a 2011 survey of rape crisis centers \n     by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, 50 percent \n     of the rape crisis centers have experienced a reduction in \n     staffing, 65 percent of the rape crisis centers have a \n     waiting list for services, and funding and staffing cuts have \n     resulted in 67 percent of the rape crisis centers having to \n     reduce the amount of hours they spend dedicated to prevention \n     and awareness;\n       Whereas individual and collective efforts reflect the dream \n     of the people of the United States for a country where \n     individuals and organizations actively work to prevent all \n     forms of sexual violence and no sexual assault victim goes \n     unserved or ever feels that there is no path to justice;

Res. 118\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, \n     neurological disease and is the second most common \n     neurological disease in the United States;\n       Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the \n     incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, nevertheless \n     it is estimated that the disease affects 500,000 to 1,500,000 \n     people in the United States and the prevalence will more than \n     double by 2040;\n       Whereas there are millions of Americans who are caregivers, \n     family members, and friends greatly impacted by Parkinson's \n     disease every day;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the economic burden of \n     Parkinson's disease is $14,400,000,000, including indirect \n     costs to patients and family members each year;\n       Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's \n     disease is a combination of genetic and environmental \n     factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is \n     still unknown;\n       Whereas there is no objective test or biomarker for \n     Parkinson's disease, and the rate of misdiagnosis can be \n     high;\n       Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from \n     person to person and include tremors, slowness of movement, \n     difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, \n     rigidity, cognitive impairment, dementia, mood disorders, \n     such as depression and anxiety, constipation, skin problems, \n     and sleep difficulties;\n       Whereas there is currently no cure, therapy, or drug to \n     slow or halt the progression of Parkinson's disease;\n       Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's \n     disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with \n     dose-limiting side effects, and ultimately lose their \n     effectiveness, leaving the person unable to move, speak or \n     swallow; and\n       Whereas increased education and research are needed to find \n     more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, \n     ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson's \n     disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month;\n       (3) continues to support research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;\n       (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance the knowledge \n     of the disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of State, local, regional, and \n     national organizations, volunteers, researchers and millions \n     of Americans across the United States working to improve the \n     quality of life of persons living with Parkinson's disease \n     and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3047-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3047-S3048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 119--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD MALARIA \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. COONS (for Mr. Wicker (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \nBoozman, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Isakson, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Brown)) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being preventable and \n     treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national security \n     interest of the United States, as reducing the risk of \n     malaria protects members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and \n     reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability \n     in less developed countries;\n       Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the \n     diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that \n     support generates goodwill toward the United States and \n     highlights the values of the people of the United States \n     through the work of governmental, non-governmental, and \n     faith-based organizations of the United States;\n       Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term \n     economic interest of the United States because those efforts \n     help developing countries identify at-risk populations, \n     provide better health services, produce healthier and more \n     productive workforces, advance economic development, and \n     promote stronger trading partners;\n       Whereas 35 countries, the majority of which are in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, account for 91 percent of malaria deaths in \n     the world;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, as children \n     under the age of 5 account for an estimated 86 percent of \n     malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal \n     health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and \n     low birth weights, with estimates that malaria infection \n     causes approximately 400,000 cases of severe maternal anemia \n     and between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have \n     made significant progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2012 by the World Health \n     Organization states that in 2011, approximately 53 percent of \n     households in sub-Saharan Africa owned at least one \n     insecticide-treated mosquito net, and household surveys \n     indicated that 90 percent of people used an insecticide-\n     treated mosquito net if one was available in the household;\n       Whereas, in 2011, approximately 153,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2012 further states that \n     between 2000 and 2010--\n       (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 26 percent around \n     the world;\n       (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, \n     malaria mortality rates decreased by 33 percent; and\n       (3) an estimated 1,100,000 malaria deaths were averted \n     globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions;\n\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2012 further states that \n     out of 99 countries with ongoing transmission of malaria in \n     2012, 11 countries are classified as being in the pre-\n     elimination phase of malaria control, 10 countries are \n     classified as being in the elimination phase, and 5 countries \n     are classified as being in the prevention of introduction \n     phase;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and \n     advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to \n     continue to reduce malaria deaths, prevent backsliding in \n     areas where progress has been made, and equip the United \n     States and the global community with the tools necessary to \n     fight malaria and other global health threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative and the contribution of the United States \n     to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas, in May 2011, an independent, external evaluation, \n     prepared through the Global Health Technical Assistance \n     Project, examining 6 objectives of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative, found the President's Malaria Initiative to be a \n     successful, well-led component of the Global Health \n     Initiative that has ``earned and deserves the task of \n     sustaining and expanding the United States Government's \n     response to global malaria control efforts'';\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the \n     President's Malaria Initiative, which is led by the United \n     States Agency for International Development and implemented \n     with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the Department of State, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the \n     Department of Defense, and private sector entities;\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative focuses on \n     helping partner countries achieve major improvements in \n     overall health outcomes through improved access to, and \n     quality of, healthcare services in locations with limited \n     resources; and\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative, recognizing the \n     burden of malaria on many partner countries, has set a target \n     of reducing the burden of malaria by 50 percent for \n     450,000,000 people, representing 70 percent of the at-risk \n     population in Africa, by 2015: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the target of ending malaria deaths by 2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, \n     particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to \n     combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

and\n       (B) the digital good or digital service is delivered, \n     transferred, or provided electronically by means of mobile \n     telecommunications service that is deemed to be provided by \n     such home service provider under section 117 of such title,\n     then the home service provider and, if different, the seller \n     of the digital good or digital service, may presume that the \n     customer's place of primary use for such mobile \n     telecommunications service is the customer tax address \n     described in section 207(2)(B) with respect to the sale of \n     such digital good or digital service.\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     terms ``home service provider'', ``mobile telecommunications \n     service'', and ``place of primary use'' have the same \n     meanings as in section 124 of title 4, United States Code.\n       (e) Multiple Locations.--\n       (1) In general.--If a digital good or a digital service is \n     sold to a customer and available for use by the customer in \n     multiple locations simultaneously, the seller may determine \n     the customer tax addresses using a reasonable and consistent \n     method based on the addresses of use as provided by the \n     customer and determined in agreement with the customer at the \n     time of sale.\n       (2) Direct customer payment.--\n       (A) Establishment of direct payment procedures.--Each State \n     and local jurisdiction shall provide reasonable procedures \n     that permit the direct payment by a qualified customer, as \n     determined under procedures established by the State or local \n     jurisdiction, of taxes that are on the sale of digital goods \n     and digital services to multiple locations of the customer \n     and that would, absent such procedures, be required or \n     permitted by law to be collected from the customer by the \n     seller.\n       (B) Effect of customer compliance with direct payment \n     procedures.--When a qualified customer elects to pay tax \n     directly under the procedures established under subparagraph \n     (A), the seller shall--\n       (i) have no obligation to obtain the multiple customer tax \n     addresses under subsection (a); and\n       (ii) not be liable for such tax, provided the seller \n     follows the State and local procedures and maintains \n     appropriate documentation in its books and records.\n\n     SEC. 205.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. 853, introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 853) to provide the Secretary of Transportation \n     with the flexibility to transfer certain funds to prevent \n     reduced operations and staffing of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Before we hear from my friend from Maine, I appreciate very \nmuch her tenacity, her diligence, and that of Senator Rockefeller and \nothers. This is something that has been difficult, but I think it is \nthe right thing to do. Hopefully when we get back, we can have \nsomething broader in scope than just this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am delighted that the Senate will \npass a bipartisan bill to resolve a serious problem confronting the \nAmerican traveling public and our economy. I thank the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, the minority leader, the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, and all the staff who have worked so hard to make this \nhappen.\n  I am very pleased to be joined in sponsoring this bill by many of our \ncolleagues, including Senator Rockefeller, Senator Thune, Senator Mark \nUdall, Senator Risch, Senator Roberts, Senator Isakson, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Hagan, the Presiding Officer, Senator Toomey, \nSenator Chambliss, Senator Murkowski, Senator Warner, Senator Begich, \nSenator Nelson, and Senator Heller.\n  As the ranking member of the Appropriations Transportation \nSubcommittee, I have been very concerned about the serious delays that \nhave been caused by the FAA furloughs of air traffic controllers. In \nfact, Secretary of Transportation LaHood and FAA Administrator Huerta \nmet with me this morning to discuss this problem and our proposed \nsolution.\n  The Collins-Rockefeller-Thune-Udall bill would restore the funding \nfor these essential air traffic controller positions, and that should \nprevent the onerous delays that were occurring and were only going to \nget worse as the traveling season reached its peak this summer. That \nwould have had a ripple effect throughout the hospitality industry in \nparticular and caused job losses that we can ill afford.\n  I just wish to point out that there literally have been thousands of \nflights delayed since the furloughs went into effect, and I am so happy \nwe were able to work together across the aisle in a bipartisan way to \nresolve this problem.\n  The FAA recently began furloughing 47,000 employees this past Sunday, \nwhich includes nearly 15,000 air traffic controllers. This is \nessentially 10 percent of its workforce, which equates to one furlough \nday per bi-weekly pay period, for a maximum of 11 days through \nSeptember 30th.\n  The challenges the FAA faces this fiscal year are daunting; not only \nis the agency operating under a continuing resolution but sequestration \ncompounds the problem. It is important that sequestration is \nimplemented in a way that ensures safety and minimizes the impact on \nthe traveling public as well as jobs in the hospitality and airline \nindustries. FAA recently announced its plans to achieve savings by \nimplementing furloughs of air traffic controllers.\n  These cuts have already caused widespread delays to the air \ntransportation system and were expected to get worse. It is estimated \nthat as many as 6,700 flights would be delayed each day, more than \ndouble the worst day of flight delays last year. This reduction in \nstaffing of air traffic controllers has been the primary cause of one \nout of every three delays since the furloughs began.\n  In fact, on Monday alone, there were 2,660 delays, of which 1,200 \nwere due to the furloughs, and 2,000 delays on Tuesday, of which 1,025 \ndue to the reduced staff. What was even more troubling is that soon we \nwill be approaching the summer peak travel season. Some airports may \nexperience delays of up to three hours during peak travel times.\n  The FAA acknowledges that these service reductions will adversely \naffect commercial, corporate, and general aviation operators. The FAA \nexpects that as airlines estimate the potential impacts of these \nfurloughs, they will be forced to change their schedules, cancel \nflights, and lay off employees.\n  Our bill, The Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013, would provide the \nSecretary of Transportation the flexibility to transfer certain funds \nto prevent furloughs of essential employees at the FAA. It would give \nthe Secretary the authority to transfer an amount not to exceed $253 \nmillion to prevent essential employees at the FAA, such as air traffic \ncontrollers, from being furloughed in order to reduce flight delays \nwhile maintaining a safe and efficient national airspace system.\n  My bill would accomplish this goal by allowing a one-time shift of \nunused monies in the Airport Improvement Program to Operations. I first \nraised the idea of using AIP carryover balances as a solution at the \npolicy lunch on Tuesday, and many of my colleagues indicated interest \nin this approach. Our bill has been vetted by the General Counsel \noffices at both the FAA and the Secretary's office. Secretary LaHood \ntold me this morning that it is an effective, workable solution.\n  The transfer would come largely from carryover balances within the \nAirport Improvement Program (AIP). To be clear: this is the \ndiscretionary portion of the program and in no way affects the \nentitlement funds airports are guaranteed to receive. The program has \nsufficient funding to support this effort. Historically, AIP carryover \nbalances range between $400-450 million and has not been below $300 \nmillion in the last decade. In fact, last year there was approximately \n$700 million of these carryover balances.\n  Over the past several years, the aviation industry has faced tough \neconomic hardships. I recognize that aviation plays a critical role in \ndriving economic growth, jobs and investment across the country. The \nAirport Improvement Program is a very important program which supports \ninfrastructure at our nation's airports.\n  This bill should be recognized as a one-time solution in order to \navert the serious national impacts that have resulted from the \ndecisions made by the FAA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I am grateful to both \nthe Majority and Minority Leaders.\n  I thank them for their cooperation in making this happen. It is nice \nto know that when we work together, we really can solve problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we were able to accomplish two very \nimportant things this week. One is the final passage of the Internet \ntax issue, but that is because it was a bipartisan issue, and we were \nable to get this done.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes and passed and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in writing, documents, and representation in a pro se civil \naction pending in Connecticut federal district court. In this action, \nthe plaintiff claims that a bar mitzvah was held in the Greenwich Town \nHall, allegedly in violation of the Constitutions of the United States \nand the State of Connecticut.\n  The plaintiff has issued a subpoena to Senator Blumenthal, who \nattended a Town Hall event preceding the alleged bar mitzvah, and to \nhis office, requesting the production of a deposition by written \nquestions from the Senator and documents. Senator Blumenthal would like \nto cooperate by providing testimony in writing and relevant documents. \nThe enclosed resolution would authorize the production of written \ntestimony from the Senator and relevant office documents, where \nappropriate. It would also authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to \nrepresent the Senator, his office, and any employee of the Senator's \noffice from whom evidence may be sought in this case.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 122\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I have submitted, with Senators \nCornyn, Reid, Enzi, Menendez, Udall of New Mexico, and Cruz, a \nresolution commemorating Cinco de Mayo.\n  We all love Cinco de Mayo for the food and festivities that we have \ngrown so accustomed to across our country. However, we commemorate \nCinco de Mayo in order to celebrate the joint history and values that \nare shared by both Mexicans and Americans. Cinco de Mayo is a day that \nreminds us that the citizens of Mexico possess the same courage that \nwe, as Americans, value in ourselves. For that reason, the \ncommemoration of Cinco de Mayo has transcended from being a celebration \nof the victorious Battle of Puebla that Mexico won over France, to a \ncelebration of courage and a recognition of all contributions that the \nMexican-American community has had both in Colorado and in our great \nNation. Celebrating Cinco de Mayo brings pride to both the Mexican-\nAmerican community and all Americans.\n  The courage displayed by Mexican forces on May 5, 1862, parallels the \ncourage that we as Americans have used to overcome adversity and thrive \nsince our founding. The victory of the beleaguered force of Mexican \ntroops at the Battle of Puebla weakened France's immense resources and \nlimited its ability to meddle in America's Civil War. As Mexico sought \nto defend itself from European aggression, the Battle of Puebla reminds \nus that the foundation of the United States was also built through \nbattles in which the United States often found itself as the underdog. \nThrough courage, perseverance, and the willingness to fight and die for \nfreedom, our Nation has become stronger. These contributions that the \nMexican-American community has had in our Nation should be celebrated \nas part of our country's history.\n  While Cinco de Mayo remains a Mexican national holiday, the \ncommemoration of this holiday has become imbedded in American culture. \nBoth in Colorado and throughout our Nation, the contributions of the \nmillions of Mexican-American families are seen throughout our \ncommunities. As in years past, I continue to encourage my fellow \nColoradans to celebrate Cinco de Mayo by remembering and educating but \nalso by coming together with friends and neighbors to enjoy food, \nmusic, and dancing.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed to, \nthe preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid on \nthe table en bloc, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  (The resolutions, with their preambles, are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/25/senate-section/article/S3060-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
