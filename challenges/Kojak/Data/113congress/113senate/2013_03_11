Mr. President, we are going to take up legislation this \nweek to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. I \napplaud the committee work done by Chairman Mikulski and Ranking Member \nShelby. These two individuals are seasoned veterans. They have worked \nhard to get this legislation done, as only they could do. They are two \nof our most senior Members and two of the most respected Members.\n  The measure we are going to work on starting today was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives last week. It is not perfect, and we hope to \nimprove upon that. There will be amendments offered. I am working on a \nprocess to consider those amendments. This week will offer another \nopportunity for the Senate to return to regular order, an opportunity \nfor this body to legislate through cooperation, through compromise, as \nwe used to do. This legislation will be a test of the Senate's good \nwill. America's economy is poised to grow and expand. The last thing it \nneeds is another manufactured crisis, such as a government shutdown, to \nderail its progress.\n  For some public servants the political fires are lit by their first \ntrip to\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nWashington or by being moved by a memorable party convention speech. \nFor others the history of military service leads to a career in public \nservice. For still others a single issue, such as a proposed freeway \nthrough a vibrant community, propels them into politics. But for \nSenator Carl Levin, serving Michigan families is something of a family \nbusiness. Senator Levin's father served as a Michigan corrections \ncommissioner. His uncle Theodore was chief judge for the district court \nin the Eastern District of Michigan for many years.\n  I was elected to Congress in 1982--the same year Senator Levin's \nbrother Sander was elected to the House of Representatives. He has been \nranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee. He is a \ndistinguished Member of the House of Representatives, having served \nthat body for going on 31 years.\n\n  The first time I met Carl Levin was over here. I was in the House, \ngoing to run for the Senate. We met in his office. The first thing I \nsaid was, I came to Washington a few years ago with your brother, \nelected in the same class.\n  He said: Yes, he is my brother but also my best friend.\n  How about that? That is something I have never ever forgotten. These \ntwo brothers, natives of Detroit, have done much for the State of \nMichigan.\n  Carl Levin is truly an outstanding Senator and an even better man. He \nis the longest serving Senator in his State's history. He dedicated his \nlife to Michigan families long before he was elected to the Senate. He \nserved as general counsel to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission and \nas assistant attorney general for the State of Michigan. He served two \nterms on the Detroit City Council, one of them as president of the city \ncouncil. As a Senator Senator Levin has consistently advocated for \nMichigan families, whether that meant supporting the auto industry, \nprotecting Lake Michigan, holding credit card companies accountable or \nsecuring funding for sons and daughters serving in the U.S. military.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin is the \nNation's most respected voice on national security and the most \npowerful advocate for the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces. As \nchairman of the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, he has \nsought truth on behalf of American families time and time again. He led \ninvestigations of the 2008 financial crisis, abusive credit practices \nand abusive credit card practices, and a long, extensive, extremely \nenlightening bit of work on the Enron collapse.\n  His dedication to the Senate is matched only by his dedication to his \nown family. He and his loving wife Barbara have been married for more \nthan 50 years. They have three daughters and six grandchildren.\n  I am confident Carl is looking forward to spending more time with his \ngrandchildren, taking long walks through his and Sandy's tree farm. It \nis a wonderful place they go. They don't harvest anything; it is just a \nbunch of trees, and they love that tree farm.\n  I so admire Senator Levin. Clearly, when he retires in 2 years, the \nSenate will lose its powerful voice for military families and issues \nthat need to be investigated by this body. Michigan is a much better \nplace because of Carl Levin. Our country, the United States, is a much \nbetter place because of Carl Levin's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is no secret that our Tax Code is in \ndire need of reform. Although there are differences of opinion about \nhow best to fix our Tax Code, I do not think there is anyone in the \nChamber who would argue in favor of keeping our current code as it is.\n  As I have said before, I believe there is, for the first time in many \nyears, real momentum to get something done on tax reform this year. The \nleaders of the tax-writing committees on both sides of the aisle have \nexpressed a desire to move forward on tax reform, and there is real \nbipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.\n  This is going to be difficult, there is no question about it. It is \ngoing to be very hard to form and maintain a coalition in favor of a \nset of reforms that will simplify the current Tax Code and promote \neconomic growth. It is going to take a lot of hard work and it is going \nto take people from both parties to get it done. But I think we can \nsucceed.\n  However, last week it was disheartening to hear the chairperson of \nthe Senate Budget Committee talk about the possibility of including \ninstructions for tax reform in a budget reconciliation package. This \nnews was discouraging for a number of reasons. First and foremost, \nreconciliation, by its very nature, is a partisan process. In the few \ninstances in recent history when reconciliation resulted in \nlegislation, there was bipartisan support at the outset. That simply is \nnot the case with this proposal. If the Budget Committee goes this \nroute, it will needlessly inject partisanship into a process that, if \nit is going to have any chance of success, must be bipartisan.\n  There is simply no way to pass a purely partisan tax reform package \nwith the current makeup of Congress. Make no mistake, if the Senate \nmajority pursues this course of action, it will poison the well for tax \nreform. It will make it all but impossible.\n  I would urge my colleagues on the Budget Committee to resist this \ntemptation. If they really want to see tax reform succeed, they should \nlet the tax-writing committees in both the House and Senate do their \njobs.\n  Another concern I have is that the statements by the Budget Committee \nchairwoman make it unclear whether she is arguing in favor of tax \nreform or simply in favor of raising taxes. My suspicion is she is \ntalking about the latter. It has become more and more common for my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to argue in favor of simply \neliminating so-called tax loopholes in order to raise revenue and then \ncalling the process ``tax reform.''\n  Indeed, the President used this very same tactic in the State of the \nUnion. He stated his support for ``comprehensive tax reform,'' but he \nspoke almost exclusively about using the process to raise more revenue. \nSome of my colleagues have made similar arguments in the Senate.\n  That is not tax reform at all. Tax reform, as it has been \ntraditionally proposed and understood, is a process of eliminating \ncertain preferences in order to broaden the tax base and lower the \nrates. This is how you simplify the Tax Code. This is how you make it \nmore efficient and fair. Most importantly, it is how you make the Tax \nCode more conducive to economic growth.\n  If you are eliminating select deductions and preferences only to \npocket the revenue for future spending, you are not reforming the Tax \nCode, you are simply raising taxes. If the Budget Committee is about to \nreport a budget which includes restrictions for tax reform, I can't \nhelp but assume the process will be more about raising revenues than it \nwill be about actually fixing our broken tax system.\n  Once again, if this is the case, the Budget Committee would be \ninjecting partisanship into what has up to now been mostly a bipartisan \neffort. At the same time, they would be perpetuating the myth that our \nTax Code is full of so-called loopholes which benefit only the rich. I \nhave spoken about this at length on the Senate floor, but the message \nbears repeating.\n  The term we hear most often to describe deductions and preferences in\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nthe Tax Code is ``tax expenditure,'' which implies that by allowing \npeople to keep more of their money, the government is somehow engaging \nin spending. Indeed, the President has even gone so far as to refer to \ndeductions and preferences, which reduce an individual's or business's \ntax burden, as ``spending in the tax code.''\n  As I said before, when many of my Democratic friends talk about tax \nreform, they are usually talking about eliminating these provisions in \norder to raise revenue so they can spend it. Far too often they refer \nto these provisions as loopholes. For example, the Budget Committee \nchairwoman was quoted last week as saying her committee is looking at \nclosing loopholes as a means of reducing the deficit.\n  Let me make one thing clear: Describing tax expenditures as loopholes \nis simply and deliberately inaccurate. A loophole is something Congress \ndid not intend; and, in general, we would eliminate loopholes once we \nlearned they were being improperly exploited.\n  Tax expenditures, by contrast, are placed by Congress into the Tax \nCode deliberately. For example, the largest tax expenditure is the \nexclusion for employer-provided health insurance and benefits. Do we \nwant to do away with that?\n  Another one of the largest tax expenditures is the home mortgage \ninterest deduction. Some would like to do away with that and millions \nwould not--especially all the home builders around the country. Whether \nthese expenditures benefit someone in the middle class or one of the \nso-called rich, they are not loopholes. These are not tax schemes some \nlawyer or accountant concocted to help his clients game that system. \nThese are broad-based tax incentives used by many Americans.\n  Favorable tax treatment of tuition expenses could be labeled spending \nthrough the Tax Code or a ``loophole,'' but you don't hear many people \nusing those terms to explain them. Rather, my friends on the other side \nof the aisle use the term ``loophole'' to describe things they do not \nlike and ``investment'' to describe things they do like. This is about \npicking winners and losers and not about tax reform.\n  Even if you disagree with a particular tax expenditure, it is simply \ndishonest to refer to it as a loophole. An honest debate requires \nrecognition that all of these tax expenditures were designed by \nCongress with economic or social goals in mind and are not tax escapes \ncreated by accident or sneaky abuses of the Tax Code.\n  Furthermore, if we are talking about eliminating tax expenditures, we \nneed to be clear about who benefits from them. If you look at the \nlargest list of tax expenditures, you will find the ones most often \ncited by my colleagues on the other side, such as bonus depreciation on \ncorporate jets or tax breaks for oil companies, are not among them.\n  What you will find is a list of deductions which disproportionately \nbenefit the middle class. This being the case, if my colleagues are \nserious about significantly reducing the deficit by eliminating \ndeductions and so-called loopholes, they will necessarily be talking \nabout raising taxes on the middle class. Indeed, if they only focus on \nthose provisions which benefit the so-called rich, they will not be \nable to raise enough revenue to make a serious dent in the deficit.\n  For example, let's take a look at the mortgage interest deduction. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, only 35 percent of the \nbenefit of the mortgage interest deduction goes to taxpayers with \nincomes over $200,000 per year. The remaining 65 percent goes to \ntaxpayers who make less than $200,000. By a ratio of almost 2 to 1, the \nmortgage interest deduction benefits the middle class, not the so-\ncalled rich.\n  We may also look at the earned income tax credit, another large tax \nexpenditure. This is another fully refundable tax credit, meaning \ntaxpayers can receive it whether they pay income taxes or not. High-\nincome earners receive no benefits from the earned income tax credit.\n  The story is the same with the child tax credit, which is limited to \nlower and middle-income earners. None of it goes to taxpayers with \nhigher incomes. Likewise, all education credits go to taxpayers making \nless than $200,000 a year.\n  The list goes on and on. Deductions for real property taxes, medical \nexpenses, childcare, and student loan interest, all of them \npredominantly, if not exclusively, benefit people making less than \n$200,000 a year.\n  Benefits from some other large tax expenditures are distributed \nalmost proportionately between higher and middle-income earners. One \nsuch provision is the State and local income and sales tax deduction.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation data, 55 percent of the \nbenefit of this deduction goes to taxpayers making more than $200,000 a \nyear, and 45 percent of the benefit goes to people making less than \n$200,000 a year. This expenditure accounts for about one-half of the \nrevenue loss attributable to itemized deductions. Since the benefits \nare slightly more in favor of those with higher incomes, it would \nlikely be a target for a ``tax reform'' exercise designed to raise \nrevenue. However, much of the burden of limiting or eliminating this \ndeduction would still fall on the middle class.\n  It is also interesting to note that this past December the New York \nTimes editorial page, which is usually very much in sync with the \nphilosophy of the Democratic Party, recommended caution when \nconsidering limits to this particular deduction. Yet it is one of the \nlargest tax expenditures in the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York \nTimes editorial from December 6, 2012, entitled ``Keep the State Tax \nDeduction.''\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 6, 2012]\n\n                      Keep the State Tax Deduction\n\n       As they continue to wrangle over the year-end fiscal \n     deadline, both Democrats and Republicans are considering caps \n     on federal income-tax deductions.\n       That could be very bad news for residents of New York, New \n     Jersey and other states and cities that rely heavily on their \n     own income taxes. Such a cap would reduce the value of the \n     deduction for state and local income taxes, which has been \n     part of the federal tax code for a century (though the \n     deduction has been diluted by the alternative minimum tax). \n     That could substantially reduce middle-class disposable \n     incomes in high-tax states, which, in turn, would put \n     pressure on those states to cut taxes and the services they \n     have long chosen to provide. (A cap would also affect \n     property and sales taxes, though those are spread around more \n     evenly among all the states.)\n       The theory behind the deduction was that the amount paid to \n     states in taxes is not really part of an individual's \n     disposable income, because it is obligatory and, therefore, \n     should not be taxed twice. Over time, the deduction has \n     become the equivalent of a subsidy from the federal \n     government to states that believe in a strong and active \n     government. That may infuriate conservatives in low-tax \n     states like Texas, who hate subsidizing states with different \n     views of government's role, but it's actually a good thing \n     for the country.\n       The deduction is Washington's way of supporting states that \n     support their most vulnerable citizens and neediest cities. \n     The seven states that account for 90 percent of state and \n     local tax deductions (including sales and property taxes)--\n     New York, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Maryland, \n     Illinois and Massachusetts--generally do a better job of \n     providing for the health and welfare of their citizens, and \n     are more willing to pay for institutions that are good for \n     society as a whole.\n       Rapid-transit systems in states like New York and \n     Massachusetts, subsidized with tax dollars, save energy and \n     improve the environment. Few cities can afford to operate \n     their own universities, but the City University of New York, \n     also subsidized with tax dollars, is an enormously valuable \n     institution with national benefits. Public hospital systems \n     and generous Medicaid programs have improved and extended the \n     lives of tens of millions of low-income people.\n       Texas is proud not to have an income tax, but it also has \n     by far the highest percentage of uninsured people in the \n     country. It ranks last in prenatal care as well and in \n     overall federal assessment of health quality.\n       In their fiscal-cliff offer, Republicans have proposed \n     raising $800 billion by capping deductions for the wealthy, \n     though their proposal would inevitably affect the middle \n     class in expensive states like New York and California. \n     President Obama would prefer to raise tax rates, but he has \n     also proposed deduction limits that would affect states that \n     have chosen to impose higher income taxes. Governors, mayors \n     and representatives of those states need to make their voices \n     heard in support of that choice.\n\n  Once again, when my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about \neliminating so-called loopholes for the sole purpose of raising \nrevenue, they are either talking about raising taxes on the middle \nclass or they are proposing changes which will have no meaningful \nimpact on the deficit at all. If the goal is to construct political \ntalking points and raise relatively significant\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\namounts of revenue by going after politically convenient targets--jet \nowners, oil companies, private equity firms, and the like--you may do \nthis by eliminating a handful of so-called loopholes.\n  This isn't the stated goal of the President, nor is it what my \ncolleagues on the Budget Committee talk about when they say they want \nto pursue ``tax reform'' through reconciliation. No, instead they talk \nabout reducing deficits, debt, and attaining fiscal sustainability. \nThey cannot do this by focusing efforts on tax provisions which only \nbenefit the wealthy. The money simply isn't there. If we are not going \nto cut spending, and if our deficit reduction efforts are focused only \non eliminating so-called tax loopholes, then the middle class happens \nto be the target.\n  We need a different approach. We need tax reform which focuses on \neliminating preferences in the Tax Code--not for the purpose of raising \ntaxes but for lowering the rates and encouraging economic growth. \nUnlike the idea of tax reform advanced by some of my friends on the \nother side, this will benefit the middle class.\n  This is what tax reform is all about. Anyone talking about raising \ntaxes or closing loopholes for the sole purpose of generating revenue \nis not talking about tax reform. For these reasons, I hope the Budget \nCommittee will go a different route. I hope they will let the \nbipartisan tax reform efforts underway in both the House and Senate run \ntheir course.\n  If they don't, if they hijack the process in order to once again \nraise taxes on the American people and to vilify Republicans as being \nthe ``party of the rich,'' we will not see tax reform happen this year \nor, quite likely, any year in the near future.\n  Our Nation is facing a number of challenges. In addition to mounting \ndebts and deficits, our economic recovery remains on a slow and tenuous \npath. We need people who are willing to make difficult choices in order \nto solve these problems. This will mean structural reforms to our \nentitlement programs, which are the main drivers of our debts. Once \nagain, that will mean real, meaningful changes to our Tax Code, which \ncontinues to be an obstacle to sustainable economic growth.\n  As I stated, I do believe there are people on both sides of the aisle \nwho recognize these needs, particularly when it comes to tax reform. \nSadly, there are also those who would rather campaign on these \nproblems, attacking anyone who proposes real solutions while offering \nonly political talking points in return. That is not what the American \npeople deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               Obamacare\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, next week marks the third anniversary \nof ObamaCare, and I will remind you that leading up to its passage in \nMarch 2010, Republicans warned endlessly that the bill would cost too \nmuch and wouldn't work the way the President and other Washington \nDemocrats said it would. Then-Speaker Pelosi famously said we needed to \npass the bill to learn what was in it. Well, nearly 3 years and \nthousands of pages of regulations later, we have learned a lot about \nObamaCare. It looks like our worst fears are coming true.\n  Right down the hall, President Obama promised if Congress would only \npass the kind of health care takeover he was after, it would slow the \ngrowth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and for \nour government. Today, the facts tell a very different story.\n  According to Congress's own nonpartisan budget experts, ObamaCare \nwill increase Federal health spending and subsidies by nearly $600 \nbillion. That is only projected to get worse over time.\n  Just a few weeks ago, these same nonpartisan experts told us spending \nis set to ``grow rapidly when provisions of the Affordable Care Act are \nfully implemented by mid decade.'' Their words, not mine.\n  So when the President tries to convince Americans that Washington \ndoesn't have a spending problem but a health spending problem, what he \nis not saying is his own health care law is actually making things \nworse, not better, and that is to say nothing of the devastating \neffects of this law for American families.\n  Then-Senator Obama promised to lower premiums by as much as $2,500 \nper family when he ran for President. Here are the facts: Three years \nafter ObamaCare's passage, premiums for families have actually risen by \nnearly that same amount. And that is before the most expensive new \nrules, taxes, and mandates kick in. After that, the experts tell us \npremiums could increase by $2,100 per family.\n\n  Tragically, ObamaCare will place the greatest burden on young \nAmericans--those just starting to build lives of their own. This is a \ntime in their lives when every dollar counts. Yet 3 years after \nObamaCare's passage, experts say premiums for healthy young people \ncould rise by 169 percent.\n  Part of the reason costs are set to increase so dramatically is \nbecause ObamaCare levies so many new taxes and fees. But that is really \nonly half the story. It is also because the law imposes so many onerous \nregulations. Just look at this stack right here. This is 1 day's worth \nof ObamaCare regulations--828 pages in 1 day. Overall, there are nearly \n20,000 pages, with many more to come. But this is 1 day's worth--828 \npages.\n  This law is a disaster waiting to happen. Imagine the burden we are \nplacing on a single mom who wants to open her own store or the young \nentrepreneur who wants to sell some new idea or the business owners we \nall know from back home--the folks who employ so many of our \nconstituents. Instead of encouraging them to create jobs and grow the \neconomy, we are hitting them with a brick of regulations.\n  Last week the Federal Reserve said what many of us have been \npredicting all along: ObamaCare is also costing jobs. Recent polling \nbears this out too. One survey said that more than half of American \nsmall business owners are worried that health care costs and taxes will \nhurt their operating environment ``a lot.'' Another small business \nsurvey recently identified these issues as the top two concerns among \neight tested.\n  There are countless real-world examples of how this is hurting the \nfolks we represent. Let me give you just one example. One of my \nconstituents is Junior Bridgeman. He was once known for his skills on \nthe basketball court. Today, Louisvillians know him as the owner of a \nsuccessful restaurant franchise that employs a lot of Kentuckians. He \nwrote to me recently to say that ObamaCare is a serious impediment not \nonly to hiring but to hiring low-income employees in particular. Here \nis what he had to say:\n\n       [It] does not consider our ability to afford the mandate. \n     Under our current labor model . . . [it] will increase labor \n     costs whether we offer health care or pay the tax penalties. \n     . . . .This creates, in essence, a disincentive to hire low \n     income employees.\n\n  The President's allies are worried too. We have seen the stories \nabout Democrats who voted for the bill now having second thoughts about \nspecific funding mechanisms for it, but now union leaders are even \nexpressing fears about the law driving up costs for their own health \ncare plans, making unionized workers actually less competitive.\n  This is the worst time to be imposing tens of thousands of pages of \nnew regulations and onerous taxes on the very families and businesses \nthat can least afford them. We owe our constituents better, \nparticularly those who are struggling the most.\n  Look, ObamaCare is just too expensive, and it is not working the way \nWashington Democrats promised. That is why ObamaCare needs to be \nrepealed. That is why I will continue to push for its repeal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, initiated an unexplainable \norder to take action to reduce the population of detained illegal \naliens, and they said it was for budgetary reasons. I quote a spokesman \nfor ICE, who said the decision was made because ``fiscal uncertainty \nremains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration . . . \n''\n  Well, we have had fiscal uncertainty for 4 years now, and the \ndecision to release these detainees was made before the sequestration \neven took place. The procedures put in place under the continuing \nresolution and the resources for covering the costs of detaining these \nillegal immigrants until they could be brought to trial and sent back \nhome were put in place by the funding we provided for the agency in \nSeptember, running through the end of this month, or until March 27. So \na lot of questions need to be answered about ICE's decision because \nthere was a furor over why we are releasing illegal immigrants back on \nthe streets of America. Why are we putting these people back out on the \nstreets when the law didn't require it? The resources were there to \nkeep there, and yet many were released before the sequestration even \ntook place--before the across-the-board cuts even took place--and I \nwant to get some answers. So I wrote Secretary Napolitano a letter \nasking her to provide answers to a series of questions, which I will \nstate in a moment, and have the answer to me in my office by Friday, \nMarch 8.\n  Well, I returned today to find the answer was not there. I could give \nthe Secretary the benefit of the doubt and say it is in the mail. We \nknow it doesn't always guarantee next-day delivery. Nevertheless, I \nthink the American people need to know. Particularly those impacted, \nthose communities impacted by these illegal immigrants--not knowing who \nthey are, not knowing why they were released, not knowing whether we \ncan bring them back to stand before a judge and plead their case or be \nprocessed for return.\n  The law enforcement officials in these communities are up in arms \nbecause they don't know who these people are. They don't know whether \nthey are criminals; they don't know whether they are ever going to be \nable to bring them back into the ICE system and be detained and readied \nfor processing. So that is why I asked the Secretary to respond to my \nletter.\n  Subsequent to that, officials at ICE have denied recent press reports \nregarding plans to release even more detained illegal immigrants. Last \nTuesday, an internal ICE document obtained by the House Judiciary \nCommittee revealed a plan of ICE to continue reducing detention center \npopulations each week while the sequestration is in place. That \ndocument shows one scenario where the number of illegal immigrants in \ncustody could be reduced by more than 1,000 a week between February 15 \nand March 31. The initial report said it was a couple hundred--I think \n300 was the number given--only to find out it is more than 1,000, and \nnow we find out it may be more than 1,000 each week for about a 6- or \n7-week period of time.\n  What we are trying to do is get the facts and get an explanation of \nwhat has happened, why it took place in the manner it did, and what is \nthe administration's plan for going forward with this. I am doing this \nbecause as ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, I am getting all kinds of questions from people--not \njust my colleagues but others across the country--basically asking what \nis going on here. I wish to be able to respond to those questions with \nanswers, or have the Department respond.\n  As the head of the Department, Secretary Napolitano needs to provide \ninformation on who made this decision, why this decision was made, why \nwas it made before sequestration even took effect, why was the number \nof released individuals said to be around 300 when it was well over \n1,000? Releasing the detained individuals has the potential to put \nthese communities at risk and sends a message to those who come here \nand break the law as illegal immigrants that our government is not \nserious. I am sure word is spreading through Mexico and other ports of \nentry to illegal immigrants: Don't worry, you may get picked up; you \nmay get put in a detention center; they will provide a bed, food, and \nso on, but they are releasing 1,000 a week. I can just see the \ntraffickers now pitching this to tens of hundreds or thousands of \npeople, taking their money, getting them across the border, reaching \nthe fence, or tunneling under the fence or climbing over the fence, or \nany of a number of other ways they are bringing illegals into this \ncountry.\n  I spent 3 days down on the border. While we are making some strides, \nwe have a long way to go to stop this illegal immigration. So we need \nclarification and we need an explanation of what has happened.\n  Let me state some of the questions I have raised to the Secretary:\n  Why did the Federal Government release detained illegal immigrants 1 \nweek before the sequester took effect and blame it on budget cuts when \nthose cuts had not even yet been put into place?\n  Why didn't ICE take the proper steps necessary to manage its \nresources efficiently across the various programs? As I said earlier, \nthe Congress itself provided them with adequate resources to maintain a \nlevel of 34,000 illegal detainees per year and not go below that. They \ndo not need to go below that number because they had the resources to \npay for it. They are required by Congress to do that.\n  What triggered ICE to instruct field offices to reduce the detainee \npopulation a week before the sequestration hit?\n  How many illegal immigrants were released during that time?\n  Exactly how many of these individuals were released solely due to \nbudget reasons?\n  How many of the released individuals, if any, were designated as \ncriminal? The law enforcement people obviously need to know that.\n  Have instructions been given to field offices to reduce the intake \nand arrests of illegal aliens into detention?\n  These are just some of the many questions I asked Secretary \nNapolitano because I think Congress and the American people deserve \nanswers.\n  As the head of the Department, Secretary Napolitano has the ultimate \nresponsibility to oversee the decisions in the management of agency \nresources. She said this decision was made at a level below her. We \nhear a lot of that from administration officials: It is not my fault, \nit is somebody else's fault. That is why they rise to the position of \nSecretary, because they are the ones who ultimately oversee the program \nand need to take responsibility, or at least need to answer a question \nposed by a Member of the Senate as to why they did what they did and \nhow we are going to fix this.\n  Failing to respond to the Congress and to our requests and the \nfailure to provide the American people with more information behind \nthis decision is simply not something we should accept. I will keep \npressing for these answers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a \nrecent decision by the Department of Defense to authorize a new \nmilitary decoration--the Distinguished Warfare Medal--as a way to \nrecognize the contributions of silent warriors, such as drone pilots \nand cyber warriors.\n  I have absolutely no objection to the creation of the Distinguished \nWarfare Medal. Every day our silent warriors use modern warfare \ntechnology in ways that have had an extraordinary impact on today's \nbattlefield--saving the lives of countless American service men and \nwomen and enhancing the national security of our country.\n  However, I adamantly oppose the decision by the Defense Department to\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nelevate the Distinguished Warfare Medal above the Bronze Star and the \nPurple Heart, which are awarded for acts of valor and heroism on the \nbattlefield, and above the Soldier's Medal, which is given for acts of \ngallantry beyond the battlefield.\n  I believe medals earned in combat or in other life-threatening \nconditions should maintain their precedence above noncombat awards. \nPlacing the Distinguished Warfare Medal above the Bronze Star and the \nPurple Heart diminishes the significance of such awards earned by \nrisking one's life in direct combat or through acts of heroism.\n  I am not alone in my opposition to the precedence the Defense \nDepartment plans to give the Distinguished Warfare Medal. A bipartisan \ngroup of 21 other Senators, our colleagues, has joined me in a letter \nto Defense Secretary Hagel urging him to reconsider the Department's \ndecision.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars in my State and in the Presiding \nOfficer's State have also asked Secretary Hagel to reconsider. And \nwhile the Secretary has told the VFW that he is satisfied with the \ncriteria and placement of the Distinguished Warfare Medal, I believe we \ncan still make the case that combat awards and medals for gallantry \nshould remain the military's highest honors.\n  In his response to the VFW defending the new medal, Secretary Hagel \nasserts:\n\n       There are numerous existing medals that may be awarded for \n     non-valorous achievements which are higher in precedence than \n     the Bronze Star.\n\n  That is true. There are medals, such as the Legion of Merit, not \ndirectly linked to a single act of valor. But these medals recognize \ndistinguished service often spanning several generations of service. \nThese awards are given for vastly different periods and different types \nof service.\n  Comparing awards for lifetime achievement to the Distinguished \nWarfare Medal, which even Secretary Hagel's letter states is awarded \nfor ``a single''--I repeat, ``a single''--``extraordinary act,'' is not \nan appropriate justification for its precedence above the Bronze Star \nand Purple Heart.\n  Veterans groups are understandably upset. The new Distinguished \nWarfare Medal appears to be a wartime medal based on a single event \nthat trumps acts of valor on the field of battle.\n  In this dispute I think it is instructive to consider why the Bronze \nStar and the Purple Heart were created.\n  The Bronze Star was conceived by COL Russell ``Red'' Reeder in 1943. \nAt the time he and other military officers believed there was a need \nfor a ground combat medal equivalent to the Air Medal, which was \nawarded for meritorious achievement to our pilots and flight crews. In \nfact, originally the award that became the Bronze Star was proposed as \nthe ``Ground Medal.''\n  The award was created to boost the morale of American ground forces \nduring World War II. As GEN George C. Marshall explained to President \nRoosevelt in a letter:\n\n       The fact that the ground troops, infantry in particular, \n     lead miserable lives of extreme discomfort and are the ones . \n     . . (most) close in personal combat with the enemy, makes the \n     maintenance of their morale of great importance. The award of \n     the Air Medal has had an adverse reaction on the ground \n     troops, particularly the Infantry Riflemen who are suffering \n     the heaviest losses, air or ground, in the Army, and enduring \n     [some of our] greatest hardships.\n\n  The Purple Heart, of course, is one of our country's oldest military \ndecorations, originally instituted by George Washington, then the \ncommander in chief of the Continental Army, in 1782, to reward troops \nfor what he called ``unusual gallantry'' and ``extraordinary fidelity \nand essential service.''\n  The Purple Heart was revived as a military decoration in 1932 on the \n200th anniversary of George Washington's birthday. In 1985, by an act \nof Congress, it was given its current precedence just below the Bronze \nStar and directly above the Meritorious Service Medal--a clear \nrecognition of the special valor of those who receive it. I recognize \nthat military awards should be updated as the tactics of warfare \nchange. Drones and cyber warfare play a role in the defense of this \ngreat country, and there is no question that each member of our \nmilitary plays a crucial role in protecting our Nation and every \nAmerican. But I have listened to West Virginia veterans and agree with \nthem: Our brave servicemembers who face life-and-death situations \ndeserve the most distinguished medals the U.S. military awards.\n  Again, I support the Distinguished Warfare Medal. I want to make no \nmistake about that. But I do not believe it should be given higher \nprecedence than awards for those who have faced the enemy on the \nbattlefield. Awards earned for heroism, patriotism, and a willingness \nto make the ultimate sacrifice for the freedoms we all enjoy every day \nshould not be ranked below a medal earned in relative safety.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with veterans who have expressed their \nconcerns about the precedence the Defense Department intends to give \nthe Distinguished Warfare Medal. I share their belief that combat \nawards are sacred, reflecting the special bravery of Americans who are \nwilling to sacrifice all for their country as well as their brothers \nand sisters in arms. And I join them in urging the Defense Department \nto preserve the legacy of these sacred awards by leaving their \nprecedence undisturbed.\n  I thank Secretary Hagel for his courageous military service to our \ncountry. Through his combat experience in Vietnam, he knows all too \nwell the clash and the heat of battle. He shares a special bond with \ngenerations of Americans from Concord to Kabul who have risked their \nlives in the defense of this great country, many of whom have paid the \nultimate sacrifice for our freedom. I hope, for that reason, he \nreconsiders the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal and \nagrees that combat awards should remain our military's highest honors.\n  Mr. President, thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last week, Senate Republicans were given an opportunity to \nend their partisan and wrongheaded filibuster of Caitlin Halligan to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Instead, they voted against the Federal judiciary, \nthe administration of justice, and the needs of the American people. \nThe Republican filibuster has lasted for over 2 years, in which Senate \nRepublicans have refused to vote up or down on this highly qualified \nwoman to fill a needed judgeship on the D.C. Circuit. No one can \nhonestly question whether she has the legal ability, judgment, \ncharacter, ethics, and temperament to serve on the court. The smearing \nof her distinguished record of service is deeply disappointing.\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\n  Narrow, special interest groups have misrepresented her as a partisan \nor ideological crusader. She is not. Senate Republicans attacked \nCaitlin Halligan's advocacy on behalf of her client, the State of New \nYork, with which they disagree. It is wrong and dangerous to attribute \nthe legal positions a lawyer takes when advocating for a client with \nwhat that person would do as an impartial judge. That is wrong and not \nthe American tradition. That is not what Republicans insisted was the \nstandard for nominees of Republican Presidents.\n  In a March 10 article entitled ``As Obama, Senate Collide, Courts \nCaught Short,'' The Boston Globe reported over the weekend about the \nstranglehold Senate Republicans have placed on nominations to fill \nvacancies on the D.C. Circuit. The Court is now more than one third \nvacant with 4 vacancies among its 11 authorized judgeships, in what the \nGlobe noted is ``the worst vacancy rate in its history and higher than \nany other federal circuit court nationwide.'' The article further notes \nthat the Republican filibuster of Caitlin Halligan is representative of \nwhat the Republicans have done to obstruct President Obama's nominees \nthe last 4 years. It says:\n\n       In what is a growing problem infecting the nation's federal \n     courts--both small and large, from San Francisco to \n     Allentown, Pa.--judges are taking far longer to gain approval \n     from the Senate. It's the result of a decline in decorum \n     among senators, the willingness of the Republican minority to \n     use tactics that were previously off-limits, and an overall \n     rise in partisanship. The result is that Washington gridlock \n     is resulting in docket gridlock across the country, with \n     courts not getting the judges they need as a result of \n     dysfunction in the Senate.\n\n  I agree and I hope that Senate Republicans will stop their \nobstruction of the President's judicial nominees.\n  Similarly, in a March 8 article in the New York Times, author Carl \nHulse noted that the changes made to filibusters earlier this year:\n\n     . . . have done little so far this session to curb \n     filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan and the \n     politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation votes on \n     Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator who \n     found himself on the receiving end of a Republican filibuster \n     before winning confirmation as secretary of defense.\n\n  Senate Republicans continue to abuse the nominations process by \nrefusing to give up-or-down votes to nominees. I ask unanimous consent \nto have this article printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  Also disconcerting were the comments and tweets by Republicans after \ntheir filibuster in which they gloated about payback. That, too, is \nwrong. It does our Nation and our Federal Judiciary no good when they \nplace their desire to engage in tit-for-tat over the needs of the \nAmerican people. I rejected that approach while moving to confirm 100 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and \n2002. Indeed, the filibuster of the nomination of Miguel Estrada was \ndifferent. It was to obtain access to information about his work and \nwhether he acted ideologically as his supervisor at the Office of \nSolicitor General had alleged. Had we gotten access to those materials, \nthere would have been a vote on the Estrada nomination. Republican \nSenators now demand access to all sorts of materials while \nfilibustering for the first time in our history the Secretary of \nDefense and the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, as well \nas the nominee to head the CIA and judicial nominees. They cannot do \nthat and still complain about the Estrada nomination. Nor was there any \ninformation missing in connection with the Halligan nomination. As the \ndebate showed, the opposition was fictitious.\n  Today the Senate will finally consider another circuit court \nnomination that has been needlessly stalled for 1 year. During the year \nthat Richard Taranto's nomination has been pending, two more vacancies \nhave opened up on the Federal Circuit. This judicial vacancy, now one \nof multiple vacancies on that court, has been left open for almost 3 \nyears, for no good reason.\n\n  There is simply no reason for the year-long delay of Richard Taranto. \nDuring the year since he was reported without controversy by the \nJudiciary Committee, I do not know of a single Senator who has come to \nthe floor to express any reservations about this nomination on the \nmerits. After nearly 4 years when judicial vacancies have remained near \nor above 80, hardworking Americans seeking justice deserve better.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Richard Taranto to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. He is currently a name \npartner at the Washington D.C. law firm Farr & Taranto, where he has \nspent the majority of his professional career. He previously served as \nAssistant to the Solicitor General and as a law clerk for Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor for the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Robert Bork for \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and Judge Abraham \nSofaer on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork. He is a distinguished litigator, who has filed nearly 230 Supreme \nCourt briefs in his career, and who has argued before that court 19 \ntimes. He has also argued 20 cases before the Federal Circuit, the \ncourt to which he has been nominated. He was unanimously rated ``well \nqualified'' by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, its \nhighest rating. Richard Taranto was reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout controversy in March 2012 and, again, last month.\n  The Senate will also be voting this evening on the nomination of \nAndrew Gordon to the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. He \nis currently a partner at the law firm McDonald Carano Wilson LLP in \nLas Vegas, Nevada where he has practiced since 1994. Andrew Gordon has \nthe bipartisan support of his home State Senators and he was reported \nby the Judiciary Committee 1 month ago. There are two additional \nnominees currently being stalled in Committee that would fill vacancies \non the Federal court in Nevada but Senator Heller is objecting to their \nnominations. After his obstruction of one of the nominees for more than \na year, that nominee finally asked that her nomination be withdrawn. \nShe was a very good nominee and the people of Nevada will be worse off \nfor not having her serve on that court.\n  These are only 2 of the 20 judicial nominations currently ready for \nSenate consideration and confirmation. Both of these nominees should \nhave been considered and confirmed last year. All of the 20 nominees \nnow ready for final action had to be renominated this year after being \nreturned at the end of the last Congress. The Senate should act swiftly \nto let these nominees get to work on behalf of the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[From the Caucus, The Politics and Government Blog, the New York Times, \n                             Mar. 8, 2013]\n\n          Democrats Cry Foul Over Wednesday's Other Filibuster\n\n                            (By Carl Hulse)\n\n       Senator Rand Paul may have staged a Senate-shaking \n     filibuster Wednesday, but his was actually only the second \n     most significant Republican filibuster of the day.\n       In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from \n     Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as \n     director of central intelligence over drone policy, the \n     Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. \n     Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court \n     for the District of Columbia.\n       The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn't blow up on Twitter \n     the way Mr. Paul's impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the \n     two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules \n     governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level \n     judicial nominations--an issue that has torn the chamber for \n     years.\n       Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to \n     the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead \n     set against confirming qualified Obama administration \n     nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of \n     exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a \n     filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the \n     last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.\n       That deal, crafted by the famous Gang of 14, put its \n     signatories on record as saying they would not block \n     confirmation votes on appeals court judges without \n     ``extraordinary circumstances'' as determined by each \n     individual. While only members of the gang signed it, it \n     became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had \n     Republicans threatening to execute the ``nuclear option'' and \n     bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple \n     majority vote instead of with the 67 votes historically \n     needed to change Senate rules.\n       It also led to President George W. Bush winning three \n     appointments to the appeals court often considered a feeder \n     to the Supreme Court, giving conservatives an advantage on \n     the influential panel, which hears\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\n     many federal-powers cases. In its current makeup, the court \n     consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents \n     and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four \n     vacancies--the most ever on that court.\n       In filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited \n     extraordinary circumstances arising from her earlier work as \n     the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly \n     on a case against gun manufacturers.\n       ``Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun \n     manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a \n     `public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state,'' said \n     Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on \n     the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism. \n     ``Therefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable \n     for the criminal conduct of third parties.''\n       Democrats cried foul. The real reason she was blocked, they \n     say, is that Republicans do not want to see the balance of \n     power on the D.C. appeals court shifted. They say that Ms. \n     Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the \n     State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have \n     abandoned the extraordinary circumstances test engineered by \n     the Gang of 14.\n       ``If you go back to that history of what occurred back \n     then, there is a real question of whether they have broken \n     the deal now,'' said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New \n     Mexico. ``This is a key circuit for the country. What they \n     are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to \n     get votes.''\n       Mr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer \n     members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in \n     the rules governing filibusters. One demand is that senators \n     act more like Mr. Paul, and take the floor to make their case \n     when they are trying to block a vote. In January, working to \n     avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada \n     Democrat and majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of \n     Kentucky, the Republican leader, struck a deal making some \n     modest changes in filibuster rules.\n       But those changes have done little so far this session to \n     curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan \n     and the politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation \n     votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican \n     senator who found himself on the receiving end of a \n     Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as \n     secretary of defense. The filibuster is alive and well in the \n     Senate and, as Mr. Paul showed, may even be enjoying \n     resurgence as grand theater.\n       Democrats say that despite what they see as clear \n     provocation, they are in no hurry to change the new rules \n     after just two months in place. They say they are more \n     inclined to explore new ways to confront Republicans over the \n     vacancies.\n       Mr. Udall says one option might be for the president to \n     make multiple nominations, in effect daring Republicans to \n     find ways to cite extraordinary circumstances in multiple \n     instances.\n       ``Rather than putting just one up, we should put before the \n     Senate all four and expose what is happening here,'' said Mr. \n     Udall, who acknowledged that Senate Democrats would need \n     White House cooperation.\n       ``We need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans, \n     and we are going to need the president,'' he said.\n       The fight will take time to unfold. Democrats say they will \n     wait to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court \n     nominees. But a series of filibusters against what they view \n     as acceptable nominees could quickly bring to a head the push \n     for a change in Senate rules.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Richard Gary \nTaranto, nominated to be U.S. circuit judge for the Federal Circuit. \nMr. Taranto's nomination was pending before the Senate last year. In \naccordance with Senate custom and practice, the nomination was placed \non hold, along with other circuit Judge nominations, pending the \noutcome of the 2012 Presidential election.\n  I also support the nomination of Andrew Patrick Gordon to be U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of Nevada. Mr. Gordon was nominated \nlate last year, with his hearing held in December.\n  Despite our continued cooperation with the President and Senate \nDemocrats, we continue to hear unfounded criticism.\n  For example, recently the White House posted on its Web site a \nstatement ``The rising number of judicial vacancies is a direct result \nof unprecedented delays in the Senate confirmation process.'' The \ngraphic went on to suggest that the President's nominees have to wait \nlonger for confirmation than nominees of previous Presidents. It cites \nstatistics that the President's nominees have to wait longer than \nnominees in prior administrations for floor consideration after being \nreported out of committee. There is no mention that in previous \nadministrations there was a much longer wait for committee \nconsideration. The end result, from nomination to confirmation, is \nabout the same for Obama nominees as it was for nominees submitted by \nGeorge W. Bush. There is no credible basis for alleging ``unprecedented \ndelays.''\n  President Obama is quoted as saying: ``A minority of Senators has \nsystematically and irresponsibly used procedural maneuvers to block or \ndelay confirmation votes on judicial nominees.'' Of course, President \nObama, as Senator, supported the filibuster of the nomination of Samuel \nAlito, nominated to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  A few Senate Democrats have joined this chorus, claiming that the \nrecent vote on the Halligan nomination was a violation of a Senate \nunderstanding or ``deal'' negotiated in 2005 by the so-called Gang of \n14.\n  Unfortunately, some of those Senators have no understanding of what \nhappened with Bush nominees, leading to that limited agreement. I am \nnot going to recite that history here, but the record is there for \nthose who are interested in the truth.\n  It is a stretch to say that the Gang of 14 is any kind of Senate \npolicy, informal or otherwise. It was an agreement among a few Members \nof that Congress. Most Senators who were part of that agreement no \nlonger serve in the Senate. Senators who did sign the agreement, on \nboth sides, subsequently voted against cloture on nominees--indicating \nthat the agreement was never regarded as limiting the Senate on cloture \nvotes. It is clear that agreement was limited to a small group, for a \nparticular point in time.\n  The allegation of a systematic and irresponsible use of procedural \nmaneuvers to block or delay nominations is unfounded. Senate \nRepublicans have sparingly used Senate rules. Only two nominees have \nbeen defeated by a filibuster. Compare that to the multiple filibusters \non nominees of President Bush. Ten nominees were blocked by \nfilibusters, with five ultimately being defeated.\n  The fact is, in his first term, President Obama had the highest \npercentage of circuit confirmations over the past four Presidential \nterms. With regard to district confirmations, President Obama had more \nduring the 112th Congress that in any of the previous eight Congresses, \ngoing back to 1994. So those who say that this President is being \ntreated differently either fail to recognize history or want to ignore \nthe facts or both.\n  A second prong of this debate concerns the vacancy rate in the \nFederal judiciary. Blaming judicial vacancies on the Senate \nconfirmation process is unfounded and a distortion of the process. The \ngrowth in vacancies is the result of a failure in the White House to \nsend nominations to the Senate. Presently, 55 of the 87 vacancies--63 \npercent--have no nominee. For the 30 vacancies categorized as \n``judicial emergencies,'' only 9 have a nominee. This has been a \npattern through most of the Obama Presidency.\n  Senators who suggest that Republican Senators are blocking all four \nvacancies on the DC Circuit should understand that two of those \nvacancies have no nominee. A Senator who suggests as a strategy to \n``put before the Senate all four and expose what is happening'' must \nfirst talk to the White House about the lack of nominees.\n  With regard to today's nominations, I would like to say a few words \nabout the nominees. I expect they will be approved, and congratulate \neach on his confirmation.\n  Richard Gary Taranto is nominated to be U.S. circuit judge for the \nFederal Circuit. After graduating from Yale Law School in 1981, Mr. \nTaranto held several judicial clerkships. First, he served as a law \nclerk for Judge Abraham Sofaer on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York. From 1982 to 1983, he clerked for Judge \nRobert Bork on the DC Circuit. Finally, he clerked for Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor from 1983 to 1984.\n  After completing his clerkship with Justice O'Connor, Mr. Taranto \nworked as an associate with Onek, Klein & Farr. He also served for a \nfew months in the spring of 1986 as a legal consultant to the Secretary \nof State's Advisory Committee on South Africa.\n  Beginning in the summer of 1986, he joined the U.S. Department of \nJustice Solicitor General's Office serving as an assistant to the \nSolicitor General. In 1989, he returned to the private sector as a \npartner in his old firm of Onek, Klein, & Farr, which soon after became \nFarr & Taranto. From 1989 to the late 1990s, his practice was heavily \nfocused on the Supreme Court. He wrote briefs\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\nand argued cases on a wide variety of topics, including constitutional \nlaw, bankruptcy, patent, trademark, Federal procedure, antitrust, and \ncopyright issues.\n  In 1997, the focus of his practice shifted to handling patent appeals \nbefore the Federal Circuit. Before the Federal Circuit, he has \nrepresented patent holders and patent defendants across a variety of \ntechnology areas. He has experience with cases concerning international \ntrade, government contracts, and money claims against the United \nStates, all within the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. Taranto has argued 19 cases in the Supreme Court; 8 while in the \nSolicitor General's Office and 11 cases in private practice. He has \nalso presented approximately 20 arguments in the Federal Circuit and \nappeared on briefs in a few others. He has also argued cases before the \nFirst, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and DC Circuits. The \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \ngave him a unanimous well qualified rating.\n  Andrew Patrick Gordon is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Nevada. Mr. Gordon received a B.A. from Claremont McKenna \nCollege in 1984, graduating cum laude. In 1987, Gordon graduated from \nHarvard Law School. Upon graduation, he joined Streich, Lang, Weeks, \nand Cardon in Phoenix, AZ. In 1992, he moved to Las Vegas, NV, where he \nassisted Streich Lang to expand into the Las Vegas market through an \naffiliate of the firm, Dawson and Associates. In 1994, he lateraled to \nMcDonald Carano Wilson LLP, working as an associate until 1997, when he \nbecame a partner. He remains with McDonald Carano Wilson to this day.\n  Mr. Gordon's law experience is mostly in civil litigation in the \nareas of business, real property, construction, and employment. From \n1997 to 2004, his practice centered on litigation arising from \ncommercial construction projects. Over the last 10 years, he has become \nmore active in arbitration and mediation. Additionally, Mr. Gordon has \nsat on numerous committees of the Nevada State Bar, the U.S. District \nCourt of Nevada, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nHe has tried at least nine cases to final judgment. The American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a \nrating of substantial majority well qualified--minority qualified.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that we have \nconfirmed a couple of judges. We have judges all over this country, \nnominees waiting to be confirmed and judicial emergencies all over the \ncountry, so I hope this is a start of a new day. We will see what \nhappens.\n  Mr. President, I stand here as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to talk about one of the greatest threats facing our \nNation; that is, climate change, dangerous climate change, or you could \ncall it climate disruption. It seems as though the only people who do \nnot get it are Members of Congress. They do not get it.\n  Last week I talked about a front page story in USA TODAY that \nhighlighted the impacts of climate change unfolding around us. The \nstory I talked about is the first of a yearlong series called ``Why you \nshould sweat climate change.'' Everyone else is sweating about it but \nnot here, not in this Senate, not in this Congress.\n  Since last week, additional information concerning climate change has \nbeen released that I want to talk about today. I want to build a record \nin this Senate on an issue that threatens the very lives of our \ngrandchildren. It is hard to imagine that this country is facing a \nquestion of our own survival and so few people seem to care about it.\n  I am going to talk about another report. A study published last week \nin Science reports that average global temperatures were higher in the \npast decade than over most of the previous 11,300 years. Let me repeat \nthat. Let me repeat that for any colleagues who might be listening. \nAverage global temperatures were higher in the past decade than over \nmost of the previous 11,300 years. Yet the Senate does very little.\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n  Senator Sanders and I have a bill--a very important bill--to put a \nprice on the pollution that is causing the climate to be disrupted and \nto change. Let me say that we do not have a slew of sponsors.\n  The lead author of the study in this Science report said average \nglobal temperatures were higher in the past decade than most of the \nprevious 11,300 years. He is a paleoclimatologist at Oregon State \nUniversity. Here is what he said:\n\n       What's different is the rate of change. . . . What we've \n     seen over the past 150 years is much greater than anything we \n     saw in the past 11,000.\n\n  That is Shaun Marcott, Ph.D., the lead author of the study.\n  Some people may ask, why is this study important? What does it mean \nfor our kids? What does it mean to our grandkids? Let's go to the \nquote.\n\n       If the scientists' forecasts are correct, the planet will \n     be warmer in 2100 than it has been for 11,300 years.\n\n  The scientific evidence continues to mount. Study after study has \nconcluded that the planet is warming and the impacts have already \nstarted. Yet the only place that doesn't seem to get this message is \nright here in Washington, DC--not at the White House; they get it. \nPresident Obama understands it. That is why he worked with us to \nincrease fuel economy, to keep that carbon pollution from automobiles \nout of the air, and we are moving to a 55-miles-per-gallon standard.\n  That is going to help, but that is not enough. We need to put a price \non pollution so polluters turn away from dirty energy and turn toward \nclean energy. That will save us from most of the ravages of the \nchanging climate. But the window is closing on the timeframe because \nimpacts have already started. Another study released last week by the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, found there was \na dramatic jump in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air in 2012. It \nwas the second highest increase since 1959, when record-keeping began.\n  The increase in carbon in the air is yet another signal that \nscientists' predictions about climate change and climate disruption--\nthose predictions are coming true. We have already seen the devastating \nand far-reaching consequences of unchecked climate disruption in the \nextreme weather events.\n  The Government Accountability Office--the GAO; they are not partisan, \nand they are not ideological--recently released a report entitled \n``2013 High Risk List'' that discusses how climate disruption and \nextreme weather events threaten our Nation. This is the Government \nAccountability Office. We, the taxpayers, support the Government \nAccountability Office. They are nonpartisan, and they are straight-\nfrom-the-shoulder analysts. They say:\n\n       Climate change could threaten coastal areas with rising sea \n     levels, alter agricultural productivity, and increase the \n     intensity and frequency of severe weather events such as \n     floods, drought, and hurricanes.''\n\n  I guess they look out their window in addition to looking at the \nnumbers. Anyone who looked out their window who lives in the area of \nSuperstorm Sandy understands this.\n  Climate change could threaten our coastal areas--it is already doing \nit. I don't know if anybody saw those homes being removed from a beach \nin Massachusetts--gorgeous homes. They were there for a while--gone, \nbecause the ocean was going to envelope them.\n  According to the GAO, extreme weather events have cost the Nation \ntens of billions of dollars already, just over the past decade. As \nthese extreme weather events increase, so will the cost to American \ntaxpayers. This is more from the Government Accountability Office. This \nis not from the EPA. This is not from NOAA. This is not from Barbara \nBoxer. This is not from Bernie Sanders. This is not from Sheldon \nWhitehouse. This is not from the Environment Committee. This is from \nthe GAO.\n\n       [T]he impacts and costliness of weather disasters--\n     resulting from floods, drought, and other events such as \n     tropical cyclones--will increase in significance as what are \n     considered ``rare'' events become more common and intense due \n     to climate change.\n\n  When I started in this work a very long time ago, we talked about the \n100-year flood, and we could protect ourselves against the 100-year \nflood. Now--as Governor Cuomo has stated so eloquently--we are seeing \nthe 100-year flood every couple of years. Now taxpayers are on the hook \ndue to extreme weather events such as Superstorm Sandy and because the \nFederal Government owns buildings across the Nation and insures \nproperty and crops and provides disaster assistance.\n  Let's see what else the GAO says:\n\n       Climate change . . . impacts pose significant financial \n     risks for the federal government--\n\n  Which, by the way, means us, the taxpayers--\n\n     which owns extensive infrastructure, insures property through \n     federal flood and crop insurance programs, provides technical \n     assistance to state and local governments, and provides \n     emergency aid in response to natural disasters.\n\n  So our Federal finances are significantly at risk.\n\n       [T]here is a growing recognition that the cost of inaction \n     could be greater and--given the government's precarious \n     fiscal position--increasingly difficult to manage given \n     expected budget pressures.\n\n  We are going to see a couple of different budgets emerge--one from \nthe Democrats in the Senate and one from the Republicans in the House--\nand they will have different visions for America. One budget, the \nDemocratic budget, is going to get to a deficit reduction, but it will \ninvest in our people. It will say to the very wealthiest: You have to \ndo your share so our kids can go to Head Start, get their education, \njob training, and clean up the environment.\n  The other budget is going to be hurtful. It is going to be painful \nbecause the other budget--the Republican budget--is going to protect \nand defend one group of people in this country, which is the wealthy \nfew. Therefore, we will not have the resources to do what we have to \ndo, and we are going to see cutbacks in the areas that we need in order \nto make sure we plan for this extreme weather and make sure we can \navert this climate disruption by investing in clean energy.\n  The GAO report is clear: Unchecked climate change comes at a very \nhigh price, but that is what is happening in this Congress. The \nPresident is doing his best. Some of us over here are pushing hard. In \nthe House they passed a bill. We fell short because of a filibuster. We \nhad 54 votes, and we needed 60 votes. As a result, a price on carbon \nnever happened, and now we are seeing hotter days, a hotter climate, \nand more severe, extreme weather. We need to take these steps. We need \nto make these investments. As these budgets come down, let's take a \nlook.\n  I can assure everyone that when we have a travesty and tragedy such \nas Superstorm Sandy, we are never going to turn away from our people \nwhether it happens to your State, Mr. President, due to a severe \ndrought or certain types of pests that arise because of a change in the \nweather. We know such events happen. It is happening all over the \ncountry, and it can happen anywhere.\n  There is extreme weather where we have fires and droughts. We have \nsnow when we never expect it, torrents of rain that we cannot even \nbelieve is happening, not to mention these high temperatures. We owe it \nto our children and our grandchildren not to turn away.\n  Now, let's see what else the GAO tells us. This is a call from them \nto us. Is anybody listening? Is anybody who gets to vote in this Senate \nlistening?\n  The GAO calls for ``a government-wide strategic approach with strong \nleadership and the authority to manage climate change risks that \nencompasses the entire range of related federal activities and \naddresses all key elements of strategic planning.''\n  That is a lot of words for something so simple. What the GAO is \nsaying to us is, you guys better act because this thing is getting out \nof control. Every time I get a chance on a Monday evening, I intend to \ncome down to the Senate floor and take a few minutes to build a case--\nand I hope an indisputable one--that we put a price on carbon pollution \njust like we made sure other pollution had a price on it. It didn't \nmatter if it was a regulatory price or if they had to go buy scrubbers \nto keep dangerous pollutants out of the air. Carbon pollution is \ndangerous. It is putting our people at risk, but no one would know it \nfrom what is happening around here.\n  I want to close by thanking my colleague Bernie Sanders, with whom I \nam so proud to serve. I am the chairman of the Environment Committee,\n\n[[Page S1285]]\n\nand he is a great member. Together we have come up with an excellent \nbill. The bill takes the proceeds of that carbon tax and invests it in \nour people, invests in clean energy, makes sure our middle class and \nworking poor have the funds they need to pay the higher prices of \nelectricity in the early years, and it will create jobs.\n  There is no question as far as what is happening to our coastal \nStates. There is no question as far as what is happening to our farms. \nThere is no question as to what is happening to our natural resources. \nThere is no question what is happening to our species. Scientists \npredict that 50 percent of God's species will be gone if we do nothing.\n  When people stand here and laugh off this notion that we are facing \nsevere climate change, I tell them: Look at some of the church groups \nwho are supporting us. They have come together. They are with us. They \nunderstand that God's creation is at stake. There is no doubt about it.\n  We are the stewards of this environment. We are the ones who are \nsupposed to protect it. Yet in this Senate, it is shrugged off as if it \nis a nothing burger. There are young people who are here whose future \nis at stake. They want to enjoy the same opportunities my generation \nenjoyed. We owe it to them to do better.\n  This nonpartisan GAO report tells us clearly that we better have a \n``government-wide strategic approach with strong leadership.'' I have \nto say I hope we have more people on this floor who will show that kind \nof leadership because the clock is ticking.\n  I say to every Member here--we have old ones, young ones, and middle \nones: You are here at the moment that we can do something. You are here \nat the moment we can still do something. The Bush administration wasted \n8 years by going to the courts and arguing that the Clean Air Act did \nnot cover carbon pollution. They did nothing for 8 years. Finally, the \nSupreme Court ruled 5 to 4 and said: Yes, of course, it covers carbon \npollution. God bless the Obama administration for moving forward in \nevery way they can--unfortunately, without us at this point.\n  We will be judged harshly if we turn away. We are here now. We didn't \nchoose this time to be born. We didn't choose the fact that this is an \nissue that is upon us. I don't know what is going to wake up this \nplace, but I am going to do my best to ring the bell as often as I can.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1285-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1285-S1286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF JAPAN'S TSUNAMI\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, today is the second anniversary of a \nvery tragic event in Japan. An earthquake--a tsunami--claimed nearly \n16,000 lives and destroyed community infrastructure, homes, and \nlivelihoods. Years after the fact, our prayers remain with the people \nof Japan for the lives which were lost and for the devastation that \noccurred within that country.\n  I had an opportunity to be in Japan in January. I had a chance to see \nfor myself some of the devastation that Japan still faces 2 years after \nthe 3/11 tsunami and earthquake. The pictures that so many of us recall \nof the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor. We all watched with great \nconcern as the accident in front of us unfolded. It was truly a sense \nof helplessness that was brought about by an act of nature. A massive \nearthquake which delivered a massive wave which truly brought about \nmassive destruction.\n  I also had an opportunity--after viewing the Fukushima Daiichi \nreactor--to travel north to a small fishing village by the name of \nRikuzentakata. It was a community of about 23,000 people. That \ncommunity alone lost over 1,900 residents who were swept out to sea--\nincluding an Alaskan teacher, Mr. Monty Dickson, whose life was lost. \nTo be in this fishing village 2 years after the fact and see how this \ncommunity is trying to regain its footing--not only economically but \nemotionally--was quite compelling. Again, Japan is dealing with the \naftermath of this destruction in ways those of us here probably cannot \nappreciate.\n  From an energy perspective, the country of Japan--literally \novernight--went from a nation where close to 30 percent of their energy \nwas generated by nuclear to a point where the nuclear power that was \ngenerated was truly just shut down as everything was on pause for that \nnation. How a nation rearranges its energy portfolio is a situation \nthat country is dealing with as we speak.\n  There were connections between Japan and the tsunami that I think are \nstill being felt today. When that tsunami hit, the people of Alaska \nwere on alert on our coastlines. They were waiting and wondering \nwhether we would be impacted by the giant wave that had taken the lives \nof so many thousands of Japanese. Well, we didn't see the big wave, but \nwhat we did see--and what we are continuing to see--is a level of \nmarine debris that has been carried across the currents from Japan and \nthe Pacific Ocean to Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington State, \nBritish Columbia, and then circling all along the coastline of my State \nof Alaska.\n  It is estimated that there is about 1.5 million tons of debris that \nis floating in the ocean. It was estimated by the Japanese Ministry of \nthe Environment that there were 5 million tons of debris that washed \ninto the ocean. They further estimated that 70 percent of that debris \nsank near the coast of Japan soon after the event. This is something \nthe Japanese fishermen were greatly concerned and worried about.\n  What we are seeing now--as the floating debris moves its way across \nthe currents--is debris on the shoreline of Alaska in surprising \nquantities. The picture behind me is some of the debris. There is roof \nof a house, the bottom of a boat, and buoys. It is just a floating mass \nof debris in the middle of the Pacific. This is just an example of some \nof what we have seen over the course of 2 years now.\n  Sometimes the sightings are pretty phenomenal, such as this picture \nwhich was off the Oregon coast. This is actually a concrete dock that \nfloated all the way across the ocean from Japan and landed on the coast \nof Oregon.\n  I have sons who are commercial fishermen. They spend their summers \nout on the water. We worry about obstacles in the water that our \nfishing vessels could encounter. Running into a concrete dock is not \nsomething any mariner would want to do. So we think that 2 years after \nthe fact we should have seen most of the debris we would anticipate. In \nfact, the vast majority is still coming our way.\n  These are buoys along the Alaskan shore. This was taken on Montague \nIsland which is just off Kodiak Island. Not all these buoys are \nnecessarily from Japan. Some are just the general marine debris that we \nsee. But what we have been able to determine is that the Japanese buoys \nare coming across. Those things that are sitting higher up on the water \nare moving more quickly, but things that are just below the water \nsurface are still on their way.\n  How do we deal with all this? How do we reach the beaches, whether it \nis the beaches in Oregon, California, Hawaii or Alaska? In Alaska, we \nhave 44,000 miles of coastline. That is a lot of territory for debris \nto come up on, and in so much of this area in my State, these beaches \nare not accessible by vehicle. They are not accessible by road. It is \nextraordinarily difficult to deal with the cleanup.\n  This is a picture of marine debris cleanup in a community by the name \nof Yakutat, a small fishing village along the coast. What they are \nfinding is that as the community volunteers go out and clean what \nbeaches they can, they have no space in their small landfills there to \naccommodate the debris. So it would be one thing if we knew this was \nall we were going to be dealing with. Our reality is we know more is \ncoming.\n  How we respond is going to be key. It is going to be critical to the \ncommunities that are impacted. But for so many of these areas where \nthere are no individuals to see this, there are none to appreciate what \nhas happened, but still we are faced with Styrofoam, plastics, nets--\nincredible amounts of nets--things that will not only foul the beaches \nbut foul the animals that may be in the area. We have a responsibility \nto act. So how do we do it? How do we do it at a time of difficult \nbudgets? We all appreciate that. It requires a level of creativity, if \nyou will--partnerships with local and government officials. It requires \nus to be proactive in terms of what is coming to our shores.\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n  We have asked the White House to assist with a debris cleanup task \nforce to get all the agencies that are involved--State, tribal, \nFederal--to be participants in how we address these issues.\n  The Government of Japan last year stepped forward and provided $5 \nmillion to the affected States, plus an additional $1 million to \nCanada--they were not obligated to provide the money for an effort to \nhelp us address the cleanups. What we need to do in this country--\nagain, we have asked the White House to establish this interagency task \nforce to deal with the debris that continues to come to our shore is to \ndetermine how we engage, how we are working together to help make a \ndifference. That is going to be critical. We also don't want to forget \nthe private interests that are potentially engaged in the cleanup. We \nhave so many different interests, so many different industries, and \nprivate citizens who are so dependent on our navigable waterways, our \nhealthy ecosystems. What we need is good communication and good \nleadership. We need a plan to guide the interagency and the public-\nprivate partnership approach to solving the challenge. I commend the \nNOAA Marine Debris Program for their coordination and their response to \nthe work. The fact is they are small. They are overtasked. They need \nthe help of their Federal partners to address this as a national \npriority.\n  So as we continue to see increased levels of debris coming over after \nthe tsunami, it is imperative we act to address it.\n  It has been interesting in the Alaska press because there have been \nongoing stories about the connections. We think Japan is thousands of \nmiles away and we don't have that connection. Beachcombers found a \nsoccer ball with the name of a Japanese boy--a 16-year-old boy and his \nphone number--and were able to make that call back to the village of \nRikuzentakata and tell that young man, whose family lost everything in \nthe tsunami, that we have your soccer ball here. It made it to the \nshore of Middleton Island in Alaska. But for that young man to have \nbeen delivered that soccer ball, after everything else he and his \nfamily owned had been wiped out, was a reminder that we are all \nconnected and how we can be working together to help one another.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this news story from the Anchorage \nDaily News printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  In Alaska, we have a lot of experience with helping our neighbors \nout. We will continue to work to address the issues, work to address \nthe debris that is reaching our shore, but we do need a little bit of \nhelp from our government. We need a little bit of help when it comes to \nadvancing this interagency task force so we can address what we are \nseeing in Alaska, what we are seeing on our coastline in the Pacific \nNorthwest and in Hawaii as well.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Mar. 9, 2013]\n\n           2 years After Japan Tsunami, Debris Spreads in US\n\n                  (By Becky Bohrer--Associated Press)\n\n       Juneau, AK.--Two years ago, the yellow buoy was hanging as \n     part of a restaurant sign in the coastal community of \n     Minamisanriku in northern Japan when an earthquake triggered \n     a tsunami and washed it--and so much more--out to sea.\n       About a year later, the buoy was found more than 3,000 \n     miles away on a remote Alaska island, discovered by an avid \n     beachcomber who, through sheer coincidence, was later able to \n     find the owner, who had lost her home and business. Hundreds \n     of similar buoys have been found on beaches along the West \n     Coast, a combination of the everyday trash that has plagued \n     coastal areas for years and debris washed away by the March \n     11, 2011 disaster.\n       Distinguishing between the two is difficult. Just 21 items \n     from among the more than 1,500 reports of possible tsunami \n     debris have been firmly traced back to the tsunami, according \n     to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n       The confirmed items include several derelict vessels, \n     including a small boat found in Hawaii waters, large docks \n     that have washed ashore in Washington state and Oregon and a \n     motorcycle that washed ashore off the coast of British \n     Columbia.\n       These are items that tend to have unique markings--names of \n     people and places, registration numbers or other identifying \n     information. The agency lists scores of other items along the \n     West Coast and across the Pacific Ocean as potentially linked \n     to the catastrophe.\n       The Japanese government estimated 1.5 million tons of \n     debris was floating in the ocean in the immediate aftermath \n     of the disaster, which devastated a long stretch of Japan's \n     northeastern coast and killed thousands of people. But it's \n     not clear how much is still out there or what might reach \n     U.S. shores. NOAA has said the debris is spread over an area \n     roughly three times the size of the contiguous United States, \n     and that beachgoers may notice an increase in debris ``over \n     many years,'' in addition to what normally washes up.\n       Beachcombing on Middleton Island, in the northern Gulf of \n     Alaska, has long been a favorite pastime for radar technician \n     David Baxter and some of his colleagues. In early 2012, there \n     had been talk about finding tsunami debris--``a wall with a \n     safe in it or a briefcase of money, we'd always joke about \n     that''--but Baxter said he didn't think it was realistic he'd \n     find anything related to the tsunami, given models he'd seen \n     at the time that suggested the debris would move much further \n     south.\n       Then, in February 2012, a co-worker found a soccer ball. \n     Baxter subsequently found another soccer ball--a discovery \n     that made international headlines as one of the first \n     identifiable pieces of debris to wash up--a volleyball and \n     the buoy.\n       The buoy stood out to Baxter as a bit different from other \n     buoys that have washed up. For example, it was hard, not \n     inflatable, and had writing on it. By chance, when a Japanese \n     film crew was visiting him and his wife after the discovery \n     of the soccer ball, they panned on other items he'd found, \n     including the buoy, he said. A friend of the restaurant's \n     owner, Sakiko Miura, happened to recognize it, and the owner \n     later confirmed it was hers through a photo sent by Baxter.\n       FedEx, which flies regularly between Anchorage and Tokyo, \n     volunteered to return items including the balls found by \n     Baxter and the buoy last June. The team traveled by plane to \n     Tokyo and then by train to outlying communities, hand-\n     delivering the items, spokeswoman Sharon Young said.\n       ``It was a wonderful experience, to reunite people with \n     things that meant a lot to them and that survived this \n     incredibly devastating situation.'' she said Friday.\n       Baxter and his wife were recently able to talk to Miura, \n     who said she plans to rebuild. He said he found the owner of \n     the soccer ball his colleague found, an 8-year-old, and plans \n     to return it this summer.\n       Baxter said he can't help but be affected by what he's \n     found. He wife is Japanese and he said he has visited the \n     nation several times. But it's more than that.\n       ``I wonder all the time, when you see (things) if the \n     person was in the house, if they survived,'' he said, adding \n     later: ``Of course, when I see the housing insulation and \n     household items, shampoo bottles, shaving cream bottles with \n     Japanese writing on them, yeah, it hurts a little.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1286-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1286-S1287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      STRAW PURCHASING OF FIREARMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week I introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with Senator Collins to combat the straw purchasing and \ntrafficking of firearms. We were joined by other Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. We have made good progress since then. Last \nThursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted for our bill as an \namendment to the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, S. 54. This \nis the first legislative vote on measures related to gun violence in \neither the Senate or the House since the Newtown tragedy. Every \nDemocratic Senator on the Committee voted in favor of our bill and we \nwere joined in that support by the Committee's ranking Republican, \nSenator Grassley. I appreciate Senator Grassley's cooperation in \ngetting our bill reported after weeks of consultation and I look \nforward to working closely with him as we move forward.\n  The White House called the Judiciary Committee action ``an important \nbipartisan step'' that takes on ``the very serious problem of gun \ntrafficking.'' At the signing of the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct last Thursday, the President called the Judiciary Committee's \naction on our bill a ``big step'' and ``real progress.'' He noted that \nour bill ``would crack down on folks who buy guns only to turn around \nand funnel them to dangerous criminals.''\n  I want to continue to make progress on this legislation and other \nbills that can be effective in reducing illegal gun violence in our \ncountry. We have the strong support of several leading law enforcement \norganizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, the FBI Agents \nAssociation, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, and\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\nthe National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Last \nweek I received a letter from the NAACP lending their strong support to \nour efforts. I thank all of these organizations for their assistance \nand support.\n  Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will continue its work on three \nremaining gun violence measures that have been on our agenda for the \npast weeks: Senator Schumer's proposal to expand requirements for \nbackground checks, Senator Boxer's proposal to enhance the safety of \nour schools, and Senator Feinstein's bill to reinstitute an assault \nweapons ban. I aim by the end of the week to have completed Judiciary \nCommittee action on these legislative proposals.\n  At the bill signing last Thursday, the President observed that we \nwere able finally to pass the Violence Against Women and Trafficking \nVictims Protection legislation on a bipartisan basis because the \nAmerican people spoke up. That is what happened on VAWA when a group of \nHouse Republicans switched their position to support passing the VAWA \nbill that they had not supported last year.\n  That is what is also needed in the context of gun violence \nlegislation. Seven of the eight Republican Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee voted against closing the loophole in the law to combat straw \npurchasing and gun trafficking. If we are going to be able to close \nloopholes in our background check system, improve school safety with \nmore resources for resource officers that include counselors and \nofficers, and if we are going to outlaw straw purchasing and gun \ntrafficking, the American people need to speak up and be heard. If \nCongress is going to place limits on high capacity clips, it will be \nbecause the American people demand such action.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 517 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1287-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1287-S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONSOLIDATED AND FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

While repeating some report language for \n     emphasis, these recommendations do not intend to negate the \n     language referred to above unless expressly provided herein.\n       In cases in which the House or the Senate have directed the \n     submission of a report, such report is to be submitted to \n     both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no \n     later than sixty days after enactment, unless otherwise \n     directed.\n       Hereafter, in Division A, the term `the Committees' refers \n     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n\n                     TITLE I--AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS\n\n                  Production, Processing and Marketing\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)\n\n       The recommendation includes $46,388,000 for the Office of \n     the Secretary. The following offices are included within the \n     Office of the Secretary: the immediate Office of the \n     Secretary; Office of Tribal Relations; Office of Homeland \n     Security and Emergency Coordination; Office of Advocacy and \n     Outreach; Office of Assistant Secretary for Administration; \n     Departmental Administration; Office of Assistant Secretary \n     for Congressional Relations; and Office of Communications. \n     The National Appeals Division, the Office of the General \n     Counsel, and the Office of Ethics are funded in separate \n     accounts.\n       The recommendation includes a general provision that \n     requires the Secretary to submit spending plans to the \n     Committees within 30 days of enactment.\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n\n                         [Dollars in thousands]\n\nOffice of the Secretary (immediate)..............................$5,051\nOffice of Tribal Relations..........................................498\nOffice of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination............1,496\nOffice of Advocacy and Outreach...................................1,422\nOffice of Assistant Secretary for Administration....................804\nDepartmental Administration......................................24,242\nOffice of Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations.........3,869\nOffice of Communications..........................................9,006\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n  Total, Office of the Secretary................................$46,388\n       Reports requested by the House and Senate Appropriations \n     Committees are an important part of the Committees' oversight \n     responsibilities. There is concern about the Department's \n     delinquency in completing these reports. There is also \n     concern that the delay is due to excessively long reviews, \n     especially in the Office of the Secretary. The reports are \n     due on the dates specified in the House or Senate reports or \n     herein. Each agency of the Department is directed to comply \n     with the deadlines and to cooperate fully with the Office of \n     Budget and Program Analysis in providing these reports. It is \n     noted that the Committees reserve the right to call before \n     them any agency that does not submit its reports by the \n     specified due date.\n       Any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of \n     State offices scheduled for 2013 and subsequent years is \n     subject to the reprogramming procedures in section 726 of \n     this Act.\n       The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to advise the \n     Committees, through the Office of Budget and Program \n     Analysis, of the status of all reports requested of the \n     Department at the time of submission of the fiscal year 2014 \n     budget and monthly thereafter. All correspondence related to \n     the directives must be addressed to the Committees.\n       The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been \n     without a permanent Chief Financial Officer since November \n     2009. With its substantial loan portfolios, potential for \n     improper payments in mandatory programs, and history of \n     uneven financial audits, the necessity for a full complement \n     of senior USDA financial leaders is evident. The Secretary is \n     directed to submit a report to the Committees detailing how \n     the Department plans to expeditiously recruit and fill this \n     vacancy with a permanent Chief Financial Officer. The \n     Secretary is reminded of the statutory requirements of 31 \n     U.S.C. 901 and 902.\n\n                          Executive Operations\n\n\n                     OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ECONOMIST\n\n       The recommendation includes $16,008,000 for the Office of \n     the Chief Economist.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL APPEALS DIVISION\n\n       The recommendation includes $14,225,000 for the National \n     Appeals Division.\n\n\n                 OFFICE OF BUDGET AND PROGRAM ANALYSIS\n\n       The recommendation includes $9,049,000 for the Office of \n     Budget and Program Analysis.\n\n                Office of the Chief Information Officer\n\n       The recommendation includes $44,031,000 for the Office of \n     the Chief Information Officer.\n\n                 Office of the Chief Financial Officer\n\n       The recommendation includes $6,247,000 for the Office of \n     the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n           Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights\n\n       The recommendation includes $893,000 for the Office of the \n     Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\n                         Office of Civil Rights\n\n       The recommendation includes $22,692,000 for the Office of \n     Civil Rights.\n\n        Agriculture Buildings and Facilities and Rental Payments\n\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)\n\n       The recommendation includes $271,336,000 for Agriculture \n     Buildings and Facilities and Rental Payments. The \n     recommendation includes $175,694,000 for rental payments; \n     $13,473,000 for Department of Homeland Security building \n     security; and $82,169,000 for building operations and \n     maintenance.\n       The recommendation includes a one-time increase above the \n     budget request of $30,000,000 for building operations and \n     maintenance. This increase is provided for high priority \n     projects in the Whitten and South Buildings, addressing first \n     those projects addressing life and safety issues.\n\n                     Hazardous Materials Management\n\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)\n\n       The recommendation includes $3,992,000 for Hazardous \n     Materials Management.\n\n                      Office of Inspector General\n\n       The recommendation includes $89,016,000 for the Office of \n     Inspector General.\n\n                     Office of the General Counsel\n\n       The recommendation includes $45,074,000 for the Office of \n     the General Counsel.\n\n                            Office of Ethics\n\n       The recommendation includes $3,405,000 for the Office of \n     Ethics.\n\n  Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics\n\n       The recommendation includes $893,000 for the Office of the \n     Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics.\n       The Under Secretary is encouraged to evaluate and adjust \n     efforts to identify methods of preventing and controlling \n     tomato diseases affecting tomato growers nationwide.\n\n                       Economic Research Service\n\n       The recommendation includes $77,397,000 for the Economic \n     Research Service.\n\n                National Agricultural Statistics Service\n\n       The recommendation includes $179,477,000 for the National \n     Agricultural Statistics Service. This includes $62,500,000 \n     for the Census of Agriculture.\n\n                     Agricultural Research Service\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       The recommendation includes $1,101,853,000 for the \n     Agricultural Research Service, Salaries and Expenses. The \n     recommendation does not concur with the President's budget \n     request regarding the termination of extramural research \n     projects or the closure of six research laboratories. It is \n     expected that the Agricultural Research Service will allocate \n     the resources provided to the highest priority research and \n     utilize existing processes consistent with the reprogramming \n     requirements of this Act to notify the Committees of any \n     changes from the previous fiscal year. The recommendation \n     also includes funding requested for repair and maintenance \n     and for the National Agricultural Library.\n       There remains concern about the high rates of obesity in \n     this country. Research into human nutrition is important to \n     help prevent childhood obesity and the medical issues obesity \n     brings. In addition, there is strong evidence that nutrition \n     plays a vital role in how a person ages, but more research in \n     this area is needed. Therefore, the Agricultural Research \n     Service is encouraged to continue research relating to \n     childhood and adult obesity as well as the impact of \n     nutrition on aging.\n\n               National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n\n\n                   RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES\n\n       The recommendation includes $738,638,000 for the National \n     Institute of Food and Agriculture's research and education \n     activities.\n       The Department is directed to include in the fiscal year \n     2014 budget request funding levels proposed to be allocated \n     to and the expected publication date, scope, and allocation \n     level for each request for awards to be published under (1) \n     each priority area specified in section 2(b)(2) of the \n     Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 450i(b)(2)); (2) each research and extension project \n     carried out under section 1621(a) of the Food, Agriculture, \n     Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5811(a)); (3) \n     each grant awarded under section 1672B(a) of the Food, \n     Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. \n     5925b(a)); (4) each research, education, and extension \n     project carried out under section 406 of the Research Reform \n     Act of 1998 (7 U.S.C. 7626); and (5) each research and \n     extension project carried out under section 412 of the \n     Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of \n     1998 (7 U.S.C. 7632). The term 'request for awards' means a \n     funding announcement published by NIFA that provides detailed \n     information on funding opportunities at the Institute, \n     including the purpose, eligibility, restrictions, focus \n     areas, evaluation criteria, regulatory information, and \n     instructions on how to apply for such opportunities.\n       There is recognition of the broad responsibilities in \n     agricultural research, education, extension, and economics \n     that Congress has given to NIFA, and NIFA is directed to \n     prioritize funding for the highest quality, peer-reviewed and \n     relevant research.\n       The following table reflects the recommended amounts:\n\n    NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION\n

The increase above \n     the President's budget request supports equine veterinary \n     medicine and related expenses.\n       The recommendation includes increased funding for the \n     animal disease traceability system within the Animal Health \n     Technical Services line item. The Agency is encouraged to \n     produce the most cost-effective, least burdensome regulatory \n     system in the final rule. APHIS is directed to continue to \n     submit quarterly reports (by March 31, 2013; June 30, 2013; \n     and September 30, 2013) to the Committees with specific cost \n     information, assessments of progress, and any deviations from \n     the scheduled completion dates.\n       There is concern about APHIS's increased responsibility of \n     managing and enforcing the importation of illegally harvested \n     plants, especially when such activities fall outside of the \n     Agency's primary mission to protect and promote the health \n     and welfare of U.S. plants and animals. The Secretary is \n     directed to provide the Committees with a report detailing \n     the current responsibilities, activities, expenditures, and \n     future plans of all agencies involved with the 2008 Farm Bill \n     provisions that amended the Lacey Act. Until such report is \n     received, APHIS may not spend more on the Lacey Act \n     amendments than was spent in fiscal year 2012.\n       The National Clean Plant Network is instrumental in \n     ensuring that nurseries can provide safe, virus-free plant \n     materials to orchards, vineyards, and other growers. There is \n     recognition of the value of continued research to improve \n     detection and eradication of viruses, and the Department is \n     encouraged to continue its work on this important

USDA's April 2012 report \n     entitled ``National Survey of WIC Participants II--Volume 2'' \n     addressed this issue, but noted that additional follow-up \n     information is needed. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) \n     is directed to provide a report to the Committees within 60 \n     days of enactment of this Act detailing what variables each \n     State uses in determining income and ways in which USDA could \n     work to ensure income eligibility uniformity. The report \n     should specify what changes, if any, could be accomplished \n     administratively and which would require changes to existing \n     law to ensure income eligibility uniformity.\n       In fulfilling the report on WIC food cost management as \n     requested in the House Committee report, USDA is directed to \n     include the following analyses of: (1) States whose costs for \n     WIC foods are significantly higher when purchased by WIC than \n     those same foods when purchased outside of the WIC program; \n     (2) vendor-group average costs to understand whether the \n     types of abuses and vendor management issues cited in the \n     House report are a systemic issue and ways to manage these \n     specific issues; and (3) any management recommendations or \n     actions USDA will take to ensure program integrity going \n     forward.\n       The Secretary is encouraged to amend 7 CFR 246.10 in order \n     for State agencies to include all varieties of fresh, whole \n     or cut vegetables, except for vegetables with added sugars, \n     fats, or oils; provided that inclusion of such vegetables \n     contribute towards meeting the special nutritional needs of \n     program participants and increases the availability of \n     low-cost, high-nutrient alternatives for participants \n     throughout the year.\n\n               Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n\n       The recommendation includes $77,290,160,000 for the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The recommendation \n     includes $3,000,000,000 to be made available for a \n     contingency reserve.\n       USDA is urged to require States to share SNAP recipient \n     case data, including the appropriate use of the ALERT \n     database, so USDA may determine whether individuals or \n     households are receiving duplicative benefits in more than \n     one State. To prevent the potential for fraud, the Secretary \n     also is urged to continue to explore information from \n     information broker services that might help to inform the \n     authorization of SNAP retailers and use its suspension and \n     debarment authority to prevent repeat offenders from re-\n     entering and defrauding SNAP or any other Federal program. \n     USDA is directed to submit a report to the Committees within \n     60 days of enactment, detailing plans to prevent future fraud \n     and improper payments, including efforts to debar or exclude \n     both vendors and participants from the receipt of benefits if \n     found guilty of fraud or abuse.\n       The recommendation includes the following for the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:\n\n\n                      Total Obligational Authority\n\n\n                         [Dollars in Thousands]\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:\n  Benefits..................................................$67,191,095\n  Contingency Reserve.........................................3,000,000\n  State Administrative Costs..................................3,866,512\n  Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program......396,000\n  Employment and Training.......................................426,946\n  Mandatory Other Program Costs.................................140,123\n  Discretionary Other Program Costs ................................998\n  Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico........................1,872,910\n  Nutrition Assistance for American Samoa.........................7,522\n  Food Distribution Program for Indian Reservations.............100,156\n  TEFAP Commodities.............................................265,750\n  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands...................12,148\n  Community Food Project..........................................5,000\n  Program Access..................................................5,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n    Total...................................................$77,290,160\n                                                       ================\n\n\n\n                      COMMODITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n       The recommendation includes $253,952,000 for the Commodity \n     Assistance Program.

---------------\n            Total, FDA Program Level....................      $4,223,295\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The recommendation includes the following increases in \n     budget authority: $12,500,000 for food safety; $10,000,000 \n     for food and drug safety inspections in China; $3,510,000 for \n     advancing medical countermeasures; $21,166,000 for necessary \n     expenses, rental payments, and facilities. FDA's proposed \n     reduction of $19,706,000 due to information technology \n     savings is also accepted.\n       There is concern that over a year has passed since USDA \n     published its dietary guidelines and more than ten months \n     have passed since the publication of the fiscal year 2012 \n     Committee reports directing FDA to commence reconsideration \n     of its 2004 seafood advisory, and yet FDA has not published \n     its draft revision of the advisory. Given data demonstrating \n     that women of childbearing years, pregnant women, and mothers \n     with young children are eating too little seafood for their \n     health and the health of their babies, and the role the \n     language of FDA's 2004 advisory may play in discouraging \n     healthy consumption of seafood, a more urgent response by FDA \n     was expected. Therefore, FDA is directed to issue a final \n     seafood advisory consistent with USDA's dietary guidelines.\n       The increasing role of nutritional rating and front of \n     package labeling claims in the marketplace is recognized. To \n     promote public health and facilitate consumer understanding, \n     such information should be based on criteria that are public \n     and readily available to consumers. The FDA is directed to \n     evaluate such systems and symbols to ensure compliance with \n     relevant FDA food labeling requirements.\n       While the considerable time and effort put into producing \n     the FDA budget justification is appreciated, due to the \n     changes within the FDA's budget over the last several years, \n     including the proposal and authorization of various new user \n     fees, the justification has become difficult to analyze. The \n     FDA is reminded that the budget justification is specifically \n     for the use of the Committees. A more streamlined approach to \n     the justification would serve both the Agency and the \n     Committees. Therefore, prior to submission of the FY 2014 \n     budget, FDA is directed to work with the Committees to \n     determine the most helpful format in which to submit the \n     justification.\n\n

The explanatory statement, while \n     repeating some language for emphasis, is not intended to \n     negate the language referred to above unless expressly \n     provided herein. In cases where both the House report and the \n     Senate report address a particular issue not specifically \n     addressed in the explanatory statement, the House report and \n     the Senate report should be read as consistent and are to be \n     interpreted accordingly. In cases where the House report or \n     the Senate report directs the submission of a report, such \n     report is to be submitted to both the House and Senate \n     Committees on Appropriations.\n       It is expected that each department and agency funded in \n     this Act shall follow the directions set forth in this Act \n     and the accompanying statement, and shall not reallocate \n     resources or reorganize activities except as provided herein. \n     Reprogramming procedures shall apply to: funds provided in \n     this Act; unobligated balances from previous appropriations \n     Acts that are available for obligation or expenditure in \n     fiscal year 2013; and non-appropriated resources such as fee \n     collections that are used to meet program requirements in \n     fiscal year 2013. These procedures are specified in section \n     505 of this Act.\n       Any reprogramming request shall include any out-year \n     budgetary impacts and a separate accounting of program or \n     mission impacts on estimated carryover funds. Any program, \n     project or activity cited in this statement, or in the House \n     report or the Senate report and not changed by this Act or \n     statement, shall be construed as the position of the Congress \n     and shall not be subject to reductions or reprogramming \n     without prior approval of the Committees. Further, it is \n     expected that any department or agency funded in this Act \n     which plans a reduction-in-force to notify by letter the \n     Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate 30 days in \n     advance of the date of any such planned personnel action.\n       It is noted that when a department or agency submits a \n     reprogramming or transfer request to the Appropriations \n     Committees of the House and Senate and does not receive \n     identical responses by the House and Senate, it shall be the \n     responsibility of the department or agency seeking the \n     reprogramming to reconcile the differences between the two \n     bodies before proceeding.

However, NOAA's lack of responsiveness toward \n     communities in the Mid-Atlantic area remains deeply \n     troubling. Therefore, NOAA shall report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations no later than 30 days after enactment of this \n     Act regarding its plans to enhance and repair core NMFS \n     functions in the Mid-Atlantic region in the areas of \n     fisheries management, endangered species, habitat protection \n     and restoration. The report shall include specific ways NMFS \n     will: (1) streamline procedures to allow Mid-Atlantic \n     fisheries decisions to be made locally rather than remotely, \n     as appropriate and consistent with procedures and practices \n     in other NMFS regions; (2) increase the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \n     Management Council's accessibility to NOAA, consistent with \n     the accessibility afforded to other fishery management \n     councils; (3) reduce bureaucracy to allow difficult Mid-\n     Atlantic issues to be brought to the attention of the NMFS \n     Northeast Regional Office and NOAA Fisheries leadership in \n     NOAA headquarters on an expedited basis; and (4) improve on-\n     the-ground coordination with Mid-Atlantic fisheries partners.\n       For clarity, it is noted that this Act and the accompanying \n     statement approve the proposed consolidation of NOAA's West \n     Coast Regional Offices, not the West Coast Fisheries Science \n     Centers.\n       Catch shares.--Section 543 of H.R. 5326 of the 112th \n     Congress regarding catch shares is not included.

This amount is \n     $34,762,000 above revised estimates and restores reductions \n     proposed in the budget to the tsunami program, hurricane \n     research, forecast capabilities, and information technology \n     staffing levels.\n       Local Warnings and Forecasts.--The funding recommendation \n     includes an additional $17,100,000 for the NWS to address \n     current operational shortfalls identified by an investigation \n     of financial mismanagement within the NWS and consistent with \n     the proposed realignment of the NWS budget in the wake of the \n     investigation. Concern remains that the inappropriate \n     movement of funds within the NWS could have jeopardized the \n     NWS' ability to accurately forecast the weather and that \n     these actions may negatively impact the NWS' ability to make \n     forecast improvements in the future. Therefore, in addition \n     to the increases provided in this account, additional funds \n     are provided to NWS in the Procurement, Acquisition and \n     Construction (PAC) account to restore reductions to systems \n     improvement activities. The NWS is directed to continue \n     implementing corrective actions identified by the Inspector \n     General, the Department and NOAA to ensure that the critical \n     mission of the NWS is not compromised by financial \n     mismanagement. In addition, dissatisfaction remains with \n     NOAA's failure to determine the true costs necessary to \n     support NWS operational needs. Therefore, NOAA is directed to \n     provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations within \n     30 days after enactment of this Act regarding: progress made \n     in implementing corrective actions; assessments of impacts to \n     NWS forecast capabilities; and a timeline for providing the \n     Committees on Appropriations with a budget that represents \n     the true operational costs of the NWS.\n       National Mesonet Program.--The continuation of the mesonet \n     program through a competitive process is supported. Senate \n     language is clarified that NOAA is not required to integrate \n     mesonet observations into NWS severe weather alerts, conduct \n     pilots, or use funds to study how mesonet data can be \n     integrated into the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing \n     System. However, NWS is not prevented from undertaking any of \n     these activities. The Senate's reference to NOAA Link is not \n     adopted, but NOAA shall continue to use the most appropriate \n     contract vehicles for information technology contracts across \n     the agency.

ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n       This Act includes a total program level of $1,941,036,000 \n     in direct obligations under this heading, of which \n     $1,926,036,000 is appropriated from the general fund and \n     $15,000,000 is derived from recoveries of prior year \n     obligations. The following narrative description and table \n     identifies the specific activities and funding levels \n     included in this Act:\n       Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.--$10,379,000 is \n     for research supercomputing activities.\n       National Weather Service.--The Act restores $12,400,000 in \n     reductions proposed by the Commerce Department in its \n     realignment of the fiscal year 2013 budget request required \n     as a result of financial mismanagement issues within the NWS. \n     Direction is included to the Department and NOAA in the \n     Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) account regarding \n     funding for NWS programs in this account.\n       NOAA weather satellites.--The value of NOAA's weather \n     satellite programs cannot be overstated in terms of the data \n     collected that is used to develop daily weather forecasts and \n     provide citizens with ample warning about severe weather. \n     Unfortunately, certain NOAA satellite acquisition programs, \n     particularly the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), remain \n     mired in cost overruns, missed deadlines, dysfunctional \n     oversight, and lack of transparency in budgeting and \n     planning. Recent reports from an Independent Review Team \n     (IRT) and the Department of Commerce Inspector General \n     validate these concerns. To address these problems, the \n     Senate recommended transferring responsibility and funding \n     for satellite acquisition from NOAA to the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, \n     concerns have been raised that transferring lead construction \n     and acquisition responsibility from NOAA to NASA in the \n     middle of a fiscal year could potentially result in further \n     launch delays. Additional information to fully evaluate the \n     implications of transferring acquisition of operational \n     satellites to NASA is needed. Therefore, to avoid both known \n     and unknown risks at this time, the Senate proposal to \n     transfer NOAA satellite programs to NASA is not adopted, but \n     instead $1,814,309,000, an increase of $117,664,000 above \n     fiscal year 2012, is provided for NESDIS satellite \n     procurement programs within NOAA. This amount includes an \n     overall reduction of $36,000,000 for administrative \n     efficiencies and other savings that NOAA is expected to \n     achieve within its satellite portfolio. NOAA is directed to \n     prioritize the weather missions of the Geostationary \n     Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and JPSS programs \n     within the funds provided and submit a spending plan to the \n     Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after \n     enactment of this Act with funding levels for each program, \n     project, or activity within NESDIS PAC.\n       While NOAA is instituting structural changes to the \n     management structure of JPSS as recommended by the IRT, it is \n     equally important for NOAA to aggressively move to define \n     JPSS requirements that prioritize the weather mission and \n     establish a refined baseline that validates and finalizes the \n     program scope and costs. To assist NOAA in achieving these \n     goals, NOAA is directed to submit a report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act that includes the following information: (1) \n     documentation that reflects total lifecycle costs for JPSS at \n     $11,900,000,000 and for GOES-R at $10,860,000,000; (2) \n     documentation that satellite requirements have been finalized \n     and that the weather missions have been prioritized within \n     the NOAA satellite portfolio; (3) a plan that maintains or \n     advances, as appropriate, the launch schedules for JPSS and \n     GOES; and (4) a plan to eliminate duplicative management \n     costs and indirect overhead within the NESDIS satellite \n     portfolio.As part of this report, NOAA is directed to \n     consider transferring the Jason satellite system construction \n     to NASA as recommended by the July 2012 IRT report. Further, \n     NOAA is directed to include in this report an update on the \n     study underway to review options for mitigating the gap \n     between the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi \n     NPP) and JPSS-1 and for mitigating the loss of data in the \n     event of a failure of either the Suomi NPP or JPSS. Within \n     120 days after enactment of this Act, NOAA shall submit a \n     report to the Committees on Appropriations that includes \n     detailed spending plans for each of the programs within the \n     NESDIS satellite portfolio, to include amounts for \n     administration and reserves.\n       This Act and the accompanying statement only reflect near-\n     term funding needs for the remainder of fiscal year 2013. \n     With the timely submission of these reports, NOAA will \n     provide assurances to the Committees on Appropriations that \n     it has prioritized the weather mission within its satellite \n     portfolio and has stabilized the overall management of these \n     programs to ensure that these costs do not erode other \n     important NOAA missions. The fiscal year 2014 budget request \n     and documents requested herein will be evaluated to determine \n     whether NOAA has made concrete and positive changes to \n     address the problems and directions outlined above.\n       NOAA Ship Ka'imimoana (KA).--An increase of $2,600,000 \n     above the request is included to begin repairs to the KA.NOAA \n     is reminded to review priorities across the agency in the \n     future to ensure that critical missions like those performed \n     by the KA are maintained.\n\n               PROCUREMENT, ACQUISITION, AND CONSTRUCTION\n                        [In thousands of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Program                              Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOffice of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research:\n  Research Supercomputing/CCRI..............................      10,379\n                                                             ===========\nNational Weather Service:\n  Systems Acquisition:\n    ASOS....................................................       1,635\n    AWIPS...................................................      20,592\n    NWSTG Legacy Replacement................................       8,185\n    Radiosonde Network Replacement..........................       4,014\n    Weather and Climate Supercomputing......................      38,169\n    Cooperative Observer Network Modernization (NERON)......       3,700\n    Complete and Sustain NOAA Weather Radio.................       5,594\n    NOAA Profiler Conversion................................       1,700\n    Ground Readiness Project................................      12,400\n                                                             -----------\n      Subtotal, NWS Systems Acquisition.....................      95,989\n                                                             ===========\n    WFO Construction........................................       3,150\n                                                             ===========\n      Total, National Weather Service--PAC..................      99,139\n                                                             ===========\nNational Environmental Satellite, Data and Information\n Service:\n    Systems Acquisition:\n      NOAA satellites.......................................   1,833,388\n      EOS and Advanced Polar Data Processing, Distribution           990\n       and Archiving Systems................................\n      Critical Infrastructure Protection....................       2,772\n      Comprehensive Large Array Data Stewardship System            6,476\n       (CLASS)..............................................\n      NPOESS Preparatory Data Exploitation..................       4,455\n      Satellite CDA Facility................................       2,228\n      Efficiencies..........................................     -36,000\n                                                             -----------\n        Total, NESDIS--PAC..................................   1,814,309\n                                                             ===========\nOffice of Marine and Aviation Operations:\n  Fleet Replacement:\n    Fleet Capital Improvements and Tech Infusion (Vessel          14,312\n     Equip and Tech Refresh)................................\n    New Vessel Construction.................................       2,897\n                                                             -----------\n      Total, Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, PAC..      17,209\n                                                             ===========\n      Total, Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction.....   1,941,036\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    PACIFIC COASTAL SALMON RECOVERY\n\n       This Act includes $65,000,000 for Pacific Coastal Salmon \n     Recovery.\n\n\n                      FISHERMEN'S CONTINGENCY FUND\n\n       This Act includes $350,000 for the Fishermen's Contingency \n     Fund.\n\n\n                   FISHERIES FINANCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT\n\n       This Act includes language under this heading limiting \n     obligations of direct loans to $24,000,000 for Individual \n     Fishing Quota loans and $59,000,000 for traditional direct \n     loans.\n\n                        Departmental Management\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $56,000,000 for Departmental Management \n     salaries and expenses.

Therefore, as directed \n     in the Senate report, the Attorney General shall follow the \n     recommendations of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     and report to the Committees on Appropriations within 120 \n     days of the enactment of this Act on the efforts of the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) to:\n       (1) conduct an assessment to better understand the extent \n     to which DOJ grant programs overlap with one another and \n     determine if grant programs may be consolidated to mitigate \n     the risk of unnecessary duplication; and\n       (2) direct granting agencies to coordinate with one another \n     on a consistent basis to review potential or recent grant \n     awards, including subgrant awards reported by DOJ prime grant \n     awardees, to the extent possible, before awarding new grants, \n     and take steps to establish written policies and procedures \n     to govern this coordination and help ensure that it occurs.\n       Operation Fast and Furious.--In September 2012, the Office \n     of Inspector General (OIG) submitted its comprehensive report \n     on Operation Fast and Furious. The review revealed a series \n     of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment, and \n     management failures that led to ATF's knowing failure to \n     interdict firearms destined for Mexico, and criticized \n     Department components for pursuing this strategy without \n     adequately taking into account the danger to public safety \n     that it created. The OIG also found that the Department \n     failed to respond accurately to a congressional inquiry about \n     these matters because it had relied on the very components \n     that were the subject of serious allegations for information, \n     which in turn was provided to Congress. The Department later \n     withdrew its inaccurate response.\n       The Department is directed to implement fully and promptly \n     the six recommendations made in the OIG report to increase \n     the Department's involvement in and oversight of ATF \n     operations, improve coordination among the Department's law \n     enforcement components, and enhance the Department's wiretap \n     application review and authorization process. The Department \n     shall report to the Committees on Appropriations within 60 \n     days of enactment of this Act on the Department's progress in \n     implementing these recommendations. All of the departments \n     and agencies funded in this Act are expected to confirm \n     information to be provided to Congress so that they can \n     respond accurately to all congressional inquiries.\n       Prescription drug abuse.--The Attorney General is urged to \n     collaborate with State and local organizations, including \n     experienced nonprofits, as a means of sharing best practices \n     for reducing prescription drug diversion and abuse, including \n     the establishment of prescription drug monitoring programs, \n     proper drug disposal, and increased enforcement on pill mills \n     and doctor shopping.\n       Obscenity enforcement.--The Department shall submit a \n     report no later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act \n     on its adult obscenity investigation and prosecution workload \n     statistics and accomplishments during the 12 months prior to \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       Product procurements.--This Act continues language from the \n     Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2012, directing that, to the extent \n     practicable, promotional items purchased with funds provided \n     by this Act shall be produced in the United States. The \n     Department is expected to work with Federal Prison \n     Industries, Inc. (FPI) to maintain its survey information on \n     promotional products in a database in order to help inform \n     the FPI board of directors of new opportunities to repatriate \n     manufacturing, and expect that any manufacturing activities \n     initiated as a result are intended to create new American \n     jobs, not compete with existing United States businesses.\n       Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).--The Department is \n     expected to continue efforts to provide assistance in the \n     form of training, technical assistance, and implementation \n     grants to assist State, local, and tribal jurisdictions in \n     achieving compliance with the PREA national standards.\n       Drug-related violence.--Efforts by Federal law enforcement \n     to reduce drug trafficking and associated violence in the \n     Southwest border region have affected trafficking routes and \n     crime rates in the Caribbean. The Attorney General is \n     expected to address these trends by allocating necessary \n     resources to areas substantially affected by drug-related \n     violence, and reporting such actions to the Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n\n\n                 JUSTICE INFORMATION SHARING TECHNOLOGY\n\n       This Act includes $33,426,000 for Justice Information \n     Sharing Technology.\n\n\n                   ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND APPEALS\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       This Act includes $313,438,000 for the Executive Office for \n     Immigration Review (EOIR) and the Office of the Pardon \n     Attorney, of which $4,000,000 is derived by transfer from fee \n     collections.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n       This Act includes $85,985,000 for the OIG.\n\n                    United States Parole Commission\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $12,772,000 for the salaries and expenses \n     of the United States Parole Commission.\n\n                            Legal Activities\n\n\n            SALARIES AND EXPENSES, GENERAL LEGAL ACTIVITIES\n\n       This Act includes $881,000,000 for General Legal \n     Activities.\n\n\n                 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION TRUST FUND\n\n       This Act includes a reimbursement of $7,833,000 for DOJ \n     expenses associated with litigating cases under the National \n     Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-660).\n\n\n               SALARIES AND EXPENSES, ANTITRUST DIVISION\n\n       This Act includes $162,170,000 for the Antitrust Division. \n     This appropriation is offset by $115,000,000 in pre-merger \n     filing fee collections, resulting in a direct appropriation \n     of $47,170,000.\n\n\n             SALARIES AND EXPENSES, UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\n\n       This Act includes $1,969,687,000 for the Executive Office \n     for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and the 94 United States \n     Attorneys' offices.\n       Adam Walsh Act implementation.--The EOUSA is expected to \n     continue to focus on investigations and prosecutions related \n     to the sexual exploitation of children, as authorized by the \n     Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public \n     Law 109-248) and as part of Project Safe Childhood. Not less \n     than $43,184,000 shall be available for this purpose in \n     fiscal year 2013.\n       Human trafficking.--In fiscal year 2012, Congress directed \n     each U.S. Attorney to establish or participate in a regional \n     human trafficking task force. The accompanying statement of \n     the managers also directed, ``Task force meetings should \n     focus specifically on combating human trafficking, with an \n     emphasis on undertaking proactive investigations.'' U.S. \n     Attorneys are expected to maintain their task force \n     participation and leadership roles in fiscal year 2013 and to \n     undertake proactive investigations, including investigations \n     of persons or entities facilitating trafficking in persons \n     through the use of classified advertising on the Internet. \n     The Department shall submit comprehensive semi-annual reports \n     regarding the work of each of these task forces. These \n     reports shall also identify any U.S. Attorney's office that \n     is not in compliance with this directive. The Department \n     shall submit its first report not later than 60 days after \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       Internet sex trafficking.--There are grave concerns that \n     certain websites that advertise ``adult services'' continue \n     to be used to facilitate sex trafficking of children. The \n     Department is directed to assess the effectiveness of current \n     legal and investigatory tools in addressing the use of such \n     websites for sex trafficking and the extent to which the \n     Department is making full and aggressive use of such tools, \n     and reportto the Committees on Appropriations on the results \n     of that assessment not later than 30 days after the enactment \n     of this Act. If the Attorney General determines that there is \n     insufficient Federal authority under which to combat this \n     activity, the report shall include an analysis and \n     recommendations to Congress of any legislative or \n     administrative initiatives that may be needed to fully equip \n     law enforcement to tackle this problem.\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n       Pill mills.--Because of the widespread nature of \n     prescription drug abuse, within the funds provided, U.S. \n     Attorneys are expected to prioritize the investigation and \n     prosecution of pain clinics serving as fronts for the illegal \n     distribution of addictive pain killers.\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES TRUSTEE SYSTEM FUND\n\n       This Act includes $223,258,000 for the United States \n     Trustee Program.

The Department shall submit a report to the \n     Committees, no later than 60 days after the enactment of this \n     Act, detailing the staff and funding resources planned for \n     IOC-2 in fiscal year 2013.\n\n                    Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $8,185,007,000 for the salaries and \n     expenses of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), \n     including $1,689,113,000 for intelligence, $3,330,036,000 for \n     Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, $2,663,835,000 for \n     Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes, and $502,023,000 for \n     Criminal Justice Services.\n       Computer intrusions.--A program increase is included of \n     $23,132,000 and 112 positions for computer intrusions as \n     described in the House report, including the submission of an \n     annual national cyber threat assessment, and Senate report \n     language on training for cyber agents.\n       Surveillance.--A program increase of $10,244,000 is \n     included for additional physical surveillance specialists as \n     described in the House report, including the reporting \n     requirement described in the House report.\n       Gangs.--An increase of $9,000,000 above the request is \n     included to combat violent gang crime. The proposal by the \n     Administration to eliminate the National Gang Intelligence \n     Center (NGIC) is rejected. Funds are included to continue the \n     operation of NGIC, and to provide additional resources to \n     existing Safe Streets Task Forces. Within the overall funds \n     provided for Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes, the FBI \n     is expected to launch a nationwide anti-gang initiative, \n     allocating agents and other personnel to task forces \n     experiencing the most severe violent gang crime, and where \n     gangs have established links to violent international drug \n     distribution cartels. The FBI shall report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations on the planned initiative, and the \n     corresponding allocations of funding and staff resources, no \n     later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act.

The FBI shall \n     submit a report to the Committees no later than 120 days \n     after the enactment of this Act on agent utilization and \n     overall staff resources dedicated to trafficking in fiscal \n     years 2010 through 2013.

The scope of \n     this review shall include: (1) an assessment of progress \n     made, and challenges in implementing the recommendations of \n     the 9/11 Commission that are related to the FBI; (2) an \n     analysis of the FBI's response to trends of domestic terror \n     attacks since September 11, 2001, including the influence of \n     domestic radicalization; (3) an assessment of any evidence \n     now known to the FBI that was not considered by the 9/11 \n     Commission related to any factors that contributed in any \n     manner to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; and \n     (4) any additional recommendations with regard to FBI \n     intelligence sharing and counterterrorism policy. The FBI \n     shall submit a report to the Committees, no later than one \n     year after enactment of this Act, on the findings and \n     recommendations resulting from this review. The FBI is \n     encouraged, in carrying out this review, to draw upon the \n     experience of 9/11 Commissioners and staff.\n\n\n                              CONSTRUCTION\n\n       This Act includes $80,982,000 for FBI Construction.\n\n                    Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes a direct appropriation of $2,050,904,000 \n     for the salaries and expenses of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA). In addition, the DEA expects to derive \n     $352,600,000 from fees deposited in the Diversion Control \n     Fund to carry out the Diversion Control Program.\n\n          Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $1,153,345,000 for the salaries and \n     expenses of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \n     Explosives (ATF).\n       Gangs.--Within the amount provided, ATF is expected to \n     prioritize funding for its Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCIT), \n     which bring focused law enforcement attention to communities \n     plagued by gang violence. The ATF is directed to identify its \n     allocation for VCIT in its spending plan for fiscal year \n     2013.\n       United States--Mexico firearms trafficking.--Support for \n     ATF's efforts to combat weapon trafficking on the border is \n     continued. As begun in fiscal year 2012, the ATF shall \n     continue to provide the Committees on Appropriations with \n     annual data on the total number of firearms recovered by the \n     Government of Mexico, and of those, the number for which an \n     ATF trace is attempted, the number successfully traced, the \n     number determined to be manufactured in the United States, \n     and the number determined to be imported into the United \n     States prior to being recovered in Mexico.\n       Reprogramming requests.--It is noted that ATF has fallen \n     into a trend of submitting annual reprogramming requests to \n     the Committees on Appropriations seeking to transfer funds \n     from its Arson and Explosives Decision Unit to its Firearms \n     Decision Unit. ATF is directed to budget appropriately among \n     its decision units in order to eliminate the need for these \n     reprogramming requests.\n\n                         Federal Prison SYstem\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       This Act includes $6,820,217,000 for the salaries and \n     expenses of the Federal Prison System.\n       Reentry research and reforms.--The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) \n     is directed to undertake a comprehensive analysis of its \n     policies and determine the reforms and best practices that \n     will help reduce costs and recidivism. The Director is \n     encouraged to share additional corrections data with outside \n     experts in order to build upon prior efforts.\n       BOP contract confinement.--The safe, secure and humane \n     incarceration of Federal inmates is considered to be a \n     critical priority.Because contract prison beds will be a \n     necessary tool for managing a rapidly expanding Federal \n     inmate population for the foreseeable future, there is a \n     commitment to ensuring that inmates at such facilities are \n     housed appropriately. Therefore, the OIG is directed to \n     conduct a review of prison facilities operating under a \n     contract with BOP to ensure that such facilities meet all \n     appropriate standards. This review should also include a \n     description of BOP's efforts to monitor the performance of \n     contract prison facilities and recommendations for how BOP \n     could improve such efforts.\n       Inmate literacy.--It is recommended that, given the \n     priority of increasing successful prisoner reentry programs \n     and the critical role community-based and volunteer literacy \n     programs can play in the transition from prison back into \n     society, BOP work with national organizations to identify and \n     describe these models, and develop appropriate replication \n     strategies.\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES\n\n       This Act includes $90,000,000 for the construction, \n     acquisition, modernization, maintenance and repair of prison \n     and detention facilities housing Federal inmates.\n       Construction funding requests.--Due to inmate population \n     growth and overcrowding estimates, BOP is encouraged to \n     include funding for new prison construction in future \n     requests.\n       Status of construction.--Previous conference agreements \n     have directed BOP to submit monthly status of construction \n     reports that include notifications of any deviations from the \n     construction and activation schedule identified in those \n     reports, including detailed explanations of the causes of \n     delays and actions proposed to address them. BOP's failure to \n     submit these reports in a timely manner has hindered the \n     Committees on Appropriations' ability to monitor and assess \n     BOP's needs.

Within 60 days of the \n     enactment of this Act, NASA shall report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations on planned milestones; expected performance \n     and configurations; planned ground and flight testing \n     programs; and deliverables for SLS, EGS and the Orion MPCV. \n     As part of this report, NASA shall validate the funding \n     levels established by the ICA for SLS, EGS and the Orion MPCV \n     as potential cost caps through fiscal year 2017 or recommend \n     and justify alternate cost caps for each program element.\n       Exploration destinations and goals.--Language from the \n     House report regarding mission goals for the test flights of \n     SLS and the Orion MPCV currently scheduled for 2017 and 2021 \n     is adopted by reference.\n       Commercial crew.--$525,000,000 is for the Commercial Crew \n     Program (CCP). This funding, which will support the \n     continuation of the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability \n     (CCiCap) phase and the awarding of Certification Products \n     Contracts, is intended to promote the safest, fastest and \n     most cost-effective reestablishment of a domestic means of \n     access to the ISS.\n       It is expected that CCP activity beyond the CCiCap base \n     period will be funded via Federal Acquisition Regulation--\n     based contracts and that NASA will take all necessary steps \n     to ensure that these contracts can be smoothly awarded with \n     minimal disruption to programmatic progress. NASA is also \n     expected to maintain rigorous oversight of the program and \n     its private sector partners to ensure that all necessary \n     safety standards are being met and all appropriate safeguards \n     for taxpayer interests are being implemented.\n\n\n                            SPACE OPERATIONS\n\n       This Act includes $3,953,000,000 for Space Operations.\n       ISS.--$2,958,000,000 is for ISS operations, research and \n     cargo supply and adopts, by reference, language from the \n     Senate report regarding satellite servicing activities.\n       Language in the House report requiring NASA to provide a \n     report on options for short-term emergency access to the ISS \n     is adopted by reference. This report shall be provided no \n     later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act.\n       Launch services.--Concern remains about potential shortages \n     in both the small- and medium-class launch vehicle markets. \n     Such shortages would threaten both the schedules and budgets \n     for NASA science missions. NASA is directed to continue \n     monitoring its options in both markets and to ensure that \n     management plans for projects in these classes appropriately \n     reflect the risks resulting from uncertainty in launch \n     vehicle availability and pricing.\n       Space and Flight Support.--$925,000,000 is for Space and \n     Flight Support, including the full requested level for \n     Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System replacement and the \n     21st Century Space Launch Complex (21CSLC) program. The \n     21CSLC funds are available for the modification and \n     modernization of launch infrastructure not exclusively used \n     for SLS, including NASA-owned facilities for launch vehicles \n     serving NASA missions and facilities scheduled to launch \n     cargo to the ISS.\n       Language from the House report regarding strategic planning \n     for upgrades and modernization of the Wallops Flight Facility \n     is adopted by reference.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n       This Act includes $125,000,000 for Education.\n       Aerospace Research and Career Development.--$40,000,000 is \n     for the National Space Grant College program, and $18,000,000 \n     is for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive \n     Research (EPSCoR). Language from the Senate report regarding \n     the distribution of Space Grant funding to states and \n     jurisdictions is not adopted.\n       Informal education.--$10,000,000 is for a competitive grant \n     program to fund informal education programs that develop STEM \n     education activities, including exhibits, at qualifying \n     institutions as described in section 616 of the NASA \n     Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155), and/or at \n     NASA Visitors Centers.\n       K-12 STEM education and youth service organizations.--It is \n     noted that NASA's Office of Education, mission directorates \n     and centers are involved in multiple efforts to engage K-12 \n     students in STEM-related activities and competitions, in \n     order to help encourage students to pursue future STEM-\n     related studies and careers. Much of NASA's work in this area \n     has been accomplished through partnerships with youth service \n     organizations, including those with a nationwide footprint. \n     These efforts both augment and leverage the resources and \n     reach of these organizations, helping to bring practical STEM \n     applications to a wider group of young participants. NASA is \n     commended for these efforts, which are an effective way to \n     help build a strong and vibrant future STEM workforce, which \n     in turn helps ensure a strong, globally competitive U.S. \n     economy. NASA is directed, within funds provided both in this \n     account and throughout the NASA budget, to expand the \n     agency's K-12 STEM education efforts with youth service \n     organizations and to report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations within 180 days of enactment on these efforts.\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\n                          CROSS AGENCY SUPPORT\n\n       This Act includes $2,823,000,000 for Cross Agency Support.\n       Cybersecurity.--Language from the Senate report regarding \n     cybersecurity is adopted by reference.\n       Comprehensive independent assessment.--Language from the \n     House report regarding NASA's response to a comprehensive \n     independent assessment of the agency conducted by the \n     National Research Council is adopted by reference.\n\n\n       CONSTRUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND RESTORATION\n\n       This Act includes $680,000,000 for Construction and \n     Environmental Compliance and Restoration. Within the amounts \n     provided, $60,000,000 is for Environmental Compliance and \n     Restoration, $329,200,000 is for Institutional Construction \n     of Facilities (CoF) and $265,710,000 is for Exploration CoF, \n     including $3,310,000 for the Orion MPCV and $142,000,000 for \n     SLS-related test facilities.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n       This Act includes $38,000,000 for the Office of Inspector \n     General.\n\n\n                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS\n\n       This Act includes the following administrative provisions \n     for NASA:\n        a provision that makes funds for announced prizes \n     available without fiscal year limitation until the prize is \n     claimed or the offer is withdrawn;\n        a provision that establishes terms and conditions \n     for the transfer of funds;\n        a provision that subjects the NASA spending plan \n     and specified changes to that spending plan to reprogramming \n     procedures under section 505 of this Act; and\n        a provision that allows NASA to retain within its \n     Working Capital Fund refunds or rebates received through \n     NASA's credit card programs.\n\n                      National Science Foundation\n\n\n                    RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES\n\n       This Act includes $5,983,280,000 for Research and Related \n     Activities (R).\n       Program priorities.--NSF's proposed R termination and \n     reduction proposals are incorporated as described in the \n     House report.\n       Advanced manufacturing.--Language in the House report \n     regarding advanced manufacturing is adopted by reference.\n       Cybersecurity research.--Language from the Senate report \n     regarding cybersecurity research is adopted by reference.\n       Innovation Corps (I-Corps).--Language from the House report \n     regarding the I-Corps program is adopted by reference. If NSF \n     determines that the directive contained in that language \n     cannot be practically enforced for any specific I-Corps \n     grant, NSF is directed to immediately report that \n     determination, along with an explanation, to the Committees \n     on Appropriations. NSF is expected to make all necessary \n     efforts to ensure that exceptions to the directive are \n     avoided to the maximum extent possible.\n       Cross-Foundation initiatives.--Limits on the implementation \n     of OneNSF initiatives as proposed in the Senate report are \n     not included because there is value in the further \n     development of interdisciplinary research activities. \n     However, future growth in interdisciplinary research should \n     not come at the expense of adequate support for \n     infrastructure and core research programs in each of NSF's \n     individual scientific disciplines. NSF is urged to assess and \n     refine the balance among these activities in its budget \n     request for fiscal year 2014 and future years.\n       Astronomy.--$247,550,000 is for astronomical sciences, \n     including $164,890,000 for infrastructure. Within the \n     infrastructure portfolio, NSF shall fund pre-construction \n     planning and research resources at the budget request level \n     and allocate the remaining funds to observatories. To the \n     extent that increases in infrastructure spending require a \n     reduction in the research budget, those reductions should \n     come from the planned increases for the Enhancing Access to \n     the Radio Spectrum program.\n       No limitations are placed on the implementation of the \n     Telescope System Instrumentation Plan, and no action or \n     statement herein regarding the Division of Astronomical \n     Sciences (AST) should be construed as an expression of \n     opinion regarding AST's recently concluded portfolio review, \n     which has yet to be submitted to the Congress for \n     consideration.\n       EPSCoR.--$158,190,000 is for EPSCoR.\n\n\n          MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION\n\n       This Act includes $196,170,000 for Major Research Equipment \n     and Facilities Construction.\n\n\n                     EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n       This Act includes $895,610,000 for Education and Human \n     Resources (EHR).\n       Program terminations and reductions.--NSF's proposed EHR \n     termination and reduction proposals as described in the House \n     report are incorporated, with the exception of NSF's proposal \n     to reduce the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) \n     program. AISL shall be funded as described in the Senate \n     report.\n       Broadening participation programs.--Funding for the \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate \n     Program, the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority \n     Participation, the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program \n     and Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology \n     is incorporated, as described in the Senate report.\n       Advanced Technological Education (ATE).--An increase of \n     $5,000,000 above the request for ATE is included, as \n     described in the House report. NSF shall choose an offset to \n     accommodate this increase from among the EHR programs not \n     otherwise described in this statement.\n       Best practices in K-12 STEM education.--Adopted, by \n     reference, is language from the House report on the \n     implementation of the recommendations contained in the \n     National Research Council's 2011 report entitled Successful \n     K-12 STEM Education: Identifying Effective Approaches in \n     Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.\n       Federal Cyber Service: Scholarships for Service.--Adopted, \n     by reference, is language from the Senate report regarding \n     the Federal Cyber Service: Scholarships for Service program.\n\n\n                 AGENCY OPERATIONS AND AWARD MANAGEMENT\n\n       This Act includes $299,400,000 for Agency Operations and \n     Award Management.\n       Follow-up on OIG findings.--NSF management responses to \n     recommendations of the OIG, particularly those regarding \n     workforce management and construction contingency funding, \n     have been inadequate. NSF is directed to provide the report \n     described in the Senate report within 30 days of the \n     enactment of this Act and to provide updates to that report \n     on a semiannual basis.\n       NSF headquarters.--The requested amount for expenses \n     associated with the expiration of NSF's headquarters lease is \n     provided.\n\n\n                  OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD\n\n       This Act includes $4,440,000 for the National Science \n     Board.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n       This Act includes $14,200,000 for the OIG.\n\n\n                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION\n\n       This Act includes a provision that establishes terms and \n     conditions for the transfer of funds.\n\n                                TITLE IV\n\n                            RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                       Commission on Civil Rights\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       This Act includes $9,400,000 for the Commission on Civil \n     Rights.\n       Improving oversight.--Language is continued that was first \n     included in fiscal year 2012 establishing an inspector \n     general (IG) function for the Commission on Civil Rights and \n     providing that the function will be carried out by the \n     individual holding the position of IG at the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO). The IG is tasked with the duties \n     and responsibilities specified in the Inspector General Act \n     of 1978, including conducting audits and reviews of \n     Commission programs, finances and personnel.\n       Funding is provided for these operations in the amount of \n     $450,000 by direct transfer to the Office of Inspector \n     General of the GAO. This amount is $200,000 above the request \n     and the enacted level. The GAO IG was unable to fulfill the \n     statutory requirements for its role as IG for the Commission \n     within the amounts provided in fiscal year 2012. Accordingly, \n     the resources available to the IG have been increased. Also \n     included is language providing the IG flexibility in \n     submitting statutorily required reports so the IG can focus \n     its efforts on more substantive oversight issues. With these \n     additional resources and flexibility, the IG is expected to \n     conduct vigorous oversight of the Commission. The IG also is \n     expected to consult with the Committees on Appropriations \n     before exercising this new authority.\n       Vacancies.--The findings of the IG's recent report on \n     management and performance challenges are concerning. In \n     particular, the Commission has not had a permanent staff \n     director since January 2011 and has not had an acting staff \n     director since April 2012. In addition, the Commission has \n     dozens of other vacant positions, many of which have been \n     unfilled for years. Many other staff have multiple titles and \n     responsibilities. The Commission is directed to examine its \n     staffing structure, realign positions, as appropriate, based \n     on available resources, and report the results to the \n     Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of \n     this Act. This report is expected to include details on \n     staffing at the Commission's regional offices, as well as an \n     assessment of the role of these offices in carrying out the \n     work of the Commission.\n\n                Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $370,000,000 for the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Up to $29,500,000 shall be \n     available for payments to State and local enforcement \n     agencies to ensure that the EEOC provides adequate resources \n     to its State and local partners.\n       Strategic plan.--EEOC is expected to use its resources to \n     implement the strategic objectives identified in the EEOC's \n     2012-2016 strategic plan; specifically: combating employment \n     discrimination through strategic law enforcement, preventing \n     employment discrimination through education and outreach, and \n     delivering excellent and consistent service.\n       EEOC is directed to report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations within 60 days of the enactment of this Act on \n     the steps it has taken to reach the fiscal year 2012 goals \n     set forth in the strategic plan, whether those goals were \n     achieved, and, if not, an explanation of why those goals were \n     not achieved. Many of the strategies and measures outlined in \n     the strategic plan are multi-year efforts, and EEOC is \n     expected to provide an\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n     analysis of the impact the strategies will have in subsequent \n     years. As noted in the Senate report, there is particular \n     interest in seeing the results of discussions surrounding \n     intake and charge management in the private sector process \n     and the development of a new case management system in the \n     Federal sector process.\n       In creating the strategic plan, the EEOC sought the input \n     of all members of the EEOC workforce, in addition to the \n     agency's leadership, and solicited and received comments from \n     a wide range of stakeholders and the public. Therefore, it is \n     expected that these invested stakeholders will be active and \n     constructive partners in the plan's implementation by EEOC.\n       Age discrimination.--Section 540 of H.R. 5326 of the 112th \n     Congress regarding an EEOC rule on age discrimination is not \n     included. There is concern that EEOC did not conduct a \n     thorough analysis of this rule's impact on small business. \n     Therefore, notwithstanding the EEOC's determination under \n     section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, no later than \n     90 days after enactment of this Act, EEOC shall conduct an \n     analysis equivalent to that required under section 604 of \n     such title and provide the analysis to the Committees on \n     Appropriations as well as to the public. The EEOC shall \n     consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to \n     undertaking this analysis. This requirement shall not \n     interfere with implementation of the rule.\n       Guidance on criminal background checks.--Section 544 of \n     H.R. 5326 of the 112th Congress is not included. The EEOC \n     recently finalized new guidance regarding the use of criminal \n     record checks, without regard for a directive proposed by the \n     Senate that such guidance should be circulated for public \n     comment at least six months before adoption. The EEOC is \n     directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations within \n     120 days of enactment of this Act detailing the steps it has \n     taken to alleviate confusion about the new guidance.\n\n                     International Trade Commission\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $83,000,000 for the International Trade \n     Commission.\n\n                       Legal Services Corporation\n\n\n               PAYMENT TO THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n       This Act includes $365,000,000 for the Legal Services \n     Corporation (LSC).\n       Pro bono task force.--It is encouraging that the LSC \n     launched a pro bono task force, which released its report \n     this fall. The LSC is urged to implement the recommendations \n     as it continues to work with grantees to adopt measures aimed \n     at increasing the involvement of private attorneys in the \n     delivery of legal services to their clients.\n       Pro bono innovation program.--The pro bono task force's \n     recommendation for the creation of a pro bono innovation \n     program is encouraging, and LSC believes it has authority \n     under the Legal Services Corporation Act to establish this \n     program. LSC is directed to submit a reprogramming request to \n     the Committees on Appropriations before starting the program.\n       Headquarters management.--Language is incorporated from the \n     Senate report regarding LSC headquarters' efforts to incite \n     stakeholders into actively lobbying Congress on budget issues \n     with Federal dollars appropriated to headquarters. The \n     funding expended in these efforts may be better used towards \n     providing services to those in need of LSC counseling in the \n     field. LSC is directed to re-examine its headquarters \n     structure and identify areas of duplication for consolidation \n     or elimination in an effort to provide a more efficient and \n     cost-saving structure, and send more funding to those in the \n     field in need of LSC services. LSC shall report these \n     findings to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n         ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n       Unauthorized uses of funds.--The Inspector General of the \n     LSC is encouraged to conduct annual audits of LSC grantees to \n     ensure that funds are not being used in contravention of the \n     restrictions on engaging in political activities or any of \n     the other restrictions by which LSC grantees are required to \n     abide. The removal of funds from any LSC grantee determined \n     by the Inspector General to have engaged in unauthorized \n     political activity is recommended.\n       Allocation of basic field grants.--Language, modified from \n     H.R. 5326 of the 112th Congress, making a technical change to \n     the allocation formula for basic field grants is included. \n     The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-134) required that the allocation for \n     grantees in each geographic area be based on poverty \n     statistics from the ``most recent decennial census.'' The \n     Census Bureau has since stopped collecting poverty data in \n     the decennial census and instead collects those data in the \n     American Community Survey (ACS). The recommended language \n     alters the formula to reflect this shift. Since ACS data are \n     released more frequently, the language allows reallocation of \n     funding every three years. The language also provides a two-\n     year phase in of the changes. The phase in, which was not \n     included in H.R. 5326 of the 112th Congress, allows grantees \n     to adjust more easily to changes in funding allocations. It \n     is disappointing that LSC waited until the fiscal year 2013 \n     budget request to seek this change, long after it was known \n     that these data would no longer be made available in the \n     decennial census.\n\n                        Marine Mammal Commission\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $3,081,000 for the Marine Mammal \n     Commission.\n\n            Office of the United States Trade Representative\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $51,251,000 for the Office of the U.S. \n     Trade Representative.\n\n                        State Justice Institute\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       This Act includes $5,121,000 for the State Justice \n     Institute.\n\n                                TITLE V\n\n                           GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\n                        (INCLUDING RESCISSIONS)\n\n       This Act includes the following general provisions:\n       Section 501 prohibits the use of funds for publicity or \n     propaganda purposes unless expressly authorized by law.\n       Section 502 prohibits any appropriation contained in this \n     Act from remaining available for obligation beyond the \n     current fiscal year unless expressly provided.\n       Section 503 provides that the expenditure of any \n     appropriation contained in the Act for any consulting service \n     through procurement contracts shall be limited to those \n     contracts where such expenditures are a matter of public \n     record and available for public inspection, except where \n     otherwise provided under existing law or existing Executive \n     Order issued pursuant to existing law.\n       Section 504 provides that if any provision of this Act or \n     the application of such provision to any person or \n     circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of the Act \n     and the application of other provisions shall not be \n     affected.\n       Section 505 prohibits a reprogramming of funds that: (1) \n     creates or initiates a new program, project or activity; (2) \n     eliminates a program, project, or activity; (3) increases \n     funds or personnel by any means for any project or activity \n     for which funds have been denied or restricted; (4) relocates \n     an office or employee; (5) reorganizes or renames offices, \n     programs or activities; (6) contracts out or privatizes any \n     function or activity presently performed by Federal \n     employees; (7) augments funds for existing programs, projects \n     or activities in excess of $500,000 or 10 percent, whichever \n     is less, or reduces by 10 percent funding for any existing \n     program, project, or activity, or numbers of personnel by 10 \n     percent; or (8) results from any general savings, including \n     savings from a reduction in personnel, which would result in \n     a change in existing programs, activities, or projects as \n     approved by Congress; unless the House and Senate Committees \n     on Appropriations are notified 15 days in advance of such \n     reprogramming of funds.

It is recognized that investors in mortgage-\n     backed securities (MBS) were excluded from negotiations with \n     respect to the settlement, and are concerned about the effect \n     the settlement will have on their interests. MBS investors \n     include State retirement systems, 401(k) plans, public and \n     private pension plans, insurance company annuities, and \n     mutual funds. Because the details of the settlement agreement \n     will likely never be known to the public, the Department of \n     Justice is directed to study both the efforts of the five \n     largest banks to comply with the settlement and the impact of \n     the settlement on the revenue of MBS trusts, and submit a \n     report to the Committees on its findings not later than one \n     year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Section 553 from H.R. 5326 of the 112th Congress regarding \n     the National Ocean Policy is not included.

Instead, direction \n     to NOAA regarding this issue is included under title I of \n     this statement.\n       Section 564 from H.R. 5326 of the 112th Congress regarding \n     the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Climate Change \n     Education (CCE) program is not included.

The \n     language and allocations set forth in House Report 112-493 \n     and Senate Report 112-196 shall be complied with unless \n     specifically addressed to the contrary in the accompanying \n     bill and explanatory statement.\n\n\n              DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY\n\n       The conferees agree that for the purposes of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law \n     99-177), as amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-\n     119) and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law \n     101-508), the terms ``program, project, and activity'' for \n     appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the \n     most specific level of budget items identified in the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013, the related \n     classified annexes and explanatory statements, and the P-1 \n     and R-1 budget justification documents as subsequently \n     modified by congressional action. The following exception to \n     the above definition shall apply: for the military personnel \n     and the operation and maintenance accounts, for which the \n     term ``program, project, and activity'' is defined as the \n     appropriations accounts contained in the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act.\n       At the time the President submits the budget for fiscal \n     year 2014, the Department of Defense is directed to transmit \n     to the congressional defense committees budget justification \n     documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and ``O-1'' which shall \n     identify, at the budget activity, activity group, and sub-\n     activity group level, the amounts requested by the President \n     to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for military \n     personnel and operation and maintenance in any budget \n     request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year 2014.\n       In carrying out any Presidential sequestration, the \n     Department of Defense and related agencies shall conform to \n     the definition for ``program, project, and activity'' set \n     forth above except that military personnel accounts will be \n     exempt from sequestration per the notification made by the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget on July 31, \n     2012.\n\n\n                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX\n\n       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the \n     accompanying classified annex.\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS\n\n       Items for which additional funds have been provided as \n     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the \n     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special \n     interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming \n     (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD \n     Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in \n     the explanatory statement.\n\n\n                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE\n\n       The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to continue \n     to follow the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts \n     as specified in the report accompanying the House version of \n     the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations \n     bill (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance \n     accounts, the Department of Defense shall continue to follow \n     the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference \n     report accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for \n     reprogramming funds shall remain at $15,000,000 for operation \n     and maintenance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 \n     for research, development, test and evaluation.\n       Also, the conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller) to continue to provide the congressional \n     defense committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I \n     and II and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports \n     for service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of \n     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with \n     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying \n     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The \n     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior \n     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified \n     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or \n     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is \n     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for \n     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. \n     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of \n     an operation and maintenance (O-1), a procurement (P-1), or a \n     research, development, test and evaluation (R-1) line exceeds \n     the identified threshold, the Department of Defense must \n     submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional \n     defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the \n     application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for \n     congressional special interest items are established \n     elsewhere in this statement.\n\n\n                           FUNDING INCREASES\n\n       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each \n     appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific \n     purposes indicated in the tables.\n\n\n          SHIP MODERNIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUSTAINMENT FUND\n\n       As detailed in House Report 112-493 and Senate Report 112-\n     196, the conferees remain concerned with the Navy's proposal \n     to prematurely retire capable and relevant ships with over \n     100 years of remaining service life following an initial \n     investment of no less than $11,600,000,000 in current fiscal \n     year 2012 dollars.\n       Therefore, the conferees recommend denying these proposed \n     retirements and direct the Secretary of the Navy to retain \n     this force structure in its entirety. The conferees recommend \n     full funding, as identified by the Navy, to man, operate, \n     sustain, upgrade, and modernize only CG-63, CG-64, CG-65, CG-\n     66, CG-68, CG-69, CG-73, LSD-41, and LSD-46 in the ``Ship \n     Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund'', as \n     specified elsewhere in this conference agreement. The \n     conferees recommend full funding for all known requirements \n     only for these specific platforms for the next two fiscal \n     years, and provide the Secretary of the Navy the authority to \n     transfer funds from the ``Ship Modernization, Operations and \n     Sustainment Fund'' to the appropriate appropriation accounts \n     in the year of execution following 30 day prior notification \n     to the congressional defense committees. The conferees direct \n     funds to be transferred in accordance with the requirements \n     previously identified to the congressional defense committees \n     by the Navy and further direct that any deviation from those \n     requirements shall be fully and clearly identified to the \n     congressional defense committees prior to the initiation of \n     any such transfer. The conferees believe that this approach \n     provides the fiscal relief required by the Navy to maintain \n     this force structure and allows the Navy sufficient time to \n     plan and budget for this force structure in future budget \n     submissions.\n       Additionally, the conferees direct the Comptroller General \n     to review the Navy's methodology and analysis regarding its \n     decommissioning proposal, to include an analysis of the \n     extent to which readiness metrics, maintenance, and \n     inspection data; operating and support costs; and cost \n     metrics related to initial and proposed curtailed service \n     lives were considered. This review shall also address the \n     extent to which decommissioning costs and any costs for \n     maintaining or acquiring like capabilities were \n     considered, the extent to which combatant command \n     requirements were taken into account when the proposal was \n     made, and the impact of the reduced fleet size on the \n     Navy's ability to meet operational and personnel tempo \n     goals and maintenance requirements. The results of this \n     review should be submitted to the congressional defense \n     committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       In addition, the USS Port Royal (CG-73) incurred \n     significant damage following a grounding incident in 2009. \n     Following the incident, the ship was repaired and has since \n     completed a deployment. However, while the Navy claims that \n     the ship never completely recovered from the grounding, the \n     Navy has failed to provide adequate analysis and cost data on \n     the structural condition of the USS Port Royal. Therefore, \n     the conferees direct the Secretary of the Navy to carry out \n     an independent structural assessment of the Port Royal that \n     includes a comparative structural assessment to other \n     cruisers of the same class. The independent review shall \n     provide a detailed cost estimate to repair the ship and how \n     that estimate differs from the cost to repair other cruisers \n     of the same class, including what issues would be corrected \n     during planned maintenance availabilities. The conferees \n     further direct that this independent assessment be certified \n     by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Both the \n     independent review and the GAO certification should be \n     submitted to the congressional defense committees not later \n     than 180 days after the enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                            FORCE STRUCTURE\n\n       The conferees agree to include a provision that prohibits \n     the Air Force from using funds made available by this Act to \n     retire, divest, realign, or transfer aircraft, or to \n     disestablish or convert units, with an exception for actions \n     proposed in the fiscal year 2013 budget request affecting C-\n     5, C-17, and E-8 aircraft, and their associated units.\n       The conferees do not agree to require the Air Force to \n     submit cost-benefit analyses for the force structure \n     proposals in the fiscal year 2013 budget request, as proposed \n     by the House. However, the conferees expect that any future \n     force structure proposals submitted by the Air Force will be \n     transparently and comprehensively justified.\n\n\n                              CONFERENCES\n\n       The conferees agree to not retain a reporting requirement \n     as established in House Report 112-493 accompanying the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013, which directs \n     the Inspector General to provide reports to the congressional \n     defense committees on conferences.\n\n\n                           TREATY COMPLIANCE\n\n       The conferees believe compliance with nuclear arms control \n     treaties is vital to our national security. The Secretary of \n     Defense is directed to notify the congressional defense \n     committees if any parties with which the\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\n     United States has signed a nuclear arms control treaty are \n     violating or acting inconsistently with the terms of that \n     treaty.\n\n\n                      BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE\n\n       The conferees do not support further rounds of Base \n     Realignment and Closure (BRAC). As such, there are no funds \n     included in this Act for new BRAC activities.\n\n                      TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n       The conference agreement provides $127,533,073,000 in Title \n     I, Military Personnel, instead of $128,462,794,000 as \n     proposed by the House and $127,502,463,000 as proposed by the \n     Senate. The conference agreement on items addressed by either \n     the House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.002\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.003\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\n                PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION EFFICIENCIES\n\n       The conferees recommend a total reduction of $146,793,000 \n     in the Permanent Change of Station (PCS) budgets for program \n     efficiencies. The conferees recognize that potential cost \n     savings could be found in the PCS program. The conferees \n     direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and \n     Readiness) to conduct a review of the PCS program to identify \n     potential efficiencies and to submit a report to the \n     congressional defense committees not later than 180 days \n     after the enactment of this Act on its findings. The \n     conferees understand that each of the Services have increased \n     time on station requirements but that the Services are not \n     meeting these goals. As such, the report should include a \n     review of the reasons that the Services have not met the \n     increased time on station goals and a plan to achieve them, \n     including the budget efficiencies that can be gained by \n     increased tour lengths. Furthermore, the report should \n     consider the potential impact of increased tour lengths on \n     servicemembers' job performance and on morale and quality of \n     life for servicemembers and their families. It should also \n     include how a change in policy would impact promotion and \n     professional development opportunities, personnel readiness, \n     and quality of life issues for servicemembers serving in \n     hardship or overseas locations.\n\n\n                          COMPOSITE PAY RATES\n\n       For a number of years, the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) has used the Department of Defense's composite pay \n     rates in its military personnel end strength analysis to \n     estimate the financial impact of work year variances on the \n     Services' military personnel budget requests. Although this \n     information has been important to the congressional defense \n     committees in their budget analyses, the conferees believe \n     that GAO's estimates would be more useful if the analysis was \n     made available earlier in the budget process. Therefore, to \n     improve the timeliness of the GAO analysis, the conferees \n     direct that the Services' composite budget pay rates should \n     be reviewed, approved, and published not later than 30 days \n     after the President's budget request is submitted to the \n     Congress.\n\n                        MILITARY PERSONNEL, ARMY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows: \n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.004\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.005\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.006\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n                        MILITARY PERSONNEL, NAVY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.007\n     \n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.008\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.009\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\n                    MILITARY PERSONNEL, MARINE CORPS\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.010\n     \n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.011\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.012\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n                     MILITARY PERSONNEL, AIR FORCE\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.013\n     \n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.014\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.015\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n                        RESERVE PERSONNEL, ARMY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.016\n     \n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.017\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\n                        RESERVE PERSONNEL, NAVY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.018\n     \n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.019\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n                    RESERVE PERSONNEL, MARINE CORPS\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.020\n     \n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.021\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\n                      RESERVE PERSONNEL, AIR FORCE\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.022\n     \n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.023\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\n                     NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL, ARMY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.024\n     \n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.025\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\n                  NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL, AIR FORCE\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as follows:\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.026\n     \n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH06MR13.027\n     \n\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\n                  TITLE II--OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\n\n       The conference agreement provides $173,494,558,000 in Title \n     II, Operation and Maintenance, instead of $175,103,569,000 as \n     proposed by the House and $170,785,490,000 as proposed by the \n     Senate.

The conferees \n     reiterate the direction in House Report 112-493 regarding \n     congressional budget justifications and reporting \n     requirements for military information support operations.\n\n\n           SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION\n\n       The conferees are aware of a proposal to establish a \n     Special Operations Command National Capital Region (SOCOM-\n     NCR) entity. While no funds were requested for this activity \n     in either the fiscal year 2012 or fiscal year 2013 budget \n     submissions, the conferees understand that SOCOM began this \n     initiative using fiscal year 2012 Overseas Contingency \n     Operations funds. Unfortunately, few details have been \n     provided regarding the basis for this proposal and the \n     expected efficiencies. Therefore, the conferees direct that \n     no funds made available in this Act shall be used for the \n     SOCOM-NCR until 30 days after the congressional defense \n     committees have received a copy of the Secretary of Defense's \n     waiver of Section 8018 of this Act and a report which \n     describes the purpose of, and activities to be performed by \n     the SOCOM-NCR, an explanation of the impact of this proposal \n     on existing activities at SOCOM headquarters, and a detailed, \n     by fiscal year, breakout of the staffing and costs associated \n     with its establishment over the future years defense program.\n\n                    OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, ARMY\n\n       The conference agreement on items addressed by either the \n     House or the Senate is as

Each of these items must be carried on the DD \n     Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in \n     the explanatory statement.\n\n\n            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS\n\n       The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to continue \n     to follow the reprogramming guidance as specified in the \n     report accompanying the House version of the fiscal year 2008 \n     Department of Defense Appropriations bill (House Report 110-\n     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming \n     funds will remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and \n     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.\n       Also, the conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller) to continue to provide the congressional \n     defense committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 \n     reports for service and defense-wide accounts in titles III \n     and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall \n     comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory \n     statement accompanying the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to \n     follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are \n     set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of \n     the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation \n     line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from \n     the base for reprogramming value as modified by any \n     adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers \n     into or out of a procurement (P-1) or research, development, \n     test and evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified \n     threshold, the Department of Defense must submit a prior \n     approval reprogramming to the congressional defense \n     committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of \n     prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional \n     special interest items are established elsewhere in this \n     statement.\n\n\n      DIMINISHING MANUFACTURING SOURCES COSTS IN MISSILE PROGRAMS\n\n       The conferees are concerned by the level of diminishing \n     manufacturing sources (DMS) costs in Department of Defense \n     tactical missile programs, particularly the Advanced Medium \n     Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The conferees direct the \n     Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and \n     Logistics), in coordination with the Service secretaries, to \n     provide two reports to the congressional defense committees.\n       The first report shall provide information on the \n     management of DMS costs within the AMRAAM program, to include \n     an explanation of the cost drivers of AMRAAM DMS; an \n     explanation of the AMRAAM program's approach to DMS \n     management and its conformity with departmental guidance and \n     best practices; an economic analysis demonstrating the costs \n     and benefits, including the break-even point, of the AMRAAM \n     DMS program; and an analysis of the impact of foreign \n     military sales on AMRAAM DMS costs and management. This \n     report shall be submitted not later than 120 days after the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       The second report shall provide information on the broader \n     issue of DMS costs and management across all tactical missile \n     procurement programs. This report shall provide an overview \n     of current strategies for addressing DMS, including current \n     and planned joint activities that address common DMS issues; \n     an explanation of the key tactical missile DMS cost drivers; \n     a comparison of DMS costs across all tactical missile \n     programs; and an analysis of the impact of foreign military \n     sales on DMS costs and management. This report shall be \n     submitted not later than 180 days after the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       In addition, the conferees direct the Secretaries of the \n     Air Force and the Navy to report DMS costs separately from \n     missile unit costs in future budget exhibits to enhance the \n     congressional defense committees' ability to oversee DMS \n     costs.\n\n\n      JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER ADVANCE PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACT DELAYS\n\n       The conferees are concerned with the Joint Strike Fighter \n     (JSF) contract award timelines and the negative impacts on \n     the JSF subcontractor workforce. The combination of \n     inconsistencies in JSF advance procurement for each variant \n     and the contract award delays have a potential to put the \n     industrial base at risk or jeopardize the aircraft delivery \n     schedule. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of \n     Defense to provide a report which examines the authorities \n     and use of JSF advance procurement, including the rationale \n     for the cost differences in advance procurement among the \n     aircraft variants and their associated impacts to the \n     subcontractor workforce. Additionally, the report should \n     examine the causes of procurement contract award delays and \n     the planned corrective action to ensure that final award of \n     the production contracts occurs within the year of \n     appropriation. This report shall be submitted to the \n     congressional defense committees not later than 120 days \n     after the enactment of this Act. USE OF UNM\n\n\n          USE OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES IN DOMESTIC AIRSPACE\n\n       The conferees are aware of concerns that have been raised \n     regarding the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and their \n     sensors in domestic airspace. The conferees understand that \n     the Air Force has policies and procedures in place governing \n     the disposition of UAV collections that may inadvertently \n     capture matters of concern to law enforcement agencies. These \n     policies and procedures are designed to ensure constitutional \n     protections and proper separation between the military and \n     law enforcement.

Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming \n     funds will remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and \n     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.\n       Also, the conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense \n     (Comptroller) to continue to provide the congressional \n     defense committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 \n     reports for service and defense-wide accounts in titles III \n     and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall \n     comply with guidance specified in the explanatory statement \n     accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n     2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation \n     that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the \n     specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement \n     or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever \n     is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for \n     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. \n     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of \n     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and \n     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the \n     Department of Defense must submit a prior approval \n     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In \n     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval \n     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest \n     items are established elsewhere in this statement.\n\n\n           department of defense and service cyber activities\n\n       The conferees understand that the Department is revising \n     the budget justification materials to be provided with the \n     fiscal year 2014 budget submission that are in support of \n     cyber activities.

To limit such transfers and improve \n     oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and \n     maintenance account, the conferees include a provision which \n     caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the \n     TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming \n     procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory \n     statement language included by the conferees should not be \n     interpreted by the Department as limiting the amount of funds \n     that may be transferred to the Direct Care System from other \n     budget activities within the Defense Health Program. In \n     addition, the conferees continue to designate the funding for \n     the Direct Care System as a special interest item. Any \n     transfer of funds from the Direct (or In-house) Care budget \n     activity into the Private Sector Care budget activity or any \n     other budget activity will require the Department of Defense \n     to follow prior approval reprogramming procedures.\n       The Department shall also provide written notification to \n     the congressional defense committees of cumulative transfers \n     in excess of $15,000,000 out of the Private Sector Care \n     budget activity. The conferees further direct the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to provide quarterly \n     reports to the congressional defense committees on budget \n     execution data for all of the Defense Health Program accounts \n     and to adequately reflect changes to the budget activities \n     requested by the Services in future budget submissions.\n\n\n                               CARRYOVER\n\n       For fiscal year 2013, the conferees recommend one percent \n     carryover authority for the operation and maintenance account \n     of the Defense Health Program. The conferees direct the \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to submit a \n     detailed spending plan for any fiscal year 2012 designated \n     carryover funds to the congressional defense committees not \n     less than 30 days prior to executing the carryover funds. \n     I89PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM\n       The conference agreement provides $15,000,000 for a Peer-\n     Reviewed Cancer Research Program that would research cancers \n     not addressed in the breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung \n     cancer research programs currently executed by the Department \n     of Defense, and specifically by the U.S. Army Medical \n     Research and Materiel Command.\n       The funds provided are directed to be used to conduct \n     research in the following areas: melanoma and other skin \n     cancers, pediatric brain tumors, genetic cancer research, \n     pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, blood cancer, colorectal \n     cancer, mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, and listeria vaccine for \n     cancer.\n       The funds provided under the Peer-Reviewed Cancer Research \n     Program shall only be used for the purposes listed above. The \n     conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health \n     Affairs) to provide a report not later than 60 days after the \n     enactment of this Act to the congressional defense committees \n     on the status of the Peer-Reviewed Cancer Research Program. \n     For each research area, the report should include the funding \n     amount awarded, the progress of the research, and the \n     relevance of the research to servicemembers and their \n     families.\n\n\n                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM\n\n       The conference agreement provides $50,000,000 for a Peer-\n     Reviewed Medical Research Program. The conferees direct the \n     Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Service \n     Surgeons General, to select medical research projects of \n     clear scientific merit and direct relevance to military \n     health. Research areas considered under this funding are \n     restricted to the following areas: chronic kidney disease, \n     chronic migraine and post-traumatic headaches, composite \n     tissue transplantation, dengue, DNA vaccine technology for \n     postexposure prophylaxis, dystonia, epilepsy, food allergies, \n     Fragile X syndrome, hantavirus, hereditary angioedema, \n     inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial cystitis, \n     leishmaniasis, lupus, malaria, nanomedicine for drug delivery \n     science, pancreatitis, polycystic kidney disease, post-\n     traumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid \n     arthritis, scleroderma, and tinnitus. The conferees emphasize \n     that the additional funding provided under the Peer-Reviewed \n     Medical Research Program shall be devoted only to the \n     purposes listed above.\n\n\n                  INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD\n\n       The conference agreement includes a provision restricting \n     the amount of funding that may be obligated to develop the \n     integrated Department of Defense-Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (DoD-VA) integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) \n     to 25 percent of the funding provided until the DoD-VA \n     Interagency Program Office (IPO) provides the House and \n     Senate Appropriations Committees an expenditure plan which \n     includes elements such as a budget and cost baseline with \n     annual and total spending for each Department and quarterly \n     milestones. The expenditure plan should also be submitted to \n     the Government Accountability Office for review.\n       The conferees are concerned that after four years of \n     working to establish a joint framework to collaborate and \n     develop an integrated Electronic Health Record, the two \n     Departments still seem to be operating as single entities. \n     The conferees support the creation of the IPO and recognize \n     this office as the single point of accountability for the \n     development and implementation of the integrated Electronic \n     Health Record for both Departments. Unfortunately, since the \n     creation of the IPO and the naming of a director, the \n     conferees have seen little benefit from establishing this \n     office since both Departments appear to operate as separate \n     entities. Despite repeated inquiries, neither the Departments \n     nor the IPO has been able to provide Congress with a firm \n     total cost of the integrated system. The conferees are \n     concerned that the IPO is unable to maintain focus on its \n     defined goals, provide effective governance, manage and \n     maintain accountability on behalf of both Departments, and \n     provide Congress with detailed expenditure plans as well as \n     information regarding the progress and future plans for this \n     project.\n       As a result, the conferees direct the IPO to deliver to the \n     congressional defense committees, the Senate and House \n     Subcommittees on Appropriations for Military Construction, \n     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, and the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) a quarterly report that includes \n     a detailed explanation of the cost and schedule of the iEHR \n     development, to include milestones, knowledge points, and \n     acquisition timelines as they impact both Departments, as \n     well as quarterly obligation reports. The conferees also \n     direct the IPO to continue briefing the House and Senate \n     Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis, coinciding \n     with the report submission. The conferees further direct the \n     GAO to review these quarterly reports and provide an annual \n     report to the congressional defense committees and the Senate \n     and House Subcommittees on Appropriations for Military \n     Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies on the \n     cost and schedule of the iEHR.\n\n           CHEMICAL AGENTS AND MUNITIONS DESTRUCTION, DEFENSE\n\n       The conference agreement provides $1,301,786,000 for \n     Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction, Defense, as \n     proposed by both the House and the Senate.

The conferees reiterate that \n     extremist governments and organizations should not be funded \n     by this Act and that the conferees will closely monitor the \n     expenditure of funds by the Department of Defense regarding \n     such matters.\n\n                           MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n       The conference agreement provides $14,116,821,000 for \n     Military Personnel, instead of $13,934,683,000 as proposed by \n     the House and $14,410,421,000 as proposed by the Senate.

Of that amount, \n     $460,000,000 is for the Army National Guard, $460,000,000 for \n     the Air National Guard, $240,000,000 for the Army Reserve, \n     $90,000,000 for the Navy Reserve, $120,000,000 for the Marine \n     Corps Reserve, and $130,000,000 for the Air Force Reserve to \n     meet urgent equipment needs that may arise this fiscal year.\n       This funding will allow the Guard and reserve components to \n     procure high priority equipment that may be used by these \n     components for both their combat missions and their missions \n     in support of state governors. The conferees direct that the \n     National Guard and Reserve Equipment account shall be \n     executed by the Chiefs of the National Guard and reserve \n     components with priority consideration given to the following \n     items: A-10 Situation Awareness Upgrade; ARC 210 Radios for \n     ANG F-16s; Arctic Search and Rescue Packages; Armory-Based \n     Individual and Unstabilized Gunnery Trainers; Batteries and \n     Battery Support Equipment; Bradley Modifications; C-130 \n     Crash-Resistant Loadmaster Seats; C-130 Secure Line-of-Sight \n     [SLOS] Beyond Line-of-Sight [BLOS] Capability; C-130/KC-135 \n     Real Time Information in Cockpit [RTIC] Data Link; CH-47 Door \n     Gun Mounts; Combat Mobility Equipment; Combined Arms Virtual \n     Trainers; F-15 AESA Radars; Field Engineering, Logistics, \n     Maintenance, and Security Equipment; Force Protection \n     Equipment; Generation 4 Advanced Targeting Pods; Green Laser \n     Interdiction Systems; handheld laser trackers; HC-130 Forward \n     Area Refueling Point; Helicopter Firefighting Equipment; \n     Helmet-Mounted Cueing System; HMMWV Recapitalization; In-\n     Flight Propeller Balancing System; Internal and External \n     Auxiliary Fuel Tanks for Apaches and Chinooks; Joint Threat \n     Emitters; Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures [LAIRCM]; \n     Light Utility Helicopters; Modular Airborne Firefighting \n     System II; Modular Small Arms Training Systems; MRAP Vehicle \n     Virtual Trainers; Naval Construction Force Tactical Vehicles \n     and Support Equipment; Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion; \n     SATCOM Ground Stations; Support Wide Area Network [SWAN] D \n     V3/MRT Packages; Targeting Pod Upgrades; Thermal Imaging \n     Systems; Ultra-Light Tactical Vehicles; Unit Maintenance \n     Aerial Recovery Kits; Virtual Convoy Operations Trainers; and \n     Virtual Door Gunner Trainers.\n\n\n             RESERVE COMPONENT SIMULATION TRAINING SYSTEMS\n\n       The use of simulation training systems has yielded a \n     military that is better trained, more capable, and more \n     confident as compared to units that do not have access to \n     modern simulation training devices. Simulation training is a \n     cost-effective means by which reserve units can improve \n     tactical decision-making skills and ultimately save lives. It \n     is anticipated that a portion of the funding in the National \n     Guard and Reserve Equipment account will be used to procure a \n     variety of simulation training systems. To ensure the most \n     efficient and effective training programs, these systems \n     should be a combination of both government owned and operated \n     simulators, as well as simulation support from a dedicated \n     commercial activity capable of providing frequent hardware \n     and software updates.\n\n\n     NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE EQUIPMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n       The conferees are concerned that the active Services are \n     not providing the necessary research, development, test and \n     evaluation funding for federal and domestic operations \n     requirements as they relate to equipping the reserve \n     components, especially equipment unique to the reserve \n     component or legacy systems with limited active component \n     investment. The conferees understand that the funding \n     required is minimal, and therefore direct the Services, \n     particularly the Air Force, to provide the necessary \n     research, development, test and evaluation funds to ensure \n     that modernizing equipment or legacy systems unique to the \n     reserve component be given the required design, integration, \n     test, and software efforts needed prior to procurement.\n\n               RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION\n\n       The conference agreement provides $247,716,000 for \n     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, instead of \n     $235,516,000 as proposed by the House and $260,413,000 as \n     proposed by the Senate.

Unless otherwise noted, \n     reference to the House and Senate reports are to House Report \n     112-492 and Senate Report 112-169, respectively. The language \n     and allocations contained in House Report 112-492 and Senate \n     Report 112-169 should be complied with and carry the same \n     emphasis as the language included in the explanatory \n     statement, unless specifically addressed to the contrary in \n     the bill or this explanatory statement. While repeating some \n     report language for emphasis, this explanatory statement does \n     not intend to negate the language referred to above unless \n     expressly provided herein. When this explanatory statement \n     refers to the Committees or the Committees on Appropriations, \n     unless otherwise noted, this reference is to the House \n     Subcommittee on Homeland Security and the Senate Subcommittee \n     on the Department of Homeland Security. In cases where the \n     explanatory statement directs the submission of a report, \n     such report shall be provided to the Committees on \n     Appropriations by April 3, 2013, unless otherwise directed. \n     In cases where the explanatory statement directs a briefing, \n     such briefing shall be provided to the Committees by April 3, \n     2013, unless otherwise directed.\n       This explanatory statement refers to the following laws and \n     organizations as follows: Implementing Recommendations of the \n     9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Public Law 110-53, is referenced \n     as the 9/11 Act; Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 93-288 is referenced as \n     the Stafford Act; the Department of Homeland Security is \n     referenced as DHS or the Department; the Government \n     Accountability Office is referenced as GAO; and the Office of \n     Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security is \n     referenced as OIG. In addition, any reference to ``full-time \n     equivalents'' shall be referred to as FTE; any reference to \n     ``program, project, and activity'' shall be referred to as \n     PPA; and any reference to ``the Secretary'' shall be \n     interpreted to mean the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n                          Classified Programs\n\n       Recommended adjustments to classified programs are \n     addressed in a classified annex accompanying this explanatory \n     statement.\n\n            TITLE I--DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS\n\n            Office of the Secretary and Executive Management\n\n       The bill provides $130,000,000 for ``Office of the \n     Secretary and Executive Management.'' Not to exceed $45,000 \n     of this funding shall be for official reception and \n     representation expenses, and the Department is directed to \n     submit quarterly reports to the Committees on DHS reception \n     and representation expenses, as specified in the Senate \n     report. The amount provided under this heading does not \n     include $370,000 as requested, for a civilian pay raise. \n     Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, \n     it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. The bill \n     also continues a provision requiring that funds made \n     available for ``Immediate Office of the Secretary'' and \n     ``Immediate Office of the Deputy Secretary'' shall be used to \n     pay for official costs associated with use of government \n     aircraft by DHS personnel in support of official travel of \n     the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. In addition, a new \n     general provision is included in the bill withholding 20 \n     percent of this appropriation from obligation until the \n     Committees receive the reports and plans required in this Act \n     to be submitted on or before May 1, 2013. New bill language \n     also is included that mandates the submission of expenditure \n     plans for the Office of Policy, Office of Intergovernmental \n     Affairs, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the \n     Privacy Officer not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. This language supersedes reporting \n     requirements set forth in the Senate report.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nImmediate Office of the Secretary............................$4,286,000\nImmediate Office of the Deputy Secretary......................2,094,000\nOffice of the Chief of Staff..................................2,175,000\nExecutive Secretary...........................................7,592,000\nOffice of Policy.............................................43,750,000\nOffice of Public Affairs......................................5,475,000\nOffice of Legislative Affairs.................................5,800,000\nOffice of Intergovernmental Affairs...........................2,380,000\nOffice of General Counsel....................................21,158,000\nOffice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties..................21,640,000\nCitizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman................5,650,000\nPrivacy Officer...............................................8,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n    Total, Office of the Secretary and Executive Management$130,000,000\n\n                  Executive Aircraft Usage and Funding\n\n       Congress adopted a new proviso covering the funding of \n     official travel on government aircraft as part of the fiscal \n     year 2010 appropriation for the Office of the Secretary and \n     Executive Management (OSEM), and that language has remained \n     in effect. Congressional intent set forth in the explanatory \n     statement of managers for that appropriation, and reaffirmed \n     since, is that the OSEM appropriation is to be used to fund \n     all official costs associated with the use of government \n     aircraft by the Department of Homeland Security personnel to \n     support official travel of the Secretary and the Deputy \n     Secretary. This proviso was adopted to provide increased \n     oversight of executive travel. The Committees understand, \n     however, that the Department has narrowly interpreted the \n     proviso by defining as ``direct'' costs those that are funded \n     by the OSEM appropriation and as ``indirect'' costs those \n     that are funded by the Coast Guard.\n       The Secretary is directed to provide a report no later than \n     April 3, 2013, detailing all costs of official and \n     nonofficial travel by the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary \n     (both direct and indirect), delineated by each trip from \n     fiscal year 2008 through the present within all DHS \n     appropriations.\n\n                            Office of Policy\n\n       The bill includes $43,750,000 for the Office of Policy. \n     This funding should also cover the costs of the Office of \n     International Affairs, Office of State and Local Law \n     Enforcement, and the Private Sector Office. The Committees \n     deny the request to fund those three offices as separate \n     entities that report directly to the Secretary.\n\n                            External Affairs\n\n       The Department is directed to brief the Committees no later \n     than April 3, 2013, on the potential of establishing an \n     external affairs office within OSEM, as discussed in the \n     House report.\n\n              Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\n\n       The bill includes $21,640,000 for the Office for Civil \n     Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), reflecting programmatic \n     increases proposed by the Department to ensure immigration \n     enforcement efforts are carried out in a manner consistent \n     with applicable law.\n\n                 Appropriate Assistance to Stakeholders\n\n       Funds are available in a number of DHS offices and \n     components, including CRCL, the\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\n     Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, U.S. \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and United States \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Customer Service \n     and Public Engagement Directorate, to provide appropriate \n     assistance and guidance to aliens and their advocates in \n     order to facilitate adherence to U.S. laws and, where \n     possible, avoid costly and needless litigation. These \n     entities assist in communication between the Department and \n     its various stakeholders. Frequently, this results in \n     budgetary savings when the correct information is provided at \n     the earliest stages of the immigration process. The \n     Committees support these efforts.\n\n                               User Fees\n\n       The Secretary is directed to submit to the Committees as \n     soon as possible the contingency plan to address gaps between \n     actual and budgeted collections of user fees mandated in the \n     conference report accompanying Public Law 111-83, and submit \n     a revised plan no later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n          Quarterly Reports and Other Information Requirements\n\n       The Committees underscore the importance of timely \n     submission of quarterly reports on operations, as outlined in \n     the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 112-\n     74. DHS shall continue to submit the Border Security Status \n     Reports, the Secure Communities Quarterly Reports, and the \n     Detention and Removal Operations Quarterly Reports with the \n     detailed information as required by such statement. In \n     addition, the information on apprehensions and recidivism \n     rates noted in the House report shall be included in the \n     Border Security Status Reports for fiscal year 2013 and \n     beyond.\n       The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE are to \n     brief the Committees no later than April 3, 2013, on their \n     tools to reduce recidivism, as required by the House report.\n       Further, the Office of Immigration Statistics, in \n     conjunction with all the relevant DHS components, are to \n     brief the Committees no later than April 3, 2013, regarding \n     collection and reporting of complete immigration enforcement \n     statistics, as required by the House report.\n\n       Weapons of Mass Destruction Policy and Program Management\n\n       Language in the House report regarding the need to elevate \n     and streamline the Department's focus on efforts to address \n     chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats and \n     deter and counter weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is agreed \n     to. In particular, DHS should ensure clear assignment of \n     responsibilities and unrestricted lines of communication both \n     within the Department and in DHS engagement with the \n     interagency and intergovernmental community. In working \n     towards this, DHS should eliminate duplication of efforts \n     within and between Departmental components, both in terms of \n     administrative resources and organization. The Department is \n     therefore directed to undertake an in-depth review of its \n     organization, operations, and communications in carrying out \n     its WMD programs, to include an evaluation of potential \n     improvements in performance and possible savings in costs \n     that might be gained by consolidation of current \n     organizations and missions, including the option of merging \n     functions of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and \n     the Office of Health Affairs (OHA). While evaluating this \n     option, consideration should be given to realigning certain \n     functions outside of the new office, as detailed in the House \n     report. The review should encompass all current and \n     authorized DHS program activity for WMD defense; examine \n     options for improvements on a holistic, department-wide \n     basis, for carrying out these functions and operations; and \n     include specific recommendations, to include statutory, \n     organizational, administrative and funding changes. The \n     Secretary is directed to submit the results of this review \n     not later than September 1, 2013. Submission of this review \n     is in lieu of the direction contained in the House report to \n     develop a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an \n     Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for fiscal year \n     2014.\n\n           Federally Funded Research and Development Centers\n\n       The Department is directed to submit a detailed report at \n     the time it submits its fiscal year 2014 budget on its \n     current and projected use of federally funded research and \n     development centers (FFRDCs), identifying FFRDCs used by \n     components and projects they are supporting, and detailing \n     FFRDC by project and appropriation for fiscal years 2012 and \n     projected for fiscal years 2013 and 2014.\n\n                            TWIC Reader Rule\n\n       The Department, and in particular the Coast Guard and the \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA), is directed to \n     take all necessary action to expedite the completion and \n     publication of a final rule governing the Transportation \n     Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) reader requirement.\n\n                            Evolving Threats\n\n       DHS is directed to brief the Committees on how it is \n     applying its resources to address evolving terrorist threats, \n     as specified in the Senate report.\n\n                           Chemical Security\n\n       Congress directed the Coast Guard and the National \n     Protection and Programs Directorate to complete a planned \n     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to harmonize chemical \n     security responsibilities established by the Chemical \n     Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) regulations and \n     Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulatory \n     programs no later than March 30, 2012, but the agreement has \n     not been finalized. The MOU is to be completed expeditiously. \n     The Deputy Secretary is also directed to continue semiannual \n     reporting to the Committees on these matters as outlined in \n     Senate Report 112-74.\n\n                     Departmental Integrity Efforts\n\n       The Deputy Secretary, jointly with the OIG, CBP, and ICE, \n     is directed to brief the Committees not later than 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act on steps for \n     addressing corruption of DHS employees, as discussed in the \n     Senate report.\n\n                  Compact of Freely Associated States\n\n       The Department is directed to promulgate regulations for \n     the admission and residency of Freely Associated States (FAS) \n     migrants, and to continue its work within the National \n     Security Council Interagency Policy Committee on Freely \n     Associated State Affairs, as stated in the Senate report.\n\n                             Overhead Costs\n\n       The Department is directed to submit a plan to reduce \n     overhead costs within 60 days of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, as specified in the Senate report.\n\n               Research and Development Portfolio Reviews\n\n       The Secretary is directed, through the Under Secretary for \n     Science and Technology, to establish a review process for all \n     research and development and related work within DHS, as \n     specified in the Senate report, and to brief the Committees \n     on this effort no later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                     Port Security Training Program\n\n       The Department and Coast Guard are directed to move forward \n     with issuing new national requirements for security training \n     at marine terminals, as stated in the Senate report.\n\n              Office of the Under Secretary for Management\n\n       The bill provides $218,511,000 for ``Office of the Under \n     Secretary for Management.'' Not to exceed $2,250 of this \n     funding shall be for official reception and representation \n     expenses. The amount provided under this heading does not \n     include $538,000, as requested, for a civilian pay raise. \n     Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, \n     it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       A new general provision is included withholding 20 percent \n     of this appropriation from obligation until the Committees \n     receive the reports and plans required in this Act to be \n     submitted on or before May 1, 2013. In addition bill language \n     is included requiring the Under Secretary for Management to \n     submit to the Committees, at the same time the President's \n     fiscal year 2014 budget is submitted, a Comprehensive \n     Acquisition Status Report (CASR) including the information \n     specified in the joint explanatory statement accompanying \n     Public Law 112-74, and to provide quarterly updates \n     thereafter.\n       Pursuant to a general provision in Title V of this Act, the \n     bill provides $29,000,000 for ``Office of the Under Secretary \n     for Management'' for costs associated with headquarters \n     consolidation and mission support consolidation. The Under \n     Secretary shall submit an expenditure plan no later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act detailing how \n     this $29,000,000 in total funding will be allocated, \n     including a revised schedule and cost estimates for \n     headquarters consolidation. Quarterly briefings are required \n     on headquarters and mission support consolidation activities, \n     including any deviation from the expenditure plan.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nImmediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management.......$3,100,000\nOffice of the Chief Security Officer.........................69,000,000\nOffice of the Chief Procurement Officer......................72,000,000\nOffice of the Chief Human Capital Officer\n    Salaries and Expenses....................................24,971,000\n    Human Resources Information Technology....................9,680,000\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Subtotal...............................................34,651,000\nOffice of the Chief Administrative Officer\n    Salaries and Expenses....................................34,312,000\n    Nebraska Avenue Complex...................................5,448,000\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Subtotal...............................................39,760,000\n                                                       ================\n\n    Total, Office of the Under Secretary for Management....$218,511,000\n\n               Insourcing and Balanced Workforce Strategy\n\n       The Department has been carrying out a program to balance \n     its workforce between direct employees and contractor-held \n     positions in the interest of achieving the optimal degree of \n     Federal control of DHS work and to reduce overreliance on \n     contractors. In order to assess the performance of this \n     effort, and its relative costs and benefits, the Department \n     is directed to include in the President's\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n     annual budget request a detailed justification of any planned \n     insourcing or outsourcing initiatives to include a net \n     present value comparison of the life-cycle cost of a \n     contracted position or task to the cost of a federalized FTE. \n     In addition, the Department is directed to submit to the \n     Committees not later than April 3, 2013, a detailed report on \n     the performance of the Department's balanced workforce \n     strategy, including numbers of insourcing or outsourcing \n     decisions by component for each of fiscal years 2009-2012, \n     associated savings or costs resulting from those decisions, \n     and methodology and metrics used in the analysis.\n\n                       Buy American Requirements\n\n       The Secretary is directed to submit, as part of the fiscal \n     year 2014 budget request, a detailed analysis on how the \n     Department could comply with Title VI of Section 604 of \n     Public Law 111-5, as specified in the House report.\n\n                    Front-End Technology Assessment\n\n       The Under Secretaries for Management and for Science and \n     Technology are directed to develop a plan for a formal \n     technology assessment of alternatives for all non-information \n     technology acquisitions and to brief the Committees as stated \n     in the Senate report.\n\n                 Office of the Cheif Financial Officer\n\n       The bill provides $51,500,000 for ``Office of the Chief \n     Financial Officer.'' Within this, $5,000,000 shall remain \n     available until September 30, 2014, to support financial \n     systems modernization efforts. The amount provided under this \n     heading does not include $144,000, as requested, for a \n     civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a civilian \n     pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay \n     raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2013. A new general provision in this Act \n     withholding 20 percent of this appropriation from obligation \n     until the Committees receive the reports and plans required \n     in this Act to be submitted on or before May 1, 2013.\n\n                    Financial Systems Modernization\n\n       The Chief Financial Officer is directed to continue \n     providing briefings to the Committees at least semiannually \n     on its financial systems modernization efforts, and to \n     highlight any funding, schedule, or implementation issues \n     relevant to continued progress. Because the Coast Guard and \n     ICE are planning improvements for their core financial \n     systems, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, in tandem \n     with the Coast Guard and ICE, are to brief the Committees on \n     the preferred solutions before funds can be obligated to \n     initiate improvement efforts. The briefing is to include \n     total resource requirements by fiscal year and a timeline for \n     implementation with discrete milestones.\n\n                      Annual Budget Justifications\n\n       The Chief Financial Officer is directed to ensure that \n     fiscal year 2014 budget justifications for classified and \n     unclassified budgets of all Department components are \n     submitted concurrent with the President's budget submission \n     to Congress. The justifications shall include detailed \n     information and explanations that reflect the requirements \n     set forth under this heading in the Senate report. The \n     Department is directed to submit a Future Years Homeland \n     Security Program budget as specified in the House report. In \n     addition, the Department is directed to inform the Committees \n     of the base funding level of any activity for which the \n     budget request proposes to increase or decrease funding for \n     an activity within a PPA category--and not simply cite the \n     total PPA funding level.\n\n                      DHS Annual Financial Report\n\n       The Department is commended for achieving a significant \n     milestone by presenting all five financial statements for \n     audit for the first time in the Department's history and \n     earning its first qualified audit opinion on a full-scope \n     audit. The Committees will closely monitor the Department's \n     progress moving forward in clearing remaining material \n     weaknesses in Financial Reporting, Information Technology \n     Controls and Financial System Functionality, Property, Plant, \n     and Equipment, Environmental and other Liabilities, and \n     Budgetary Accounting, and achieving full compliance with the \n     Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), \n     the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 \n     (FFMIA), the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, and the \n     Anti-deficiency Act (ADA).\n\n                        Appropriations Liaisons\n\n       The DHS Budget Officer shall serve as the primary point of \n     contact with the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations for Departmental and cross-cutting interagency \n     issues related to budget formulation and execution, with \n     component Chief Financial Officers and Budget Officers \n     serving as primary points of contact for those components, as \n     proposed in the House report.\n\n                Office of the Chief Information Officer\n\n       The bill provides $243,732,000 for ``Office of the Chief \n     Information Officer.'' The amount provided under this heading \n     does not include $200,000, as requested, for a civilian pay \n     raise. Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for \n     2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be \n     absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. \n     Language is continued requiring the submission of a multi-\n     year investment justification and management plan. This plan \n     is intended to cover investments funded through this account \n     as well as those overseen by the CIO through the Working \n     Capital Fund (WCF). However, the plan should not include \n     investments funded under other appropriations, as such \n     information is provided in other reports. The CIO is not \n     required to keep the Committees informed about developments \n     in mitigating insider threats, as proposed by the House, as \n     this matter is addressed elsewhere in the Department.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nSalaries and Expenses......................................$118,000,000\nInformation Technology Services..............................27,600,000\nInfrastructure and Security Activities.......................56,000,000\nHomeland Secure Data Network.................................42,132,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n    Total, Office of the Chief Information Officer.........$243,732,000\n\n                         Data Center Migration\n\n       The bill provides $55,000,000 for data center migration \n     under a general provision in Title V of this Act. The \n     Department is directed to continue to brief the Committees \n     quarterly on data center migration status and plans for \n     further migration in fiscal year 2014.\n\n                  HSPD -12/Trusted Internet Connection\n\n       Given the significant investment that will be required to \n     transition the Department to logical access as required by \n     Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Department \n     is directed to submit an implementation plan that includes \n     estimated costs and deployment milestones by component no \n     later than April 3, 2013. The Department is also directed to \n     provide semiannual briefings to the Committees on its \n     progress in developing trusted internet connections, in lieu \n     of quarterly briefings on OneNet implementation and Networx \n     migration proposed in the Senate report.\n\n                        Analysts and Operations\n\n       A total of $322,280,000 is provided for ``Analysis and \n     Operations,'' of which $94,359,000 shall remain available \n     until September 30, 2014, and of which not to exceed $3,825 \n     shall be for official reception and representation expenses. \n     No additional funding is provided for a civilian pay raise. \n     Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, \n     it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. The \n     requested increase in executive service salaries for the \n     Office of Operations Coordination and Planning is denied as \n     is the requested increase in funding associated with the Air \n     Domain Intelligence Integration Element. In addition, \n     $1,800,000 of prior year balances is rescinded. Other funding \n     details are included within the accompanying classified \n     annex.\n       As detailed in the Senate report, the Chief Intelligence \n     Officer is directed to submit an expenditure plan for fiscal \n     year 2013 no later than 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act. Furthermore, the Office of Intelligence and \n     Analysis is directed to continue to provide annual briefings \n     on the State and Local Fusion Center Program, as specified in \n     the Senate report.\n\n                      Office of Inspector General\n\n       The bill provides $145,164,000 for ``Office of Inspector \n     General,'' including $121,164,000 for direct appropriations \n     and $24,000,000 transferred from the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency ``Disaster Relief Fund'' (DRF) for audits \n     and investigations related to that funding. The amount \n     provided under this heading does not include $400,000, as \n     requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should the President \n     provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the \n     cost of the pay raise will be absorbed within existing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013. The OIG is directed to \n     submit a plan for expenditure of all funds no later than 30 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act and to include \n     DRF transfers in the CFO's monthly budget execution reports \n     submitted to the Committees, which shall satisfy the \n     requirements for notification of DRF transfers under a \n     general provision in Title V of this Act.\n\n                        Integrity Investigations\n\n       Within the total provided, an increase of $3,000,000 is \n     provided for integrity investigations. The fiscal year 2013 \n     expenditure plan should identify the total funds dedicated to \n     integrity investigations and their intended purpose.\n\n                               GAO Review\n\n       The Committees are concerned that the current organization \n     of the OIG may not allow for adequate independence of the \n     OIG's inspections and evaluations function, and that current \n     organizational reporting lines hinder the timely and complete \n     delivery of information to OIG leadership. Recent \n     developments at OIG that have left many senior positions \n     occupied by acting heads have adversely affected OIG's \n     ability to manage its growing workload, and raised questions \n     about its effectiveness and reliability in conducting \n     investigative operations for which it has been assigned \n     unique jurisdiction within DHS. This has occurred at a time \n     when the workload for OIG is growing, compounded by the need \n     to address the potential of fraud associated with ever \n     increasing disaster assistance and the highly sensitive issue \n     of integrity investigations in the Department, particularly \n     with regard to border security operations. GAO is directed to \n     undertake a review of (1) the organizational structure of the \n     OIG; (2) how OIG is organized to report the results of \n     audits, investigations, and inspections and evaluations; and \n     (3) whether these functions are properly placed within the \n     organizational structure of OIG to ensure compliance with \n     applicable independence standards. The review should be \n     completed by December 1, 2013.\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\n          TITLE II--SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT, AND INVESTIGATIONS\n\n                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       A total of $8,293,351,000 is provided for ``Salaries and \n     Expenses.'' The funding level reflects changes in the \n     activities supported by this appropriation. In addition, the \n     bill institutes a new PPA structure and distribution for \n     greater accountability.\n       The bill provides $315,000,000 in appropriated funds to \n     rectify CBP's salary shortfall, created by the flawed budget \n     request that incorrectly assumed CBP access to fee revenues \n     and demonstrated inexcusably poor budget development by CBP. \n     Specifically, the President's budget request for fiscal year \n     2013 assumes that CBP has access to $110,000,000 in fee \n     revenues pursuant to the Colombia Free Trade Agreement's \n     elimination of certain exemptions to the Consolidated Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) fees. While the \n     fees are being collected today from travelers entering the \n     United States, the fees are not accessible to CBP. Further, \n     the shortfall created by this inaccessibility persists \n     annually until fiscal year 2022. The Department is directed, \n     in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget \n     (OMB), to include a means of access to these fees in the \n     fiscal year 2014 budget request and beyond, with appropriate \n     offsets. The gap cannot be filled by appropriated funds and \n     trade-offs within CBP accounts into the future.\n       Compounding this deficit, CBP failed to adequately estimate \n     its salary needs for its operational workforce resulting in \n     an estimated $214,000,000 shortage in fiscal year 2013. After \n     months of unanswered questions from OMB, DHS, and CBP, the \n     House Appropriations Committee undertook an audit of CBP's \n     budget development and execution processes that revealed \n     significant weaknesses. The Department is directed to ensure \n     the fiscal year 2014 request fully funds CBP's operational \n     workforce and mission needs. Further, the Committees will \n     continue to work with CBP in the coming months to ensure the \n     weaknesses are addressed.\n       The CBP funding level reflects savings and deferments \n     proposed by CBP to reduce the shortfall, including: \n     $50,000,000 in rent savings and deferrals; $10,000,000 in \n     project reprioritization and cancellations taken from \n     Facilities Construction and Sustainment; and $35,889,000 from \n     deferment of vehicle replacement. While the Committees are \n     concerned about longer term deferment of vehicle replacement, \n     CBP currently has a sufficient, well-maintained fleet for \n     fiscal year 2013. CBP proposed other, internal offsets that \n     were wholly unacceptable. No funds are included for the Joint \n     Operations Division created by CBP in 2011.\n       The amount provided under this heading does not include the \n     full amount requested for a civilian pay raise. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. However, \n     to avoid exacerbating CBP's pay shortfall, the bill provides \n     $19,558,000 across the appropriate PPAs and in the ``Air and \n     Marine Operations'' appropriation as a contingency for a \n     potential pay raise to cover operational personnel. Should \n     the President decide not to institute the pay raise, CBP \n     shall apply those funds to other operational needs, in \n     accordance with a general provision in Title V and with \n     appropriate notification to the Committees.\n       The bill also restructures the Headquarters Management and \n     Administration PPAs to provide greater visibility into CBP's \n     expenditures, as outlined in the House report. The new PPA \n     structure is provided in the table listed below. In the \n     fiscal year 2014 budget request, CBP is directed to \n     distribute the working capital fund expenditures among the \n     PPAs as appropriate to reflect the actual costs to each CBP \n     office rather than including a total in the Administration \n     PPA.\n       Further, funds in existing PPAs across the ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' appropriation are redistributed to more closely \n     align to offices, as outlined in the House report. For \n     example, the Office of Information Technology (OIT) is funded \n     for its activities in the Automated Targeting Systems (ATS) \n     and Inspection and Detection Technology Investments PPAs, in \n     addition to the funds in the ``Automation Modernization'' \n     appropriation that now contains OIT's salaries and expenses.\n       Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation \n     (Inspections) is funded at $3,206,458,000, including \n     $215,000,000 to address part of the salary shortfall noted \n     above; $5,747,000 for prior year annualization of CBP officer \n     staffing enhancements; $14,076,000 for annualization of CBP \n     officer staff for new ports of entry and enhanced operations; \n     $10,000,000 as requested for enhancing intellectual property \n     rights enforcement efforts; $13,032,000 to re-baseline the \n     Container Security Initiative; realignment of funds to the \n     Other International Programs PPA from International Cargo \n     Screening; and consolidation of funds into the ATS and \n     National Targeting Center PPAs to more fully display the \n     costs of those activities. Other International Programs is \n     reduced by $2,218,000, as recommended in the Senate report. \n     As included in the House report, $12,284,000 is provided to \n     the Office of Field Operations for its entry-exit policy and \n     operations responsibilities. CBP is expected to maintain no \n     less than 21,775 CBP officers, a number adjusted by CBP from \n     prior year targets to account for all CBP officers as \n     intended.\n       Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry is \n     funded at $3,705,735,000, which reflects an $8,000,000 \n     decrease to transfer responsibility for detainee medical \n     costs to ICE, $11,500,000 in cost savings for detainee \n     transportation, $100,000,000 to address part of the salary \n     shortfall noted above, and full funding for the Office of \n     Border Patrol and the Joint Field Command. This level \n     continues to support a Border Patrol agent force of 21,370.\n       The Air and Marine Operations PPA is moved to the ``Air and \n     Marine Operations'' appropriation and renamed the Salaries \n     and Expenses PPA. As outlined in the House report, the PPA \n     does not include funds for the Joint Operations Division and \n     the Joint Field Command.\n       The Committees reject the proposal to move the United \n     States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-\n     VISIT) from the National Protection and Programs Directorate \n     (NPPD) to CBP. Instead, the bill realigns the policy and \n     operational responsibilities of US-VISIT while retaining the \n     information technology systems in a new Office of Biometric \n     Identity Management (OBIM) in NPPD discussed later.\n       CBP has long been subject to limitations, terms and \n     conditions on overtime funds that are carried in the Salaries \n     and Expenses appropriation. Funds moved from the Salaries and \n     Expenses appropriation into the ``Automation Modernization'' \n     and ``Air and Marine Operations'' appropriations are still \n     subject to those limitations, terms and conditions.\n       The amount provided for the ``Salaries and Expenses'' \n     appropriation by PPA is as follows:\nHeadquarters, Management, and Administration:\n    Commissioner............................................$17,415,000\n    Chief Counsel............................................43,078,000\n    Congressional Affairs.....................................2,568,000\n    Internal Affairs........................................154,108,000\n    Public Affairs...........................................12,563,000\n    Training and Development.................................77,721,000\n    Tech, Innovation, Acquisition............................26,004,000\n    Intelligence/Investigative Liaison.......................68,156,000\n    Administration..........................................414,674,000\n    Rent....................................................564,871,000\n      Subtotal............................................1,381,158,000\nBorder Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation:\n    Inspections, trade, and travel facilitation at ports o2,718,654,000\n    Harbor maintenance fee collection (trust fund)............3,274,000\n    International cargo screening............................71,487,000\n    Other international programs.............................14,799,000\n    Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).....43,069,000\n    Trusted Traveler programs................................10,811,000\n    Inspection and detection technology investments.........117,565,000\n    Automated Targeting Systems.............................113,826,000\n    National Targeting Center................................68.127,000\n    Training.................................................34,846,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Subtotal............................................3,206,458,000\nBorder Security and Control between Ports of Entry:\n    Border security and control...........................3,631,796,000\n    Training.................................................73,939,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Subtotal............................................3,705,735,000\n                                                       ================\n\nTotal, Salaries and Expenses.............................$8,293,351,000\n\n                             Financial Plan\n\n       CBP is directed to submit its fiscal year 2013 financial \n     plan by office no later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, consistent with the new distribution \n     and PPAs. Additionally, CBP shall include the working capital \n     fund estimates by office and PPA.\n\n                    Management of User Fee Revenues\n\n       CBP has not demonstrated the ability to manage fluctuations \n     in fee funding levels. Given that approximately 37 percent of \n     CBP officers are funded by user fees, the failure to properly \n     project and manage these fees has a significant operational \n     impact--not only on CBP but on the traveling public and on \n     our national security posture. To address these failures and \n     to assist the Committees in their oversight, the Commissioner \n     is directed to take the actions required by the House report \n     on user fee management. In addition, as required by the \n     Senate report, CBP shall brief on the use of APHIS fee \n     revenues and report on steps to advance its relationship with \n     port authorities on staffing.\n\n                              Fee Balances\n\n       As directed in the House report, CBP shall report on the \n     final determination regarding the availability of \n     $639,400,000 in unobligated fee balances and the path for \n     eliminating them from CBP's financial statements. \n     Unfortunately, these funds are not accessible to CBP; \n     however, the agency has not responded adequately to the \n     question of availability raised by GAO.\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n                      Innovation and Facilitation\n\n       CBP is directed to continue considering and instituting \n     innovations to more efficiently process legitimate travel and \n     trade, such as those outlined in the House report. Further, \n     the bill provides funds above the request toward this end, \n     including $10,000,000 for preclearance operations and \n     $2,500,000 for improved signage and information about the \n     entry process, as recommended in the Senate report, and \n     $4,500,000 for Global Entry expansion, kiosks, and promotion, \n     as recommended in the House and Senate reports. No later than \n     60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall \n     brief the Committees in detail on its full fiscal year 2013 \n     funding for these activities as well as the use of the \n     increased funds.\n\n                        Workload Staffing Model\n\n       The Department is directed to immediately submit the CBP \n     workload staffing model for Field Operations required by the \n     joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 112-74. \n     This report, which has languished in a bureaucratic clearance \n     ``do loop,'' is necessary for a responsible dialogue on CBP \n     mission needs, including any demonstrated staffing needs.\n\n                        Cargo Security Strategy\n\n       The bill provides an additional $3,000,000 for the Customs-\n     Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program to \n     ensure audits of participants are conducted as needed based \n     on a risk determination. No later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committees in \n     detail on its full fiscal year 2013 funding for C-TPAT as \n     well as the use of the increased funds.\n       Further, the Committees concur with the direction and \n     concerns outlined in the House report regarding the cargo \n     security strategy and look forward to seeing the Secretary \n     develop and propose a meaningful alternative to 100 percent \n     scanning.\n\n                               Targeting\n\n       The bill provides an additional $3,000,000 for National \n     Targeting Center (NTC) operations to cover pre-adjudication \n     vetting of visa applicants. No later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committees \n     in detail on its full fiscal year 2013 funding for NTC as \n     well as the use of the increased funds.\n       As required in the House report, CBP is directed to provide \n     a detailed accounting of funds executed by the Targeting \n     Analysis Systems Project Office no later than 30 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act. CBP shall also include an \n     annual update of this information with the President's budget \n     request.\n\n                    Entry-Exit Policy and Operations\n\n       CBP is the DHS lead for entry-exit policy and operations, \n     as recommended by the House. Responsibility for implementing \n     a biometric exit program lies with CBP. Within 120 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, CBP, in conjunction with \n     OBIM and any other appropriate partners, such as the Science \n     and Technology Directorate, shall report to the Senate \n     Committees on Appropriations, the Judiciary, and Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committees on \n     Appropriations, the Judiciary, and Homeland Security on the \n     Department's tangible progress in implementing an enhanced \n     biographic exit system and biometric exit planning. The \n     report shall include the results of the Canadian pilot \n     programs and provide an update on the Mexican pilot program. \n     The Committees on Appropriations shall be briefed \n     semiannually on exit thereafter.\n\n        Border Patrol and Border Security Between Ports of Entry\n\n       CBP shall submit a report to the Committees no later than \n     90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on its five-\n     year staffing and deployment plan for the Border Patrol. In \n     addition, the budget justification for fiscal year 2014 shall \n     include a plan detailing staffing and funding for the \n     Northern Border. Further, CBP is prohibited from closing \n     Border Patrol stations in Texas, as proposed in the budget \n     request. CBP and ICE have not produced a transition plan to \n     ensure the immigration enforcement needs of local sheriffs \n     will be supported without a Border Patrol presence.\n\n                     Joint Field Command Structure\n\n       While CBP allocated funds within its budget for the Joint \n     Field Command (JFC), it is important to reassess the cost-\n     benefit of operating the JFC, particularly as CBP considers \n     other joint operation and coordination structures and \n     confronts enormous budget challenges. The need for \n     operational coordination within CBP is no less imperative \n     than its coordination with ICE, Coast Guard, and other law \n     enforcement agencies active in a particular area of \n     responsibility. Therefore, CBP is directed to brief the \n     Committees, no later than 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, on all plans, milestones, and costs for \n     establishing and operating joint field efforts, as required \n     in the House report. In addition, the brief shall include the \n     cost-benefit of operating the JFC.\n\n                           Integrity Programs\n\n       The bill supports CBP efforts to reduce and prevent \n     corruption, as well as ensure that its ethics, integrity, and \n     conduct programs include training at all stages of an agent's \n     or officer's career. Over the past five years, as the Federal \n     law enforcement presence on the Nation's borders has \n     increased due to major increases in hiring of Border Patrol \n     agents and other law enforcement officers, Congress has \n     provided resources above the Presidents' requests for the \n     OIG, CBP, and ICE to ensure that a greater level of scrutiny \n     is focused on preventing officer corruption and enhancing \n     training on public integrity. Given these efforts, combined \n     with the full implementation of the Anti-Border Corruption \n     Act of 2011 (Public Law 111-338), sufficient funds were \n     requested in the budget and are provided by this Act to \n     continue rigorous attention to public integrity of DHS law \n     enforcement personnel. CBP is expected to work with OIG and \n     ICE to aggressively investigate reports of fraud and to \n     provide continuous integrity training to current as well as \n     new employees. CBP is directed to continue briefing the \n     Committees on a semiannual basis on integrity efforts, per \n     the House report. In addition, GAO is directed to report on \n     CBP's integrity program no later than 120 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, as required in the House report.\n\n                      Workers' Compensation Plans\n\n       CBP is directed to brief the Committees on its progress in \n     implementing the OIG recommendations and related issues, as \n     required by the House report, no later than April 3, 2013.\n\n                      Preventing Human Trafficking\n\n       The Committees strongly support DHS efforts to broaden \n     human trafficking awareness, including through CBP's Blue \n     Lightning Initiative. In lieu of the level recommended by the \n     House, CBP shall fund its Blue Campaign efforts, as \n     requested, and brief the Committees, as required by the House \n     report.\n\n                                Training\n\n       Per the House report, CBP is directed to brief the \n     Committees on its corrective action plan and the status of \n     implementation of recommendations contained in GAO-12-269, \n     not later than April 3, 2013. In addition, GAO is directed to \n     follow up on its findings one year after its release to \n     identify progress that has been made and any remaining \n     deficiencies.\n\n\n                        AUTOMATION MODERNIZATION\n\n       A total of $719,866,000 is provided for ``Automation \n     Modernization.'' Of that amount, $394,340,000 is for \n     Information Technology, which includes salaries and expenses \n     for OIT; $138,794,000 is for the Automated Commercial \n     Environment (ACE); and $186,732,000, as requested, is for \n     Current Operations Protection and Processing Support. As \n     provided in a general provision in this Act, CBP is required \n     to submit an updated multi-year investment and management \n     plan for all funds executed by OIT that are now largely \n     consolidated in ``Automation Modernization.''\n       The amount provided under this heading does not include the \n     requested funding for a civilian pay raise. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n\n                               Briefings\n\n       CBP is directed to continue briefing the Committees on a \n     quarterly basis on ACE progress, including the information \n     directed by the House and Senate reports. CBP and ICE are \n     directed to jointly brief the Committees on the status of \n     TECS modernization efforts, as required by the House and \n     Senate reports, on a semiannual basis with the first briefing \n     no later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n\n        BORDER SECURITY FENCING, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n       A total of $324,099,000 is provided for ``Border Security \n     Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology'' (BSFIT). No funds \n     are provided for further environmental mitigation efforts \n     with the Department of Interior.\n       The Committees remain concerned about the lack of progress \n     in deploying critical tools and technology that the Border \n     Patrol clearly needs to secure the border. The schedule for \n     awarding a contract for Integrated Fixed Towers (IFT) as well \n     as to upgrade and purchase Remote Video Surveillance Systems \n     (RVSS) continues to slip. In fact, CBP's schedule does not \n     show full deployment of RVSS and IFT before fiscal years 2014 \n     and 2016 respectively--years after the original timelines. \n     Given these delays, CBP is directed to continue quarterly \n     briefings and weekly notifications on procurement actions, as \n     directed in the House report. In addition, CBP is currently \n     evaluating proposals submitted for IFT, a process that shall \n     include a demonstration evaluation. After the demonstration \n     phase, CBP is directed to brief DHS leadership, OMB, and the \n     Committees before a contract award for IFT that would specify \n     the number and pace of deployments. The briefing is not \n     intended to involve procurement-sensitive information; rather \n     the focus is on understanding CBP's intention regarding the \n     number and pace of deployments rather than vendor-specific \n     information.\n       As of October 1, 2012, CBP has $400,000,000 in prior year \n     unobligated balances in BSFIT in addition to the funds \n     provided for fiscal year 2013. As a result, the bill includes \n     a rescission of $73,232,000, to ensure that funds do not \n     languish unused for years. As recommended in the House \n     report, those funds are applied to CBP Air and Marine \n     operations, supporting a significant increase in proposed \n     flight hours. These funds will provide immediate border \n     security operational benefit while enabling CBP to maintain \n     its\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n     IFT investments and deployments as currently planned.\n\n\n                       AIR AND MARINE OPERATIONS\n\n       A total of $799,006,000 is provided for ``Air and Marine \n     Operations.'' The funding includes $283,570,000 for a new \n     Salaries and Expenses PPA moved from the CBP ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' appropriation; $397,399,000 for Operations and \n     Maintenance to restore flight hours, including to restore \n     unmanned aerial systems (UAS) flight hours above the fiscal \n     year 2011 level; and $118,037,000 for Procurement. The \n     procurement funds include an additional $21,500,000 for \n     purchase of an additional multi-enforcement aircraft; \n     $39,000,000 for the service life extension of the P-3 fleet; \n     and $18,567,000 for enhanced sensor capabilities for UAS.\n       The amount provided under this heading does not include the \n     full amount requested for a civilian pay raise. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. However, \n     to avoid exacerbating CBP's pay shortfall, the bill provides \n     $870,000, as part of the total $19,558,000 provided to CBP, \n     in the Salaries and Expenses PPA as a contingency to cover \n     operational personnel. Should the President decide not to \n     institute the pay raise, CBP shall apply those funds to other \n     operational needs, in accordance with a general provision in \n     Title V of this Act and with appropriate notification to the \n     Committees.\n\n                U.S. Security Interests in the Caribbean\n\n       There are significant concerns about public safety and \n     security in the Caribbean, as outlined in the House report, \n     and it is excepted that the Secretary will allocate \n     resources, assets, and personnel to Puerto Rico and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands in a manner and to a degree consistent with \n     those concerns. Further, DHS is encouraged to work with the \n     Department of Defense to address surveillance capabilities, \n     as specified in the House report under a different heading.\n\n\n                 CONSTRUCTION AND FACILITIES MANAGEMENT\n\n       A total of $233,563,000 is provided for ``Construction and \n     Facilities Management.'' Of that amount, $176,214,000 is for \n     Facilities Construction and Sustainment and $57,349,000 is \n     for Program Oversight and Management. Per the Senate report, \n     the Department is directed to encourage the use of small \n     businesses, including the use of public-private partnerships, \n     in all phases of the contracting process for construction and \n     renovation of ports of entry.\n\n                U.S. Immigration and customs enforcement\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       A total of $5,394,402,000 is provided for ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' to ensure robust enforcement of our Nation's \n     immigration laws. Within this amount, the bill supports \n     maintenance of no fewer than 34,000 detention beds and funds \n     the 287(g) program at the fiscal year 2012 level of \n     $68,321,000 across PPAs in this appropriation. Additionally, \n     $138,249,000 is provided to complete nationwide deployment of \n     the Secure Communities program. The bill includes the \n     transfer of overstay analysis from US-VISIT to ICE and \n     increase the amount proposed for transfer to Domestic \n     Investigations by $2,307,000 for a total of $19,917,000. \n     Further, the amount provided under this heading does not \n     include $14,083,000, as requested, for a civilian pay raise. \n     Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, \n     it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nHeadquarters Management and Administration:\n    Personnel, compensation and benefits, services and othe$220,044,000\n    Headquarters managed IT investments.....................160,464,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Subtotal, Headquarters Management and Administration..380,508,000\nLegal Proceedings...........................................207,041,000\nInvestigations:\n    Domestic investigations...............................1,686,859,000\n    International Investigations:......................................\n    International operations................................115,122,000\n    Visa Security Program....................................34,561,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Subtotal, International Investigations................149,683,000\n                                                       ================\n\n    Subtotal, Investigations..............................1,836,542,000\nIntelligence.................................................78,452,000\nDetention and Removal Operations:\n    Custody operations....................................2,025,016,000\n    Fugitive operations.....................................145,325,000\n    Criminal Alien Program..................................216,510,000\n    Alternatives to detention................................96,557,000\n    Transportation and removal program......................270,202,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Subtotal, Detention and Removal Operations..........2,753,610,000\nSecure Communities..........................................138,249,000\nTotal, Salaries and Expenses.............................$5,394,402,000\n\n             ICE Headquarters Management and Administration\n\n       The bill provides $380,508,000 for ICE Headquarters \n     Management and Administration. ICE has failed to submit the \n     multi-year investment and management plan required by Public \n     Law 112-74 for funds executed by the Office of Information \n     Technology. Submission of that plan is expected immediately. \n     Timely submission of the update with the submission of the \n     fiscal year 2014 budget request is also expected, as required \n     by law.\n\n                        Immigration Proceedings\n\n       The bill does not include the proposed transfer authority \n     for $5,000,000 from ICE to the Executive Office for \n     Immigration Review (EOIR) to bolster the Legal Orientation \n     Program. However, given the extensive caseload pending before \n     immigration courts and the paper-intensive process, the bill \n     provides $3,000,000 in ICE ``Automation Modernization'' to \n     improve case management and electronic communication between \n     ICE and EOIR to achieve more efficient processing. Further, \n     ICE is directed to formalize its internal policy to utilize \n     digital records and provide a copy of the policy to the \n     Committees no later than 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       As required in the House report under this heading, ICE is \n     directed to report no later than April 3, 2013, on all \n     corrective actions and controls instituted to prevent \n     recurrence of the embezzlement and kick-back scheme uncovered \n     last year in the Office of Intelligence.\n\n                      ICE Domestic Investigations\n\n       A total of $1,686,859,000 is provided for Domestic \n     Investigations, reflecting a reduction of $10,000,000 \n     realigning responsibility for illegal aliens on parole and \n     probation to Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).\n\n                      Combatting Human Trafficking\n\n       The bill provides an additional $11,000,000 to support \n     ICE's efforts in countering human trafficking and human \n     smuggling. Of these funds, no less than $1,200,000 is \n     provided to further the Hidden in Plain Sight public outreach \n     campaign under the Blue Campaign umbrella. ICE is directed, \n     no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, to brief the Committees in detail on its full fiscal \n     year 2013 funding for efforts related to countering human \n     smuggling and human trafficking as well as its plans for \n     these additional funds.\n\n                     Law Enforcement Support Center\n\n       The bill provides no less than $34,900,000, as requested, \n     for the Law Enforcement Support Center.\n\n                           Overstay Analysis\n\n       Of the total provided in Domestic Investigations, \n     $19,917,000 is for overstay analysis activities previously \n     performed by US-VISIT. ICE is the appropriate mission owner \n     for visa-overstay investigations and operations. As required \n     in the House report, ICE is directed to provide semiannual \n     briefings on the overstay backlog elimination effort; to \n     ensure that similar backlogs do not arise again in the \n     future; and to update the Committees on its overstay \n     enforcement strategy. Further, ICE shall brief the Committees \n     no later than April 3, 2013, on the number of visa overstays \n     in the United States by nationality and the actionable \n     measures ICE will take to reduce the overstay population, as \n     directed in the House report.\n\n                          Worksite Enforcement\n\n       The bill provides $134,626,000 for worksite enforcement \n     activities, as requested, and requires ICE to follow the \n     direction in the House report under this heading.\n\n                    Trade Compliance and Enforcement\n\n       The bill provides no less than $10,187,000 for the \n     Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, as \n     requested. As required by the Senate report, CBP and ICE are \n     directed to jointly brief the Committees by May 1, 2013, on \n     the ongoing efforts to improve commercial trade enforcement \n     and intellectual property rights.\n\n                      International Investigations\n\n       A total of $34,561,000 is provided for the Visa Security \n     Program (VSP), including an additional $2,000,000 to support \n     pre-adjudication vetting of visa applicants. ICE is directed \n     to update the Committees no later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act on the VSP.\n       Of the amount provided to International Operations, no less \n     than $8,000,000 shall be for ICE's vetted units. ICE is \n     directed to specifically budget for these units in the fiscal \n     year 2014 budget request.\n\n           Cooperation from Foreign Countries on Repatriation\n\n       The Committees remain concerned about the public safety \n     impacts of the release of certain criminal aliens stemming \n     from the decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S. \n     Ct. 2491 (2001), as outlined in the House report. ICE shall \n     provide a detailed report on this issue, as directed in the \n     House report, no later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                          Fugitive Operations\n\n       A total of $145,325,000 is provided for fugitive \n     operations, as specified by the House.\n\n                         Criminal Alien Program\n\n       A total of $216,510,000 is provided for the Criminal Alien \n     Program, as pecified by the House.\n\n                       Alternatives to Detention\n\n       A total of $96,557,000 is provided for Alternatives to \n     Detention (ATD) programs. As required in the House report, \n     ICE is directed to\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\n     address factors that may hamper program goals in its \n     utilization of program funds; to expand the Fast Track pilot \n     program working with EOIR; to identify and implement best \n     practices for more effective processing of the non-detained \n     docket; and to utilize the appropriate level of supervision \n     warranted by the individual enrolled in ATD. As required in \n     the Senate report, ICE is directed to brief the Committees \n     quarterly on the Fast Track pilots and post on its website \n     any contractor evaluations and OIG reports related to the ATD \n     program.\n\n                           Secure Communities\n\n       A total of $138,249,000 is provided to complete nationwide \n     deployment of Secure Communities. ICE is directed to update \n     the Committees no later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act on jurisdictions failing to honor ICE \n     detainers, as required in the House report. Further, as \n     directed in the House report, ICE shall update the Committees \n     on its effort to digitize paper fingerprint cards from legacy \n     immigration files, no later than April 3, 2013.\n\n                          Detention Standards\n\n       As required by the House report, ICE is directed to \n     consider the cost implications of changes to its detention \n     standard requirements and budget accordingly.\n\n                U.S. Citizen Children of Removed Aliens\n\n       Within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, ICE is \n     to brief the Committees on its capabilities to identify, \n     track, and report on the status of unaccompanied alien \n     children after the removal or departure of their parent or \n     legal guardian and related issues, as directed in the Senate \n     report.\n\n\n                        AUTOMATION MODERNIZATION\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       A total of $33,500,000 is provided for ``Automation \n     Modernization,'' as requested and including an increase of \n     $3,000,000 above the request to improve case management and \n     electronic communication between ICE and EOIR to achieve more \n     efficient processing. Given the interdependencies in ICE and \n     EOIR systems, ICE may transfer up to $1,000,000 to EOIR to \n     further this effort.\n\n\n                              CONSTRUCTION\n\n       A total of $5,000,000 is provided for ``Construction,'' as \n     requested.\n\n\n                 TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n       A total of $5,052,620,000 is provided for ``Aviation \n     Security.'' The amount does not include $13,823,000, as \n     requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should the President \n     provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the \n     cost of the pay raise will be absorbed within existing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       In addition to the amounts appropriated, a mandatory \n     appropriation totaling $250,000,000 is available through the \n     Aviation Security Capital Fund. Statutory language reflects \n     the collection of $2,070,000,000 from aviation security fees, \n     as authorized.\nThe amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as follows:\nScreening Operations:\n    Screener Workforce:\n      Privatized Screening.................................$147,690,000\n      Screener Personnel, Compensation, and Benefits .....3,078,709,000\n      Subtotal, Screener Workforce .......................3,226,399,000\n    Screener Training and Other:............................224,984,000\n    Checkpoint Support:.....................................115,204,000\n    EDS/ETD Systems:\n      EDS Procurement and Installation.......................99,930,000\n      Screening Technology Maintenance and Utilitie.........309,000,000\n  Subtotal, EDS/ETD Systems.................................408,930,000\nSubtotal, Screening Operations............................3,975,517,000\nAviation Security Direction and Enforcement:\n    Aviation Regulation and Other Enforcement...............368,255,000\n    Airport Management and Support..........................562,349,000\n    Federal Flight Deck Officer and Flight Crew Training.....24,730,000\n    Air Cargo...............................................121,769,000\nSubtotal, Aviation Security Direction and Enforcement.....1,077,103,000\nTotal, Aviation Security ................................$5,052,620,000\n\n                          Privatized Screening\n\n       The bill provides a total of $147,690,000 for the Screening \n     Partnership Program (SPP), reflecting an increase of \n     $4,500,000 to address increased costs for current \n     participants and to provide some funding for airports that \n     may request to join the program. TSA is directed to brief the \n     Committees no later than 90 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act on how it is complying with the FAA \n     reauthorization law (Public Law 112-95) provisions regarding \n     evaluation of SPP applications, and the extent to which it is \n     implementing GAO recommendations to compare cost and \n     performance of SPP airports and non-SPP airports. The brief \n     should also cover how TSA is addressing court rulings related \n     to its administration of the SPP program. TSA is to provide \n     the Committees quarterly reports on its execution of the SPP \n     program and processing of applications for participation. In \n     addition, as TSA implements new statutory requirements for \n     privatized screening, TSA is expected to disapprove any new \n     contract application where privatized screening does not \n     currently exist if the annual cost of the contract exceeds \n     the annual cost to TSA of providing Federal screening \n     services.\n\n             Screener Personnel, Compensation, and Benefits\n\n       The provides $3,078,709,000 for Screener Personnel, \n     Compensation, and Benefits. This reflects no funding for the \n     fiscal year 2013 pay raise, as noted above, as well as \n     reductions in costs due to delays in deployment of the \n     advanced imaging technology (AIT), shifts in workload to SPP \n     airports, and efficiencies from checkpoint and baggage \n     processing streamlining. Some of these efficiencies may come \n     in the form of behavior detection officers (BDOs) being used \n     to execute the travel document checker function in some \n     cases, which may increase efficiency and possibly reduce \n     duplicative positions.\n\n                           Checkpoint Support\n\n       A total of $115,204,000 is provided for Checkpoint Support. \n     The reduction below the request is justified due to an \n     identical amount in unobligated balances that have remained \n     unspent for over five years.\n\n                   Advanced Imaging Technology Study\n\n       As detailed in the Senate report, the Secretary is \n     instructed to allocate resources for an independent study of \n     the potential health risks associated with the use of AIT \n     scanning machines at airport security checkpoints, including \n     backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave technologies. The study \n     is to be conducted by an independent laboratory selected by \n     the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary shall convene an \n     independent panel of experts to evaluate the results of this \n     study to consider any risk posed by AIT from a public health \n     perspective in addition to the risk to each airline \n     passenger. Among other things, the study shall evaluate the \n     possible malfunctions and fail-safe mechanisms of such \n     machines as well as the radiation emissions of AIT. The \n     independent panel should evaluate the results of the study \n     and also review risks posed by AIT to certain, more \n     vulnerable passengers screened or affected by such machines. \n     Upon completion, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report that contains the results of the study and evaluation. \n     Further, the Secretary is directed to ensure that easily \n     readable signs or equivalent electronic displays are placed \n     at the front of airline passenger checkpoint queues where AIT \n     scanning machines are used to alert passengers to the use of \n     such technology and screening alternatives available.\n\n              Risk-Based Approaches to Passenger Screening\n\n       TSA is directed to brief the Committees on a semiannual \n     basis, beginning no later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, on progress in developing and applying \n     trusted traveler approaches and any legal or budgetary \n     impediments to their implementation. The briefing should also \n     identify savings and efficiencies generated by these efforts. \n     In addition, TSA is directed to include in the briefing: (1) \n     its plans to expand Pre-Check to additional airlines and \n     passengers who currently do not qualify for the program, \n     including a timeline and milestones; (2) statistics detailing \n     the incremental progress being made to increase the eligible \n     population of passengers that have access to Pre-Check and \n     expand the number of airport locations where Pre-Check is \n     available; (3) key indicators of success such as passenger \n     satisfaction data; (4) projected cost savings from Pre-Check \n     and other risk-based screening initiatives; (5) a description \n     of efforts to ensure the public is fully aware of the \n     program; (6) wait times for Pre-Check and non-Pre-Check \n     lanes; and (7) a description of security measures being \n     implemented to ensure that eligible passengers in the Pre-\n     Check program are truly low-risk. This last point is also \n     addressed in the classified annex.\n\n                          Passenger Complaints\n\n       As highlighted in the Senate report, concerns remain about \n     the process TSA has established for resolving passenger \n     complaints. As directed by the joint explanatory statement \n     accompanying Public Law 112-74, GAO recently completed a \n     review of TSA's policies and procedures for resolving \n     passenger complaints and whether current resolution processes \n     conform to independent standards. GAO made several \n     recommendations to TSA as a result of its review, such as \n     establishing: (1) a consistent policy for receiving \n     complaints; (2) a process for systematically analyzing \n     information on complaints from all mechanisms; (3) a policy \n     for informing passengers about the screening complaint \n     process; and (4) mechanisms to share information on best \n     practices among airports. TSA is to brief the Committees no \n     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act on \n     its efforts to address the recommendations in the GAO report. \n     The Committee is also aware of efforts TSA has undertaken to \n     ensure the complaint resolution process is independent, such \n     as referring cases directly to its Ombudsman Division and \n     training current employees to be passenger advocates. TSA is \n     required to fund these efforts at a level that will enable \n     them to respond fully to passengers seeking assistance.\n\n                           Security Breaches\n\n       As detailed in the Senate report, the findings in the DHS \n     OIG Investigation Report\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\n     entitled ``Transportation Security Administration's Efforts \n     to Identify and Track Security Breaches at Our Nation's \n     Airports'' are of concern, and the TSA Administrator is \n     therefore directed to submit a report to the Committees not \n     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act as \n     specified in the Senate report.\n\n                      Explosives Detection Systems\n\n       The bill provides a total of $99,930,000 for Explosives \n     Detection Systems (EDS) Procurement and Installation.\n       TSA is directed to brief the Committees no later than 60 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act on its plans to \n     upgrade all EDS units procured and deployed with its 2010 \n     detection standards, and how it will address the concerns \n     highlighted in the GAO report (GAO-11-740). Statutory \n     language is included under the ``Transportation Security \n     Support'' appropriation withholding the obligation of \n     $20,000,000 from headquarters administration until TSA \n     submits to the Committees, no later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, detailed expenditure plans for \n     fiscal year 2013 for checkpoint security and EDS \n     refurbishments, procurement, and installations on an airport-\n     by-airport basis. The plans shall include: specific \n     technologies for purchase; program schedules and major \n     milestones; a schedule for obligation of the funds; \n     recapitalization priorities; and a table detailing actual \n     versus anticipated unobligated balances at the close of the \n     fiscal year. Further, the plan shall include a new section \n     providing details on passenger screening pilot programs that \n     are in progress or being considered for implementation in \n     fiscal year 2013, to include: a summary of the pilot program \n     that describes what the program is attempting to achieve; \n     potential capabilities and benefits of the program; the \n     airports where the pilots will be operating; funding \n     commitments; and plans for expansion. In addition, TSA is to \n     provide quarterly EDS and checkpoint expenditures briefings \n     to the Committees, including any deviations from the original \n     plan.\n\n               Aviation Regulation and Other Enforcement\n\n       The bill provides a total of $368,255,000 for Aviation \n     Regulation and Other Enforcement, including an increase of \n     $3,000,000 to support an increase in canine teams for \n     domestic inspections in the air cargo and aviation regulation \n     environments. When combined with a similar increase in \n     funding under the ``Surface Transportation Security'' \n     appropriation, TSA will be able to field no fewer than 50 new \n     canine teams overall. In addition, the agreement includes a \n     reduction of $6,000,000 for visible intermodal protection and \n     response (VIPR) teams, which have experienced significant \n     delays in hiring. TSA is directed to brief the Committees on \n     an updated VIPR expenditure plan for fiscal year 2013 within \n     60 days after the date of enactment of this Act and using the \n     same format provided in the March 12, 2012, report to the \n     Committees.\n\n              Foreign Repair Station Security Regulations\n\n       In 2003, Congress directed TSA to issue final regulations \n     to ensure the security of foreign and domestic aircraft \n     repair stations. A provision is not included affecting \n     funding for the DHS Office of General Counsel that was \n     proposed by the House, but TSA is directed to brief the \n     Committees if the final rule is not approved and published in \n     the fourth quarter of calendar year 2012, as anticipated.\n\n                Five-Year Strategic Plan for Investments\n\n       TSA is directed to submit a five-year budget estimate \n     within its fiscal year 2014 congressional budget \n     justification that includes projected funding levels for the \n     next five fiscal years individually for all passenger \n     screening technology acquisitions. The plan shall indicate \n     the total cost and estimated completion date for each \n     technology.\n\n    Use of Unclaimed Money for Assistance to Military Personnel and \n                               Dependents\n\n       Section 44945 of title 49, United States Code, enacted as \n     part of the fiscal year 2005 DHS Appropriations Act, \n     authorized and directed unclaimed money collected at airport \n     security checkpoints to be used for civil aviation security. \n     However, such collections have been little used, and Congress \n     has thus rescinded unobligated balances. The Committees \n     prefer that these funds be applied productively to an \n     important public mission, and therefore the Department and \n     TSA, in consultation with the Department of Defense, are \n     directed to submit a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations and Armed Services of the House and the \n     Senate, the House Committee on Homeland Security, and the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     which considers the feasibility of transferring the \n     collections to nonprofit organizations that are selected on a \n     competitive basis to operate airport centers in multiple \n     locations throughout the United States to provide a place of \n     rest and recuperation for members of the armed forces and \n     their families. The report, which shall include any \n     recommendations for new statutory language, cost estimates \n     for TSA to manage such a program, and administrative action \n     that may be required, shall also address ways to ensure small \n     airports have a mechanism for transferring unclaimed money to \n     TSA headquarters, which shall consolidate the collections.\n\n\n                    SURFACE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n       The bill provides a total of $124,418,000 for ``Surface \n     Transportation Security.'' The amount provided under this \n     heading does not include $358,000, as requested, for a \n     civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a civilian \n     pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay \n     raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2013. Within the amount appropriated, $36,353,000 \n     is provided for staffing and operations and $88,065,000 for \n     surface transportation security inspectors and canines. This \n     reflects an increase of $2,000,000 for additional surface \n     canine teams for passenger and cargo screening in the mass \n     transit and maritime domain. In combination with increased \n     funding provided under the ``Aviation Security'' \n     appropriation, TSA will be able to field no fewer than 50 new \n     canine teams overall. It also reflects a reduction of \n     $1,500,000 for VIPR teams, which have experienced significant \n     delays in hiring.\n\n\n           TRANSPORTATION THREAT ASSESSMENT AND CREDENTIALING\n\n       A total of $272,144,000 is provided for ``Transportation \n     Threat Assessment and Credentialing.'' The amount provided \n     under this heading does not include $207,000, as requested, \n     for a civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a \n     civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of \n     the pay raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2013. To facilitate oversight, TSA is \n     directed to brief the Committees on the status of TTAC \n     Infrastructure Modernization no later than 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, and \n     to advise the Committees of any developments that might delay \n     initial operating capacity in 2014 or to publish a Universal \n     Fee Rule.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nSecure Flight..............................................$106,935,000\nCrew and Other Vetting Programs..............................85,489,000\n  Subtotal, Direct Appropriations...........................192,424,000\nTWIC Fees....................................................47,300,000\nHazardous Materials Fees.....................................12,000,000\nAlien Flight School Fees......................................5,000,000\nAir Cargo/Certified Cargo Screening Program...................7,200,000\nSecure Identification Display Area Checks.....................8,000,000\nOther Security Threat Assessments...............................120,000\nGeneral Aviation at DCA.........................................100,000\n  Subtotal, Fee Collections.................................$79,720,000\n\n                              TWIC Readers\n\n       The Coast Guard, the Department, and TSA are directed to \n     take all necessary action to expedite the completion and \n     publication of a final TWIC reader rule and to expand \n     Universal Enrollment Centers that will result in no less than \n     50 percent expansion in the number of available TWIC \n     enrollment sites.\n\n\n                    TRANSPORTATION SECURITY SUPPORT\n\n       The bill provides a total of $954,277,000 for \n     ``Transportation Security Support.'' The amount provided \n     under this heading does not include $432,000, as requested, \n     for a civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a \n     civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of \n     the pay raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2013. Bill language, proposed by the Senate, \n     also is included to withhold $20,000,000 from obligation \n     until the TSA Administrator submits detailed expenditure \n     plans for air cargo security, checkpoint support, and EDS \n     refurbishment, procurement and installation.\nThe amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as follows:\nHeadquarters Administration................................$276,122,000\nInformation Technology......................................417,196,000\nHuman Capital Services......................................215,829,000\nIntelligence.................................................45,130,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Total, Transportation Security Support...................$954,277,000\n\n          Account Structure and Availability of Appropriations\n\n       TSA is directed to include a proposal for account \n     restructuring with the fiscal year 2014 budget request. The \n     proposal should reflect the proposal set forth in the Senate \n     report to establish a one-year appropriation for salaries and \n     related expenses, and DHS is to continue to consult with the \n     Committees on its development of this proposal.\n\n                         Human Capital Services\n\n       The bill provides a total of $215,829,000 for Human Capital \n     Services. The reduction may come from advisory and assistance \n     services.\n\n\n                          FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS\n\n       A total of $907,757,000 is provided for ``Federal Air \n     Marshals'', including $793,786,000 for Management and \n     Administration and $113,971,000 for Travel and Training. The \n     amount provided under this heading does not include \n     $2,743,000, as requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should \n     the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013. The \n     funding reduction reflects a readjustment in light of the \n     multiple security enhancements in aviation security put in \n     place since the Christmas Day 2009 bombing attempt. This \n     level of funding is adequate to ensure coverage of all high-\n     risk international and domestic flights, and provide \n     additional discussion of this in the classified annex to this \n     statement. TSA is directed to submit a report no later than \n     120 days after the date of enactment of this Act outlining \n     the best options for leveraging the Federal\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n     law enforcement population to supplement Federal Air Marshal \n     Service (FAMS) resources, including a detailed description of \n     what the Department is doing to develop such options beyond a \n     notional phase. Further, TSA is directed to brief the \n     Committees no later than 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act on its optimal mix of staff, the types and \n     frequency of flights for which FAMS coverage should be \n     provided, and any legislative or regulatory changes that \n     might be required to improve FAMS operations and overall \n     aviation security.\n\n                              Coast Guard\n\n\n                           OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n       The bill provides a total of $7,074,782,000 for ``Operating \n     Expenses,'' including $594,000,000 for defense activities, of \n     which $254,000,000 is designated as being for overseas \n     contingency operations (OCO) and the global war on terrorism \n     (GWOT). Funds provided in support of GWOT and OCO under this \n     heading may be allocated notwithstanding section 503 in Title \n     V of this Act.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation includes the \n     following reductions from the budget request: a decrease of \n     $2,947,000 for civilian pay and a decrease of $5,000,000 for \n     the Headquarters Directorate. None of the reductions shall \n     come from small boat acquisitions. Should the President \n     provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the \n     cost of the pay raise will be absorbed within existing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation includes the \n     following increases above the budget request: an additional \n     $23,842,000 to reduce the backlog in critical depot level \n     maintenance; $1,977,000 to prevent the decommissioning of \n     three 110-foot patrol boats; $10,191,000 to reduce the \n     operational gap created by the disestablishment of the high-\n     tempo high-maintenance program; $8,413,000 to maintain one of \n     the two High Endurance Cutters proposed for decommissioning; \n     $5,200,000 for seasonal air facilities; and $3,115,000 for \n     the annualization of marine environmental response positions.\nThe amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as follows:\nMilitary Pay and Allowances..............................$3,415,181,000\nCivilian Pay and Benefits...................................786,580,000\nTraining and Recruiting.....................................214,183,000\nOperating Funds and Unit Level Maintenance................1,093,893,000\nCentrally Managed Accounts..................................351,072,000\nIntermediate and Depot Level Maintenance....................959,873,000\nOverseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism.....254,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Total, Operating Expenses..............................$7,074,782,000\n\n                  Program Terminations and New Starts\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed to brief the Committees prior \n     to starting the process of terminating programs that have \n     been specifically requested in the budget and funded by \n     Congress, such as the termination of the high tempo-high \n     maintenance program and the H-60 radar program. Further, the \n     Coast Guard is directed to comply with the general provisions \n     in Title V of this Act with respect to the creation of \n     programs not previously requested and justified or the \n     elimination of programs previously requested and justified to \n     Congress in the justification accompanying the President's \n     budget.\n\n  Overseas Contingency Operations Funding and Global War on Terrorism\n\n       Funding is included for OCO/GWOT within the Coast Guard \n     ``Operating Expenses'' appropriation instead of within \n     funding provided to the Department of Defense. There is \n     concern with the continued overreliance on OCO/GWOT funds to \n     support activities that have become part of the Coast Guard's \n     routine mission set. As activities overseas continue to draw \n     down, it is expected that there will be a similar decrease in \n     OCO/GWOT funding requested by the Administration for the \n     Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is directed to brief the \n     Committees no later than 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act on any changes expected to funding for the OCO/\n     GWOT during fiscal year 2013. Further, the Coast Guard is \n     directed to include in the classified annex for fiscal year \n     2014 details of its current and future support to Central \n     Command.\n\n                              TWIC Readers\n\n       The Coast Guard, the Department, and TSA are directed to \n     take all necessary action to expedite the completion and \n     publication of a final TWIC reader rule.\n\n                        Seasonal Air Facilities\n\n       The request to replace five H-65 helicopters in operation \n     at Air Station Traverse City with three H-60 helicopters and \n     to close two seasonal Air Facilities at Muskegon, Michigan \n     and Waukegan, Illinois is denied. There also is concern that \n     two of the H-60 aircraft proposed to be transferred to Air \n     Station Traverse City would be taken from Operation Bahamas, \n     Turks and Caicos, resulting in a significant loss of annual \n     hours dedicated to drug and migrant interdiction and search \n     and rescue in that area of responsibility.\n\n                     Marine Environmental Response\n\n       The Coast Guard is expected to keep the Committees apprised \n     of marine environmental response hiring efforts in fiscal \n     year 2013 to achieve 718 positions, including 26 positions \n     added in this Act, and to report to the Committees within 15 \n     days if it deviates from this plan.\n\n                      Support of Military Families\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed to submit a copy of its \n     National Housing Assessment no later than 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act. The report shall prioritize \n     short-term and long-term improvements needed, including \n     resource requirements.\n\n         Infrastructure and Response Capabilities in the Arctic\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed to report to the Committees \n     within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the \n     actions taken to reach international agreements on ensuring \n     adequate maritime transportation infrastructure and response \n     capabilities in the Arctic.\n\n                            Coast Guard Yard\n\n       The Coast Guard Yard located at Curtis Bay, Maryland, is \n     recognized as a critical component of the Coast Guard's core \n     logistics capability that directly supports fleet readiness. \n     Sufficient industrial work should be assigned to the Yard to \n     sustain this capability.\n\n                Sexual Harassment Reporting Requirements\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed to provide to the Committees \n     the annual report required by Section 217 of the Coast Guard \n     Authorization Act of 2010.\n\n                      Command and Control Aircraft\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed to notify the Committees prior \n     to making any changes in the type or number of the command \n     and control aircraft.\n\n                        Automation Modernization\n\n       A new appropriation for Automation Modernization is not \n     included; however, the Coast Guard is directed to provide a \n     report to the Committees no later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act detailing funding for fiscal year \n     2012, planned for fiscal year 2013, and requested for fiscal \n     year 2014 by program, project and activity for new \n     information technology investments and automation \n     modernization.\n\n                           Chemical Security\n\n       In House report 112-331, the Coast Guard and NPPD are \n     directed to complete a planned Memorandum of Understanding \n     (MOU) to harmonize chemical security responsibilities \n     established by the CFATS regulations and MTSA regulatory \n     programs no later than March 30, 2012, but the agreement has \n     not been finalized. The MOU is to be completed expeditiously.\n\n          Funding for Minor Shore Infrastructure Improvements\n\n       The bill continues to allow funds from the ``Operating \n     Expenses'' appropriation to be used for the sustainment, \n     repair, replacement and maintenance of shore infrastructure, \n     including projects to correct deficiencies for code \n     compliance or that threaten life, health, or safety to an \n     amount not exceeding 50 percent of a building's or \n     structure's replacement value. Additionally, ``Operating \n     Expenses'' funds are allowed to be used for contingent, \n     emergent, or other unspecified minor construction projects, \n     which includes new construction, procurement, development, \n     conversion, rebuilding, improvement, or an extension of any \n     facility not exceeding $1,000,000 in total costs at any \n     location for planned or unplanned operational needs.\n       Minor construction projects funded from the ``Operating \n     Expenses'' appropriation can be combined with depot level \n     maintenance projects for the sake of administrative and \n     economic efficiency. Such projects and any sustainment, \n     repair, replacement or maintenance projects over $1,000,000 \n     shall be detailed in a semiannual report to the Committees.\n\n\n                ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND RESTORATION\n\n       The bill provides a total of $13,151,000 for \n     ``Environmental Compliance and Restoration.'' The amount \n     provided for this appropriation includes a decrease of \n     $11,000 in civilian pay. Should the President provide a \n     civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of \n     the pay raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n                            RESERVE TRAINING\n\n       The bill provides a total of $132,528,000 for ``Reserve \n     Training.'' The amount provided for this appropriation \n     includes a decrease of $26,000 in civilian pay. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n              ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\n       The bill provides a total of $1,545,393,000 for \n     ``Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements.''\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nVessels\n  Survey and Design-Vessel and Boats.........................$2,500.000\n  Response Boat--Medium.......................................8,000,000\n  National Security Cutter..................................679,300,000\n  Offshore Patrol Cutter.....................................30,000,000\n  Fast Response Cutter......................................335,000,000\n  Cutter boats................................................4,000,000\n  Polar ice breaking vessel...................................8,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Vessels.......................................1,082,800,000\nAircraft\n  Airframs Replacement (CGNR 6017)...........................14,000,000\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\n  Maritime Patrol Aircraft...................................55,000,000\n  Long range Surveillance Aircraft...........................90,000,000\n  H-65 conversion/sustainment projects.......................31,500,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Aircraft........................................190,500,001\nOther\n  Program Oversight and Management...........................15,000,000\n  Systems Engineering and Integration.................................0\n  C4ISR......................................................40,500,000\n  Coast Guard--Logistics Information Management System........2,500,000\n  Nationwide Automatic Identification System..................6,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Other Equipment..................................64,000,000\nShore Facilities and Aids to Navigation\n  Major construction: Housing, ATON, and Survey & design.....30,000,000\n  Minor Shore.................................................5,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Shore Facilities and Aids to Navigation..........84,411,000\nMilitary Housing.............................................10,000,000\nPersonnel and Related Support\n  Direct Personnel Costs....................................113,082,000\n  Core Acquisition Costs........................................600,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Personnel and Related Support...................113,682,000\n                                                       ================\n\n      Total, Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements.$1,545,393,000\n\n     Quarterly Reports on Acquisition Projects and Mission Emphasis\n\n       The Commandant is to continue to brief the Committees \n     quarterly on all major acquisitions consistent with the \n     direction in the joint explanatory statement accompanying \n     Public Law 112-74. In addition to the information normally \n     provided, these required briefings shall include: the top \n     five risks for each acquisition, if applicable, and if these \n     risks have future budget implications; the objective for \n     operational hours the Coast Guard expects to achieve; the gap \n     between that objective, current capabilities, and stated \n     mission requirements; and how the acquisition of the specific \n     asset closes the gap.

Further, as detailed \n     on page 86 in the House report, the budget justification for \n     aircraft and vessels in fiscal year 2014 shall include \n     detailed cost information consistent with the appropriate \n     work elements for the program, and standardized for similar \n     type systems such as aircraft and vessels.\n       The budget justification for programs that are conversions \n     or sustainment shall provide similar data and include types \n     of modifications, quantity of kits, and planned installation \n     schedule of modification kits.\n       The budget justification for Program Oversight and \n     Management, Systems Engineering and Integration and C4ISR \n     shall provide a breakout of funding by asset.\n       In the budget justification, the Coast Guard is directed to \n     provide procurement history and planning for the prior year, \n     current year, and budget year to include quantity and unit \n     cost, contracting office location, contractor, contract \n     method/type, award date, date of first delivery, and the \n     availability of technical data package.\n       Additionally, to address continued deficiencies in the \n     budget justification for Program Oversight and Management, \n     the Coast Guard is directed to provide a detailed subdivision \n     of funding requested for government program management in its \n     justification materials accompanying the fiscal year 2014 \n     budget submission. This includes providing funding associated \n     with each subdivision.\n\n                              Full Funding\n\n       Bill language is included that directs the funds provided \n     in this Act be immediately available and allotted to contract \n     for the production of the sixth National Security Cutter \n     (NSC) notwithstanding the availability of post-delivery \n     activity funding and long lead time materials, components, \n     and designs of the seventh NSC notwithstanding the \n     availability of production funds for the seventh NSC.\n       Further, a new general provision in Title V of this Act \n     sets requirements related to funding availability and \n     contract awards for long lead materials and production of \n     Coast Guard cutters. In addition, the Secretary shall develop \n     fiscal policy that prescribes Coast Guard budgetary policies, \n     procedures and technical direction necessary to comply with \n     statutory language in the general provision and consistent \n     with the DoD Financial Management Regulations (Volume 2A \n     Chapter 1, C. Procedures for Full Funding) directing the \n     funding and allocation of funds for production contracts and \n     long lead time material contracts. This policy shall include \n     that (1) the costs of outfitting and post-delivery activities \n     and spare or repair parts shall be requested not earlier than \n     for the first fiscal year in which it is necessary to incur \n     such costs to maintain a planned production schedule, which \n     may be subsequent to the fiscal year for which production \n     costs are requested; and (2) the costs of long lead time \n     items shall be requested for the fiscal year in which it is \n     necessary to incur such costs to maintain a planned \n     production schedule, which may be in advance of the fiscal \n     year for which production costs are requested.\n\n                               Carry Over\n\n       The Coast Guard is directed, to the maximum extent \n     possible, to budget for programs, assets, modifications, and \n     installations that it will execute in the budget request year \n     so as not to accumulate excessive carryover.\n\n                        National Security Cutter\n\n       A total of $679,300,000 is provided for the National \n     Security Cutter (NSC) program. Of this amount, $557,000,000, \n     as requested, is for the production of NSC-6 and $77,000,000 \n     is to acquire long lead time materials for the production of \n     NSC-7.\n\n                          Fast Response Cutter\n\n       A total of $335,000,000 is provided for the acquisition of \n     six Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) instead of two FRCs, as \n     requested. This funding will allow the Coast Guard to acquire \n     FRC hulls (19-24). Procuring six Fast Response Cutters in \n     fiscal year 2013 will maximize the production line and \n     generate cost savings of $5,000,000 per hull for a total \n     savings to the taxpayers of $30,000,000.\n\n                         Offshore Patrol Cutter\n\n       A total of $30,000,000 is provided for the Offshore Patrol \n     Cutter (OPC). The Coast Guard is directed to update the \n     Committees on changes or updates in the Operation \n     Requirements Documents.\n\n                  Medium Endurance Cutter Sustainment\n\n       A total of $16,000,000 is provided for the Medium Endurance \n     Cutter (WMEC) Sustainment, to include $3,000,000 above the \n     amount requested to be used to conduct a WMEC condition \n     survey to address potential service life extension \n     requirements, as described in the House report.\n\n                            Polar Icebreaker\n\n       As requested, $8,000,000 is provided to initiate survey and \n     design activities for a new Coast Guard polar icebreaker. The \n     Coast Guard is directed to provide the Committees with its \n     Mission Needs Statement no later than 30 days after it \n     receives Departmental approval and to brief the Committees on \n     its timeline for completing a concept of operations, market \n     research, specification development, and other acquisition \n     milestones leading to a request for proposal and contract \n     award.\n\n                          Response Boat-Medium\n\n       A total of $8,000,000 is provided for the Response Boat-\n     Medium (RB-M) acquisition.\n       These funds will allow the Coast Guard to purchase 4 RB-Ms \n     in fiscal year 2013, bringing the total funded for the Coast \n     Guard to 170 boats.\n\n                            H-60 Helicopter\n\n       A total of $14,000,000 is provided for aircraft replacement \n     of one H-60 helicopter, an increase of $14,000,000 above the \n     amount requested.\n\n                            HC-130J Aircraft\n\n      A total of $90,000,000 is provided for one HC-130J aircraft.\n\n                        Maritime Patrol Aircraft\n\n       A total of $55,000,000 is provided for the Maritime Patrol \n     Aircraft (MPA), $12,000,000 above the amount requested. This \n     fully funds one MPA, including funding to acquire a Mission \n     System Pallet and spares, which were not included in the \n     fiscal year 2013 request.\n\n                       Unmanned Aircraft Systems\n\n       As described in the Senate report, the Coast Guard is \n     directed to keep the Committees informed of its efforts to \n     pursue a small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) as an interim \n     capability for the NSC and to keep the Committees apprised of \n     its efforts for both cutter-based and land-based UAS \n     development.\n\n                    Program Oversight and Management\n\n       A total of $15,000,000 is provided for Program Oversight \n     and Management.\n\n                  Systems Engineering and Integration\n\n       All funding for Systems Engineering and Integration is \n     denied, a reduction of $2,500,000 from the amount requested, \n     because of high carryover from prior appropriations.\n\n Major Shore Construction, Housing, Aids to Navigation, and Survey and \n                                 Design\n\n       A total of $30,000,000 is provided for Major Shore \n     Construction, Housing, Aids to Navigation, and Survey and \n     Design. The Coast Guard is directed to submit an expenditure \n     plan for these funds to the Committees no later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, including a \n     prioritized list of all backlogged projects and the Coast \n     Guard's plan to address them. In addition, the Coast Guard is \n     directed to include a detailed description of any changes \n     from the fiscal year 2013 budget justification for major \n     acquisition systems infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\n                      Coast Guard Military Housing\n\n       A total of $10,000,000 is provided for the \n     recapitalization, improvement, and acquisition of housing to \n     support military families. Of this amount, $6,828,691 is \n     derived from the Coast Guard Housing Fund. The Coast Guard \n     shall provide an expenditure plan to the Committees for these \n     funds in the shore facilities report required to be submitted \n     no later than 45 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n                         Acquisition Personnel\n\n       A total of $113,682,000 is provided for direct costs of \n     acquisition personnel. The amount provided includes a \n     decrease of $216,000 in civilian pay and a decrease of \n     $3,500,000 for efficiencies. Should the President provide a \n     civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of \n     the pay raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2013.\n\n                           Fleet Requirements\n\n       The Secretary and the Commandant are directed to comply \n     with Senate language with respect to developing a working \n     group to examine available studies on Coast Guard fleet \n     requirements.\n\n                          Unfunded Priorities\n\n       The Commandant is directed to provide to the Committees, at \n     the time of the President's budget submission, a list of \n     approved but unfunded Coast Guard priorities and the funds \n     needed for each.\n\n\n              RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION\n\n       The bill provides a total of $19,690,000 for ``Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation''. The amount provided for \n     this appropriation includes a decrease of $38,000 in civilian \n     pay. Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for \n     2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be \n     absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       The Commandant is directed to provide a detailed \n     prioritized listing of planned activities relative to stated \n     mission requirements in the justification materials \n     accompanying the fiscal year 2014 budget submission. Further, \n     the Commandant is directed to comply with the Senate \n     direction to study the viability and applicability of \n     persistent unmanned maritime vehicles and other cost-saving \n     maritime technologies through a competitive process.\n\n\n                              RETIRED PAY\n\n       The bill provides a total of $1,423,000,000 for ``Retired \n     Pay''. The Coast Guard's ``Retired Pay'' appropriation is a \n     mandatory budget activity.\n\n                      United States Secret Service\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       The bill provides $1,555,913,000 for ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'', of which not to exceed $19,125 shall be for \n     official reception and representation expenses. The amount \n     provided under this heading does not include $4,058,000, as \n     requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should the President \n     provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the \n     cost of the pay raise will be absorbed within existing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\nProtection:\n    Protection of persons and facilities...................$855,236,000\n    Protective intelligence activities.......................68,125,000\n    Presidential candidate nominee protection................57,960,000\n    National Special Security Event fund......................4,500,000\n    Subtotal, Protection:...................................985,821,000\n\nInvestigations:\n    Domestic field operations...............................299,690,000\n    International field office administration, operations and30,971,000\n    Support for missing and exploited children................8,366,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Investigations:.................................339,027,000\nHeadquarters, Management and Administration.................174,334,000\nRowley Training Center.......................................55,598,000\nInformation Integration and Technology Transformation.........1,133,000\n                                                       ================\n\n      Total, Salaries and Expenses.......................$1,555,913,000\n\n                Salaries and Expenses Account Structure\n\n       The current account structure for Programs, Projects, and \n     Activities (PPAs) is retained, with the following \n     consolidations requested in the budget: White House mail \n     screening now is funded within the Protection of Persons and \n     Facilities PPA, and the Electronic Crimes Special Agent \n     Program (ECSAP) and Electronic Crimes Task Forces are now \n     funded within Domestic Field Operations.\n       The Committees do not agree with the proposal to reduce the \n     number of PPAs to five, with single PPAs for pay and \n     benefits, protection, and investigations as requested in the \n     budget. The Secret Service has stated that because current \n     PPA structure spreads pay and expenses across many programs, \n     it is constantly challenged by having to balance shifting \n     demands between protection and investigations, and as a \n     result, must either submit formal reprogramming, or employ \n     inefficient and conservative financial management to avoid \n     them. The Committees understand this argument, particularly \n     as it applies to the Secret Service field office \n     organization, where the same agents may be involved in both \n     protective operations and a variety of investigations \n     efforts. While the bill maintains the current PPA structure \n     some flexibility has been provided in statute to the Secret \n     Service to reprogram $15,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is \n     lower, between the Protection of Persons and Facilities PPA \n     and the Domestic Field Operations PPA.\n       The Secret Service is developing a financial reporting \n     system that it asserts will enable it to report enterprise-\n     wide labor costs on a timelier basis and the Secret Service \n     is invited to provide such evidence to the Committees for \n     consideration during the 2014 appropriations process.\n\n                        International Operations\n\n       The tempo of international investigative operations has \n     increased for the Secret Service, with notable successes in \n     investigating and halting counterfeiting and other forms of \n     electronic and financial crime through its overseas field \n     operations, including its new locations in Beijing, China and \n     Lima, Peru. The Secret Service is directed to brief the \n     Committees not later than April 3, 2013, on the status of its \n     overseas investigative operations, including staffing and \n     funding for its field offices.\n\n     Domestic Field Operations and Electronic Crimes Investigations\n\n       The partial consolidation provided in the bill includes \n     incorporation of the previously separate PPA for Electronic \n     Crimes Special Agent Program (ECSAP) and Electronic Crimes \n     Task Forces (ECTF) into the Domestic Field Operations PPA. \n     This consolidation does not reflect any dissatisfaction with \n     the ECSAP or ECTF programs; on the contrary, those activities \n     have proven highly productive and deserve strong support. \n     Therefore, the bill includes an increase of $3,500,000 within \n     the PPA to be distributed between the ECSAP/ECTF programs and \n     other high priority domestic investigative efforts. While \n     ECSAP/ECTF will no longer have a separate reporting and \n     reprogramming line, the Committees expect: (1) to receive \n     periodic briefings on the status of investigations; (2) to \n     see the funding and programmatic efforts sustained; and (3) \n     the funding and personnel resources for them continue to be \n     identified in future budgets.\n       In addition, as a step to aligning the program and funding \n     for electronic crimes investigation support, the bill \n     includes $4,000,000 within the Domestic Field Operations PPA \n     for grant assistance for electronic crime investigation and \n     forensic training for State and local law enforcement \n     agencies, which the Secret Service has been providing to date \n     at the National Computer Forensics Institute, previously \n     funded through the National Protection and Programs \n     Directorate (NPPD). The Secret Service is directed to \n     coordinate with NPPD as the subject matter experts to ensure \n     the curriculum is sound and consistent with current risk and \n     threat, and to avoid duplication and ensure efficiency.\n\n               Support for Missing and Exploited Children\n\n       The bill provides $8,366,000 to fund grant assistance and \n     investigative support for investigations related to missing \n     and exploited children as proposed by the House.\n\n              Professionalism Reinforcement Working Group\n\n       The Secret Service is directed to provide quarterly \n     briefings to the Committees on the status of the \n     Professionalism Reinforcement Working Group and its review of \n     Secret Service professional standards of conduct, and their \n     relationship to training, policy and procedures.\n\n                    National Special Security Events\n\n       The bill provides $4,500,000, as requested, to defray costs \n     specific to Secret Service execution of its statutory \n     responsibilities to direct the planning and coordination of \n     National Special Security Events (NSSEs). Some federal \n     agencies have sought reimbursement from the Secret Service \n     for participation in and support of prior NSSEs, despite the \n     fact the Secret Service, as a matter of policy and practice, \n     has sought and accepted such support only on the explicit \n     understanding that such support is provided on a voluntary \n     and non-reimbursable basis. Further, when other agencies and \n     departments elect to participate in NSSEs, they are \n     fulfilling their responsibilities set forth in Homeland \n     Security Presidential Directive 15 and National Security \n     Presidential Directive 46, and their authority to fund such \n     participation derives from those Directives. Based on this \n     understanding, and to clarify the expectation that \n     participating agencies should budget for and fund their own \n     costs, a new general provision is included in the Act that \n     provides that none of the funds in this Act may be used to \n     reimburse any Federal department or agency for its \n     participation in a National Special Security Event.\n       To resolve ongoing disputes over prior funding \n     responsibilities, determine whether any agency participation \n     in past NSSEs should be eligible for reimbursement, and \n     dispel ambiguity about how participating agencies will be \n     funded for future NSSEs, the Administration must either \n     propose a change in current law or issue clear administrative \n     guidance.\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\n       The Department and the Office of Management and Budget are \n     directed to jointly resolve this issue, address the \n     appropriate assignment of budgeting and funding \n     responsibilities for the costs of agency participation in \n     NSSEs, and submit a specific plan to accomplish this, \n     including proposed statutory remedies if necessary, not later \n     than April 3, 2013.\n       In addition, the USSS is directed to provide periodic \n     updates on NSSEs planned for fiscal year 2013 prior to and \n     following the event, instead of quarterly briefings as \n     proposed by the Senate.\n\n                         Technology Activities\n\n       The bill includes $1,133,000 for information integration \n     and technology transformation activities of the Secret \n     Service, and direct the Secret Service to provide greater \n     detail in its annual budget justification accompanying the \n     fiscal year 2014 budget request on all USSS information \n     technology activities, to include the multi-year investment \n     plan called for in statutory language for the acquisition \n     account.\n\n\n     ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVEMENTS, AND RELATED EXPENSES\n\n       The bill provides a total of $56,750,000 for ``Acquisition, \n     Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses.'' This \n     funding covers the acquisition, construction, improvements \n     and related expenses for the Rowley Training Center and \n     investments in Information Integration and Technology \n     Transformation (IITT) programs. Bill language is included \n     requiring the Director to submit a multi-year IITT investment \n     plan along with the budget request for fiscal year 2014, as \n     proposed by the House.\n\n      TITLE III--PROTECTION, PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, AND RECOVERY\n\n              National Protection and Programs Directorate\n\n\n                     MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n       A total of $50,220,000 is provided for ``Management and \n     Administration'' of the National Protection and Programs \n     Directorate (NPPD), of which no more than $3,825 is for \n     official reception and representation expenses. The amount \n     provided under this heading does not include $101,000, as \n     requested, for a civilian pay raise.

Of the total provided, $13,551,000 is for the Office of \n     Bombing Prevention, and the Office is encouraged to work with \n     the National Guard and the Department of Defense as discussed \n     in the Senate report; $20,588,000 is for vulnerability \n     assessments and NPPD is encouraged to share information \n     regionally; and $16,876,000 is for cybersecurity education. \n     Funding for the National Computer Forensics Institute has \n     been provided under the heading United States Secret Service, \n     ``Salaries and Expenses.'' No funds are provided under this \n     heading for such activity.\n       Of the total provided, $77,945,000 is for Infrastructure \n     Security Compliance to implement the Chemical Facility Anti-\n     Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, of which $20,000,000 is \n     not available for obligation until the Under Secretary for \n     NPPD submits to the Committees an expenditure plan for the \n     CFATS program for fiscal year 2013, including the number of \n     facilities covered, inspectors on-board, inspections pending, \n     and inspections projected to be completed by September 30, \n     2013. NPPD is directed to brief the Committees on the \n     findings of recent GAO testimony summarizing the DHS actions \n     to better manage its chemical security program (GAO-12-\n     1044T), including progress in addressing the recommendations \n     and in implementing the action plan.\n       In lieu of language in House report 112-492, directing a \n     review by NPPD, in conjunction with the Coast Guard, GAO is \n     directed to continue its ongoing effort to examine the extent \n     to which DHS has made progress and encountered challenges in \n     developing a viable CFATS program. Once the CFATS program \n     begins performing and completing a sufficient number of \n     compliance inspections, GAO shall review how compliance \n     inspections are performed, whether inspectors are properly \n     trained and have the right skill sets to perform compliance \n     inspections and if the CFATS program faces any barriers or \n     challenges in managing the compliance inspection process. GAO \n     shall complete this review in consultation with the \n     Committees.\n       NPPD is not required to provide the report on the CFATS \n     action plan as required in Senate report 112-169, since the \n     information has been provided. NPPD is directed to provide a \n     report regarding CFATS semiannual data as required in Senate \n     report 112-169, and a briefing, instead of a report, \n     regarding alternative security programs as required in the \n     House report 112-492. NPPD is expected to continue to \n     increase its on-board FTEs to reach the fiscal year 2013 \n     requested level, to include the hiring of the appropriate \n     level of inspectors to meet mission requirements, and is \n     directed to include in the aforementioned report, with \n     semiannual data, any variation to the level of inspectors \n     requested with a justification for the change. NPPD is \n     directed to brief the Committees regularly on the status of \n     any proposed personnel surety information collection requests \n     and include in the briefings how addressing industry concerns \n     with respect to notifying industry of denials are being \n     addressed.\n       NPPD is directed to brief the Committees on the progress \n     toward implementing the recommendations included in the \n     recent GAO report entitled ``DHS Could Better Manage Security \n     Surveys and Vulnerability Assessments'' (GAO-12-378).\n       Within the total amount provided, $202,000,000 shall be \n     used to deploy technology to improve the information security \n     on Federal computer systems in accordance with a new general \n     provision contained in Title V of this Act. The Under \n     Secretary is directed to provide an expenditure plan, in the \n     same format as the plan submitted to fulfill the requirement \n     in section 137 (b) of Public Law 112-175, for the entire \n     fiscal year 2013 amount.\n       Within the total amount provided, $329,009,000 is for \n     Network Security Deployment, which fully funds the amount \n     that will be obligated in fiscal year 2013 for the Einstein \n     program and related activities.\n       Within the total amount provided, $24,499,000 is provided \n     for Next Generation Networks to prevent delays in deploying \n     priority communications services capability.\n       The Under Secretary is directed to provide a report \n     detailing all fiscal year 2013 NPPD grant programs including \n     the justification, strategy, and future funding requirements \n     for the grants, as well as the determinations and findings to \n     justify sole source awards.\n\n\n                       FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE\n\n       A total of $1,301,824,000 is provided for the ``Federal \n     Protective Service'' (FPS), as requested, for fiscal year \n     2013. This amount is fully offset by collections of security \n     fees. A provision is included requiring the Secretary and the \n     Director of the OMB to certify, no later than May 1, 2013, \n     that FPS will collect a sufficient amount in fees to cover \n     the total number of FTE requested in the budget, or adjust \n     the fee to cover all costs.\n       The NPPD Office of Chief Financial Officer is directed to \n     brief the Committees on the entire year expenditure plan for \n     funds provided in this Act not later than 45 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       FPS is directed to brief the Committees on progress in \n     implementing the recommendations made in a recent GAO report, \n     ``DHS Needs to Refocus Its Efforts to Lead the Government \n     Facilities Sector'' (GAO-12-852), not later than 45 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, including a specific \n     timeframe for publishing an action plan.\n\n\n                OFFICE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTITY MANAGEMENT\n\n       A total of $232,422,000 is provided for the ``Office of \n     Biometric Identity Management.''\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n     This level includes: $40,546,000 for Salaries and Expenses \n     (S); $15,980,000 for Systems Engineering; $155,840,000 for \n     Operations and Maintenance (O), to include $65,500,000 for \n     IDENT; and $20,056,000 for Identity Management and Screening \n     Services. Funding is not provided for the Office of Biometric \n     Identity Management (OBIM) to continue US--VISIT's staff \n     rotations to international partner agencies. As provided in \n     bill language, the S and half of the O funds have an \n     availability of one year. The bill provides $19,917,000 to \n     ICE in order to fully fund overstay analysis previously \n     performed by US--VISIT, to include the Data Integrity Group. \n     The bill also provides $12,284,000 to CBP related to entry-\n     exit policy and operations. Statutory language is included \n     ensuring that the appropriate successor account is charged \n     for amounts obligated under US-VISIT. Further, the amount \n     provided under this heading does not include funds requested \n     for a civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a \n     civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of \n     the pay raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2013.\n       As outlined in the House report, OBIM is the lead entity \n     within DHS responsible for biometric identity management \n     services through its management of the Automated Biometric \n     Identification System, or IDENT. OBIM assumes the most \n     significant and cross-cutting responsibility from what was \n     known as US-VISIT--namely to serve customers across DHS, at \n     other Federal agencies, in State and local law enforcement, \n     and overseas through storage of biometric identities, \n     recurrent matching against derogatory information, and other \n     biometric expertise and services. OBIM is expected to \n     reconstitute what is now known as the US-VISIT Executive \n     Stakeholder Board to ensure strong coordination with DHS and \n     interagency partners.\n       OBIM is encouraged to identify efficiencies under this new \n     structure through reassessing its staffing, travel, and \n     contractor support requirements.\n\n                       Operations and Maintenance\n\n       OBIM retains budget and responsibility for the Arrival \n     Departure Information System (ADIS) as well as IDENT. OBIM is \n     directed to undertake a rigorous review of its Information \n     Technology costs, as well as IDENT and ADIS modernization \n     needs, and develop proposals for efficiencies and cost \n     savings, including considering managed service options with \n     the CBP Office of Information Technology and examining \n     contractor services. OBIM is encouraged to apply efficiencies \n     and cost savings to continue the Unique Identity program and \n     modernize IDENT. All modernization activities should be \n     outlined in OBIM's investment and management plan.\n       As directed in the House report, OBIM shall continue its \n     data sharing and connectivity improvement efforts with the \n     Intelligence Community. OBIM also is directed to brief the \n     Committees on a semiannual basis on its workload and service \n     levels, staffing, modernization efforts, and other \n     operations.\n\n                            Unique Identity\n\n       OBIM and its counterparts at the Justice, State, and \n     Defense Departments as well as its stakeholders within DHS \n     are directed to continue providing semiannual briefings on \n     the progress in implementing system interoperability, as \n     required by the House and Senate reports.\n\n                                  Exit\n\n       CBP is the DHS lead for entry-exit policy and operations. \n     Responsibility for implementing a biometric exit program lies \n     with CBP. As a transitional matter, OBIM is directed to \n     ensure that the entry data exchange program with Canada, as \n     referenced in the Senate report, is fully funded in fiscal \n     year 2013. Within 120 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, CBP, in conjunction with OBIM and any other \n     appropriate partners, such as the Science and Technology \n     Directorate, shall report to the Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations, the Judiciary, and Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs and the House Committees on \n     Appropriations, the Judiciary, and Homeland Security on the \n     Department's tangible progress in implementing an enhanced \n     biographic exit system and biometric exit planning. The \n     report shall include the results of the Canadian pilot \n     programs and provide an update on the Mexican pilot program. \n     The Committees on Appropriations shall be briefed \n     semiannually on exit thereafter.\n\n                        Office of Health Affairs\n\n       A total of $132,499,000 is provided for the ``Office of \n     Health Affairs'' (OHA). The amount provided under this \n     heading does not include $55,000, as requested, for a \n     civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a civilian \n     pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay \n     raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2013.\n       Of the total amount provided, $2,000,000 is for the \n     Chemical Defense Program, $1,500,000 above the request for \n     two additional demonstration projects, to be awarded through \n     a competitive process; $13,000,000 is for the National Bio-\n     Surveillance Integration System, $5,000,000 above the request \n     to sustain existing activities and support new pilots, to be \n     awarded through a competitive process; and $5,407,000 is for \n     Planning and Coordination, $500,000 above the request to \n     support programs that address the wellness and resiliency of \n     the DHS workforce and the needs of the Food, Agriculture, and \n     Veterinary Defense Division.\n       Of the total amount provided, $26,702,000 is for salaries \n     and expenses. The decrease below the request is due to \n     continued under execution of on-board FTE and lapsed \n     balances.\n       Of the total amount provided, $85,390,000 is for BioWatch, \n     $39,900,000 below the request which was intended for BioWatch \n     Generation 3 testing and evaluation. The Committees have \n     consistently demonstrated strong support for the development \n     of an early warning network to detect biological agents to \n     speed response and recovery from a terrorist attack. While \n     the Committees support OHA's ongoing efforts to improve the \n     Nation's biological detection capabilities, serious concerns \n     have been raised about the Biowatch Generation 3 program, to \n     include scientific validity and delays in execution that have \n     created large carryover balances. The Department is \n     encouraged to continue with Phase II, Stage I activities, as \n     currently planned with available carryover funding, to ensure \n     candidate systems meet entry criteria through performance \n     testing. However, prior to entering Phase II, Stage 2 that \n     includes down-selection for a single solution and entering \n     operational testing and evaluation, the Secretary shall \n     certify to the Committees that the science used to develop \n     the technology is proven and warrants operational testing and \n     evaluation.\n       The OHA Chief Financial Officer is directed to brief the \n     Committees on the entire year expenditure plan for funds \n     provided in this Act not later than 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                  Federal Emergency Management Agency\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       A total of $973,118,000 is provided for ``Salaries and \n     Expenses.'' The following programs are funded, within the \n     total, at last year's levels as listed in Senate report 112-\n     169: the National Hurricane Program, the National Earthquake \n     Hazards Reduction Program and the National Dam Safety \n     Program. Of the amounts provided, no less than $35,180,000 is \n     for the Urban Search and Rescue Response System and \n     $2,000,000 is for the Emergency Management Assistance \n     Compact. An additional $5,000,000 for automation \n     modernization and $5,000,000 for national training center \n     infrastructure improvements is provided. The amount provided \n     under this heading does not include funds, as requested, for \n     a civilian pay raise. Should the President provide a civilian \n     pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the cost of the pay \n     raise will be absorbed within existing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2013.\n       Of the total amount provided, $4,293,000 is included for \n     the Office of National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC), \n     which is a reduction of $806,000 below the request. ONCRC is \n     directed to work expeditiously on its highest priority \n     activities in fiscal year 2013.\n       The grant management and administration costs associated \n     with ''State and Local Programs'', ''Firefighters Assistance \n     Grants'', and ''Emergency Management Performance Grants'' are \n     fully funded within the ''Salaries and Expenses'' \n     appropriation instead of through transfers as has been done \n     in previous years.\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\n\nAdministrative and regional offices........................$257,409,000\n  Office of National Capital Region Coordination............(4,293,000)\nPreparedness and protection.................................179,047,000\nResponse....................................................179,428,000\n  Urban search and rescue response system..................(35,180,000)\nRecovery.....................................................55,299,000\nMitigation...................................................29,814,000\nMission support.............................................157,534,000\nCentrally managed accounts..................................114,587,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Total, Salaries and Expenses.............................$973,118,000\n\n       A provision is continued and made permanent a provision \n     directing the inclusion of West Virginia and Pennsylvania to \n     be incorporated into efforts to integrate the activities of \n     Federal, State, and local government in the National Capital \n     Region.\n       FEMA is directed to brief the Committees on an expenditure \n     plan, within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, \n     detailed by PPA and by office, which shall include: funding \n     levels for the prior year, the current year, and deviations \n     between the two years. The number of positions, the number of \n     FTE, the amount for salaries and benefits and the amount for \n     the program showing all sources of funding, to include \n     transfers from other appropriations, shall also be included. \n     FEMA shall include fiscal year 2014 budget detail for each \n     FEMA office and region by: object classification, FTEs on-\n     board, FTE vacancies, and the appropriation accounts used to \n     support the office and its programs. Further, FEMA is \n     directed to present the fiscal year 2014 budget in the same \n     account and PPA structure as provided in this Act and \n     statement. Should FEMA determine that changes to the funding \n     structure facilitate better resource management and \n     transparency in spending, changes shall be presented in an \n     addendum to the Congressional Justification with a clear \n     justification.\n       FEMA is directed to maintain the Children's Coordinator \n     position within the Office of the Administrator and sustain \n     the on-\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n     going efforts of the working group to address children's \n     disaster-related needs.\n       FEMA is directed to provide an expenditure plan for capital \n     improvement for the Mount Weather facility for fiscal year \n     2013 no later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and for fiscal years 2013 through 2018 no later than \n     May 1, 2013.\n       A new appropriation for ``Automation Modernization'' is not \n     included. Instead, $5,000,000 above the request is provided \n     for automation modernization within ``Salaries and \n     Expenses.'' This amount is to continue the effort begun by \n     the Committees in fiscal year 2012 to update FEMA's \n     technological capabilities in order to better meet its \n     mission. No funds were identified in the fiscal year 2013 \n     budget request for this effort; however, should there be \n     funds intended for this purpose, the $5,000,000 provided is \n     in addition to that amount. FEMA is directed to provide a \n     report 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     detailing funding for fiscal year 2012, planned for fiscal \n     year 2013, and requested for fiscal year 2014 by program, \n     project, and activity for new information technology \n     investments and automation modernization.

The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA \n     is as follows:\n\nDiscretionary State and Local Grants.......................$188,932,000\nState Homeland Security Grant Program.......................346,600,000\n    Operation Stonegarden..................................(46,600,000)\nUrban Area Security Initiative..............................500,376,000\n    Nonprofit security grants..............................(10,000,000)\nPublic transportation security assistance and railroad security \n  assistance.................................................97,500,000\n    Amtrak security........................................(10,000,000)\nPort Security Grants.........................................97,500,000\nEducation, Training, and Exercises.....................................\n    Emergency Management Institute...........................17,805,000\n    Center for Domestic Preparedness.........................64,991,000\n    National Domestic Preparedness Consortium................93,000,000\n    National Exercise Program................................32,378,000\n    Continuing Training .....................................27,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n  Subtotal, Education, Training, and Exercises..............235,174,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \nTotal, State and Local Programs..........................$1,466,082,000\n\n       The National Preparedness Grant Program, as proposed in the \n     budget request is rejected due to a lack of justification, \n     and a new general provision is included in Title V of this \n     Act that prohibits the obligation of funds for such program \n     or any successor program unless explicitly authorized by \n     Congress. Instead, the bill provides no less than the amounts \n     distributed in fiscal year 2012 for the State Homeland \n     Security Grant Program, Operation Stonegarden, the Urban Area \n     Security Initiative, Nonprofit Security Grants, Public \n     Transportation Security Assistance and Railroad Security \n     Assistance Grants to include grants to Amtrak security, and \n     Port Security Grants. Within the total amount provided, \n     $188,932,000 is to be allocated by the Secretary according to \n     threat, vulnerability, and consequence to assist in \n     preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding \n     to acts of terrorism.\n       Several provisions are included related to grant \n     administration. Grant guidance shall be issued within 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, applicants shall \n     apply within 80 days of receiving guidance, and award \n     decisions shall be made within 65 days of the receipt of \n     applications. Grantees may not use more than 5 percent of a \n     grant for grant administration and shall provide reports on \n     the use of funds as determined necessary by the Secretary. \n     The installation of communications towers is not considered \n     construction under State Homeland Security Grants and the \n     Urban Area Security Initiative.\n       A provision is included and made permanent allowing the \n     Center for Domestic Preparedness to train, and be reimbursed \n     for such training, certain emergency personnel provided it \n     does not interfere with the primary mission to train state \n     and local emergency response providers.\n       The Secretary and the Administrator are directed to refine \n     the grant reform proposal and include enough detail for the \n     appropriate committees of jurisdiction, potential grantees, \n     and the general public to understand how such reform will \n     further the safety and security of the Nation and its \n     citizens.\n       The Committees believe that the UASI program should be \n     further focused on the areas under the greatest threat and at \n     the greatest risk, providing funding to a maximum of 25 \n     regions. FEMA is directed to clearly identify the specific \n     criteria that will be used to determine the risk to urban \n     areas in a briefing to the Committees prior to grant guidance \n     being issued, and to justify the reason for final \n     determinations in a clear and transparent manner to the \n     Committees five days prior to the announcement of awards, in \n     accordance with a general provision in Title V of this Act.\n       Within the total amount provided, $27,000,000 is for \n     Continuing Training Grants, of which no less than $3,000,000 \n     may be awarded through a competitive process to provide and \n     deliver FEMA-certified training to rural first responders.\n       FEMA is directed to brief the Committees on its progress \n     toward resolving the recommendations of the June 2012 OIG \n     report, ``Requirements for Reporting Homeland Security Grant \n     Program Achievements'' (OIG-12-92), not later than 45 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       The Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program \n     Progress Report, required by the joint explanatory statement \n     accompanying Public Law 112-74, which was received on August \n     14, 2012, details the challenges regional catastrophic \n     planning presents and the results of the grant program in \n     overcoming those challenges. The comprehensive report \n     completed by grant recipients, which was included as part of \n     the FEMA report, in particular highlights specific progress. \n     FEMA is directed to continue its technical assistance to \n     areas at greatest risk of a catastrophic event and to promote \n     regional planning for on-going and emerging needs.\n\n\n                     FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS\n\n       A total of $675,000,000 is provided for ``Firefighter \n     Assistance Grants'' including $337,500,000 for firefighter \n     assistance grants and $337,500,000 for firefighter staffing \n     grants. In lieu of providing a report as directed in House \n     report 112-492, FEMA is directed to brief the Committees \n     semiannually on efforts to hire veterans.\n\n\n                EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE GRANTS\n\n       A total of $350,000,000 is provided for ``Emergency \n     Management Performance Grants.''\n\n\n              RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM\n\n       Statutory language is included providing for the receipt \n     and expenditure of fees collected, as authorized by P.L. 105-\n     276.\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION\n\n       A total of $44,000,000 is provided for the ``United States \n     Fire Administration.'' The amount provided does not include \n     funds, as requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n       In 2050, the number of elderly in America is projected to \n     be 88.5 million, more than double the 40.2 million in 2010. \n     This shift in our demographics will have a dramatic impact on \n     services provided by the fire service and emergency medical \n     personnel. The FEMA Administrator, in consultation with the \n     USFA Administrator, is directed to submit to the Committees \n     no later than May 1, 2013, a report describing the need for \n     educational outreach to the elderly on prevention, improved \n     training and equipment for fire service and emergency medical \n     personnel on how to assist the elderly, and where \n     appropriate, model laws, regulations, or guidelines to \n     prevent injury or loss of life.\n\n\n                          DISASTER RELIEF FUND\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       A total of $7,007,926,000 is provided for the ``Disaster \n     Relief Fund,'' of which $6,400,000,000 is designated as being \n     for disaster relief for major disasters pursuant to \n     251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985. This level of funding is an increase of \n     $919,000,000 above the President's request, due to the impact \n     of Hurricane Sandy which made landfall on October 29, 2012, \n     and other designated disasters. A provision is included \n     transferring $24,000,000 to the OIG for audits and \n     investigations related to all disasters. Several provisions \n     directing FEMA to submit reports are included.\n\n\n             FLOOD HAZARD MAPPING AND RISK ANALYSIS PROGRAM\n\n       A total of $95,329,000 is provided for ``Flood Hazard \n     Mapping and Risk Analysis Program.'' The amount provided does \n     not include funds, as requested, for a civilian pay raise. \n     Should the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, \n     it is assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND\n\n       A total of $22,000,000 is provided for salaries and \n     expenses and $149,000,000 for flood plain management and \n     mapping. The Committees note that eliminating severe \n     repetitive loss properties results in the greatest savings to \n     the National Flood Insurance Fund, and FEMA is encouraged to \n     continue to prioritize reducing the number of such \n     properties. FEMA is directed to report to the relevant \n     committees of jurisdiction as required by Senate report 112-\n     169 and including the House Committee on Financial Services, \n     on efforts to improve levee analysis and mapping procedures.\n\n\n                  NATIONAL PREDISASTER MITIGATION FUND\n\n       A total of $25,000,000 is provided for ``National \n     Predisaster Mitigation Fund.''\n\n\n                       EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER\n\n       A total of $120,000,000 is provided for the ``Emergency \n     Food and Shelter'' program.\n\n       TITLE IV--RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND SERVICES\n\n           United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\n\n       A total of $111,924,000 is provided in discretionary \n     appropriations for USCIS for E-\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\n     Verify. The amount provided under this heading does not \n     include funds requested for a civilian pay raise. Should the \n     President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing funds for fiscal year 2013.\n\n                        Military Naturalizations\n\n       The cost of military naturalizations is to be paid for by \n     the Department of Defense through the execution of an annual \n     Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) for reimbursement. Therefore, no \n     USCIS funds are provided for military naturalizations, and \n     USCIS is directed to ensure that IAAs are executed in a \n     timely manner each year.\n\n              Electronic Access to Immigration Information\n\n       USCIS shall work with ICE and EOIR to maximize the sharing \n     of digital records and ultimately minimize the cost of \n     shipping and managing cumbersome paper files. Funds are \n     specified to support efforts to that end in ICE Automation \n     Modernization; USCIS is encouraged to participate in and \n     support these efforts as well. USCIS is also directed to \n     provide no less than $29,000,000 to continue conversion of \n     immigration records to digital format.\n\n                            Electronic I-94\n\n       As required by the House report, USCIS and CBP are directed \n     to brief the Committees quarterly on their progress toward \n     elimination of the paper I-94. Before the Department \n     implements interim changes, extensive outreach should be \n     undertaken to ensure that those affected understand the \n     interim process of obtaining the valid I-94 number.\n\n                                E-Verify\n\n       The Director of USCIS is expected to submit a report to the \n     Committees identifying the costs of expanding the use of E-\n     Verify no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, as required by the Senate report.\n\n                           Stateless Persons\n\n       As directed by the House report, USCIS, with other DHS \n     components as appropriate, shall brief the Committees on its \n     efforts to quantify the number of stateless persons in the \n     country.\n\n                      Immigrant Integration Grants\n\n       A general provision in Title V of this Act is included \n     providing $2,500,000 in appropriated funds and $7,500,000 \n     from fee revenue for immigrant integration grants. None of \n     the appropriated funds may be used to administer the program.\n\n                Federal Law Enforcement Training Center\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       A total of $228,467,000 is provided for ``Salaries and \n     Expenses.'' Within the funds provided, $29,163,000 is for \n     Management and Administration and $1,300,000 for the Federal \n     Law Enforcement Training Accreditation Board. The amount \n     provided under this heading does not include $472,000, as \n     requested, for a civilian pay raise. Should the President \n     provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is assumed that the \n     cost of the pay raise will be absorbed within existing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n\n      Support of the DHS Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer\n\n       The Department informed and briefed the Committees that \n     beginning in fiscal year 2012, it planned to partner with the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) through an \n     IAA to fulfill its human resource service requirements, with \n     FLETC being fully reimbursed through the Working Capital \n     Fund. The Department assured the Committees that this \n     partnership would result in reduced costs for human resources \n     service needs for headquarters components and deliver these \n     services in a more efficient manner. Since the initial \n     announcement, the Chief Human Capital Officer has decided to \n     modify the execution plan, potentially moving some functions \n     back to DHS Headquarters. There is no objection to this \n     arrangement as long as it does not adversely impact FLETC's \n     mission requirements. As such, the Office of the Chief Human \n     Capital Officer and FLETC are directed to brief the \n     Committees no later than 90 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act on the current plan to deliver human resource \n     services.\n\n             Full Utilization of FLETC Training Facilities\n\n       In the current fiscal environment, law enforcement agencies \n     are not hiring at the rate that has been experienced in the \n     past ten years. For that reason, FLETC is experiencing lower \n     demand for basic training and has greater capacity to support \n     advanced training and potentially other activities. FLETC is \n     encouraged to ensure that its facilities and assets are fully \n     utilized to support the needs of its customers. For example, \n     if training does not fully utilize firing ranges, FLETC \n     should consider use of firing ranges for law enforcement \n     qualification requirements. FLETC is directed to brief the \n     Committees within 60 days of the date of enactment of this \n     Act on its utilization rates.\n\n\n     ACQUISITIONS, CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVEMENTS, AND RELATED EXPENSES\n\n       A total of $28,385,000 is provided for ``Acquisitions, \n     Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses.''\n\n                         Science and Technology\n\n\n                     MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n       The bill provides $132,000,000 for ``Management and \n     Administration,'' including not to exceed $7,650 for official \n     reception and representation expenses. The amount provided \n     includes a reduction of $228,000 for the pay raise. Should \n     the President provide a civilian pay raise for 2013, it is \n     assumed that the cost of the pay raise will be absorbed \n     within existing appropriations for fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n           RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION, AND OPERATIONS\n\n       The bill provides $703,471,000 for ``Research, Development, \n     Acquisition, and Operations.''\n       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as \n     follows:\n\nResearch, Development, and Innovation......................$450,555,000\nLaboratory Facilities.......................................164,932,000\nAcquisition and Operations Support...........................47,984,000\nUniversity Programs..........................................40,000,000\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \nTotal, Research, Development, Acquisition and Operations...$703,471,000\n\n                 Research, Development, and Innovation\n\n       The bill includes $450,555,000 for Research, Development, \n     and Innovation (RDI). This funding is expected to permit the \n     Science and Technology Directorate (S) to restart and \n     sustain its efforts in its top priority areas, to include \n     biological defense, cybersecurity, border security, and first \n     responder technologies. However, the Committees do not \n     support having RDI as an undifferentiated PPA for this \n     activity, breakouts by research thrust areas are preferred. \n     At the same time, since funding is below the request, some \n     adjustment will be made to prioritize the funding. S is \n     directed, as was done in the joint explanatory statement \n     accompanying Public Law 112-74, to provide to the Committees \n     a detailed breakout of funding levels proposed for each of \n     its research thrust areas within the RDI PPA, and submit this \n     no later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act. These revised allocations by thrust area shall \n     subsequently serve as PPAs and control levels for fiscal year \n     2013 for purposes of reprogramming notification and approval, \n     governed by the requirements of the general provisions in \n     Title V of this Act. This funding plan shall also include \n     project-level detail on how S intends to fund individual \n     research initiatives within each thrust area PPA.\n\n                           Portfolio Reviews\n\n       S is directed to brief the Committees on the results of \n     any portfolio reviews conducted in fiscal year 2013 no later \n     than 30 days after completion of the review and assessment of \n     its results. As required by the House report, the briefing \n     shall include an assessment of the most promising projects, \n     an appraisal of those that scored poorly, any plans to modify \n     or reallocate funding from underperforming initiatives, as \n     well as a detailed overview of how S measures and \n     scrutinizes the cost and schedule of its research projects.\n\n                          Customer Engagement\n\n       S is directed to brief the Committees no later than 60 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act on the process \n     for determining each customer's research and development \n     needs; for prioritizing S work for them; and for assessing \n     customer satisfaction with S's work. The briefing shall \n     also describe the extent to which S customers are involved \n     in the Directorate's portfolio reviews.\n\n                             Apex Projects\n\n       S and its partner components are directed to brief the \n     Committees no later than 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and periodically thereafter on funding, \n     schedule, and progress of Apex projects. S is also directed \n     to notify the Committees at least 14 days before initiating a \n     new Apex project.\n\n                National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility\n\n       The bill provides $37,500,000 within the Laboratory \n     Facilities PPA for the National Bio- and Agro-defense \n     Facility (NBAF). This funding shall be applied, in \n     conjunction with $90,000,000 in previous appropriations, to \n     the construction of the new biological security level \n     facility needed to handle large animal research into \n     infectious animal and zoonotic diseases. If additional funds \n     are to be considered for NBAF in fiscal year 2014, or any \n     fiscal year thereafter, such funds must be in addition to the \n     Department's enacted budget, thereby not displacing resources \n     for Departmental programs. S is directed to submit a \n     detailed update of its fiscal year 2013 NBAF construction \n     plan and schedule no later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                   Plum Island Animal Disease Center\n\n       S is directed to provide with the fiscal year 2014 budget \n     an updated and detailed report on projected costs required to \n     keep Plum Island Animal Disease Center sustainable in the \n     short- and medium-term, and update periodically as estimates \n     change. The report shall include cost estimates and plans for \n     repair as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.\n\n                        Cyber Security Research\n\n       The Committees support increased funding for cyber security \n     research. The Department is encouraged to fund multi-\n     disciplinary programs of study and research that focus on \n     addressing cyber security problems on a global scale, as \n     specified in the Senate report. In addition, S is \n     encouraged to pursue cyber security programs that will assist\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\n     the U.S. financial industry, as required in the Senate \n     report. While a specific level of funding is not directed, as \n     proposed by the House, S is expected to take advantage of, \n     and leverage, the expertise of existing governmental \n     organizations to improve DHS cyber security capabilities, to \n     include the use of competitively awarded research and \n     development projects.\n       S is also directed to submit a report no later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act on the \n     expenditure of funds for financial sector cyber attack \n     simulations and outcomes, as required by the Senate report.\n\n                         Reporting Requirements\n\n       S is directed to provide in conjunction with the \n     President's fiscal year 2014 budget request, the results of \n     its research and development for the prior fiscal year, and a \n     report on the amounts de-obligated from projects during the \n     prior fiscal year and to what projects those funds were \n     subsequently obligated. S shall also provide quarterly \n     briefings to the Committees on the test and evaluation status \n     of all level 1 acquisitions.

A provision is continued that no part of any \n     appropriation shall remain available for obligation beyond \n     the current year unless expressly provided.\n       Section 502. A provision is continued that unexpended \n     balances of prior appropriations may be merged with new \n     appropriation accounts and used for the same purpose, subject \n     to reprogramming guidelines.\n       Section 503. A provision is continued that provides \n     authority to reprogram appropriations within an account and \n     to transfer up to 5 percent between appropriations accounts \n     with 15-day advance notification to the Committees. A \n     detailed funding table identifying programs, projects, and \n     activities is included at the end of this statement. This \n     table along with funding levels specified in the statement \n     shall serve as the control level for all reprogrammings. \n     These reprogramming guidelines shall be complied with by all \n     agencies funded by this Act.\n       The Department shall submit reprogramming requests on a \n     timely basis and provide complete explanations of the \n     reallocations proposed, including detailed justifications of \n     the increases and offsets, and any specific impact the \n     proposed changes will have on the budget request for the \n     following fiscal year and future-year appropriations \n     requirements. Each request submitted to the Committees should \n     include a detailed table showing the proposed revisions at \n     the account, program, project, and activity level to the \n     funding and staffing (full-time equivalent position) levels \n     for the current fiscal year and to the levels requested in \n     the President's budget for the following fiscal year.\n       The Department shall manage its programs and activities \n     within the levels appropriated. The Department should only \n     submit reprogramming or transfer requests in the case of an \n     unforeseeable emergency or situation that could not have been \n     predicted when formulating the budget request for the current \n     fiscal year. When the Department submits a reprogramming or \n     transfer request to the Committees and does not receive \n     identical responses from the House and Senate, it is the \n     responsibility of the Department to reconcile the House and \n     Senate differences before proceeding, and if reconciliation \n     is not possible, to consider the reprogramming or transfer \n     request not approved.\n       The Department is not to submit a reprogramming or transfer \n     of funds after June 30 except in extraordinary circumstances, \n     which imminently threaten the safety of human life or the \n     protection of property. If a reprogramming or transfer is \n     needed after June 30, the notice should contain sufficient \n     documentation as to why it meets this statutory exception.\n       Funds that are deobligated by the Department are also \n     subject to the reprogramming and transfer guidelines and \n     requirements set forth in this section.\n       Section 504. A provision is continued that prohibits funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department to \n     make payment to the Department's Working Capital Fund, except \n     for activities and amounts allowed in the President's fiscal \n     year 2013 request. Funds provided to the WCF are available \n     until expended. The Department can only charge components for \n     direct usage of the WCF and these funds may be used only for \n     the purposes consistent with the contributing component. Any \n     funds paid in advance or reimbursed must reflect the full \n     cost of each service. The WCF shall be subject to the \n     requirements of section 503 of this Act.\n       Section 505. A provision is continued that not to exceed 50 \n     percent of unobligated balances remaining at the end of \n     fiscal year 2013 from appropriations made for salaries and \n     expenses shall remain available through fiscal year 2014 \n     subject to section 503 reprogramming guidelines.\n       Section 506. A provision is continued that funds for \n     intelligence activities are deemed to be specifically \n     authorized during fiscal year 2013 until the enactment of an \n     Act authorizing intelligence activities for fiscal year 2013.\n       Section 507. A provision is continued and modified \n     requiring notification of the Committees three days before \n     grant allocations,\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n     grant awards, contract awards, other transactional \n     agreements, letters of intent, a task or delivery order on a \n     multiple contract award totaling $1,000,000 or more, a task \n     or delivery order greater than $10,000,000 from multi-year \n     funds, or sole-source grant awards, are announced by the \n     Department, including contracts covered by the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation. The Department is required to brief \n     the Committees 5 full business days prior to announcing the \n     intention to make a grant under State and Local Programs. \n     Notification shall include a description of the project or \n     projects to be funded, including city, county, and State.\n       Section 508. A provision is continued that no agency shall \n     purchase, construct, or lease additional facilities for \n     Federal law enforcement training without advance approval of \n     the Committees.\n       Section 509. A provision is continued that none of the \n     funds may be used for any construction, repair, alteration, \n     or acquisition project for which a prospectus, if required \n     under chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, has not \n     been approved.\n       Section 510. A provision is continued that consolidates by \n     reference prior year statutory bill language into one \n     provision. These provisions relate to contracting officer's \n     technical representative training; sensitive security \n     information; and the use of funds in conformance with section \n     303 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n       Section 511. A provision is continued that none of the \n     funds may be used in contravention of the Buy American Act.\n       Section 512. A provision is continued on reporting \n     requirements of the privacy officer.\n       Section 513. A provision is continued regarding the oath of \n     allegiance required by section 337 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act.\n       Section 514. A provision is continued requiring the Chief \n     Financial Officer to submit monthly budget execution and \n     staffing reports within 45 days after the close of each \n     month.\n       Section 515. A provision is included directing that any \n     funds appropriated or transferred to TSA ``Aviation \n     Security'', ``Administration'', and ``Transportation Security \n     Support'' in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 that are recovered or \n     deobligated shall be available only for procurement and \n     installation of explosives detection systems, air cargo, \n     baggage, and checkpoint screening systems, subject to \n     notification. Quarterly reports must be submitted identifying \n     any funds that are recovered or deobligated.\n       Section 516. A provision is included regarding the \n     competitive sourcing for United States Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services.\n       Section 517. A provision is continued for fiscal year 2013 \n     requiring that any funds appropriated to the Coast Guard's \n     110-123 foot patrol boat conversion that are recovered, \n     collected, or otherwise received as a result of negotiation, \n     mediation, or litigation, shall be available until expended \n     for the Fast Response Cutter program.\n       Section 518. A provision is continued for fiscal year 2013 \n     relating to undercover investigative operations authority of \n     the U.S. Secret Service.\n       Section 519. A provision is continued classifying the \n     functions of the instructor staff at the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center as inherently governmental for \n     purposes of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act.\n       Section 520. A provision is continued prohibiting the \n     obligation of funds by the Office of the Secretary and \n     Executive Management, the Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Management, and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for \n     grants or contracts awarded by any means other than full and \n     open competition. Certain exceptions apply, and this \n     provision does not require new competitions of existing \n     contracts during their current terms. It also requires the \n     Inspector General to review Departmental contracts awarded \n     noncompetitively and report on the results to the Committees.\n       Section 521. A provision is included that prohibits funding \n     pertaining to the Principal Federal Official during a \n     Stafford Act declared disaster or emergency, with certain \n     exceptions.\n       Section 522. A provision is continued that precludes DHS \n     from using funds in this Act to carry out reorganization \n     authority. This prohibition is not intended to prevent the \n     Department from carrying out routine or small reallocations \n     of personnel or functions within components, subject to \n     section 503 of this Act. This language prevents large scale \n     reorganization of the Department, which the Committees \n     believe should be acted on legislatively by the relevant \n     Congressional committees of jurisdiction.\n       Section 523. A provision is included prohibiting the \n     Secretary from reducing operations within the Coast Guard's \n     Civil Engineering Program except as specifically authorized \n     by a statute enacted after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Section 524. A provision is continued that prohibits \n     funding to grant an immigration benefit to any individual \n     unless the results of the background checks required in \n     statute, to be completed prior to the grant of the benefit, \n     have been received by DHS.\n       Section 525. A provision is included extending other \n     transactional authority for DHS through fiscal year 2013.\n       Section 526.

A provision is included prohibiting funds from \n     being used to reduce the Coast Guard's Operations Systems \n     Center mission or its government-employed or contract staff.\n       Section 530.

A provision is continued requiring the \n     Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     to notify the Committees of any proposed transfers from the \n     Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund to any agency within \n     DHS. No funds may be obligated until the Committees approve \n     the proposed transfers.\n       Section 533.

A provision is continued directing that any \n     official required by this Act to report or to certify to the \n     Committees on Appropriations may not delegate any such \n     authority unless expressly authorized to do so in this Act.\n       Section 537. A provision is continued extending risk-based \n     security standards for chemical facilities cited in section \n     550 of Public Law 109-295, as amended, for one year.\n       Section 538.

This explanatory \n     statement, while repeating some report language for emphasis, \n     does not intend to negate the language referred to above \n     unless expressly provided herein. In cases where the House or \n     the Senate has directed the submission of a report, such \n     report is to be submitted to both Houses of Congress. House \n     or Senate reporting requirements with deadlines prior to, or \n     within 15 days after, enactment of this Act shall be \n     submitted no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act. \n     All other reporting deadlines not changed by this explanatory \n     statement are to be met.\n       Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs Joint \n     Collaboration on Medical Facility Construction.--Having the \n     Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) medical facility construction accounts in the \n     same bill allows the Committees to review coordinated efforts \n     and efficiencies within the two systems. An overarching \n     concern of the Committees has been to facilitate the seamless \n     transition from active duty service member to veteran, \n     including the transition from DOD to VA medical facilities. \n     There have been multiple instances in which DOD and the VA \n     have failed to coordinate medical facility construction \n     efforts, in particular, where the VA is currently collocated \n     with an existing DOD medical facility, but hospital \n     replacement facilities are planned and budgeted in the \n     military construction budget without coordination or \n     consultation with the VA. Better coordination between the two \n     Departments on construction activities, where appropriate, \n     has the potential to save money by reducing duplicative \n     construction costs, and provides a unique opportunity for \n     creating more efficient use of medical equipment once the \n     hospitals or outpatient clinics become operational. The \n     TRICARE Management Activity and the Veterans Health \n     Administration are therefore directed to report to the \n     congressional defense committees no later than 180 days after \n     enactment of this Act on the current construction \n     coordination between the two agencies. The report should \n     include a comparison by fiscal year of the TRICARE Management \n     Activity and the Veterans Health Administration's future year \n     construction plans for new facilities that currently are \n     collocated as well as any potential new collocation sites.\n       Hiring of veterans.--The unemployment rates among the \n     Nation's veterans, particularly for those who have recently \n     left active duty, continue to be of concern. With impending \n     force reductions, this problem is likely to worsen. The \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the \n     Department of Defense and the domestic agencies funded in \n     title III of this division, are urged to redouble their \n     efforts to hire returning veterans and to exceed where \n     possible statutory requirements for veterans hiring \n     preferences. In recognizing the skills and specialty \n     certifications veterans have received through their military \n     training, these agencies will gain a superior workforce and \n     at the same time demonstrate the Government's appreciation \n     for our veterans' service.\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n                       ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST\n\n       Incrementally Funded Projects.--The Administration \n     requested several large military construction projects that \n     can be incrementally funded, but were instead submitted as \n     large single-year requests, in accordance with a directive \n     from the Office of Management and Budget to the Department of \n     Defense to severely restrict the use of incremental funding \n     for military construction. The Committees on Appropriations \n     of both Houses of Congress have previously notified the \n     Administration that they reserve the prerogative to provide \n     incremental funding where appropriate, in accordance with \n     authorizing legislation. In general, the Committees support \n     full funding for military construction projects. In some \n     cases, however, incremental funding makes fiscal and \n     programmatic sense. The bill therefore incrementally funds \n     the following projects: Ambulatory Care Center Phase 3, Joint \n     Base San Antonio, Texas; STRATCOM Replacement Facility, \n     Increment 2, Offutt AFB, Nebraska; U.S. Military Academy \n     Cadet Barracks, West Point, New York; and Aegis Ashore \n     Missile Defense Complex, Deveselu, Romania.\n\n                      MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY\n\n       The bill appropriates $1,684,323,000 for Military \n     Construction, Army. Within this amount, the bill provides \n     $80,173,000 for study, planning, design, architect and \n     engineer services, and host nation support.\n       Arlington Cemetery.--The budget request proposed to fund \n     Arlington National Cemetery through three accounts: \n     $25,000,000 to be provided through Operation and Maintenance, \n     Army, $103,000,000 to be provided through Military \n     Construction, Army, and $45,800,000 to be provided through \n     Cemeterial Expenses, Army for a total of $173,800,000. \n     Instead of including the $103,000,000 in title I as \n     requested, the funds are provided in title III of Division E \n     under Cemeterial Expenses, Army.\n\n              MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS\n\n       The bill appropriates $1,549,164,000 for Military \n     Construction, Navy and Marine Corps. Within this amount, the \n     bill provides $102,619,000 for study, planning, design, \n     architect and engineer services.\n\n                    MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE\n\n       The bill appropriates $322,543,000 for Military \n     Construction, Air Force. Within this amount, the bill \n     provides $18,635,000 for study, planning, design, architect \n     and engineer services.\n\n                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill appropriates $3,582,423,000 for Military \n     Construction, Defense-Wide. Within this amount, the bill \n     provides $315,562,000 for study, planning, design, architect \n     and engineer services.\n       Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP).--The bill \n     provides $150,000,000 for ECIP. Additionally, the bill \n     provides $10,000,000 in dedicated funding for ECIP planning \n     and design. The Committees strongly support the efforts of \n     the Department of Defense to promote energy conservation, \n     green building initiatives, energy security, and investment \n     in renewable energy resources, and commend the leadership of \n     the Department and the services for making energy efficiency \n     a key component of construction on military installations. \n     The Department is urged to use the dedicated planning and \n     design funds to invest in innovative renewable energy \n     projects as well as projects that enhance energy security at \n     military installations. The Department is also encouraged to \n     request dedicated planning and design funding for ECIP in \n     future budget submissions.\n\n               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n       The bill appropriates $613,799,000 for Military \n     Construction, Army National Guard. Within this amount, the \n     bill provides $26,622,000 for study, planning, design, \n     architect and engineer services.\n\n               MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n       The bill appropriates $42,386,000 for Military \n     Construction, Air National Guard. Within this amount, the \n     bill provides $4,000,000 for study, planning, design, \n     architect and engineer services.\n\n                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY RESERVE\n\n       The bill appropriates $305,846,000 for Military \n     Construction, Army Reserve. Within this amount, the bill \n     provides $15,951,000 for study, planning, design, architect \n     and engineer services.\n\n                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY RESERVE\n\n       The bill appropriates $49,532,000 for Military \n     Construction, Navy Reserve. Within this amount, the bill \n     provides $2,118,000 for study, planning, design, architect \n     and engineer services.\n\n                MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE RESERVE\n\n       The bill appropriates $10,979,000 for Military \n     Construction, Air Force Reserve. Within this amount, the bill \n     provides $2,879,000 for study, planning, design, architect \n     and engineer services.\n\n     NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION SECURITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\n       The bill appropriates $254,163,000 for the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization Security Investment Program.\n\n                   FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, ARMY\n\n       The bill appropriates $4,641,000 for Family Housing \n     Construction, Army.\n\n             FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, ARMY\n\n       The bill appropriates $530,051,000 for Family Housing \n     Operation and Maintenance, Army.\n\n           FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS\n\n       The bill appropriates $102,182,000 for Family Housing \n     Construction, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\n    FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS\n\n       The bill appropriates $378,230,000 for Family Housing \n     Operation and Maintenance, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\n                 FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE\n\n       The bill appropriates $83,824,000 for Family Housing \n     Construction, Air Force.\n\n          FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AIR FORCE\n\n       The bill appropriates $497,829,000 for Family Housing \n     Operation and Maintenance, Air Force.\n\n         FAMILY HOUSING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, DEFENSE-WIDE\n\n       The bill appropriates $52,238,000 for Family Housing \n     Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY HOUSING IMPROVEMENT FUND\n\n       The bill appropriates $1,786,000 for the Department of \n     Defense Family Housing Improvement Fund.\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HOMEOWNERS ASSISTANCE FUND\n\n       The bill provides no appropriation for the Department of \n     Defense Homeowners Assistance Fund in fiscal year 2013, the \n     same as the budget request.\n\n          CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE\n\n       The bill appropriates $151,000,000 for Chemical \n     Demilitarization Construction, Defense-Wide.\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT 1990\n\n       The bill appropriates $409,396,000 for the Department of \n     Defense Base Closure Account 1990. This amount is $60,000,000 \n     above the budget request to accelerate the pace of \n     environmental cleanup at closed or realigned military \n     installations. Based on requirements identified by the \n     services, of the additional funding provided, $30,000,000 \n     shall be made available for the Army, and $30,000,000 for the \n     Navy. These funds are to be allocated at the discretion of \n     the services to meet the most pressing unfunded environmental \n     cleanup requirements at closed or realigned bases.\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT 2005\n\n       The bill appropriates $126,697,000 for the Department of \n     Defense Base Closure Account 2005. Significant bid savings \n     have been realized in the BRAC 2005 military construction \n     program, primarily as a result of the favorable bid climate \n     over the past several years, and these savings should be used \n     to offset current BRAC 2005 requirements. The bill therefore \n     rescinds $132,513,000 from previous BRAC 2005 appropriations \n     (Sec. 131 of Administrative Provisions) to offset the fiscal \n     year 2013 request.\n       BRAC 133.--In an effort to mitigate traffic congestion \n     surrounding the Mark Center site, the bill includes a \n     limitation on the number of parking spaces the Department may \n     utilize at the Mark Center to no more than 2,500, with the \n     exception of disabled parking spaces. The limitation may be \n     waived in part, but not in whole, if the Secretary of Defense \n     certifies that none of the intersections surrounding the Mark \n     Center reach failing levels of service ``e'' or ``f,'' as \n     defined by the Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity \n     Manual, during a consecutive 90 day period.\n\n                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS\n\n             (Including Transfers and Rescissions of Funds)\n\n       The bill includes section 101 limiting the use of funds \n     under a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract.\n       The

          DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n       Budget justification requirements.--Both the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations believe that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must strengthen its \n     presentation of budget justification materials in several \n     areas. There is agreement with the direction of the Senate \n     regarding the budget detail for components of the Veterans \n     Health Administration (VHA) such as the VHA central office, \n     Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) staff offices and \n     centralized field support offices. The VA is requested to \n     provide more detailed information about the Board of Veterans \n     Appeals staffing and claims workloads and is required to \n     provide the data requested in the House report pertaining to \n     full-time equivalents and funding within administrative line \n     items. The VA is also required to provide a breakout of all \n     reimbursable or cost sharing arrangements exceeding \n     $5,000,000 in value that are in place for crosscutting \n     efforts across the Department.\n\n                    VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n                       COMPENSATION AND PENSIONS\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill appropriates $60,599,855,000 for Compensation and \n     Pensions. The bill reflects new estimates provided in the \n     Administration's mid-session review. Of the amount provided, \n     not more than $9,204,000 is to be transferred to General \n     Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration and \n     Information Technology Systems, for reimbursement of \n     necessary expenses in implementing provisions of title 38.\n\n\n                         READJUSTMENT BENEFITS\n\n       The bill appropriates $12,023,458,000 for Readjustment \n     Benefits. The bill reflects new estimates provided in the \n     Administration's mid-session review. The bill provides full \n     funding for the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program \n     (VRAP), for which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     estimates it will obligate more than $1,100,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 2013.\n\n\n                   VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES\n\n       The bill appropriates $104,600,000 for Veterans Insurance \n     and Indemnities.\n\n\n                 VETERANS HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAM FUND\n\n       The bill appropriates such sums as may be necessary for \n     costs associated with direct and guaranteed loans for the \n     Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund. The bill limits \n     obligations for direct loans to not more than $500,000 and \n     provides that $157,814,000 shall be available for \n     administrative expenses.\n\n\n            VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT\n\n       The bill appropriates $19,000 for the cost of direct loans \n     from the Vocational Rehabilitation Loans Program Account, \n     plus $346,000 to be paid to the appropriation for General \n     Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration. The \n     bill provides for a direct loan limitation of $2,729,000.\n\n\n          NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT\n\n       The bill appropriates $1,089,000 for administrative \n     expenses of the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program \n     Account.\n\n                     VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION\n\n                           Areas of Interest\n\n       Advance appropriation budgeting.--It is incumbent upon the \n     Department to provide more detailed explanations within its \n     budget justification so the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate (``Committees'') \n     will have an accurate and complete view of how its advance \n     funding requests were determined. There is agreement with the \n     data requirements for advance funding described in the Senate \n     report.\n       Reprogramming for medical care initiatives.--The bill \n     includes an administrative provision requiring the Department \n     to submit a reprogramming request whenever funding allocated \n     in the fiscal year 2013 expenditure plan for a medical care \n     initiative differs by more than $25,000,000 from the \n     allocation shown in the 2013 congressional budget \n     justification. Due to the nature of advance appropriations, \n     the Department submits its budget request almost seven full \n     fiscal year quarters before the funding becomes available for \n     obligation. Medical care funding is dynamic in nature, and \n     this length of time between budget submission and obligation \n     creates a situation in which funding priorities and needs may \n     change. This has limited the Committees' ability to provide \n     proper budget oversight of initiatives which are budgeted \n     outside of the actuarial model. Therefore, reprogramming \n     requests submitted throughout the year should identify \n     current year estimates whenever the Department intends to \n     make significant funding shifts within these initiatives. The \n     term ``medical care initiative'' in the bill language refers \n     only to the initiatives, not legislative proposals, in the \n     ``Initiatives/Legislative Proposals'' section of the VA \n     Medical Care Obligations by Program display on page 1A-5 of \n     Volume 2 of the fiscal year 2013 budget justification. The \n     bill language does not refer to special purpose funds \n     allocated outside the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation \n     model. The Committees request that reprogrammings be \n     identified only in the aggregate and not by specific project \n     or location.\n       There is agreement with the Senate direction regarding life \n     cycle costs as it relates to the acquisition of batteries. \n     The Department is directed to submit the reporting \n     requirement contained in the Senate report no later than 180 \n     days after enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                            MEDICAL SERVICES\n\n       The bill appropriates $43,557,000,000 in advance for fiscal \n     year 2014 for Medical Services. The bill also provides \n     $155,000,000 for fiscal year 2013 in addition to the advance \n     appropriation provided last year. The bill includes language \n     citing new authority for services for those affected by \n     drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune, NC. Additional \n     fiscal year 2013 funding is provided for hiring mental health \n     providers and offsetting a projected decline in revenues.\n       The bill provides $1,351,851,000 in fiscal year 2014 to \n     fully implement VA homeless assistance programs, including \n     the providers grant and per diem, domiciliary care for \n     homeless veterans, and the HUD-VA supported housing program. \n     In addition, the bill provides $4,816,132,000 for homeless \n     veteran treatment costs in fiscal year 2014.\n       The bill provides the full fiscal year 2014 request of \n     $6,453,027,000 for mental health programs, including \n     $443,332,000 for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \n     $246,400,000 for traumatic brain injury, and $75,605,000 for \n     suicide prevention.\n       The Committees support the VA effort to hire an additional \n     1,600 mental health clinicians and 300 support staff as part \n     of an ongoing review of mental health operations. The VA is \n     directed to provide the Committees, no later than 60 days \n     after enactment of this Act, a detailed staffing plan and \n     timeline to add these additional personnel.\n       The bill provides $250,000,000 for the Office of Rural \n     Health. The VA is making substantial efforts to improve \n     access and quality of care for rural areas, but there is \n     concern that significant gaps remain. To address the ongoing \n     challenges in recruiting and retaining highly qualified \n     healthcare professionals in rural areas, the VA is urged to \n     consider innovative ways to rotate practitioners through \n     rural areas, including the approaches suggested in the Senate \n     report. Secondly, the VA is urged to move expeditiously in \n     its implementation of the grant program that will allow \n     veterans service organizations to provide better \n     transportation options for rural veterans seeking care at VA \n     facilities. Finally, the VA is urged to thoroughly test the \n     approach for providing non-VA care in rural facilities that \n     is being demonstrated in the Access Received Closer to Home \n     program (Project ARCH) and consider expanding Project ARCH's \n     reach.\n       There is agreement with the direction of the House \n     regarding an annual report detailing the distribution of \n     medical services funding among the VISNs, central \n     headquarters, and medical centers.\n       The time period for the Office of Management and Budget's \n     (OMB) review of the regulation establishing VA participation \n     in State prescription drug monitoring boards has expired. OMB \n     is urged to facilitate publication of the regulation so that \n     the program may be implemented before the end of the calendar \n     year.\n       The VA is urged to work in conjunction with the Department \n     of Justice's veterans treatment courts program to provide \n     collaborative, rehabilitative approaches for continuing \n     judicial supervision over offenders who are veterans.\n\n\n                     MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n       The bill appropriates $6,033,000,000 in advance for fiscal \n     year 2014 for Medical Support and Compliance.\n\n\n                           MEDICAL FACILITIES\n\n       The bill appropriates $4,872,000,000 in advance for fiscal \n     year 2014 for Medical Facilities.\n       In March of 2012, the Committees were notified that \n     contracting errors were made in the Solicitation for Offers \n     to build the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in \n     Southwest Louisiana. These errors have resulted in delays in \n     the opening of the Lake Charles CBOC and the expansion of the \n     Lafayette CBOC. The Department is directed to continue to \n     provide the Committees regular updates on the progress being \n     made to correct the errors and to complete these CBOCs in an \n     expeditious manner.\n\n\n                    MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH\n\n       The bill appropriates $582,674,000 for Medical and \n     Prosthetic Research.\n\n\n                    NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION\n\n       The bill appropriates $258,284,000 for the National \n     Cemetery Administration (NCA). Of the amount provided, \n     $25,828,000 is available until September 30, 2014.\n       There is concern that the NCA is not adequately serving the \n     Nation's veterans in rural areas. While the strategy to serve \n     rural veterans outlined in the fiscal year 2013 budget \n     request is a partial step, it fails to offer a long-term \n     strategy for addressing this underserved veteran population. \n     There is concern that the NCA places undue emphasis on major \n     urban areas whereas the NCA's effort toward rural areas \n     appears to be a lower priority. As a result, the bill \n     includes language requiring the Secretary to provide a report \n     to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act \n     outlining a strategy to address the shortcomings identified \n     in House Report 112-491, with proposed policies and an \n     implementation timeframe. In addition, the bill requires the \n     Government Accountability Office to conduct a review of this \n     strategy and submit it to the Committees not later than 180 \n     days after the Committees receive the strategy.\n       The bill includes language directing the Secretary to issue \n     guidelines on committal\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n     services at VA national cemeteries to ensure that veterans' \n     families may hold committal services with any religious or \n     secular content they desire and invite the participation of \n     an honor guard and veterans service organizations, subject to \n     VA security, safety, and law enforcement regulations. The \n     bill also restricts VA from editing or controlling the \n     content of speeches at events at national cemeteries, subject \n     to VA authorities provided in section 2413 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n\n                      DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n                         GENERAL ADMINISTRATION\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill appropriates $424,737,000 for General \n     Administration. Of the amount provided, $20,837,000 is \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2014. The bill \n     includes language permitting the transfer of funds from this \n     account to ``General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits \n     Administration.''\n       The bill includes language designating that not less than \n     $86,006,000 is provided for the Board of Veterans Appeals. \n     The Department is directed to provide to the Committees \n     within 30 days of enactment of this Act a fiscal year 2013 \n     staffing plan and detailed strategic plan to address wait \n     time and backlogs at the Board of Veterans Appeals.\n       The bill includes language indicating that such sums as may \n     be necessary are provided so that the Department may comply \n     with the energy management requirements under the National \n     Energy Conservation Policy Act.\n       The bill includes the following funding levels:\n\n\n                       (in thousands of dollars)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Office                               Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOffice of the Secretary....................................       10,085\nBoard of Veterans Appeals..................................       86,006\nOffice of General Counsel..................................       83,099\nOffice of Management.......................................       45,598\nOffice of Human Resources..................................       70,379\nOffice of Policy and Planning..............................       26,015\nOffice of Operations, Security and Preparedness............       18,510\nOffice of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs.............       23,037\nOffice of Congressional Affairs and Legislative Affairs....        6,302\nOffice of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction..........       55,706\n    Total..................................................      424,737\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       There is agreement with the House language for the Major \n     Construction account regarding a report on the contract audit \n     program for construction projects and the periodic reporting \n     done by building contractors. The report should be provided \n     by the VA central office. There is also agreement with the \n     Senate language for the General Administration account \n     requesting a report outlining processes that are in place to \n     ensure proper oversight of construction, including which \n     components of central oversight are performed outside of the \n     various VA administrations and whether spot audits are \n     performed in the field.\n       There is agreement with House language regarding the VA \n     budget office being the primary communication source within \n     the VA to the Committees and their Members.\n\n      GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES, VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION\n\n       The bill appropriates $2,164,074,000 for General Operating \n     Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration. The bill makes \n     available not to exceed $113,000,000 of this funding until \n     the end of fiscal year 2014.\n       The lengthy wait time and persistent backlog of claims at \n     the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) continue to impose \n     an unacceptable burden on disabled veterans. The Department \n     has set 2015 as the date by which it plans to achieve a \n     significant reduction in the backlog of claims and to \n     increase the accuracy rate at all regional offices to 98 \n     percent. There is agreement with direction and reporting \n     requirements in the Senate report, and the Department is \n     directed to submit one report 90 days after enactment of this \n     Act containing: (1) the metrics developed for evaluating the \n     success in reducing the backlog of claims and the average \n     adjudication time by utilizing external vendors in specific \n     areas of collecting claims materials; (2) the wait times, \n     accuracy rates, and backlog of disability claims decisions at \n     all 57 regional offices; (3) how the quality-review teams and \n     the quality initiatives at each regional office have affected \n     the performance, wait times, and rates at each location; and \n     (4) the specific metrics the VBA uses in determining \n     personnel performance.\n       The Department is directed to provide quarterly reports on \n     the implementation of the Veterans Benefits Management System \n     (VBMS) and how the implementation has increased the \n     efficiency and timeliness of VBA claims processing, with the \n     quarterly reports including the number and location of the \n     regional offices that have adopted the paperless claims \n     processing system and the rollout of the individual improved \n     business processes.\n       Recent findings by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Office of Inspector General that the Oakland, Los Angeles and \n     San Diego, California VA Regional Offices have high error \n     rates and claims processing times compared to other regional \n     offices across the Nation is unacceptable. For example, the \n     Inspector General found that 80 percent of claims reviewed in \n     the Los Angeles office were unnecessarily delayed and that in \n     one case a claim in Oakland had been pending for 8 years. The \n     Department is directed to submit a report to the Committees \n     no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act detailing \n     how the Inspector General's recommendations are being \n     implemented at these Regional Offices. The report shall also \n     include an explanation about why the Los Angeles office is \n     currently operating in what is referred to as ``safe mode,'' \n     which means that staff is not held accountable to VA \n     standards.\n\n                     Information Technology Systems\n\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill appropriates $3,327,444,000 for Information \n     Technology (IT) Systems. The bill identifies separately the \n     funding available for pay ($1,021,000,000); operations and \n     maintenance ($1,812,045,000); and systems development, \n     modernization, and enhancement ($494,399,000). The bill makes \n     $30,630,000 of pay funding available until the end of fiscal \n     year 2014; $126,000,000 of operations and maintenance funding \n     available until the end of fiscal year 2014; and all IT \n     systems development, modernization and enhancement funding \n     available until the end of fiscal year 2014.\n       The bill includes language prohibiting the obligation of IT \n     development, modernization, and enhancement funding until the \n     VA submits a certification of the amounts to be obligated, in \n     part or in full, for each development project.\n       The bill includes language permitting funding made \n     available for the three IT subaccounts to be transferred \n     among them after the VA requests and receives approval from \n     the Committees.\n       The bill includes language providing that funding may be \n     transferred between development projects or to new projects \n     subject to the Committees' approval.\n       The bill includes language restricting the amount of \n     funding that may be obligated to develop the integrated \n     Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs (DOD-VA) \n     integrated electronic health record (iEHR) to 25 percent of \n     the funding provided until the DOD-VA Interagency Program \n     Office (IPO) provides the Committees an expenditure plan \n     including elements such as a long-term roadmap for the life \n     of the project, with annual and total spending for each \n     Department and quarterly milestones. The expenditure plan \n     should also be submitted to the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) for review. The Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act has comparable bill language.\n       There is concern that after four years of working to \n     establish a joint framework to collaborate and develop an \n     integrated electronic health record, the two Departments \n     still seem to be operating as separate entities. The \n     Committees support the creation of the IPO and recognize this \n     office as the single point of accountability for the \n     development and implementation of the integrated electronic \n     health record for both Departments. Unfortunately, since the \n     creation of the IPO and the naming of a director, there has \n     been little evidence of the benefit from establishing this \n     office, since both Departments still appear to operate as \n     separate entities. Despite repeated inquiries, neither of the \n     Departments nor the IPO has been able to provide Congress \n     with a firm total cost of the integrated system. There is \n     concern that the IPO is unable to maintain focus on its \n     defined goals, provide effective governance, manage and \n     maintain accountability on behalf of both Departments, and \n     provide Congress with detailed expenditure plans as well as \n     information regarding progress and future plans for this \n     project.\n       As a result, the IPO is directed to deliver to the \n     congressional defense committees, the Senate and House \n     Subcommittees on Appropriations for Military Construction, \n     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, and to the GAO a \n     quarterly report that includes a detailed, plain English \n     narrative explanation of the cost and schedule of the iEHR \n     development, to include milestones, knowledge points, and \n     acquisition timelines as it impacts both Departments, as well \n     as quarterly obligation reports. The IPO is also directed to \n     continue briefing the Committees on a quarterly basis.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend of mine and a friend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky who has \nserved his State and his community for decades. I was saddened to hear \nthat Doug Whitlock, the president of Eastern Kentucky University since \n2007, will retire from that position this summer. In his 6 years at the \nhelm, he has led Eastern Kentucky University to new growth and success, \nincluding the establishment of the EKU Center for the Arts, the New \nScience Building, the Noel Studio for Academic Creativity, the Center \nfor Renewable and Alternative Fuel Technologies, and much more.\n  Doug is EKU's 11th president. Like his predecessors, his mission has \nbeen to uphold the rich tradition of EKU while guiding the school to \neven greater excellence. Of course, this came naturally to Doug, as EKU \nis his own alma mater. Doug earned two degrees from EKU as a first-\ngeneration graduate--his bachelor's degree in history and social \nscience in 1965, followed by a master's degree in history in 1966. Doug \nalso earned a doctoral degree in higher education from the University \nof Kentucky in 1981.\n  Doug's been with EKU since 1968, when he became the school's director \nof publications. From 1971 to 1976, he served as director of public \ninformation; then as executive assistant to the president from 1976 to \n1998, and vice president for administrative affairs from 1998 to 2003. \nFrom 2003 to 2006, he returned to the classroom, teaching computer \nscience.\n  Perhaps Doug's greatest strength is that he understands the power of \ncollaboration. He knows how to lead others to see great goals \naccomplished. Aside from the progress he has brought to EKU, he has \nserved with the Madison County Schools Board of Education, the Richmond \nChamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Commerce Lexington's Central \nKentucky Public Policy Council, the Bluegrass Tomorrow Board of \nDirectors, the International Town and Gown Association, the Southern \nGrowth Policies Board, and the American Association of State Colleges \nand Universities.\n  Under Doug's tenure, EKU produced its first Truman, Goldwater, and \nFulbright Scholars and added several new Ph.D. programs. The 16,000-\nstudent school also gained several national distinctions, including \nrecognition by both Forbes and U.S. News & World Report as ranking \namong America's best colleges; recognition by the Carnegie Foundation \nfor the Advancement of Teaching as a community-engaged university; and \nrecognition by the Chronicle of Higher Education as one of America's \n``Great Colleges to Work For.''\n  Thanks to Doug's leadership, EKU also was honored as a veterans-\nfriendly campus by G.I.

Madam President, I would like to recognize the South \nLaurel Middle School Dance Team, a group of young ladies from Laurel \nCounty in eastern Kentucky who have recently achieved national success. \nSouth Laurel Middle's dance team won a Universal Dance Association \nnational title, marking the first time any dance team from South Laurel \nhas won such an accolade.\n  Head coach Bettina Rogers recounts that ``they danced with all their \nhearts'' and gratefully recognized the support of the school and the \nfriends, family, and community that surrounds these exceptional young \nladies. The girls embody the Kentucky spirit of hard work and \ndedication, practicing up to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, in \npreparation for their competition. The team, which formed in March, won \na plethora of other titles this year, and it is clear that their hours \nof practice have paid off.\n  At this time, I would like to applaud and recognize the South Laurel \nMiddle School Dance Team for their national title win and all their \nrecent accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that an article \nextolling the team's achievements from a Laurel County-area newspaper, \nthe Sentinel Echo, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Sentinel Echo, February 6, 2013]\n\n              CHAMPS!

The \n     girls practiced for the national competition five days a week \n     for approximately three hours, and sometimes four, Sizemore \n     said.\n       ``It means the world to me to get to spend five days a week \n     with my dance sisters, not only my sisters in dance, but my \n     sisters in Christ,'' said Megan Ford, an eighth-grade dance \n     team member.\n       ``I feel that our win was deserved, for all the hard work \n     we've done. But I also have to give all the glory to God for \n     keeping us safe as we go. I'm so thankful for all of these \n     girls for how we've been spending our time together and how \n     we've stuck together as a team--and not just as a team, but \n     as a family,'' said Hannah Sears, an eighth-grade dance team \n     member.\n       Six eighth-graders will be moving on to high school next \n     year, vacating their spots on the award-winning dance team. \n     Coach Rogers says try-outs will begin this March.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1589-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FREEDOM FOR BOB LEVINSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise today to remind this body of the \nplight of a missing person and the suffering of his family.\n  On March 8, 2007, retired FBI agent Bob Levinson traveled to the \nIranian island of Kish on a business trip. From what we know, he \nchecked into his hotel, checked out on March 9, got into a taxi, and \nthen disappeared.\n  This week marks the sixth year of his disappearance, making Bob one \nof the longest held or missing Americans in history.\n  And for Bob's wife Christine and their seven children, it's been 6 \nyears of excruciating suffering. Bob's safe return remains their \nhighest priority--as it must for the U.S. Government as well.\n  With the assistance of the U.S. Department of State, we continue to \nreceive word that Bob is alive and remains in captivity somewhere in \nSouthwest Asia.\n  Yet the Government of Iran continues to provide next to nothing in \nterms of real assistance. Given Iran's resources and capabilities in \nthe region, they could be doing so much more to help reunite Bob with \nhis family.\n  I remain convinced that our two countries share the same goal: \nfinally putting to rest all the speculation behind Bob's disappearance \nby safely getting him back to Florida where he belongs.\n  Today I rise to implore all parties to view this as a humanitarian \ncase that transcends the differences between the United States and \nIran. We must all redouble our efforts to bring Bob home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1589-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEAD EXPOSURE REDUCTION AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, today I would like to recognize \nretired LTC Dave Hoffman for his outstanding service to the United \nStates Air Force as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. Mr. Hoffman \njourneyed to Alaska in the 1970s to fly helicopters in the 71st \nAerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, ARRS, an Air Force Unit that \nperformed search and rescue for both civilians and military members in \nremote Alaska.\n  At that time, a United States Air Force air rescue unit was \nconsidered top notch if they logged two or more ``saves'' in a year. \nThe 71st ARRS that Dave Hoffman flew for logged over 90 saves in 1978. \nWith temperatures dipping to 30 degrees below zero, the pilots of the \n71st were often on their own in the Alaskan wilderness for days, \nputting their own lives at risk to save the lives of others.\n  After his service in the USAF, Dave joined the Alaska Army National \nGuard, assisting his unit in countless saves. When the Air Force \ndecided to deactivate the 71st ARRS, legislation was introduced that \ncreated the 210th Rescue Squadron, RQS, in the Alaska Air National \nGuard at Kulis Air National Guard Base in Anchorage, AK. Initially, as \na cadre instructor pilot and later as first commander of Detachment 1, \nDave Hoffman continued the tradition of greatness. By 1996, the 210th \nRQS had saved a record 310 lives and held the record for both the \nhighest altitude rescue, 14,400 ft., and the furthest rescue, 2037 \nmiles, in an HH-60G helicopter.\n  In the fall of 1991, then Major Hoffman participated in a rescue \neffort less than 400 nautical miles from the North Pole where a \nCanadian C-130 crashed. Flying night and day for over 3 days, Dave \nHoffman's ability to persevere under the worst conditions resulted in \nsaving 13 lives while managing to return all rescuers and assets \nunharmed. This mission earned him the Air Medal.\n  In 1993, he was involved in the first military exercise teaming \nRussian and American forces on Russian soil. Lieutenant Colonel Hoffman \nflew with such precision during an aerial refueling that Russian \nGeneral Kalugin was convinced an automated mechanism had performed the \nfeat. When it was proven that Dave Hoffman had, in fact, piloted the \nhelicopter, the Russian general presented him with a medal for \n``superior airmanship.''\n  Although Dave Hoffman is one of the best rescue and recovery pilots, \nhis personality outshines his technical ability. After a rough landing, \nDave is known to flash his famous smile and say, ``You know, my dashing \nyoung lieutenant, if you aren't so hard on the equipment it'll last \nlonger.'' His loyalty to the guard and to the men and women he served \nwith has touched all who know him.\n  Many recall a man who is always calm, sincere, honest, and has a \ngreat joy for life. Those who had the pleasure of flying with Dave, \naffectionately called ``Hoff-person'' and ``King Biscuit,'' are not shy \nabout the respect, admiration and love that they have for the man. \nWhether he was saving lives or sharing in them, he left a lasting glow \nwithin the recipients. On this day, I would like to honor Mr. Dave \nHoffman and thank him for his service to this country, to Alaska, and \nto so many who are lucky enough to know him.\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1590-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LYAL HANSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, today I wish to honor Mr. Lyal \nHanson, who is entering his 50th year of service to the United States \nPostal Service. The State of Alaska had only been a State for 5 years \nwhen Mr. Hanson began delivering mail.\n  In Alaska, mail delivery is not just a convenience; it is a \nnecessity. For interior villages, towns on the coast, and residents who \nlive in the Bush, the mail is a lifeline and often the only method of \nregular communication. In Alaska's urban and rural areas, the mail is a \ncritical part of our communications infrastructure which allows small \nbusinesses to transport goods.\n  Today, Mr. Hanson delivers mail in South Anchorage near Tudor Road. \nResidents on his delivery route know him and appreciate his public \nservice. Letter carriers like Lyal Hanson helped Alaska in the early \nstages of statehood and his work ties our communities together as we \ncontinue to grow.\n  Our State's economy has developed tremendously since Lyal Hanson \nbegan delivering mail, and the public service of people like him is \npart of our success story. At this time, I would like to recognize and \nthank Mr. Hanson for his many years of service to the United States \nPostal Service. We are fortunate to have someone as dedicated and \ncommitted to delivering mail in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1590-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL GLENN JOHNSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

He has served in units in the United States, \nGermany, Korea, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, and has \nsupported Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Over the course of his distinguished career, he has served at all \nlevels of the Army, from platoon leader to Chief of the Exercise and \nTraining Branch, U.S. Force Korea, to legislative liaison in the Army \nLegislative Affairs division. I was honored to have Lieutenant Colonel \nJohnson serve as a military fellow in my office in 2010.\n  I would like to extend my deepest thanks to Lieutenant Colonel \nJohnson for his many years of service to our Nation.

Madam President, earlier this year my home state of \nOregon lost one of its most visionary citizens, Dr. Robert Bayard \nTextor. Today I wish to join his friends, family, colleagues, and I \nhope the rest of the country, in mourning the loss of this thoughtful \nand uniquely accomplished man, who would have turned 90 this week.\n  Linguists tell us that the term ``citizen'' is synonymous with an \ninhabitant of a city or community. Bob was all of that and much more.\n  Bob began his studies at Antioch College before joining the U.S. Army \nin 1943. After the war he volunteered to use newly acquired language \nskills to aid in the reconstruction of post-war Japan. Like our late \ncolleague former Senator Mark Hatfield, his experiences in that war-\nravaged country proved to be a turning point in his life. When he left \nJapan in 1948, Bob resumed his formal education and focused his Ph.D. \nstudies at Cornell on what would be his lifelong passion--cultural \nanthropology--and committed himself to a career of seeking better ways \nto handle human problems.\n  Amid the Cold War and the arms race, Bob's drive to reduce \nintercultural misunderstanding led him to study first in Vienna, \nAustria, and late in Asia where he studied four different Asian \nlanguages.\n  Upon his return to the U.S., Bob advised the then-nascent Peace Corps \nin 1961-1962. During that time, he helped train the first cohort of \nPeace Corps Volunteers to be deployed in Thailand and wrote a memo to \nPeace Corps Director Sargent Shriver titled ``In-Up-Out.'' That \nconcept, specifying how the Peace Corps would benefit by staying \nyouthful and vigorous, guides the agency to this day.\n  Bob joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1964. When he \nretired in 1990, he served as a Courtesy Professor of International \nStudies at the University of Oregon, bringing his rare gifts to \nOregonians and visiting students alike.\n  While he researched, taught and studied at Harvard, Stanford, Oregon, \nand Cornell, above all, Dr. Textor was an anthropologist and an \nimportant innovator in the use of quantitative methods in comparative \nglobal analysis. He remains a force in what is now known as \nanticipatory anthropology and his work in this field lives on through \nthe Textor Family Prize for Excellence in Anticipatory Anthropology.\n  He wrote a comprehensive book on the legendary Margaret Mead titled \n``The World Ahead,'' and, at the request of Motorola, co-authored an \nanalysis of its corporate culture titled ``Uncompromising Integrity: \nMotorola's Global Challenge.''\n  While Dr. Textor will be remembered by his peers for his academic and \ngovernmental achievements, Bob Textor's legacy is much more personal. \nIn Portland, Bob served on the Metro Future Vision Commission and \nhelped craft a report which still guides the Portland Metro area's \ndevelopment.\n  In 1998, Bob's ``thirst'' for knowledge prompted him to found a \npolicy salon that lives today: The Thirsters. Convened every Thursday \nexcept Thanksgiving, the Thirsters bring together policy experts, \ndiplomats, business people and academicians to thrash out issues of \ntechnology, politics, social justice, ethics, sustainability and \nculture, all done amicably over glasses of Oregon's famous home-grown \nbeverages.\n  To quote his fellow Thirster, Lewis and Clark College Professor \nEmeritus Roger Paget: ``He leaves a significant legacy, not only in \nseveral professional fields and the community of Thirsters, but above \nall in Marisa and Alex, his children, both of whom imbibed his love of \nmaking sense out of being in different cultures.''\n  On behalf of his colleagues, the millions who have benefitted from \ntheir experience with the Peace Corps and my constituents in the \nThirsters, I want to express my appreciation for Bob Textor's life and \nservice to his country and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/11/senate-section/article/S1590-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 505.

A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nenhance the Small Business Investment Company Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nthe Expanding Access to Capital for Entrepreneurial Leaders Act, or the \nEXCEL Act. This legislation will enhance the already successful Small \nBusiness Investment Company, SBIC, program at the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, that has helped over 100,000 small businesses. The \nbest part of this bill is that the EXCEL Act should not cost the \ntaxpayer anything.\n  The SBA runs a venture capital program by guaranteeing money borrowed \nby qualified investment funds who invest in small businesses. The \nqualified funds, or Small Business Investment Companies, SBICs, are \nprivately owned and operated, but licensed and regulated by the SBA. \nUsing a combination of private investments and the loans guaranteed by \nthe SBA, typically at a ratio of $2 in guaranteed funds for every $1 of \nprivate capital, SBICs make longterm investments in American small \nbusinesses. In order to participate in the program, funds pay licensing \nfees which serve to cover all SBIC program costs. As a result, the core \nSBIC program, Debenture SBICs, not only boasts a strong success rate, \nbut also incurs no cost to the U.S. government. Since the program's \ninception, over $50 billion has been invested in over 100,000 small \nbusinesses.\n  In the last Congress, the former Ranking Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Olympia Snowe, and I conducted a roundtable with 14 \nparticipants from the SBA, SBICs, SBIC investors, and small businesses \nto elicit suggestions on enhancing the program. Out of that was born \nthe EXCEL Act.\n  The EXCEL Act is a bipartisan effort encompassing much-needed changes \nthat will allow the SBIC program to meet growing demand and will make \nimprovements so that more small businesses can access capital.\n  First, the EXCEL Act raises the SBIC program authorization level from \n$3 billion to $4 billion and pegs it to inflation. This change is long \noverdue--the ceiling has been at $3 billion for some time, despite \ninflation and the impressive growth in the SBIC program. To illustrate: \nthe program grew 50 percent in fiscal year 2011 alone. In order to meet \ndemand, we need to give the program room to grow.\n  Secondly, the EXCEL Act will encourage successful investors by \nraising the limit on ``families of funds.'' Family of funds refers to a \nteam of SBIC fund managers who operate several funds. These are \ncurrently limited to $225 million of SBA-guaranteed debt. However, SBIC \nfund managers who manage more than one fund generally see better \ninvestment results. The EXCEL Act will encourage that kind of success \nby giving families of funds a higher limit of $350 million, which will \nbe indexed to inflation.\n  Next, the EXCEL Act improves transparency and accountability in the \nprogram. The legislation requires that the SBA make public how \neffective individual SBICs are in their small business investments, \nguaranteeing that SBA-backed money is being used responsibly.\n  Finally, the EXCEL Act promotes outreach, thereby ensuring that the \nmaximum possible number of small businesses can benefit from the SBIC \nprogram. The legislation encourages outreach to community banks and \nother lenders, states and municipalities, and asks the SBA to make \ntheir SBIC website more user-friendly.\n  The EXCEL Act contains a number of commonsense provisions that have \nhad support across the aisle. It enhances a program with proven success \nin providing capital to small businesses, and does so with the \nexpectation that it will not add a dime to the deficit. Let us get this \nbill passed. Let us help small businesses excel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Franken, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Lee, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 517. A bill to promote consumer choice and wireless competition by \npermitting consumers to unlock mobile wireless devices, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that will help promote competition in the wireless industry \nand restore consumer choice. From 2006 until last year, an exemption to \nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, permitted cell phone users \nto ``unlock'' their cell phones when their contract expired, allowing \nthem to change wireless providers and thereby promoting consumer \nchoice. This exemption has enhanced competition in the cell phone \nmarket, but it was allowed to expire last year.\n  Over the past few weeks and months, consumers have spoken clearly--\nthey want to retain the right to transfer their cell phones between \nwireless providers, if they so choose, when their contracts expire. I \nagree, which is why today I am pleased to introduce the Unlocking \nConsumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, along with Senator \nGrassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Lee and Senator Franken, who chairs \nthe Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the \nLaw. We are working closely with Chairman Goodlatte and members of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee to pass commonsense legislation and provide \nconsumers with better choice.\n  The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act \nreestablishes the Library of Congress's rule permitting cell phone \nunlocking. It also directs the Library to undertake a new proceeding to \nconsider whether to broaden this exemption to allow unlocking of other \nwireless devices such as tablets. At a time when the line between phone \nand tablet is beginning to blur, it makes sense for the Library to \nconsider extending this exemption to those devices as well.\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\n  The DMCA maintains an important balance between protecting copyright \nowners and users. It was designed to be sufficiently flexible to meet \nthe challenges of an ever-evolving digital copyright world. Every 3 \nyears, the Library of Congress conducts its public review of the \nexemptions permitted under the DMCA to help promote that flexibility. \nUnfortunately, in its most recent proceeding, there was not a \nsufficient record for the Library to continue the cell phone exemption, \ndespite the strong merits of the rule. Our legislation restores the \nimportant exemption that had been in effect in previous years. Although \nCongress has stepped in in this instance to restore an important policy \nobjective, I urge parties in future rulemakings to provide a more full \nrecord so that the rulemaking process can proceed as it was designed.\n  When I wrote the DMCA, the law was intended to allow choice and \nprotect consumers. This straightforward restoring bill furthers that \nobjective. When consumers finish the terms of their contract, they \nshould be able to keep their phones and make their own decision about \nwhich wireless provider to use. They should not be forced to stay with \ntheir original provider due to software that restricts a phone to only \none network. I am pleased that many wireless providers already sell \nunlocked phones, or will unlock phones for consumers once contracts \nexpire, but that does not mean that consumers should face penalties \nunder the DMCA for taking those same steps on their own. This bill will \nprotect and promote competition in the wireless market by allowing \nconsumers to bring their phones with them to the provider that best \nsuits their needs.\n  I urge all Senators to support this narrow, commonsense legislation \nto protect consumers and promote competition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unlocking Consumer Choice \n     and Wireless Competition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF EXISTING RULE AND ADDITIONAL RULEMAKING BY \n                   LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Repeal and Replace.--Paragraph (3) of section 201.40(b) \n     of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, as amended and \n     revised by the Librarian of Congress on October 28, 2012, \n     pursuant to his authority under section 1201(a) of title 17, \n     United States Code, shall have no force and effect, and such \n     paragraph shall read, and shall be in effect, as such \n     paragraph was in effect on July 27, 2010.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Librarian of Congress, upon the \n     recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who shall \n     consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and \n     Information of the Department of Commerce and report and \n     comment on his or her views in making such recommendation, \n     shall determine, consistent with the requirements set forth \n     under section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United States Code, \n     whether to extend the exemption for the class of works \n     described in section 201.40(b)(3) of title 37, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as amended by subsection (a), to include \n     any other category of wireless devices in addition to \n     wireless telephone handsets.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act alters, or \n     shall be construed to alter, the authority of the Librarian \n     of Congress under section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United \n     States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 519. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to improve early education; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Providing \nResources Early for Kids Act of 2013--the PRE-K Act.\n  Research shows that quality early education is foundational for \nsuccess in school and in life.\n  The PRE-K Act will help more children enter school ready to succeed. \nIt creates a new federal-state partnership to provide better preschool \nopportunities for our country's children. High quality preschool makes \nthe biggest difference, so this bill focuses on quality.\n  The PRE-K Act would provide Federal grants to States to strengthen \nquality. States could use the funding to increase the number of highly \ntrained early educators in preschool classrooms.\n  The bill would improve the student-to-teacher ratios in preschools; \nprovide vital comprehensive services such as health screenings and \nnutritional assistance.\n  The bill would increase the hours per day and weeks per year families \nhave access to high quality early education programs; and improve \nprograms for our youngest children, from birth to three years old.\n  States would need to coordinate with existing Head Start providers \nand their State Advisory Councils.\n  The PRE-K Act recognizes that not all states have a high-quality \nstate preschool program in place yet. This bill meets states where they \nare. States that already have a high-quality program could apply as \n``Qualified States'' and get money improve quality and expand to serve \nmore children. Other States, like Hawaii, could apply as ``Selected \nStates,'' earning Federal grants to establish a high-quality preschool \nprogram within two years.\n  In Hawaii, Governor Abercrombie is leading the fight to build a State \npreschool program for low-income families. The PRE-K Act could support \nHawaii's efforts through Federal partnership grants.\n  Decades of research show that high quality early education programs \ncan help kids enter kindergarten ready to learn and avoid falling \nbehind. Later in life, kids who have high-quality preschool are more \nlikely to avoid crime or teen pregnancy, graduate high school and \ncollege, earn more income, pay taxes, and need fewer public services.\n  The studies have found that investing $1 in quality early learning \ncan bring a return on investment of between $2 and $17 down the line. A \nUniversity of Hawaii/Good Beginnings Alliance study of a theoretical \nHawaii program found we'd get $4.20 for every $1 invested. In this \ntight fiscal environment, wise Federal spending is key. High quality \nearly learning is one of the best investments we can make.\n  That is why business and financial leaders, from the Hawaii Business \nRoundtable to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, agree that quality \nearly education is critically important in providing the tools children \nneed for success in school and in adulthood.\n  Law enforcement officials know that quality early learning helps \nprevent kids from falling behind, dropping out of high school, or \ngetting involved in crime. High-ranking military leaders have also \nstressed the importance of quality early education as a national \nsecurity issue. Today 75 percent of Americans age 17 to 24 are \nineligible for military service due to poor education, physical un-\nfitness, or involvement with crime. Quality early learning helps kids \nget on the right path--before they fall behind.\n  Parents know the high cost of child care is difficult to afford. If \nparents can't find child care, they can't go to work. Parents also want \nmore than just supervision for their children. They want to know their \nchildren are being engaged by effective teachers who are preparing them \nacademically, socially, and emotionally for success in school.\n  Teachers and school administrators know firsthand that their students \nwho come to kindergarten with quality preschool are more likely to \nsucceed. Special education professionals and advocates for students \nwith disabilities know that quality early learning can identify \ndisabilities early and bring intervention to get kids on track with \ntheir peers.\n  Education is the great equalizer, and starting children on an early \npath to success is critical. I have been working to strengthen quality \nearly education for over a decade. As Lieutenant Governor, I helped \nestablish Hawaii's Pre-Plus program, which constructed preschool \nclassrooms for use by nonprofit, private, or public preschools. In the \nU.S. House of Representatives, I first introduced the PRE-K Act in \n2007. The\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nbill passed through the House Education and Labor Committee with a \nbipartisan vote. President Obama has made quality early learning a key \npart of his education platform. I helped lead a coalition of over 100 \nbipartisan House members to enact and fund President Obama's Early \nLearning Challenge. We also fought for increases in Head Start and \nChild Care subsidies to serve more children and families.\n  In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama called for \nnew Federal support for high-quality state preschool. This is the first \ntime in a generation that a president has used the State of the Union \naddress to call for expanding preschool access. The PRE-K Act answers \nthis call.\n  The time is right. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe House and Senate to move this forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 521. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to award grants to \nfund research on orthotics and prosthetics; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to tell you about a wounded \nwarrior.\n  He was fitted with a prosthetic leg that fit reasonably well and he \nwas able to carry on with his life. But from time to time his leg would \ngive out.\n  He would fall, but he carried on.\n  Then he and his wife were blessed with their first child. He was \nimmensely happy to be a father. But he was terrified to hold his baby.\n  He was afraid that his leg would give out and he would fall and hurt \nhis baby.\n  Can you imagine going to war to make the world safe for your children \nand then being afraid to hold your own child?\n  One day this young father mentioned his fear to a prosthetics \npractitioner, who began researching other prosthetic legs and was able \nto find a leg that fit him better and was more stable.\n  Finally, that new father was able to hold his baby without fear.\n  Most Americans will never need for a prosthetic limb. But many do. \nThey include people who suffer catastrophic injuries in battle and \naccidents and others who lose limbs to illnesses such as cancer and \ndiabetes.\n  For these people, proper-fitting, advanced prosthetics and orthotics \nfitted by highly trained, experienced clinicians can mean the \ndifference between constant pain and discomfort--and a certain amount \nof anxiety, or living a happier, healthier and more productive life.\n  Let me tell you about another veteran who lives in Illinois.\n  He lost a leg in Vietnam.\n  He was fitted with a prosthetic leg that included a hydraulic knee \nunit. That was the state of the art decades ago.\n  Several times a year he would fall. Many of the falls resulted in \nbroken bones and other injuries.\n  This veteran was also overweight, with high blood pressure.\n  About 6 years ago, he was fitted with his first computer-controlled \nknee.\n  He had more stability and more range of motion. He moved with more \nconfidence.\n  With his new, advanced knee, he was able to exercise. He lost weight.\n  His health improved and he was able to stop taking multiple \nmedications. He is living a happier, healthier life.\n  Finding the right prosthetic is more than luck or guess work. It \nrequires a great deal of education, training and experience. There are \nmany talented prosthetic clinicians working today in Veterans \nAdministration Hospitals and other hospitals and rehabilitation \nclinics.\n  But we have a problem. Just as the need for these health \nprofessionals is increasing, many are retiring.\n  Wounded warriors deserve the best medical care our grateful Nation \nhas to offer.\n  Today, with Senators Blumenthal and Harkin, I am introducing two \nbills to help ensure that service members and veterans who need \nprosthetics receive the care and equipment they deserve.\n  The first bill, the Wounded Warrior Workforce Enhancement Act, will \nestablish a competitive grant program at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to train more health professionals in the fields of orthotics \nand prosthetics.\n  These grants can be used to create new degree programs or expand \nexisting programs in these fields.\n  Our bill will also require the VA to establish a Center of Excellence \nin Prosthetic and Orthotic Education to research and share information \nabout the knowledge, skills, and training clinical professionals in the \nfield need the most.\n  The work at the Center would add to higher education's clinical \nexpertise to train the students going into prosthetics and orthotics.\n  The second bill we are introducing today, the Wounded Warrior \nResearch Enhancement Act, directs the Secretary of Defense to establish \nan ongoing program of research and best practices in orthotics and \nprosthetics care.\n  We ask OD to then make sure clinical professionals serving service \nmembers and veterans are kept up to date on innovations in technology \nand care.\n  In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, tens of thousands of our \nservice members have been wounded by roadside bombs, rocket propelled \ngrenades and small arms fire.\n  As our involvement in these wars winds down, many returning veterans \nare living with complex wounds that require sophisticated prosthetics \nand orthotics.\n  We can build on the breakthrough advances made by researchers at the \nRehabilitation Institute of Chicago and by private providers such as \nScheck & Siress, founded in Oak Park, IL.\n  Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, is home to the largest \nand oldest prosthetics and orthotics program in the Western Hemisphere.\n  It offers first-rate master's level education and training and \ngraduates 50 clinicians every year.\n  Northwestern can be a model for other universities around the country \nto meet the needs of veteran amputees.\n  New technologies are improving the quality of life for amputees. We \nneed to make sure that clinicians in the field have the skills and \ntraining to help veterans take advantage of these advances.\n  Recently the standard for entry-level qualifications for clinicians \nin prosthetics was changed to require a master's degree.\n  That makes sense. There is a lot to know. But right now there are not \nenough master's degree programs in our universities to meet the current \ndemands for prosthetics and orthotics technicians.\n  Many experienced clinicians are nearing retirement age.\n  Veterans are not the only people who benefit when we train more \nclinicians in the fields of prosthetics and orthotics.\n  As America's population ages and rates of diabetes and cardiovascular \ndisease increase, more Americans find themselves in need of prosthetics \nand orthotics. They, too, will benefit from this investment in research \nand training.\n  When we ask our service members to risk their lives for us, they \ndon't say, ``Ask me later.'' They go.\n  If they come home needing a new limb, we shouldn't tell them, ``Ask \nme later.''\n  We know that the VA is facing a critical and impending shortage of \nclinicians who are trained in prosthetics and orthotics.\n  By working together now, we can prevent that shortage and help \nAmerica's wounded warriors live the fullest lives possible. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas there are more than 3,300,000,000 women in the \n     world today;\n       Whereas women around the world participate in the \n     political, social, and economic life of their communities, \n     play a critical role in providing and caring for their \n     families, contribute substantially to the growth of \n     economies, and, as both farmers and caregivers, play an \n     important role in advancing food security for their \n     communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas, on January 30, 2013, President Barack Obama signed \n     a presidential memorandum recognizing the need for \n     ``dedicated professionals with . . . expertise and stature'' \n     to sustain advances in the status of women and girls \n     worldwide and directing the Secretary of State to ensure that \n     an Ambassador-at-Large continues to lead the Office of Global \n     Women's Issues;\n       Whereas, on December 19, 2011, the Obama Administration \n     launched the first-ever United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security that included a comprehensive set \n     of national commitments to advance the active participation \n     of women in decision making relating to matters of war and \n     peace;\n       Whereas President Obama said, ``[o]ur common prosperity \n     will be advanced by allowing all humanity--men and women--to \n     reach their full potential'';\n       Whereas, on August 10, 2012, President Obama announced

lives, including underrepresentation \n     in all aspects of public life, denial of basic human rights, \n     and discrimination;\n       Whereas, despite some achievements by individual women \n     leaders, women around the world are still vastly \n     underrepresented in high level positions and in national and \n     local legislatures and governments and, according to the \n     Inter-Parliamentary Union, women account for only 20.3 \n     percent of national parliamentarians;\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite proven \n     successes by women in conflict-affected regions in moderating \n     violent extremism, resolving disputes through non-violent \n     mediation and negotiation, and stabilizing their societies by \n     improving access to peace and security services, \n     institutions, and decision-making venues;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, 1 in 3 women \n     around the world has experienced some form of gender-based \n     violence and 1 in 4 women has been abused during pregnancy;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, as \n     many as 1 in 5 women report being sexually abused before the \n     age of 15;\n       Whereas, according to UNESCO, women account for 64 percent \n     of the 796,000,000 adults worldwide who lack basic literacy \n     skills;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations Population Fund, 1 \n     in 9 girls in developing countries (excluding the People's \n     Republic of China) will be married before the age of 15;\n       Whereas, according to Save the Children, pregnancy-related \n     complications are a leading cause of death among girls \n     between the ages of 15 and 19 in developing countries;\n       Whereas, according to the Food and Agriculture \n     Organization, the majority of women living in rural areas of \n     the developing world are heavily engaged in agricultural \n     labor, yet they receive less credit, land, agricultural \n     inputs, and training than their male counterparts;\n       Whereas it is imperative to alleviate violence and \n     discrimination against women and afford them every \n     opportunity to be full and productive members of their \n     communities; and\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future, and a day to recognize the obstacles that women \n     still face in the struggle for equal rights and \n     opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of International Women's Day;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of countries to generate \n     economic growth, sustainable democracy, and inclusive \n     security;\n       (3) recognizes and honors the women in the United States \n     and around the world who have worked throughout history to \n     ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human \n     rights;\n       (4) reaffirms its commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, and to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic human rights of women and girls \n     worldwide; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":

(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), none of \n     the funds provided under this Act, or provided under previous \n     appropriations Acts to the agencies funded by this Act that \n     remain available for obligation or expenditure in fiscal year \n     2013, or provided from any accounts in the Treasury of the \n     United States derived by the collection of fees available to \n     the agencies funded by this Act, shall be available for \n     obligation or expenditure through a reprogramming of funds \n     that: (1) creates or initiates a new program, project or \n     activity; (2) eliminates a program, project or activity; (3) \n     increases funds or personnel by any means for any project or \n     activity for which funds have been denied or restricted; (4) \n     relocates an office or employees; (5) reorganizes or renames \n     offices, programs or activities; (6) contracts out or \n     privatizes any functions or activities presently performed by \n     Federal employees; (7) augments existing programs, projects \n     or activities in excess of $500,000 or 10 percent, whichever \n     is less, or reduces by 10 percent funding for any program, \n     project or activity, or numbers of personnel by 10 percent; \n     or (8) results from any general savings, including savings \n     from a reduction in personnel, which would result in a change \n     in existing programs, projects or activities as approved by \n     Congress; unless the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations are notified 15 days in advance of such \n     reprogramming of funds.\n       (b) None of the funds provided under this Act to any agency \n     of the Department of Justice, or provided under previous \n     appropriations Acts to any agency of the Department of \n     Justice that remain available for obligation or expenditure \n     in fiscal year 2013, or provided from any accounts in the \n     Treasury of the United States derived by the collection of \n     fees available to the agencies funded by this Act, shall be \n     available for obligation or expenditure through a \n     reprogramming of funds that: (1) creates or initiates a new \n     program, project or activity; (2) eliminates a program, \n     project or activity; (3) increases funds or personnel by any \n     means for any project or activity for which funds have been \n     denied or restricted; (4) relocates an office or employees; \n     (5) reorganizes or renames offices, programs or activities; \n     (6) contracts out or privatizes any functions or activities \n     presently performed by Federal employees; (7) augments \n     existing programs, projects or activities in excess of \n     $500,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less, or reduces by 10 \n     percent funding for any program, project or activity, or \n     numbers of personnel by 10 percent; or (8) results from any \n     general savings, including savings from a reduction in \n     personnel, which would result in a change in existing \n     programs, projects or activities as approved by Congress; \n     unless the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are \n     notified 45 days in advance of such reprogramming of funds.\n       (c) Subsection (b) of this section shall sunset on \n     September 30, 2013.\n       Sec. 506.

(a) The Departments of Commerce and Justice, the \n     National Science Foundation, and the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration shall provide to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     a quarterly report on the status of balances of \n     appropriations at the account level.

For balances that are obligated, \n     but unexpended, the quarterly reports shall separately \n     identify amounts by the year of obligation.\n       (b) The report described in subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted within 30 days of the end of the first quarter of \n     fiscal year 2013, and subsequent reports shall be submitted \n     within 30 days of the end of each quarter thereafter.\n       (c) If a department or agency is unable to fulfill any \n     aspect of a reporting requirement described in subsection (a) \n     due to a limitation of a current accounting system, the \n     department or agency shall fulfill such aspect to the maximum \n     extent practicable under such accounting system and shall \n     identify and describe in each quarterly report the extent to \n     which such aspect is not fulfilled.\n       Sec. 508.  Any costs incurred by a department or agency \n     funded under this Act resulting from, or to prevent, \n     personnel actions taken in response to funding reductions \n     included in this Act shall be absorbed within the total \n     budgetary resources available to such department or agency:  \n     Provided, That the authority to transfer funds between \n     appropriations accounts as may be necessary to carry out this \n     section is provided in addition to authorities included \n     elsewhere in this Act:  Provided further, That use of funds \n     to carry out this section shall be treated as a reprogramming \n     of funds under section 505 of this Act and shall not be \n     available for obligation or expenditure except in compliance \n     with the procedures set forth in that section.\n       Sec. 509.  None of the funds provided by this Act shall be \n     available to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco \n     products, or to seek the reduction or removal by any foreign \n     country of restrictions on the marketing of tobacco or \n     tobacco products, except for restrictions which are not \n     applied equally to all tobacco or tobacco products of the \n     same type.\n       Sec. 510.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     amounts deposited or available in the Fund established by \n     section 1402 of chapter XIV of title II of Public Law 98-473 \n     (42 U.S.C. 10601) in any fiscal year in excess of \n     $730,000,000 shall not be available for obligation until the \n     following fiscal year.\n       Sec. 511.  None of the funds made available to the \n     Department of Justice in this Act may be used to discriminate \n     against or denigrate the religious or moral beliefs of \n     students who participate in programs for which financial \n     assistance is provided from those funds, or of the parents or \n     legal guardians of such students.\n       Sec. 512.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be transferred to any department, agency, or instrumentality \n     of the United States Government, except pursuant to a \n     transfer made by, or transfer authority provided in, this Act \n     or any other appropriations Act.\n       Sec. 513.  Any funds provided in this Act used to implement \n     E-Government Initiatives shall be subject to the procedures \n     set forth in section 505 of this Act.\n       Sec. 514. (a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released \n     without adequate disclaimers regarding the limitations of the \n     data.\n       (b) For fiscal year 2013 and thereafter, the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall include in \n     all such data releases, language similar to the following \n     that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw \n     broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:\n       (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement \n     authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale \n     and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 515. (a) The Inspectors General of the Department of \n     Commerce, the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, \n     and the Legal Services Corporation shall conduct audits, \n     pursuant to the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App.), of \n     grants or contracts for which funds are appropriated by this \n     Act, and shall submit reports to Congress on the progress of \n     such audits, which may include preliminary findings and a \n     description of areas of particular interest, within 180 days \n     after initiating such an audit and every 180 days thereafter \n     until any such audit is completed.\n       (b) Within 60 days after the date on which an audit \n     described in subsection (a) by an Inspector General is \n     completed, the Secretary, Attorney General, Administrator, \n     Director, or President, as appropriate, shall make the \n     results of the audit available to the public on the Internet \n     website maintained by the Department, Administration, \n     Foundation, or Corporation, respectively. The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\n     the grant or contract will be made available through a \n     subcontract or in any other manner to another person who has \n     a financial interest in the person awarded the grant or \n     contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 516. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under this Act may be used by the Departments \n     of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, or the National Science Foundation to acquire \n     an information technology system unless the head of the \n     entity involved, in consultation with the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation or other appropriate Federal entity, has made \n     an assessment of any associated risk of cyber-espionage or \n     sabotage associated with the acquisition of such system, \n     including any risk associated with such system being \n     produced, manufactured or assembled by one or more entities \n     that are owned, directed or subsidized by the People's \n     Republic of China.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to acquire an \n     information technology system described in an assessment \n     required by subsection (a) and produced, manufactured or \n     assembled by one or more entities that are owned, directed or \n     subsidized by the People's Republic of China unless the head \n     of the assessing entity described in subsection (a) \n     determines, and reports that determination to the Committees \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, that the acquisition of such system is in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n       Sec. 517.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the \n     use of torture by any official or contract employee of the \n     United States Government.\n       Sec. 518. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or \n     treaty, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act or any other Act may be expended or \n     obligated by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the \n     United States to pay administrative expenses or to compensate \n     an officer or employee of the United States in connection \n     with requiring an export license for the export to Canada of \n     components, parts, accessories or attachments for firearms \n     listed in Category I, section 121.1 of title 22, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (International Trafficking in Arms \n     Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it existed on April 1, 2005) \n     with a total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any \n     transaction, provided that the conditions of subsection (b) \n     of this section are met by the exporting party for such \n     articles.\n       (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export \n     license--\n       (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's \n     Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or \n     from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United \n     States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles \n     enumerated in subsection (a); and\n       (2) does not permit the export without a license of--\n       (A) fully automatic firearms and components and parts for \n     such firearms, other than for end use by the Federal \n     Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of \n     Canada;\n       (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete \n     breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in Category I, other \n     than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial \n     or Municipal Government of Canada; or\n       (C) articles for export from Canada to another foreign \n     destination.\n       (c) In accordance with this section, the District Directors \n     of Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or \n     temporary export without a license of any unclassified \n     articles specified in subsection (a) to Canada for end use in \n     Canada or return to the United States, or temporary import of \n     Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in the United \n     States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.\n       (d) The President may require export licenses under this \n     section on a temporary basis if the President determines, \n     upon publication first in the Federal Register, that the \n     Government of Canada has implemented or maintained inadequate \n     import controls for the articles specified in subsection (a), \n     such that a significant diversion of such articles has and \n     continues to take place for use in international terrorism or \n     in the escalation of a conflict in another nation. The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 519.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     receiving appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act \n     shall obligate or expend in any way such funds to pay \n     administrative expenses or the compensation of any officer or \n     employee of the United States to deny any application \n     submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified \n     pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to \n     import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, \n     parts, or ammunition.\n       Sec. 520.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to include in any new bilateral or multilateral trade \n     agreement the text of--\n       (1) paragraph 2 of article 16.7 of the United States-\n     Singapore Free Trade Agreement;\n       (2) paragraph 4 of article 17.9 of the United States-\n     Australia Free Trade Agreement; or\n       (3) paragraph 4 of article 15.9 of the United States-\n     Morocco Free Trade Agreement.\n       Sec. 521.

If at any time during any quarter, the program \n     manager of a project within the jurisdiction of the \n     Departments of Commerce or Justice, the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration, or the National Science Foundation \n     totaling more than $75,000,000 has reasonable cause to \n     believe that the total program cost has increased by 10 \n     percent, the program manager shall immediately inform the \n     respective Secretary, Administrator, or Director. The \n     Secretary, Administrator, or Director shall notify the House \n     and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days in \n     writing of such increase, and shall include in such notice: \n     the date on which such determination was made; a statement of \n     the reasons for such increases; the action taken and proposed \n     to be taken to control future cost growth of the project; \n     changes made in the performance or schedule milestones and \n     the degree to which such changes have contributed to the \n     increase in total program costs or procurement costs; new \n     estimates of the total project or procurement costs; and a \n     statement validating that the project's management structure \n     is adequate to control total project or procurement costs.\n       Sec. 523.

Res. 12\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale struck the country of Haiti, followed by \n     59 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater;\n       Whereas more than 220,000 people died as a result of the \n     earthquake, more than 300,000 people were injured, and more \n     than 3,000,000 people were directly affected by the disaster;\n       Whereas the total cost in terms of human lives, \n     infrastructure damage, and economic losses makes the \n     earthquake one of the worst urban disasters in modern \n     history;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama vowed the ``unwavering \n     support'' of the United States Government and pledged a \n     ``swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives and \n     support the recovery in Haiti'';\n       Whereas the initial emergency response of the men and women \n     of the United States Government, led by the United States \n     Agency for International Development and United States \n     Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora, other individuals, \n     businesses, and philanthropic organizations throughout the \n     United States and the international community overwhelmingly \n     responded to the crisis by sending emergency relief supplies \n     and significant financial contributions;\n       Whereas the Senate passed 3 successive resolutions \n     expressing its profound sympathy and unwavering support for \n     the people of Haiti and urging all nations to assist the \n     people of Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas, 3 years later, significant challenges still remain \n     in Haiti as it works to recover and rebuild;\n       Whereas, according to the International Organization for \n     Migration, approximately 360,000 people remain in spontaneous \n     and organized camps in Haiti and hundreds of thousands of \n     poor people in Haiti continue to live in non-permanent \n     housing, conditions that make them vulnerable to future \n     natural disasters;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people as a result of the \n     earthquake will have some form of a long term disability, in \n     addition to approximately 800,000 persons with disabilities \n     living in Haiti;\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n       Whereas, according to an independent panel investigation by \n     the United Nations, on October 19, 2010, an imported strain \n     of cholera was detected in the Lower Artibonite region of \n     Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health \n     and Population, as of December 31, 2012, more than 7,900 \n     people in Haiti have died from cholera and more than 635,000 \n     have been infected with the disease since the earthquake on \n     January 12, 2010;\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General announced a \n     plan to eliminate cholera from the island of Hispaniola \n     through enhanced treatment and prevention efforts and through \n     the development of clean water and sanitation infrastructure \n     that is accessible to all people in Haiti;\n       Whereas gender-based violence against women and girls in \n     Haiti continues to be a chronic problem, and judicial \n     barriers that have prevented victims from finding redress \n     remain a significant issue of concern;\n       Whereas, in 2012 alone, Haiti faced a long drought period \n     and 2 major tropical storms that destroyed 70 percent of \n     agricultural crops in Haiti, impacting the lives of millions \n     of people in Haiti facing food insecurity and further \n     crippling the economy of Haiti;\n       Whereas the sustained assistance to Haiti from the United \n     States and the international community bolsters the efforts \n     of the Government of Haiti to confront these challenges; and\n       Whereas, since the earthquake on January 12, 2010, the \n     people of Haiti have demonstrated unwavering resilience, \n     dignity, and courage: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of lives as a result of the tragic \n     earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, and the subsequent \n     cholera epidemic;\n       (2) honors the sacrifice made by the men and women of the \n     Government of Haiti, civil society, the United States \n     Government, the United Nations, and the international \n     community in their response to those affected by the \n     calamity;\n       (3) reaffirms its solidarity with the Government and people \n     of Haiti as they work to rebuild their country and \n     livelihoods;\n       (4) supports the long-term reconstruction efforts of the \n     United States Government to improve housing, energy, job \n     creation, food security, health care, education, governance, \n     and rule of law in Haiti in full cooperation with the \n     Government of Haiti, its Office of the Secretary of State for \n     the Integration of Persons with Disabilities, and civil \n     society, and with the support of the private sector;\n       (5) urges the President and the international community to \n     continue--\n       (A) to focus assistance on increasing the capacity of the \n     public sector of Haiti to sustainably provide services to the \n     people of Haiti;\n       (B) to develop, improve, and increase communication and \n     participation to more substantially involve civil society in \n     Haiti and the Haitian diaspora at all stages of the post-\n     earthquake response;\n       (C) to provide programs that protect and involve vulnerable \n     populations, including internally displaced persons, \n     children, women and girls, and persons with disabilities;
