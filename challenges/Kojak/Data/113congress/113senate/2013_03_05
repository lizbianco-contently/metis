Mr. President, before the Chaplain leaves the Chamber, I \nwant to say something on behalf of all the Senators.\n  New Senators probably don't know him as well as those who have been \nhere longer than the beginning of this year, but we are so fortunate to \nhave this good man leading the Senate in our spiritual activities. He \nleads the prayer every morning. We have a ``Prayer Breakfast'' every \nWednesday. And during that period of time when we don't see him, he is \nout counseling people who work here, including individual Senators.\n  During the last few years, my wife has been ill and has had a bad \naccident. He has been so in tune with her, making sure that we all are \naware of how well she is doing. She has had a great recovery.\n  So on behalf of the whole Senate, I extend my appreciation to this \ngood man--a man who was born with very little except a very good mother \nwho taught him early on--and had a very keen intellect--that with his \nmind he could accomplish a great deal.\n  As far as memory, there is only one other person I have known in my \nlifetime who had a memory like his, and that was Robert Byrd, the \nlongtime Senator from West Virginia. Chaplain Black has a remarkable \nmemory of not only all the Scriptures, Old and New Testament, but \npoems. He has an intellect that is really amazing.\n  Again, I repeat, we are all so very fortunate that he is Chaplain of \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1095-7", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, four-time Prime Minister of the United \nKingdom William Gladstone said something we all have repeated many \ntimes: ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' By that measure millions \nof Americans who rely on courts that are overworked and understaffed \nare being denied the justice they rightly deserve.\n  With 1 out of every 10 Federal judgeships today vacant, Americans can \nno longer rely on fairness and speedy trials. More than one-half of the \nNation's population lives in a part of the country that has been \ndeclared a judicial emergency--more than one-half.\n  The high number of vacancies isn't due to a lack of qualified lawyers \nto take these jobs; it is due, instead, to\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nblatant partisanship. I am going to lay out in a few minutes what is \nremarkable.\n  President Obama's judicial nominees have waited on average four times \nlonger to be confirmed than those nominated by the second George W. \nBush. Even highly qualified nominees--nominees who are eventually \nconfirmed unanimously or almost unanimously--routinely wait for months \nto be confirmed because of the delay tactics used by my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Tomorrow we are going to consider highly qualified Caitlin Joan \nHalligan to be a DC circuit judge. She has been waiting more than 2 \nyears to be confirmed. She was nominated for the second time to fill a \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This is a \ncourt that was formed some 65 years ago. It was done because the \nSupreme Court couldn't do the cases--they didn't have time to do them, \nand the circuit courts were overwhelmed with work they couldn't do.\n  Many consider the DC Circuit to be just a tiny notch below the \nSupreme Court. In fact, Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, said yesterday many believe it is more important than the \nSupreme Court because they have such wide-ranging jurisdiction. Once \nthey make a decision, rarely does the Supreme Court take up their \ncases. They consider complex appeals of Federal regulations, among \nother things, and have jurisdiction over vital national security \nchallenges.\n  It is also one of the many courts in crisis across the country. Mr. \nPresident, 36 to 37 percent of the DC Circuit seats are vacant. There \nare four vacancies now. The last appointment to the DC Circuit was made \nin 2006. It is now 2013. In the years since the number of pending cases \nper judge has grown to almost 200 from a little over 100.\n  When Ms. Halligan was nominated to the DC Circuit in 2010, she was \nnominated to fill one of two vacancies. Many Republicans said they \nvoted against her then because there was no need; the DC Circuit had \nenough judges. Now it is four short.\n  More than 2 years after she was first turned down, her nomination is \nagain before the Senate, and the DC Circuit has four empty seats. The \nlast time the Senate considered Ms. Halligan's nomination, some of my \nRepublican colleagues claimed the DC Circuit didn't need any more \njudges, so they filibustered the confirmation. No one could credibly \nmake that argument today. If my Republican colleagues choose to \nfilibuster her confirmation a second time, their naked partisanship \nwill certainly be exposed.\n  For example, Patricia Wald, who served on that court for 20 years--\nfor 5 years she was the chief judge--said of the confirmation process:\n\n       The constitutional system of nomination and confirmation \n     can work only if there is good faith on the part of both the \n     president and the Senate to move qualified nominees along, \n     rather than withholding consent for political reasons.\n\n  For example, if someone doesn't want to vote for her, tell them to \nvote no. Have them vote no. I invite them to vote no. But don't stop \nher from having an up-or-down vote.\n  I was very troubled with Justice Thomas, who was then a circuit court \njudge. A decision had to be made by me and many others: Should we allow \nJustice Thomas an up-or-down vote? The decision was made, yes, we \nshould. He barely made it. He got 2 or 3 votes more than 50. It would \nhave been so easy to stop that nomination, but it would have been the \nwrong thing to do. As bad as I feel he has been as a jurist, it doesn't \nmatter. He should have had the ability to have an up-or-down vote. A \nRepublican President sent that name forward, and he was entitled to a \nvote. That was a decision I and many other Democratic Senators made.\n  If my Republican colleagues don't like this woman, for whatever \nreason, vote against her. Don't stop her from having an up-or-down \nvote. A second partisan filibuster of this highly qualified nominee by \nmy Republican colleagues would be in very bad faith. I repeat: If for \nsome reason you don't like her, vote against her. Don't stop her from \nhaving a vote.\n  One qualified, consensus judicial nominee ought to be treated as \nanother regardless of the political party of the President who made the \nnomination.\n  President Obama is the only President in 65 years--since this court \nwas formed--to not have a single person put on the DC Circuit. That is \nhow important this court is, and this is how Ms. Halligan and others \nhave been stymied from getting on this court.\n  It is not because President Obama's nominees are anything but totally \nqualified. Ms. Halligan's colleagues have called her a brilliant legal \nmind. She has outstanding credentials, strong support from lawyers, a \nvast number of Republicans, former judges, law enforcement officials, \nand more than 20 former Supreme Court clerks from across the political \nspectrum.\n  She graduated with honors from Princeton and Georgetown Law School. \nShe clerked for Justice Patricia Wald, whom I just quoted, and this \nwoman was a judge in the DC Circuit for 20 years, 5 years as a chief \njudge.\n  If a truly exceptional candidate such as Caitlin Halligan isn't \nqualified to be a judge in the United States, I don't know who would \nbe. I think it is very delicate ground Republicans are walking on if \nthey think they can filibuster this woman and get away with it. It \nwould be wrong. If they don't like her, vote against her.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1096-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, back in November the American people \nsent a divided government to Washington. I know this is not the outcome \nthat President Obama had hoped for. I know he wanted complete control \nof Washington, just like he had the first 2 years of his Presidency.\n  Still, it was surprising to me--and I think to a lot of other people \naround here--to learn over the weekend that among the first calls the \nPresident made after his acceptance speech on election day had to do \nwith ginning up another campaign.\n  The President wasn't focused on solving the problems that middle-\nclass families face today but how to get a Democratic Speaker of the \nHouse 2 years down the road. That was the message he sent to top House \nDemocrats.\n  Since then, the President, along with his Washington Democratic \nallies, has expended enormous amounts of energy to advance that goal--\nrebooting his political organization, provoking manufactured crises \nwith Congress, engineering show votes in the Senate, and traveling \naround the country to campaign relentlessly against his opponents.\n  That is why the sequester went into effect in its current form. That \nis why Washington continues to careen needlessly from crisis to crisis.\n  And that is why we find ourselves in a situation where more than \n1,400 days have passed since Senate Democrats last passed a budget. \nWhat a sad state of affairs for our country, and for the notion of \ngovernance in general.\n  Every year House Republicans have passed budgets that seriously \naddress the transcendent challenge of our time: putting runaway \nWashington spending and debt on a sustainable path so we can create \njobs and grow the economy.\n  Meanwhile, Democrats have followed the President's lead, focusing on \nthe next campaign to the exclusion of all else.\n  But it is not just Senate Democrats who have been missing in action. \nThe President has been late submitting his own budget outline nearly \nevery single year.\n  He has already missed this year's deadline by more than a month.\n  Just last week we learned the President will submit his budget after \nthe House and the Senate have passed their own budgets and have gone \nhome for Passover and Easter. That goes far beyond the pale of just \nmissing deadlines.\n  Look, the American people are tired of the delays and the excuses. It \nis time\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\nfor the President to get his budget plan over to us. Not next week or \nnext month, but now. And this time, it should be serious--it should \nroot out waste and inefficiency instead of kicking the can further down \nthe road.\n  The budget blueprint he sent us last year was so roundly ridiculed \nfor its fiscal gimmickry and its massive tax hikes that, when it came \nto a vote in the Senate, his own party joined Republicans in voting it \ndown 99 to 0.\n  In the House, it was rejected unanimously. Even the President's most \nliberal allies couldn't defend it.\n  So we are counting on the President to get serious this time. And we \nare counting on Senate Democrats to stop relying on Republicans to bail \nthem out of their irresponsibility and habitual legislative tardiness.\n  But the broader point is this: President Obama and his Senate \nDemocratic allies will have plenty of time to campaign next year. The \nAmerican people are exhausted after all these years of campaigning, and \nthey expect Democratic leaders now to finally work with the divided \nCongress they elected to get things done. As I have said before, the \nPresident has to figure out how to govern with the situation he has, \nnot the one he wishes he had. That is what being President is all \nabout.\n  It is time to return to actually solving problems--in other words, to \nlegislate the way we are supposed to around here: with transparency, \nwith public input, and with sufficient time to develop sound policy. \nThat is especially true when it comes to dealing with the most \ncontroversial issues in Washington. Whether it is the budget or tax \nreform or health care, we end up with better outcomes when we legislate \nin the light of day and not in some back room.\n  For instance, the Senate majority should be allowing us to mark up \nbills so that Members with expertise in a certain issue area can \ncontribute to the legislative process in the most constructive and \ntransparent way possible.\n  When bills do reach the floor, the Senate majority should allow \nMembers of both parties the chance to represent the voices of their \nconstituents by offering amendments in an open process.\n  And when the House sends us bills, the Senate majority should \nactually take some of them up every once in a while.\n  The leadership won't agree with everything the House passes; but that \nis okay. If the Senate passes a different version of a bill, we can \nwork out our differences through the legislative process.\n  That is how Congress is supposed to function, even though it's not at \nall how the Senate has functioned recently.\n  I know Washington Democrats' most important priority right now is \ngetting Nancy Pelosi her old job back in 2014. But that is not what \nAmericans want--and that is why Washington has become so dysfunctional.\n  The American people, including my constituents in Kentucky, expect \nthem to get off the hustings and work with Members of both parties to \naddress the most serious challenges facing our country. The public is \ntired of the manufactured crises, the poll-tested gimmicks, and the \nendless campaigning. They expect and deserve better than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1097-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate took an important \nstep forward when it comes to keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals. Senator Pat Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nintroduced bipartisan legislation to finally crack down on the straw \npurchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. I was happy to join in \nintroducing this bill. It is a bipartisan group of Senators, including \nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator Susan Collins, and my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Mark Kirk. Chairman Leahy's legislation combined \na straw purchasing bill he and I introduced earlier this year together \nwith a gun trafficking bill on which Senators Gillibrand and Kirk had \nbeen working. We sat down with Senator Collins and crafted a new bill, \nthe Stop Illegal Trafficking of Firearms Act. It is important \nlegislation, and the need for it is very clear.\n  I have met a number of times in recent months with law enforcement \nleaders in Chicago and across my State. I asked them what Congress can \ndo to help better protect our communities and our children, and one \nthing I kept hearing over and over again was that we needed to crack \ndown on straw purchases. Time after time, law enforcement agencies say, \ncriminals and gang members commit crimes with guns they purchased \nthrough others.\n  A typical straw purchase happens when someone who legally can \npurchase a weapon and pass a background check buys a gun on behalf of \nsomeone who cannot pass that same background check. When a straw \npurchaser buys from a licensed gun dealer, the purchaser falsely claims \non the Federal sale form that he is the actual buyer of the gun. Under \ncurrent law, it is illegal to lie and buy a gun this way, but the only \ncharge a Federal prosecutor can bring is for knowingly making a false \nstatement on a Federal form--an offense which dramatically understates \nthe gravity of the situation.\n  We have had several hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nincluding one I chaired on February 12, where U.S. attorneys have \ntestified that these paperwork prosecutions are wholly inadequate as a \ndeterrent for straw purchasing. Some of the critics even on my Senate \nJudiciary Subcommittee panel said: Why don't you prosecute more? The \nU.S. attorneys told us it's because these paperwork offenses are not \ntaken that seriously by the court. The new law we have written will be \ntaken seriously.\n  The cases, as they stand now, are hard to prove and have little jury \nappeal. Even a conviction usually results in a very small sentence \nunder the current law. The reality is that straw purchasers think they \ncan make a fast $50 or more by buying a gun from somebody else, and \nthat the consequences are not that great. We need to change this \nequation.\n  At the hearing I chaired in the Judiciary Committee's Constitution \nSubcommittee on February 12, we heard powerful testimony from Sandra \nWortham from the South Side of Chicago. Her brother, a Chicago police \nofficer, Tom Wortham IV, was murdered in 2010 by gang members with a \nhandgun that had been straw purchased and trafficked to Chicago from \nMississippi. Almost 1 out of 10 crime guns in Chicago come from \nMississippi. We ask why. Because the standards for sales are lax in \nMississippi, and straw purchasers know they can fill the trunk of a car \nwith these purchased weapons and head to the Windy City and sell them \non the streets to thugs and drug gangs. Then, of course, they result in \ntragedy.\n  The gang members who killed Officer Wortham were not allowed to buy a \nhandgun from a dealer because of their age and criminal records, but it \nwas real easy to get a straw purchased gun on the street. According to \nan investigative report by the Chicago Tribune,\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nthe man who straw purchased the gun that killed Officer Wortham did so \nfor a quick $100. The Tribune said he gave little thought to what he \nwas doing. ``I didn't even know what ATF stood for,'' the straw \npurchaser said to the Tribune.\n  That was the gun that was used to kill Officer Wortham, a veteran of \ntwo combat tours in Iraq, a leader in his community, one of Chicago's \nfinest, and he was gunned down in front of his parents' home. His \nfather was a retired Chicago police officer.\n  We need to send a message to those who think that straw purchasing \nmight be an easy way to make a quick buck. As Sandra Wortham said at \nour hearing:\n\n       We need to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands in \n     the first place. I don't think that makes us anti-gun, I \n     think it makes us pro-decent law abiding people.\n\n  I agree with Sandra Wortham. We can take steps consistent with the \nConstitution and the Second Amendment to crack down on straw purchases \nand gun-trafficking schemes that provide criminals with guns, and that \nis what this bill does.\n  The bill we introduced yesterday will create a tough Federal crime to \npunish and deter straw purchasing. It says that if a straw purchaser \nbuys a gun from a licensed dealer on behalf of someone else, the buyer \nwill face the prospect of significant jail time for up to 15 years. \nThey will face hard time for a Federal crime. The same penalty applies \nto straw purchasers who buy a gun from a private seller on behalf of \nsomeone he knows or is has reasonable cause to believe is a prohibited \npurchaser.\n  The legislation also creates a separate Federal offense for firearms \ntrafficking, which is when someone transports or transfers firearms to \nanother when he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that transfer \nviolates Federal law. The bill provides for increased penalties if the \ntrafficker was a leader of an organized gang.\n  Cracking down straw purchasing and gun trafficking will help shut \ndown the pipeline of guns into cities such as Chicago, where gang \nmembers use them on almost a daily basis to commit terrible crimes.\n  This section of our bill is named in honor of Hadiya Pendleton, the \n15-year-old girl in Chicago who was shot and killed by alleged gang \nmembers in January just days after she attended the inauguration of the \nPresident of the United States here in Washington. Both Senator Kirk's \nhope and mine is that these reforms--once signed into law--will help \nprevent gang shootings and other gun crimes in the future.\n  It is time to move forward on this legislation and on other \ncommonsense proposals that will reduce the epidemic of gun violence in \nAmerica. This Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will take up \nthis bipartisan legislation that was introduced yesterday. I hope we \ncan pass it out quickly with a strong bipartisan vote.\n  I also look forward to voting in committee for bills to improve our \nsystem of criminal background checks and to stop the flood of new \nmilitary-style and high-capacity magazines onto our streets. It is time \nfor Congress to move forward with these measures to reduce gun \nviolence. These proposals will not stop every shooting in America--no \nproposal can--but they will save lives if we put them into effect.\n  I again thank my colleagues Chairman Leahy, Senator Kirk, Senator \nGillibrand, and Senator Collins for collectively joining together to \nmake sure this legislation moves forward. I think we can do something \nimportant, on a bipartisan basis, to make our streets, schools, and \ncommunities safer across America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my following statement be placed in a \nseparate part of the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1098-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1098-S1099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF CAITLIN HALLIGAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week the Senate is going to have an \nopportunity to confirm the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to serve on \nthe Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. In doing so, we can correct a \nmistake the Senate made in the last Congress.\n  Ms. Halligan is an extraordinarily well-qualified nominee. She has \nthe intellect, experience, temperament to be an outstanding Federal \nappellate judge.\n  On December 6, 2011, Caitlin Halligan's nomination was stopped by a \nfilibuster by Republican Senators. Forty-five Republicans voted against \nthe cloture motion on her nomination, thus denying Ms. Halligan an up-\nor-down vote. That killed her nomination for that Congress.\n  She has now been renominated in this Congress for the DC Circuit, and \nthe court needs her. Right now there are only seven active status \njudges on the DC Circuit. There are supposed to be 11. Four seats are \nvacant, including one vacancy that opened just last month. This is \nuntenable.\n  Retired DC Circuit Judge Patricia Wald has served as chief judge of \nthe circuit for 5 years. She wrote in the Washington Post last month \nthat:\n\n       There is cause for extreme concern that Congress is \n     systematically denying the court the human resources it needs \n     to carry out its weighty mandates.\n\n  It is time to address this vacancy situation by giving Ms. Halligan \nan up-or-down vote and confirming her nomination. She is eminently \nqualified. She graduated from Princeton University and the Georgetown \nUniversity School of Law where she served as managing editor of the law \nreview. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. She \nserved for 7 years as solicitor general for the State of New York, \nrepresenting that State in a broad range of litigation. She currently \nserves as general counsel at the New York County district attorney's \noffice. She has argued five cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and \nserved as counsel in dozens more cases in that same Court. The American \nBar Association has given her a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating to \nserve on the Federal bench.\n  Ms. Halligan's legal views are well within the political mainstream. \nShe has received widespread support from across the political spectrum. \nFor example, the National District Attorneys Association, the \nprosecutors, said she ``would be an outstanding addition'' to the DC \nCircuit. She also has the support of law enforcement organizations and \nprominent conservative lawyers.\n  There is simply nothing in her background that constitutes the \n``extraordinary circumstances'' that the so-called Gang of 14 said we \nare supposed to use as a standard to justify a filibuster. There are \nno--repeat no--legitimate questions about Ms. Halligan's competence or \nethics or temperament or ideology or fitness to serve on the bench. All \nshe has done throughout her career is serve as an excellent lawyer on \nbehalf of her clients.\n  When Ms. Halligan was filibustered in 2011, some of my Republican \ncolleagues cited two main arguments against her. First, they claimed \nthe DC Circuit didn't need another judge since they could handle the \nworkload with eight judges. The DC Circuit may have had eight judges in \n2011, but now there are only seven, so that argument doesn't hold.\n  Second, Republicans claim that when Ms. Halligan was solicitor \ngeneral of New York, she advocated positions in litigations that they, \nthe Republicans, disagreed with. Is that the standard, that a lawyer \nrepresented a client with a position that might not be the lawyer's \npersonal position or a Senator's personal position? It has been a few \nyears since I represented clients, but I believe that under our system \nof legal representation, that is not the standard; that lawyers must \nonly represent those people they agree with.\n  In our system of law, the system where the scales of justice are held \nby the lady with the blindfold, we are supposed to give justice to both \nsides and hope at the end of the day the system serves us.\n  Ms. Halligan advocated positions at the direction of her client, \nwhich happened to be the State of New York. In the American legal \ntradition, lawyers are not supposed to be held to the views of their \nclients.\n  As Chief Justice John Roberts said during his confirmation hearing--\nand I remember this:\n\n       It is a basic principle in our system that lawyers \n     represent clients and you do not ascribe the position of a \n     client to the lawyer. It's a position that goes back to John \n     Adams and the Revolution.\n\n  Those who read the book about John Adams often wonder how this man \nbecame President of the United States\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\nafter representing British soldiers at a massacre in the city of \nBoston.\n  Ms. Halligan should not be filibustered because she represented \nclients with whom some Senators don't always agree.\n  The bottom line is this: Our country needs excellent judges serving \non the Federal bench. If qualified mainstream judicial nominees cannot \nbe considered fairly by the Senate on their merits, then good lawyers \nare going to stop putting their name in for consideration. Maybe that \nis the ultimate goal on the other side by some of the Senators who \nobject to Ms. Halligan.\n  Why would a top-notch lawyer volunteer to go through a long, \nexcruciating judicial confirmation if the lawyer is only going to be \nfilibustered at the end for reasons that don't have a thing to do with \ntheir qualifications? We are going to end up with a Federal bench that \nis either empty or lacks the excellence we should require.\n  Caitlin Halligan deserves an up-or-down vote on the merits. The \nSenate made a mistake in denying her that vote in 2011. Let's correct \nthat mistake this week. She has clearly demonstrated she can serve the \nDC Circuit with distinction. She deserves that chance on the merits.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we remember President Lyndon Johnson's \ncourage and skill in passing the Civil Rights Act. We remember \nPresident Nixon going to China. We remember President Carter and the \nPanama Canal treaties. We remember President Reagan fixing Social \nSecurity and George H.W. Bush balancing the budget by raising taxes. We \nremember President Clinton and welfare reform. We remember President \nGeorge W. Bush tackling immigration reform. If the history books were \nwritten today, we would remember President Obama for the sequester.\n  This is unique in history. This is not the way our Presidents usually \nconduct themselves. Here we have a policy that was designed to be the \nworst possible policy, and that may be what our talented, intelligent \ncurrent President is remembered for. He is remembered for it because it \ncomes from a process he recommended, he signed into law, that he has \nknown about for the last year, that he has done nothing about except to \ncampaign around the country blaming others for it over the last month, \nand he seems determined to keep it in law.\n\n  Now, for what reason could this be possible?\n  Well, let's go back to why the President agreed to the sequester. He \nagreed to it in 2011 after suggesting the process from which it came in \norder to get $2.2 trillion in spending reductions so he could get a \ndebt ceiling increase that lasted through the election. And he did it, \nfor the second reason, because he did not want to go against his own \nparty's constituency in tackling the biggest problem our country \nfaces--the biggest problem according to the former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the biggest problem according to the President's \nown debt commission--the out-of-control automatic spending increases \nthat are in the Federal budget.\n  So we are left today with a sequester--automatic spending decreases \nwhich are the result of the automatic spending increases in \nentitlements the President is unwilling to confront. We are slashing \nthe part of the budget that is basically under control. It is growing \nat about the rate of inflation. I am talking about national defense, \nnational parks, National Laboratories, Pell grants, and cancer \nresearch. All that is growing at about the rate of inflation. We are \nslashing that part of the budget because the President does not want to \nchallenge his own party on the part of the budget that is out of \ncontrol, growing at two or three times the rate of inflation: Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, and other entitlements.\n  This is not how our Presidents usually have acted when confronted \nwith a great crisis. When President Johnson dealt with civil rights, he \nknew he would be terribly unpopular in Texas and throughout the South. \nWhen President Nixon went to China, he knew Republican conservatives \nwould be angry with him. President Carter enraged many Americans by his \nsupport for the Panama Canal Treaty. President Reagan made many seniors \nunhappy when he fixed Social Security. George H.W. Bush probably lost \nthe 1992 election when he raised taxes to balance the budget. Bill \nClinton was pilloried by his own party when he worked with Republicans \nto reform welfare. George W. Bush made many radio talk show hosts very \nunhappy when he tried to change our immigration laws.\n  Why did they do it? They did it because they were the President of \nthe United States, and that is what presidents do.\n  Robert Merry, a biographer of President James K. Polk, told me \nrecently that every great crisis in our country has been solved by \npresidential leadership or not at all. Every great crisis in American \nhistory has been solved by presidential leadership or not at all. Yet \nthis president seems determined not to exercise that sort of \npresidential leadership. So his presidential leadership is a colossal \nfailure, first, because he will not respect this Congress and work with \nit in a way to get results that all of the presidents I just mentioned \ndid.\n  The New York Times had a very interesting story this Sunday about how \nPresident Woodrow Wilson would come down to the President's Room right \noff the Senate and sit there three days a week with the door open, and \nhe got almost everything he proposed passed, until he went over the \nheads of Congress around the country about the League of Nations and \nlost.\n  Or Senator Howard Baker used to tell the story of how, when Senator \nEverett Dirksen, the Republican leader, would not go down to the White \nHouse and have a drink with President Johnson in 1967, President \nJohnson showed up with his beagles in the Republican leader's office \nand said: Everett, if you won't come have a drink with me, I am here to \nhave a drink with you.\n  I am not here to advocate having drinks, but I am here to suggest \nthat when they disappeared into the back room together for 45 minutes, \nthat played a big role in writing the Civil Rights Act of 1968 because \nit was written in Everett Dirksen's Republican leader office right down \nthe hall, at the request of the Democratic President of the United \nStates.\n  And Senator Harkin--I do not think he will mind me telling the story \nabout the afternoon 20 years ago when he was in his office and he got a \ntelephone call from President George H.W. Bush's office. Would he come \ndown with a few other Congressmen? The President was there for the \nafternoon. Mrs. Bush was in Texas. They spent an hour together, and the \nPresident showed them around. On the way out, Senator Harkin said to \nPresident Bush: Mr. President, I don't want to turn this into a \nbusiness meeting, but one of your staff members is slowing down the \nAmericans with Disabilities bill. That conversation, Senator Harkin \nsays, changed things at the White House and helped that bill to pass.\n  Or Tip O'Neill, going into the Democratic Caucus in the 1980s and \nbeing criticized by his fellow caucus members: Why are you spending so \nmuch time with Ronald Reagan? Why are you fixing Social Security? He \nsaid: Because I like him. Because I like him.\n  Technology has changed a lot. But human nature has not. And \nrelationships are essential in the Senate, in the White House, in \npolitics, in church, in business, and all of our Presidents have known \nthat you need to show respect to the people with whom you work if you \nare going to solve difficult problems. That is why I am disappointed by \nour talented President's unwillingness to work with Congress. There is \nno reaching out.\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\n  It was 18 months before he had his first meeting with the Republican \nleader one on one. He has known for a year the sequester was coming, \nbut there was no meeting with the Republican or Democratic leaders that \nI know about until the day it started. It is breaking news when the \nPresident makes a telephone call to a Senate leader. And then the \nPresident spends his time running around the country taunting and \nheckling the Members of Congress that he is supposed to work with to \nget a result. What kind of leadership is that?\n  I started in 1969 working in congressional relations for a President \nof the United States. I have worked with or for eight. I have never \nseen anything like it in my life.\n  I have been a governor. That is small potatoes compared to being a \npresident. I know that. But I worked with a Democratic legislature, and \nI guarantee you, if I had taunted them and heckled them and criticized \nthem, I never would have gotten anything passed to improve roads or \nschools or get the auto industry into Tennessee. Instead, I would meet \nwith them regularly. I would listen to them. I would change my \nproposals based on what they had to say. I would know they had to go \nback into their caucuses and still survive. I did not think about ever \nputting them in an awkward position when we were trying to get \nsomething done. I tried to put them in a position to make it easier to \nget something done. I changed my ideas and I could get a result. During \nelections we tried to beat each other. Between elections we sought to \ngovern.\n  This is all made worse by the Democratic leadership of the Senate \ndeliberately bringing business to a halt we have a fiscal crisis, we \nhave not had a budget in 4 years, we did not even pass any \nappropriations bills last year, there is little respect for committee \nwork, and he has used the gag rule 70 times to cut off amendments from \nthe Republican side of the aisle.\n\n  For example, last week, we had several options on our side--I think \nthere were some on the other side--to make the sequester go down a \nlittle bit easier, to make it make more common sense, and what did we \nend up doing? We were here all week, and we ended up voting on two \nproposals. They were procedural votes, and everybody knew they were \npolitical posturing not designed to pass. Why did we not just put it on \nthe floor? There are 100 of us here.\n  We are all grownups. We worked hard to get here. We have ideas. We \nmight have improved the sequester. We had time to do it. But the \nDemocratic leadership did not allow us to bring it up. So we end up \nwith deliberately bad policy becoming law.\n  It is not too late. There are things the President and we can still \ndo. We could spread the pain across the whole budget. We could spread \nit across part of the budget. We could give the President more \nflexibility in making decisions. Or the President could come to us with \nhis plan, this month, for dealing with the biggest problem facing our \ncountry: the out-of-control mandatory spending. He could do what \nPresidents Johnson and Nixon and Carter and Bush did before him. He \ncould confront it, go against the grain of his party, work with Members \nof both sides, and get a result. It is not that hard to do. Senator \nCorker and I have a proposal to do it. There is the Domenici-Rivlin \nproposal to do it. There is the Ryan-Wyden proposal to do it.\n  When part of the budget is growing at two to three times inflation \nand the rest is growing at about the rate of inflation, it is obvious \nwhich part we need to work on.\n  It may be the President does not like some of us. Well, President \nEisenhower had that same feeling about Members of Congress. Someone \nasked him: Then how do you get along with them? He said: I look first \nat the office. I respect the office. I do not think about the person \nwho occupies the office.\n  There are real victims here. In the short term with the sequester, \nthere is cancer research, there are airline travelers, there are many \npeople--the President has let us know about this--who are going to be \nhurt by this and be inconvenienced. In the long term, if we do not deal \nwith this No. 1 fiscal problem we have, the real victims will be \nseniors who will not have all of their hospital bills paid in 11 years \nbecause the Medicare trustees have told us Medicare will not be able to \npay all of them--the Medicare Trust Fund will be out of money--and \nyoung Americans will be forever destined to be the debt-paying \ngeneration because we and the President did not have the courage to \nface up to our responsibilities.\n  So I would say, with respect, it is time for this President to show \nthe kind of Presidential leadership that President Johnson did on civil \nrights, that President Nixon did on China, that President Carter did on \nthe Panama Canal Treaty, that President Reagan did on Social Security, \nand that Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and George W. Bush \ndid. Respect the other branches of government. Confront your own party \nwhere necessary. Listen to what both have to say and fashion a \nconsensus that most of us can support.\n  We are one budget agreement away from reasserting our global \npreeminence and getting the economy moving again. As Robert Merry said: \nEvery great crisis is solved by Presidential leadership or not at all.\n  It is time, Mr. President, for Presidential leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article in \nthe New York Times, from Sunday, entitled ``Wilson to Obama: March \nForth!''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Mar. 1, 2013]\n\n                     Wilson to Obama: March Forth!\n\n                           (By A. Scott Berg)\n\n       ``There has been a change of government,'' declared Woodrow \n     Wilson in his first sentence as president of the United \n     States, one hundred years ago this Monday. Until 1937, when \n     the 20th Amendment moved Inauguration Day to late January, \n     chief executives took their oaths of office on March Fourth, \n     a date that sounds like a command.\n       Nobody heeded this implied imperative more than Wilson: the \n     28th president enjoyed the most meteoric rise in American \n     history, before or since. In 1910, Wilson was the president \n     of a small men's college in New Jersey--his alma mater, \n     Princeton. In 1912, he won the presidency. (He made a brief \n     stop in between as governor of New Jersey.) Over the next \n     eight years, Wilson advanced the most ambitious agenda of \n     progressive legislation the country had ever seen, what \n     became known as ``The New Freedom.'' To this day, any \n     president who wants to enact transformative proposals can \n     learn a few lessons from the nation's scholar-president.\n       With his first important piece of legislation, Wilson \n     showed that he was offering a sharp change in governance. He \n     began his crusade with a thorough revision of the tariff \n     system, an issue that, for decades, had only been discussed. \n     Powerful legislators had long rigged tariffs to buttress \n     monopolies and to favor their own interests, if not their own \n     fortunes.\n       Wilson, a Democrat, thought an economic overhaul this \n     audacious demanded an equally bold presentation. Not since \n     John Adams's final State of the Union speech, in 1800, had a \n     president addressed a joint session of Congress in person. \n     But Wilson, a former professor of constitutional law (and \n     still the nation's only president with a Ph.D.), knew that he \n     was empowered ``from time to time'' to ``give to the Congress \n     information of the state of the union, and recommend to their \n     consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and \n     expedient.'' And so, on April 8, 1913, five weeks after his \n     inauguration, he appeared before the lawmakers. Even members \n     of Wilson's own party decried the maneuver as an arrogant \n     throne speech.\n       The man many considered an aloof intellectual explained to \n     Congress that the president of the United States is simply \n     ``a human being trying to cooperate with other human beings \n     in a common service.'' His presence alone, to say nothing of \n     his eloquent appeal, affixed overwhelming importance to \n     tariff reform. In less than 10 minutes, Wilson articulated \n     his argument and left the Capitol.\n       The next day, Wilson did something even more stunning: he \n     returned. On the second floor of the Capitol--in the North \n     Wing, steps from the Senate chamber--is the most ornate room \n     within an already grand edifice. George Washington had \n     suggested this President's Room, where he and the Senate \n     could conduct their joint business, but it was not built \n     until the 1850s. Even then, the Italianate salon, with its \n     frescoed ceiling and richly colored tiled floor, was seldom \n     used beyond the third day of March every other year, when \n     Congressional sessions ended and the president arrived to \n     sign 11th-hour legislation. Only during Wilson's tenure has \n     the President's Room served the purpose for which it was \n     designed. He frequently worked there three times a week, \n     often with the door open.\n       Almost every visit Wilson made to the Capitol proved \n     productive. (As president, he appeared before joint sessions \n     of Congress more than two dozen times.) During Wilson's first \n     term, when the president was blessed with majorities in both \n     the House and the\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\n     Senate, the policies of the New Freedom led to the creation \n     of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the \n     Clayton Antitrust Act, the eight-hour workday, child labor \n     laws and workers' compensation. Wilson was also able to \n     appoint the first Jew to the Supreme Court, Louis D. \n     Brandeis.\n       Even when the president became besieged with troubles, both \n     personal and political--the death of his first wife; the \n     outbreak of World War I; an increasingly Republican \n     legislative branch; agonizing depression until he married a \n     widow named Edith Bolling Galt--Wilson hammered away at his \n     progressive program. In 1916, he won re-election because, as \n     his campaign slogan put it, ``He kept us out of war!'' A \n     month after his second inauguration, he appeared yet again \n     before Congress, this time, however, to convince the nation \n     that ``the world must be made safe for democracy.'' This \n     credo became the foundation for the next century of American \n     foreign policy: an obligation to assist all peoples in \n     pursuit of freedom and self-determination.\n       Suddenly, the United States needed to transform itself from \n     an isolationist nation into a war machine, and Wilson \n     persuaded Congress that dozens of crucial issues (including \n     repressive espionage and sedition acts) required that \n     politics be ``adjourned.'' Wilson returned again and again to \n     the President's Room, eventually convincing Congress to pass \n     the 19th Amendment: if women could keep the home fires \n     burning amid wartime privation, the president argued, they \n     should be entitled to vote. The journalist Frank I. Cobb \n     called Wilson's control of Congress ``the most impressive \n     triumph of mind over matter known to American politics.''\n       In the 1918 Congressional election--held days before the \n     armistice--Wilson largely abstained from politics, but he did \n     issue a written plea for a Democratic majority. Those who had \n     followed his earlier advice and adjourned politics felt he \n     was pulling a fast one. Republicans captured both houses. \n     With the war over, Wilson left for Paris to broker a peace \n     treaty, one he hoped would include the formation of a League \n     of Nations, where countries could settle disputes peaceably \n     and preemptively. The treaty required Senate approval, and \n     Wilson, who had been away from Washington for more than six \n     months, returned to discover that Republicans had actively, \n     sometimes secretly, built opposition to it--without even \n     knowing what the treaty stipulated.\n       Recognizing insurmountable resistance on Capitol Hill, even \n     after hosting an unprecedented working meeting of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee at the White House, Wilson \n     attempted an end run around the Senate: he took his case \n     directly to the people. During a 29-city tour, he slowly \n     captured public support. But then he collapsed on a train \n     between Pueblo, Colo., and Wichita, Kan., and had to be \n     rushed back to the White House. Days later he suffered a \n     stroke, which his wife, his physician and a handful of co-\n     conspirators concealed from the world, leaving Mrs. Wilson to \n     decide, in her words, ``what was important and what was \n     not.''\n       In March 1920, having recovered enough to wage a final \n     battle against the Republicans, Wilson could have garnered \n     support for a League of Nations by surrendering minor \n     concessions. But he refused. The treaty failed the Senate by \n     seven votes, and in 1921, the president hobbled out of the \n     White House as the lamest duck in American history, with his \n     ideals intact but his grandest ambition in tatters.\n       Two months ago, our current president, facing financial \n     cliffs and sequestration and toting an ambitious agenda \n     filled with such incendiary issues as immigration reform and \n     gun control, spoke of the need to break ``the habit of \n     negotiating through crisis.'' Wilson knew how to sidestep \n     that problem. He understood that conversation often holds the \n     power to convert, that sustained dialogue is the best means \n     of finding common ground.\n       Today, President Obama and Congress agree that the national \n     debt poses lethal threats to future generations, and so they \n     should declare war on that enemy and adjourn politics, at \n     least until it has been subdued. The two sides should convene \n     in the President's Room, at the table beneath the frescoes \n     named ``Legislation'' and ``Executive Authority,'' each \n     prepared to leave something on it. And then they should \n     return the next day, and maybe the day after that. Perhaps \n     the senior senator from Kentucky could offer a bottle of his \n     state's smoothest bourbon, and the president could provide \n     the branch water. All sides should remember Wilson and the \n     single factor that determines the country's glorious \n     successes or crushing failures: cooperation.\n       March forth!\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate a very special day \nin history--a day that inspires pride and gratitude in the hearts of \nthe people of the great State of Texas. I rise today to commemorate \nTexas Independence Day, which was actually this last Saturday, March 2.\n  I will read a letter that was written 177 years ago from behind the \nwalls of an old Spanish mission known as the Alamo--a letter written by \na young lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army, William Barret Travis. In \ndoing so I carry on a tradition that was started by the late John \nTower, who represented Texas in this body for more than two decades. \nThis tradition was later carried on by his successor, Senator Phil \nGramm, and then by our recently retired colleague, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison. It is a tremendous honor that this privilege has now fallen \nto me.\n  On February 23, 1846, with his position under siege and outnumbered \nby nearly 10 to 1 by the forces of Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de \nSanta Anna, Travis penned the following letter, ``To the People of \nTexas and All Americans in the World:''\n\n       Fellow citizens & compatriots--\n       I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under \n     Santa Anna.\n       I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for \n     24 hours and have not lost a man.\n       The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion. \n     Otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the \n     fort is taken.\n       I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag \n     still waves proudly from the walls.\n       I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism \n     and everything dear to the American character, to come to our \n     aid, with all dispatch.\n       The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no \n     doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five \n     days.\n       If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain \n     myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never \n     forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country.\n       Victory or Death.\n\n  Signed:\n\n       William Barret Travis.\n\n  As we all know, in the battle that ensued, 189 defenders of the Alamo \nlost their lives. But they did not die in vain. The Battle of the Alamo \nbought precious time for the Texas Revolutionaries, allowing Sam \nHouston to maneuver his army into position for a decisive victory at \nthe Battle of San Jacinto. With this victory, Texas became a sovereign \nand independent republic. For 9 years, the Republic of Texas thrived as \nan independent nation. Then, in 1845, it agreed to join the United \nStates as the 28th State.\n  Many of the Texas patriots who fought in the revolution went on to \nserve in the U.S. Congress. I am honored to hold the seat once occupied \nby Sam Houston. More broadly, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nserve 26 million Texans because of the sacrifices made by these brave \nmen 177 years ago.\n  May we always remember their sacrifices and their courage. And may \nGod continue to bless Texas and these United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1101-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1101-S1103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement--also known as ICE--initiated a precipitous action to \nreduce the population of the illegal immigrants detained by the U.S. \nGovernment for, they said, ``budgetary reasons.''\n  Let me quote ICE spokesperson Gillian Christensen, who stated, ``As \nfiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and the \npossible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to \nensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget.'' So the \nresult was a release of a significant number of detained illegal \nimmigrants and blaming it on the sequester's imminent budget cuts last \nweek, when it appears ICE mismanaged its resources.\n  That is unacceptable. This was an unnecessary action. It has the \npotential to put communities at risk. It is ineffective, inefficient, \nand irresponsible government.\n  Let's be clear about something else that ICE points to as a reason \nfor this action, ``fiscal uncertainty.'' Fiscal uncertainty is what has \ndefined our economy over the past 4 years because this government \ncannot get its act together. This government has failed to\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\ndefine for the American people, whether it is business men or women or \nwhether it is homeowners, or anyone else in this country who is looking \nto Washington to get its act together, what the future will look like. \nThen decisions can be made as to how to adapt to necessary changes or \nmodifications given our dismal fiscal situation, plunging into debt at \nrecord rates, borrowing 40 cents of every dollar. It is unsustainable. \nBut instead of providing a clear path forward on how we will address \nthis, we continue to lurch from cliff to cliff, fiscal calamity to \nfiscal calamity. It is freezing everything in place. The economy is \nsuffering for it, and more than the economy, Americans are suffering \nfor it. The 23 million Americans who are either unemployed or \nunderemployed are suffering greatly.\n  Sadly, this uncertainty and the budget constraints we face should not \ncatch any department or agency by surprise. This is not good \ngovernment, but it is the Washington way under this administration and \nthe current Democrat-led Senate. The Department of Homeland Security \nand ICE have known since September 28, 2012 exactly what level of \nresources were available for ICE under the current continuing \nresolution.\n  For those who do not understand the jargon that comes out of this \nplace, ``continuing resolution'' means a stopgap measure that Congress \nput in place last September in order to fund this government at the \ncurrent levels. That expires March 27. We likely will do it again for \nthe second 6 months of the year, instead of putting a budget together, \ninstead of putting together something that would give the American \npeople certainty as to how much money we are going to spend, and what \neffect it would have on the economy.\n  Anyway, ICE has known their spending level since September 28, as has \nevery agency. So they had plenty of notice. Why then would ICE release \ndetained illegal immigrants a week before the sequestration even took \nplace? Why did they not take proper steps necessary during the 6 months \ntime they had to evaluate this and manage their resources in a way that \nwould not require that someone make the decision to release hundreds if \nnot thousands of illegal immigrants?\n  In an effort to sort out the facts, I have requested Secretary \nNapolitano provide in writing more information and answer several \nquestions regarding the release of those individuals from detention. \nQuestion No. 1: What triggered the ICE instruction to the field to \nreduce the detainee population by this date?\n  Secondly, what is the total number of detainees released between \nFebruary 22, 2013, and February 25--a 3-day period of time? How many \nwere released? These numbers have been all over the lot, from the low \nhundreds to well into the thousands. We need to know how many illegal \nimmigrants were released in the United States and under what conditions \nthat decision was made.\n  We need to know how many of these detainees were released solely due \nto so-called ``budgetary'' reasons. How many of the released detainees \nwere designated as criminals? If additional funding can be found first \nwithin ICE or DHS for custody operations, will these released \nindividuals be returned to detention, and how will they be rounded up \nand how will they be found?\n  We know that not all law enforcement authorities were notified of \nthis in Arizona. It is unlikely to think that we know where all of \nthose individuals are at this time. I do not think they are going to \ncome back and voluntarily line up and say: Oh, I am back; I knew I \nshould not have been released.\n  Have instructions been given to field offices to reduce the intake \nand arrest of illegal aliens into detention?\n  Furthermore, I want to know if the Secretary agrees with the decision \nto release these individuals. If not, what is being done to modify this \naction so it does not take place in the future?\n  I am also concerned that the administration has not taken \naccountability for this action. Secretary Napolitano distanced herself \nfrom the press by saying, ``Detainee populations and how that is \nmanaged back and forth is really handled by career officials in the \nfield.'' Well, that may be the case, but that is not an appropriate \nresponse.\n  Is anyone in this current government willing to take responsibility \nand say, the buck stops here? I am assigned to this position and \ntherefore I take responsibility for what happens underneath my \nposition? This constantly, ``well, we didn't know about that,'' or \n``that is somebody else's obligation,'' or ``really, do you expect us \nto be on top of that''--yes. That is why you are CEO for a company. \nThat is why you get paid more than anybody else. That is why you were \nselected as Secretary of a department or the head of an agency, to take \nresponsibility for what happens underneath you.\n  I was also struck by the Secretary's comments at an event hosted by \nPolitico yesterday where she talked about the challenges DHS faces \nbecause there is not the opportunity to shift money around.\n  I agree with that. Republicans agree with that.\n  On this floor, just last Thursday, Republicans put forward a proposal \nto allow agencies to do just that after weeks and months of moaning and \ngroaning by this administration and by its various agency heads about \nhow this sequestration has made the situation much worse. It is stupid. \nIt is a terrible way to do things. I agree, by the way.\n  However, we need to be able to have the flexibility to move the money \nfrom less efficient--or not needed at this time--to the essentials. We \nwouldn't need to put out statements such as: Arrive at the airport 4 \nhours early because we need to cut the TSA agents at the same level as \nthe least function of this particular government.\n  We put that proposal before us. The President, who has been begging \nfor this, simply said: No, we are not going to do it. It was a quick \nchange of mind. I think it destroyed his political narrative. This \nproposal was before this Senate body last week to give those agencies \nthe flexibility to take from one pot that wasn't needed as much--or \ntake from areas that are efficient--and put it toward traffic \ncontrollers, transportation security officials, FDA, Department of \nAgriculture meat inspectors, wherever the priorities lie. To complain \nabout not having flexibility when your own President rejected the \nproposal given by Republicans to allow that to happen, it just boggles \nmy mind.\n  As I have said many times before over the past 2 years when the \nvarious department heads come before the Appropriations Committee: Do \nyou have an alternative plan? Do you have a plan in the event the money \ndoesn't continue to flow in from the taxpayer at a rate which allows \nyou every year to increase, increase, increase, your spending? We are \nrunning out of money. Wouldn't it be wise to look at how you could run \nyour department more effectively and efficiently as States have had to \ndo, cities had to do, businesses had to do, families had to do? They \nneed to make those decisions about separating the essential from the \n``would like to do but can't afford to do it right now.'' We need to \neliminate the items and programs that never should have been funded in \nthe first place or the programs that used to work, but are not a high \npriority any longer. Manage your department in a way that you can \nbecome more effective, do more with less.\n  To date, all the answers that have come back are, no, this is what \nthe administration wants. This is what we are going to do. We are going \nto ask for an increase next year, and we are going to tell the American \npeople we need to raise their taxes in order to pay for it or we are \ngoing to continue to borrow and go deeper and deeper into debt. It is a \nterrible way to run any organization, whether it is a Little League \norganization, a business or even the Federal Government of the United \nStates. No agency can assert with any credibility that it cannot \nperform its stated mission if it is asked to join the rest of Americans \nin reducing its budget and making modest cuts. The irony is that the \nmore Congress and the President delay action on a bold long-term fiscal \nplan with credible spending reforms, the more all other programs, \nagencies, and departments will need to cut back and do more with less.\n  We are simply pushing the problem down the road for another day. Each \ntime we push it down the road with short-term fixes or no fixes at all \nand don't address the real problems, we are making it ever harder and \nwill be forced to do it in a more Draconian way.\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\n  If the Cabinet Secretaries want more flexibility with their budgets, \nI urge them to encourage the President to lead and reform the main \nproblem and to address the main drivers of our spending, which is the \nrunaway mandatory spending that is eating everybody's lunch. Whether \nyou are for paving more roads, fixing more bridges, funding more \nmedical research or whether you want more money to go into education or \nany other function of government, if you can't address the big donkey \nor elephant in the room, which is the mandatory runaway spending, there \nis not going to be enough funds for any other priorities. We have all \nknown that year after year after year.\n  Without leadership from the top this cannot happen. It has been tried \nmany times, sometimes with bipartisan efforts, all shot down because we \ndon't have leadership from the White House and from the President of \nthe United States. He is the chief CEO of this country and he needs to \nmanage resources in a more effective way.\n  Only when we do that will we be able to avoid these constant budget \nshowdowns and short-term stopgap measures which don't solve the \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 64, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 64) authorizing expenditures by \n     committees of the Senate for the period March 1, 2013, \n     through September 30, 2013.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Paul, who is \ngoing to be offering his amendment in a few minutes, for allowing me to \ngo first. I would like to spend a few minutes speaking in opposition to \nthe Paul amendment.\n  I wish to talk about the Senate National Security Working Group, \nwhich will be the subject of the Paul amendment. This group, along with \nits predecessor organization, the Senate Arms Control Observer Group, \nhas served a useful role in helping the Senate to fulfill its unique \nconstitutional duty to consider treaties and to provide its advice and \nconsent to their ratification.\n  The Senate National Security Working Group is a key component of the \nSenate's ability to provide advice on treaties before those treaties \nare finalized because the working group begins meeting with the \nadministration early in the process of negotiation. This was the case \nfor the Senate consideration of the New START treaty a few years ago. \nThe National Security Working Group convened a series of briefings and \nmeetings with the administration starting at the very beginning of the \nnegotiation process, and through the group the Senate has many \nopportunities to learn of the progress and details of negotiations and \nto provide our advice and views to the administration throughout the \nprocess.\n  Let me first assure my colleagues that throughout the entire New \nSTART negotiation process, the members of the National Security Working \nGroup asked a great number of questions, received answers at a number \nof meetings, stayed abreast of the negotiation details, and provided \nadvice to the administration. It is a vital process that not only \nallows Senators to engage the administration early in the negotiation \nprocess, but it also gives the administration an opportunity to respond \nto Senators' concerns and questions and to guide the process in such a \nmanner as to avoid problems during Senate consideration of the treaty \nratification process. That was, in fact, the principal original purpose \nof the Arms Control Observer Group, which ensured early Senate \nengagement during the negotiation process. This process helps to ensure \nthat there is a core of Senators who are informed on treaty matters \nbefore the Senate takes up ratification, and through those Senators the \nentire Senate can have a role.\n  I also want to mention briefly to my colleagues that the National \nSecurity Working Group is perhaps unique among Senate institutions in \nthat it is, by design, purely bipartisan. It is actually composed of an \nequal number of Senators from each side of the aisle. Its decisions and \nactions are not controlled by the majority party; they are arrived at \nentirely through bipartisan agreement--something we could use more of \naround here. The bipartisan nature of the group, which is central to \nits function and its crucial role in helping the Senate fulfill its \nconstitutional treaty role, is something we should support and \ncontinue.\n  We expect there are going to be some additional preliminary \nnegotiations and discussions about those negotiations this year. It is \nvery important that this National Security Working Group continues to \nhave the ability to pave the way for negotiations that can be fruitful.\n  As I yield the floor, I again thank Senator Paul for his courtesy in \nallowing me to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as some of you may have heard, we are a bit \nshort of money. We are borrowing $50,000 every second. We borrow over \n$4 billion every day. In a year's time we borrow over $1 trillion. \nThere are ramifications to that. Some economists now say that the \nburden of our debt is costing us 1 million jobs a year. What I am \nasking is, in the midst of this sequester when people say we have no \nmoney to cut, to take this small item.\n  Why would I want to cut this small group? There are a couple of \nreasons. It is called the National Security Working Group--about $2.8 \nmillion, which is not much money in terms of Washington. But why would \nI want to cut it?\n  The first reason would be that there are no records of them meeting. \nWe heard about the START treaty. It was in 2009 when they were last \nmeeting. There are no public records that this group, which spends \n$700,000 a year, has met in the last 3 years. There are no public \nrecords of who works for the committee. There are no public records of \ntheir salaries. Every one of my staff's name and salary is printed in \nthe public record--not for this group.\n  Now, they say we need this group to negotiate treaties. Well, we have \na group; it is called the Foreign Relations Committee. I am on the \nForeign Relations Committee, and that is where we discuss treaties--or \nat least we are supposed to. The Foreign Relations Committee has dozens \nof employees, and millions of dollars are spent on our committee. It \ngoes through the regular process. Our staff's salaries are approved, \nthe names are in the public record, and if you object, you know where \nto look for the information. To fund a group that has no records and no \nrecords of them meeting and doesn't tell you where they are paying the \nsalaries I don't think makes any sense.\n  Our job is to look at the money as if it were ours, as if it were \nyours, and pay attention to detail.\n  Will this balance the budget? No. Is it a place we should start? Yes. \nAbsolutely. What I would call for is looking and saving where we can. \nIn my office, I have a $3.5 million budget. I saved $600,000 last year, \nand I turned it back in to the Treasury. That doesn't balance the \nbudget, but we have to start somewhere. This is another $700,000. If I \nwin this one vote, I could save $700,000--or at least save us from \nborrowing another $700,000. If all of your elected officials were up \nhere doing the same, we would be much closer to a resolution. I turned \nin $600,000 to the Treasury--18 percent of my budget--and I didn't lay \noff anybody because we are careful about the way we spend. We spend as \nif it were our own money. If all of our public officials were doing \nthat, imagine what we could do.\n  I have another bill that will never see the light of day up here \nbecause they don't want to fix anything. This bill would give bonuses \nto civil servants--Federal employees--who find savings. Right now we do \nthe opposite. If your budget is $12 million and you work somewhere in \nthe bureaucracy of government, you want to spend it at the\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nend of the year so you can get it next year.\n  I would change that incentive. I would give that civil servant a \nsignificant bonus if they will keep money at the end of the year and \nturn it back in to the Treasury. Can you imagine the savings from top \nto bottom throughout government if we did that? But if we were to do \nthat, to ask civil servants to do that and look for these savings--and \nright now, with the sequester, people throughout government are looking \nfor savings--why shouldn't we start with the Senate?\n  Why would we continue to fund a group where the work they supposedly \ndo is also done officially by another group which has many employees, a \nlarge staff, and it is the constitutional mandate of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to discuss treaties.\n  So while this is a small bit of money, it is symbolic of what needs \nto go on in this country in order to rectify a problem that is truly \nbankrupting the American people.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, tomorrow the Senate will have an \nopportunity to correct itself and complete action on the nomination of \nCaitlin Halligan to the DC Circuit. She was first nominated to a \nvacancy on the court in September 2010, almost 30 months ago. No one \nwho knows her, no one who is familiar with her outstanding legal career \ncan be anything but impressed by her experience, her intelligence, and \nher integrity. Hers is a legal career which rivals that of the DC \nCircuit judge she was nominated to succeed.\n  I might mention that the judge she was nominated to succeed was John \nRoberts, who served on the DC Circuit. He is now Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. I voted for the confirmation of John Roberts to the DC \nCircuit. I voted for the confirmation of John Roberts to the Supreme \nCourt. He and I do not share the same judicial philosophy or\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\npolitical party, but I voted for him because he was well qualified. I \ndid not agree with every position he had taken or argument he made as a \nhigh-level lawyer in several Republican administrations, but I \nsupported his nomination to the DC Circuit because of his legal \nexcellence. Caitlin Halligan is also well qualified. Caitlin Halligan \nis as well qualified as John Roberts, whom I voted for, and her \nnomination deserves a vote. John Roberts was confirmed unanimously to \nthe DC Circuit on the day the Judiciary Committee completed \nconsideration of his nomination and reported it to the Senate. It is \ntime for the Senate to consider Caitlin Halligan's nomination on her \nmerits and end the filibuster that has extended over 2 years.\n  What I am saying is that if we want to be honest in the Senate, we \nhave to apply the same standard to her that we applied to the \nnomination of John Roberts. After being nominated and renominated four \ntimes over the course of the last 3 years, it is time for the Senate to \naccord this outstanding woman debate and vote on the merits she \ndeserves.\n  Caitlin Halligan is a highly regarded appellate advocate, with the \nkind of impeccable credentials in both public service and private \npractice that make her unquestionably qualified to serve on the DC \nCircuit. In fact, the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nreviewed her nomination and gave her their highest possible rating. The \njudge for whom she clerked on the DC Circuit, former chief judge Pat \nWald, urges her confirmation. Those who have worked with her all praise \nher. We have not heard a single negative comment on her legal ability, \njudgment, character, ethics, or her temperament. By the standard we \nhave used for nominees of Republican Presidents, there is no question \nthat Caitlin Halligan should be confirmed and this ill-advised \nfilibuster should end. Earlier this month the Senate ended a filibuster \nagainst the nomination of Robert Bacharach and he was confirmed \nunanimously to the Tenth Circuit. We finally were allowed to complete \naction on the nomination of William Kayatta to the First Circuit. So, \ntoo, the Senate should now reconsider its prior treatment of Caitlin \nHalligan and confirm her nomination.\n  She is a stellar candidate with broad bipartisan support. She is \nsupported by law enforcement, with whom she worked closely while \nserving as a chief appellate lawyer in the State of New York and as \ngeneral counsel for the Manhattan district attorney. That includes the \nsupport of New York City police commissioner, Ray Kelly; the New York \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; and the National District Attorneys \nAssociation.\n  Carter Phillips, who served as an assistant to the Solicitor General \nduring the Reagan administration, describes her as one of those \nextremely smart, thoughtful, measured, and effective advocates and \nconcluded that she would be a first-rate judge. She has the strong \nsupport of the New York Women in Law Enforcement, the National Center \nfor Women and Policing, the National Conference of Women's Bar \nAssociations, the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, \nand the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nletters in support for Ms. Halligan at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I have been here 38 years and occasionally see things that really \ndisappoint me. This is one where I see that narrow special interest \ngroups seek to misrepresent her as a partisan or ideological crusader. \nShe is not. Everybody who knows her, everybody who has dealt with her, \nRepublican and Democratic alike, says she is not. What they do say is \nthat she is a brilliant lawyer who knows the difference between the \nroles of legal advocate and judge. She will be a fair, impartial, and \noutstanding judge.\n  To oppose her for her work as an advocate would be like saying: We \ncan't have this particular nominee be a judge because the nominee was \nappointed to defend a murderer and we are against murder. No. We are \nagainst the rule of law. We are against everybody who appears before a \ncourt having good representation whether we agree with their position \nor not. These kinds of arguments undermine our whole legal system.\n  While serving as the solicitor general for the State of New York, she \nwas an advocate, representing the interests of her client. How often \nhave we heard Republican Senators say that what lawyers do and say in \nlegal proceedings should not be used to undermine their judicial \nnominations? Chief Justice Roberts himself has made that point. As an \nattorney, Chief Justice Roberts advocated for positions where I \ndisagreed with him, but he was supporting the position of the people \nfor whom he was an advocate. At his confirmation hearing to join the \nUnited States Supreme Court, Judge Roberts said:\n\n       [I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back \n     before the founding of the country that lawyers are not \n     identified with the positions of their clients. The most \n     famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the \n     British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that \n     for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution \n     in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule \n     of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.\n       Our Founders thought that they were not being given their \n     rights under the British system to which they were entitled, \n     and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that \n     what they were about was defending the rule of law, not \n     undermining it, and that principle, that you don't \n     identify the lawyer with the particular views of the \n     client, or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf of \n     the client, is critical to the fair administration of \n     justice.\n\n  That has always been our tradition--at least until now. This litmus \ntest that would disqualify nominees because as lawyers they represented \na legal position in a case is dangerous and wrong. Almost every nominee \nwho had been a practicing lawyer would be disqualified by such a test. \nBy the standard that is being applied to Caitlin Halligan, John Roberts \ncould not have been confirmed to serve as a Federal judge let alone as \nthe Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Yet some have justified their filibuster because she was directed by \nthe New York attorney general to draft an amicus brief challenging a \nFederal law that protected gun manufacturers from liability for crimes \ncommitted with their products. As New York's solicitor general she \nfiled a brief in support of a class action lawsuit against anti-choice \nclinic protestors under the Hobbs Act. She filed a brief on behalf of \nNew York in support of a lower court's decision to permit back pay to \nundocumented employees whose employers were violating Federal law. She \nfiled a brief on behalf of New York and other States in support of the \nUniversity of Michigan's affirmative action program. In all of these \ncases, she was representing her client, the State of New York.\n  Note that her critics are not arguing that she was a bad lawyer. In \nessence, what they are contending is that because they disagree with \nthe legal positions taken on behalf of her client, she should not get \nan up-or-down vote. That is wrong.\n  When I voted for Chief Justice Roberts, I remember a number of \nRepublicans told me, of course, that is the only thing you should do \nbecause you think he is qualified. Now I have Republicans who tell me \nthey feel she is well qualified, but this special interest group or \nthat special interest group is opposed to her. She took positions with \nwhich they disagree. That is not the issue. Is she qualified? Did she \nstand up for her clients the way an attorney should in our adversarial \nsystem?\n  Her public service in the State of New York is commendable, and no \nreason to filibuster this nomination. Vote yes or vote no on this \nnomination. Voting to block it from coming to a vote is saying: I don't \nhave the courage to stand up and vote yes or no; I want to vote maybe. \nIt never comes to a vote if we filibuster it. I may vote maybe so I \ndon't have to explain to people that she is far more qualified than \npeople we voted for who were nominated by Republican Presidents. I \ndidn't vote against her; I didn't vote for her; I voted maybe.\n  That is not the way it should be. Our legal system is an adversarial \nsystem, predicated upon legal advocacy for both sides. There is a \ndifference between serving as a legal advocate and as an impartial \njudge. She knows that. She is a woman of integrity. No one who fairly \nreviews her nomination has any reason to doubt her commitment to serve \nas an impartial judge.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  I always said when I practiced law that I didn't want to walk into a \ncourtroom and say the case is going be determined by whether I was \nplaintiff or defendant, Republican or Democratic, but that the case \nwould be determined on the facts and the law.\n  We have been fortunate in Vermont that we have had many judges like \nthis, judges who were appointed by Republican Governors, judges \nappointed by Democratic Governors, Federal judges appointed by \nRepublican Presidents, Federal judges appointed by Democratic \nPresidents. In Vermont, we have been fortunate because no matter what \ntheir positions have been before, they turned out to be impartial \njudges, which is what this good woman will be.\n  In fact, it is not only wrong but dangerous to attribute the legal \nposition she took in representing her client, the State of New York, to \nher personally and then take the additional leap--and it is a huge \nleap--to contend that her personal views will override her commitment \nto evenhandedly apply the law.\n  John Adams, one of our most revered Founders, wrote that his \nrepresentation of the British soldiers in the controversial case \nregarding the Boston Massacre was ``one of the most gallant, generous, \nmanly and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best \npieces of service I ever rendered my country.'' That is our tradition. \nThe Senate should end this filibuster and vote to confirm a woman who \nhas ably served as a public official representing the State of New York \nand the district attorney of Manhattan.\n  The other justification Republican Senators used 2 years ago to \njustify their filibuster is gone. Some contended that the caseload in \nthe DC Circuit was not sufficiently heavy to justify the appointment. \nThere are now four vacancies on the DC Circuit. The vacancies have \ndoubled during the last 2 years. The bench is more than one-third \nempty. This is reason enough for Senators to reconsider their earlier \nvotes and end this filibuster.\n  The Senate responded to this caseload concern in 2008 when we agreed \nto decrease the number of DC Circuit judgeships from 12 to 11. Caitlin \nHalligan is nominated to fill the 8th seat on the DC Circuit, not the \n11th. Just a few years ago when the DC Circuit caseload per active \njudge was lower than it is now, all the Republican Senators voted to \nconfirm nominees to fill the 9th seat, the 10th seat twice, and the \n11th seat on this court. In fact, the DC Circuit caseload for active \njudges increased 50 percent from 2005--50 percent from when the Senate \nconfirmed the nominee to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit bench. \nThe caseload on the DC Circuit is also greater than the caseload on the \nTenth Circuit, to which the Senate just confirmed Judge Robert \nBacharach of Oklahoma last week.\n  In her recent column in The Washington Post, Judge Wald explains why \nthe work of the DC Circuit, with its unique jurisdiction over complex \nregulatory cases is different and more onerous than in other circuits \nand why the court needs to have its vacancies filled. She wrote:\n\n       The number of pending cases per judge has grown from 119 in \n     2005 to 188 today. A great many of these are not easy cases. \n     The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, \n     labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest \n     impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water \n     regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform, \n     insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands \n     of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days \n     of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, \n     and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of \n     record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically \n     intricate legal opinions.\n\n  She also notes: ``The D.C. Circuit has 11 judgeships but only seven \nactive judges. There is cause for extreme concern that Congress is \nsystematically denying the court the human resources it needs to carry \nout its weighty mandates.'' I ask that a copy of her article be \nincluded in the Record at this point.\n  I urge all those who have said filibusters on judicial nominations \nare unconstitutional to end this filibuster. I urge those who have said \nhere on this floor that they would never support a filibuster of a \njudicial nomination to end this filibuster. I urge those who said they \nwould filibuster only in extraordinary circumstances to end this \nfilibuster. I urge all those who care about the judiciary and the \nadministration of justice, the Senate, and the American people to come \nforward and end this filibuster.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Letters of Support for Halligan\n\n       February 14, 2011--Derek Champagne, Franklin County \n     District Attorney\n       February 16, 2011--William Fitzpatrick, Onondaga County \n     District Attorney\n       February 22, 2011--Randy Mastro, Gibson Dunn\n       February 25, 2011--Daniel Donovan, Jr., Richmond County \n     District Attorney\n       February 28, 2011--Chauncy Parker, Director of New York/New \n     Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program\n       February 28, 2011--23 Former United States Supreme Court \n     Clerkship Colleagues\n       March 4, 2011--Cyrus Vance, Jr., New York County District \n     Attorney\n       March 4, 2011--Joint Letter from 21 lawyers (Clifford \n     Sloan, Sri Srinivasan, Miguel Estrada, Carter Phillips, Seth \n     Waxman, Walter Dillinger, David Frederick, Andrew Levander, \n     Richard Davis, Michele Hirshman, Dietrich Snell, Paul Smith, \n     Patricia Ann Millet, Kathleen Sullivan, Thomas Brunner, Mier \n     Feder, Evan Tager, Philip Howard, Ira Millstein, Roy Reardon, \n     Michael H.

Wald)\n\n       Pending before the Senate are nominations to fill two of \n     the four vacant judgeships on the U. S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. This court has exclusive \n     jurisdiction over many vital national security challenges and \n     hears the bulk of appeals from the major regulatory agencies \n     of the federal government. Aside from the U.S. Supreme Court, \n     it resolves more constitutional questions involving \n     separation of powers and executive prerogatives than any \n     court in the country.\n       The D.C. Circuit has 11 judgeships but only seven active \n     judges. There is cause for extreme concern that Congress is \n     systematically denying the court the human resources it needs \n     to carry out its weighty mandates.\n       The court's vacancies date to 2005, and it has not received \n     a new appointment since 2006. The number of pending cases per \n     judge has grown from 119 in 2005 to 188 today. A great many \n     of these are not easy cases. The D.C. Circuit hears the most \n     complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over \n     regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' \n     lives: clean air and water regulations, nuclear plant safety, \n     healthcare reform issues, insider trading and more. These \n     cases can require thousands of hours of preparation by the \n     judges, often consuming days of argument, involving hundreds \n     of parties and interveners, and necessitating dozens of \n     briefs and thousands of pages of record--all of which \n     culminates in lengthy, technically intricate legal opinions.\n       I served on the D.C. Circuit for more than 20 years and as \n     its chief judge for almost five. My colleagues and I worked \n     as steadily and intensively as judges on other circuits even \n     if they may have heard more cases. The nature of the D.C. \n     Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts. \n     The U.S. Judicial Conference reviews this caseload \n     periodically and makes recommendations to Congress about the \n     court's structure. In 2009, the conference recommended, based \n     on its review, that the circuit's 12th judgeship be \n     eliminated. This apolitical process is the proper way to \n     determine the circuit's needs, rather than in the more highly \n     charged context of individual confirmations.\n       During my two-decade tenure, 11 active judges were sitting \n     a majority of the time; today, the court has only 64 percent \n     of its authorized active judges. This precipitous decline \n     manifests in the way the court operates. And while the D.C. \n     Circuit has five senior judges, they may opt out of the most \n     complex regulatory cases and do not sit en banc. They also \n     choose the periods during which they will sit, which can \n     affect the randomization of assignment of judges to cases.\n       There is, moreover, a subtle constitutional dynamic at work \n     here: The president nominates and the Senate confirms federal \n     judges for life. While some presidents may not encounter any \n     vacancies during their administration, over time the \n     constitutional schemata ensures that the makeup of courts \n     reflects the choices of changing presidents and the ``advise \n     and consent'' of changing Senates. Since the circuit courts' \n     structure was established in 1948, President Obama is the \n     first president not to have a single judge confirmed to the \n     D.C. Circuit during his first full term. The constitutional \n     system of nomination and confirmation can work only if there \n     is good faith on the part of both the president and the \n     Senate to move qualified nominees along, rather than \n     withholding consent for political reasons. I recall my own \n     difficult confirmation 35 years ago as the first female judge \n     on the circuit; eminent senators such as Barry Goldwater, \n     Thad Cochran and Alan Simpson voted to confirm me regardless \n     of differences in party or general political philosophy.\n       The two D.C. Circuit nominees before the Senate are \n     exceedingly well qualified. Caitlin Halligan served as my law \n     clerk during the 1995-96 term, working on cases involving the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service, the Federal Communications Commission \n     and diverse other topics. She later clerked for Supreme Court \n     Justice Stephen Breyer. She also served as New York solicitor \n     general and general counsel for the Manhattan district \n     attorney's office, as well as being a partner in a major law \n     firm. The other nominee, Sri Srinivasan, has similarly \n     impressive credentials and a reputation that surely merits \n     prompt and serious consideration of his nomination.\n       There is a tradition in the D.C. Circuit of spirited \n     differences among judges on the most important legal issues \n     of our time. My experience, however, was that deliberations \n     generally focused on the legal and real-world consequences of \n     decisions and reflected a premium on rational thinking and \n     intellectual prowess, not personal philosophy or policy \n     preferences. It is in that vein that I urge the Senate to \n     confirm the two pending nominations to the D.C. Circuit, so \n     that this eminent court can live up to its full potential in \n     our country's judicial work.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that the colloquy between the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee and myself be as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1107-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1107-S1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, to discuss two pieces of legislation we introduced to \nrestore liberty and to protect jobs. The first bill, S. 40, the \nAmerican Liberty Restoration Act, would repeal ObamaCare's \nunconstitutional individual mandate. The second bill, S. 399, the \nAmerican Job Protection Act, would repeal Obama's job-killing employer \nmandate. These two provisions were included in the President's health \nlaw for the purpose of raising revenues--an attempt to pay for all of \nthe new spending under ObamaCare--and to garner support from the \nprivate insurance industry.\n  I would ask Senator Alexander, has the so-called Affordable Care Act \nlived up to the promises President Obama made during the health care \nreform debate to maintain personal freedom, reduce health care costs, \nand decrease unemployment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nleadership on these two pieces of legislation, and the answer is: No, \nthe new health care law hasn't lived up to the promises.\n  Let me cite an example. The President promised in the debates leading \nup to the health care act that if someone wanted to keep the insurance \nthey had, they would be able to do that. I am afraid it is not working \nout that way, and here is why.\n  What happens is that businesses around the country are finding out \nwhen the health care law goes into effect fully they will either have \nto supply a certain type of health care insurance, which in many \ncases--as many as half the cases according to some studies--is a better \npolicy and more expensive policy than they are now offering their \nemployees, or they will have to pay a $2,000 tax, to the Internal \nRevenue Service. That means the employee, if the business decides to do \nthat, will go into the exchange and lose the employer insurance they \nhad.\n  Based on my experience in talking to many businesses, there is going \nto be a massive rush, by small businesses in particular and by many \nlarge businesses, to stop offering employer-sponsored health insurance \nto their employees and, instead, pay the $2,000 penalty, or tax, which \nmeans all of those employees--most of them lower income employees or \nmiddle-income employees--will lose the insurance they had and be in the \nexchanges looking for a new insurance policy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I agree with my colleague and thank him \nfor his comments.\n  I would also argue the individual mandate is unconstitutional. When \nthe law was being debated here in Congress, and later when it was being \nlitigated in the courts, proponents repeatedly argued the individual \nmandate was constitutional under the commerce clause. Well, that simply \nisn't the case. While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law on \nother grounds, the majority of Justices agreed the individual mandate \nwas not a proper exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate \ncommerce.\n  I have to say I agree with that conclusion. Indeed, I say it is \nsimply common sense the power to regulate interstate commerce does not \ninclude the power to compel individuals to engage in commerce, which is \nprecisely what the individual mandate does.\n  Despite the Court's overall decision, the American people see the \nindividual mandate for what it is--an affront to individual liberty. \nIndeed, the vast majority of the American people know it violates our \nconstitutional principles and that it cedes too much power to the \nFederal Government. That is why, in poll after poll, the majority of \nAmericans support repealing the mandate.\n  I would also ask the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, to share his views about the individual mandate, if he has \nany additional views.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I agree with the Senator from Utah. I think he stated \nclearly what the constitutionality is and he has been a most forceful \nadvocate of that.\n  As I think about the legislation we are talking about, I am thinking \nalso about the employer mandate and the requirement that, as I \nmentioned earlier, employers pay $2,000 if they do not\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\noffer insurance or a $3,000 penalty if they offer the wrong kinds of \ninsurance.\n  I would say to the Senator from Utah that we are making it more \ndifficult to lower the unemployment rate in this country, which has \nstayed too high, with 12 million people unemployed, when we keep \nloading up employers with costs that make it more expensive to hire an \nemployee. If we make it more expensive to hire an employee, we don't \ngive the employer an incentive to hire more people. In fact, we \ndiscourage the employer from hiring more people.\n  I wonder if I might ask the Senator, in thinking about the employer \nmandate, if he agrees that employers across the country are considering \nreducing their number of employees, having more part-time employees in \norder to deal with this new cost of the employer mandate which is part \nof the health care law.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee \nthat is certainly the case. There are various reports and analyses of \nthis that indicate a significant number of employers would rather pay \nthe penalty and not have to deal with the particular requirements the \nAffordable Care Act seems to require.\n  On top of the unconstitutional individual mandate, this job-killing \nemployer mandate is a real problem. Under the President's health law, \nemployers with more than 50 full-time employees are required to offer \ncoverage, as the distinguished Senator said, that meets a minimum value \nor pay a penalty of $2,000 per employee. The distinguished Senator from \nTennessee explained this well. If the employer does offer coverage but \nthat coverage does not meet the minimum value, employers must pay \n$3,000 per employee. I have never heard such a ridiculous approach \ntoward business. Not surprisingly, the penalty under this provision \ncosts less than offering coverage. According to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation annual survey of employer-sponsored health insurance, \naverage annual premiums are $5,615 for single coverage and $15,745 for \nfamily coverage. Once again, the penalty for an employer who doesn't \noffer health insurance is only $2,000 per employee. That being the \ncase, the law does not incentivize employers to offer the employees \nhealth insurance. Instead, it does exactly the opposite. Rather than \nfooting the full cost of providing health coverage, many employers are \ngoing to take the less expensive route and simply pay the penalty, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee has mentioned. Even worse, \nmany employers that currently do offer their employees health benefits \nunder current law will likely drop the benefits and, instead, choose to \npay the penalty.\n  Studies are already showing this is the case, and this will be the \ncase. An employer survey done by McKinsey and Company found that ``30 \npercent of respondents who said their companies offered employer-\nsponsored health insurance said they would definitely or probably drop \ncoverage in the years following 2014.''\n  So despite the President's claim to the contrary, ObamaCare has not \npreserved the employer-sponsored health insurance market. It dismantles \nit. As a result, the President's promise that those who like their \nhealth insurance would be able to keep it falls by the wayside.\n  I believe Senator Alexander is also concerned about the fact the \nPresident's law defines small employers as those with less than 50 \nemployees. In addition, I thought this law was supposed to create jobs. \nThe President claimed it would. So again, I would turn to my colleague \nfrom Tennessee and ask: Does he think that has been the case? Does he \nthink the President has been right about that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, I would say to my friend from Utah, I am afraid \nthe President was mistaken about that. And we have talked about some \nspecifics, but let me give some very specific examples of why I believe \nthat is true.\n\n  Some time ago I met with a large group of chief executive officers of \nrestaurant companies in America. The service and hospitality industries \nare the largest employers in America. Restaurant companies are the \nlargest employer of low-income, young, usually minority people. These \nare Americans who are often getting their first job or they are \nAmericans of any age who are trying to work their way up the economic \nladder, starting with a lower paying job, a job that doesn't require as \nmany skills, and hoping that instead of having a minimum wage they will \nend up someday with a maximum wage. But in order to get that maximum \nwage they have to get on the ladder. They have to start somewhere.\n  Here is what I was told. The chief executive officer of Ruby Tuesday, \nIncorporated, which has about 800 restaurants, said to me--and he \ndidn't mind being quoted--that the cost to his company of implementing \nthe new health care law would equal his entire profit for the company \nlast year and that he wouldn't build anymore new restaurants in the \nUnited States as a result of that. He said he would look to expand \noutside.\n  Another, even larger restaurant company, said because of their \nanalysis of the law, instead of operating their stores with 90 \nemployees, they would try to offer it through stores with 70 employees. \nSo that means fewer employees and it means fewer employees receiving \nemployer health care.\n  Then almost every other restaurant said they were looking for ways to \nhave more part-time employees so they didn't have to incur the expense \nof the new health care law.\n  So at least with that industry and those low-income, usually \nminority, often young employees, the jobs are going away because of the \nhealth care law. And with those jobs goes whatever employer health care \ninsurance was being offered by those companies.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have heard the same complaints by the restaurant \nindustry, and by a lot of small businesses that are looking to not hire \nmore than 50 people, and also are looking to cut their employees' work \nhours down to below 30 hours a week in order to avoid these massive \ncosts that would incur to them.\n  The employer mandate is a drag on our economy, forcing too many of \nour Nation's job creators to stop hiring and growing their businesses \nin order to comply with the onerous provision in the President's health \nlaw. Instead of letting the Federal Government dictate how employers \nshould allocate resources, we should repeal this job-killing mandate \nand let businesses freely manage their personnel needs.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I certainly agree with the Senator from Utah, and that \nis the purpose of our legislation. We could offer more examples. The \nWall Street Journal article of February 22 of this year said:\n\n       Many franchisees of Burger King, McDonalds, Red Lobster, \n     KFC, Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell have started to cut back on \n     full-time employment, though many are terrified to talk on \n     the record.\n\n  These are the kinds of companies I was talking about.\n  The article also references a 2011 Hudson Institute study that \nestimates the employer mandate will cost the franchise industry $6.4 \nbillion and put 3.2 million jobs at risk.\n  Mr. HATCH. I couldn't agree more with the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in \nthe Record an article under Politico's banner, titled: ``Under ACA, \nEmployer Mandate Could Mean Fewer Jobs.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Feb. 27, 2013]\n\n           Under ACA, Employer Mandate Could Mean Fewer Jobs\n\n    (By Dan Danner, Bruce Josten, Matthew Shay, and Dirk Van Dongen)\n\n       This March marks the third anniversary of the passage of \n     the president's sweeping health care legislation. But for \n     many in the business community now facing a litany of \n     difficult decisions in the law's wake, this milestone will be \n     met with capitulation rather than celebration.\n       With the employer mandate, Obamacare puts the nation's job \n     creators between a rock and a hard place. Despite the gentle \n     sounding title, the Shared Responsibility provision actually \n     takes the two parties who should be making decisions about \n     employer-sponsored health coverage (the employer and the \n     employee) completely out of the equation. Beginning in 2014, \n     large employers must provide a prescribed level of health \n     care coverage to all full-time employees or potentially pay a \n     hefty penalty. While this may sound relatively \n     straightforward, it is anything but.\n       Beyond imposing a costly and non-negotiable mandated \n     benefit, the law also redefines the long-standing definition \n     of a full-\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\n     time employee. With the passage of the law, an employee \n     working an average of 30 hours or more per week over a month \n     is a full-time employee. Further, the law sets out a \n     complicated algorithm to determine whether a business is a \n     large employer. Aggregating the hours of all part-time \n     workers and adding in the number of full-time workers are \n     necessary to determine whether a business has the equivalent \n     of 50 or more fulltime employees and is therefore, a large \n     employer.\n       Under the guise of improving access to coverage, the \n     mandate presents a false choice for owners: provide one-size-\n     fits-all health care coverage at the expense of higher wages \n     and other benefits; or potentially pay a penalty. The \n     unfortunate reality is that, with this devil's choice, \n     everyone ends up paying a penalty--employers, employees and \n     the unemployed. Whatever ``choice'' the employer makes will \n     lead to fewer jobs, lower wages and lost revenue.\n       For employers near the ``large'' employer threshold, we can \n     expect to see layoffs or dramatically reduced hours. These \n     will be tough decisions, especially for small businesses \n     where employees are like family and benefits options are \n     often discussed and agreed upon collaboratively. The rising \n     cost of the mandated insurance plans will very likely force \n     many businesses to drop coverage entirely and pay the steep \n     penalty, a difficult choice but a necessary one in light of \n     increasingly cost-prohibitive employee coverage. Smaller \n     businesses that might otherwise be eyeing expansion and \n     growth down the road will most likely reduce or cap the \n     number of employees to avoid the expensive mandate in the \n     future.\n       The options available to job creators are bleak--cut their \n     workforce, stem growth, pay a penalty or go out of business--\n     and whatever choice they are forced to make will ultimately \n     harm employees and the economy. Replacing one full-time \n     position with two part-time positions is a hollow form of job \n     creation--not an efficient way to create good jobs that can \n     support families. Compliance costs--already 36 percent higher \n     for small firms--will soar; those costs, as well as the money \n     that must now go toward increased benefits or nontax \n     deductible penalties, will crowd out wage increases and \n     business investment.\n       The Commerce Department reported last month that in the \n     fourth quarter of 2012, economic growth contracted for the \n     first time in more than three years. This isn't a surprise, \n     given that the small-business sector has never recovered--and \n     is unlikely to--while Washington continues to penalize small \n     employers for expanding. At a time when our economy is deeply \n     troubled, our government is forcing employers to restructure \n     in ways that repress growth and employment.\n       Thankfully, Thursday's bicameral introduction of the \n     American Job Protection Act by Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and \n     Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Congressmen John Barrow of \n     Georgia and Charles Boustany of Louisiana comes at a perfect \n     time. Members of both parties recognize the damage this \n     impending mandate will have on our economy, and Congress \n     should repeal it before it's too late.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Again, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for working \nwith me on these two critical issues that impact every American. I will \nconclude with a quote from a Utah employer. This is a small business \nowner who is concerned about what the company will do come January 1 if \nthese mandates remain in place. This employer wrote to me saying this \nabout ObamaCare:\n\n       We will have to choose who will work 30 or less hours a \n     week, which in turn is bad for our business because we have \n     to train more people to do one job. It is bad for our \n     customers because they will have to interact with different \n     employees who may not know the customer's needs as well, and \n     it is most devastating for the employee because the \n     employee's hours will be cut.\n\n  If we want to turn this economy around, government decrees such as \nthe employer mandate must be repealed.\n  Our job creators cannot grow and innovate with these heavy-handed \nregulations coming from Washington bureaucrats who have no clue how to \nrun a business.\n  We must work together on this important issue for the sake of the \nindividuals working three jobs at a time to make ends meet, for \nemployers trying to keep workers on the payroll and contributing to the \neconomy, and for our Nation as a whole to put our economy on the right \ntrack and to keep us globally competitive. At least that is my \nviewpoint, and it is certainly the viewpoint of my small business \ncolleagues there in Utah.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Utah for this opportunity to \nhave a colloquy with him, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record following my remarks letters from the National Restaurant \nAssociation, Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and the National \nRetail Federation, each of which strongly supports our legislation and \nmakes the points we have made about the employer mandate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Restaurant\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2013.\n     Re Support for repeal of Shared Responsibility for Employers \n         provision.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Alexander: On behalf of the \n     National Restaurant Association members, we write in support \n     of the American Job Protection Act, and to thank you for your \n     leadership on this issue. This legislation would repeal the \n     2010 health care reform law's harmful employer mandate.\n       The National Restaurant Association is the leading business \n     association for the restaurant and food service industry. The \n     industry is comprised of 980,000 restaurant and foodservice \n     outlets employing 13.1 million people who serve 130 million \n     guests daily. Although it is predominately comprised of small \n     businesses, the restaurant industry is the nation's second-\n     largest private-sector employer, employing 10 percent of the \n     U.S. workforce.\n       Regrettably, the employer mandate is expected to \n     significantly increase costs within our industry, threatening \n     entrepreneurs' ability to hire additional employees, or \n     expand operations. The American Job Protection Act would \n     repeal the mandate, thereby providing restaurateurs the \n     flexibility to provide the health care coverage that they can \n     afford, while addressing the varying needs within the diverse \n     workforce.\n       Again, thank you for introducing the American Job \n     Protection Act. We strongly support the legislation's passage \n     and look forward to working with you toward that end.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Angelo I. Amador, Esq.,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                         Labor & Workforce Policy.\n\n                                      Michelle Reinke Neblett,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Labor & Workforce Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2013.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Alexander: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, thanks you for introducing S. 399, the ``American Job \n     Protection Act, '' which would repeal the employer mandate \n     included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (PPACA). This requirement is already having a negative effect \n     on employment and will continue to discourage small \n     businesses from growing. In fact, the Chamber's most recent \n     quarterly small business survey released in January of 2013 \n     confirmed that 71 percent of small business executives \n     believe that implementation of the health care law will make \n     it harder for them to hire more employees.\n       The PPACA requires businesses with 50 or more full-time \n     equivalent employees to offer certain health benefits or pay \n     steep penalties. Even businesses that do provide health \n     benefits may still be subjected to draconian fines. \n     Businesses with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees \n     are hesitant to grow their businesses or hire what would \n     amount to the fiftieth employee. Repealing this ``shared \n     responsibility'' provision would not only protect existing \n     jobs, but spur the creation of new jobs by removing the fear \n     and uncertainty many small businesses are experiencing in \n     anticipation of these coverage requirements that begin in \n     2014.\n       Prior to the enactment of the PPACA, businesses voluntarily \n     offered health insurance to most Americans. According to the \n     Employee Benefits Research Institute, more than 156 million \n     Americans had employer-sponsored health insurance in 2009. \n     But now, the employer mandate requires businesses to provide \n     prescribed coverage, an unprecedented intrusion on employers' \n     freedom to develop employee compensation packages. This \n     requirement is not only unlikely to achieve the objective of \n     forcing all employers to provide federally prescribed \n     coverage, it is also likely to incent employers to drop \n     coverage entirely, limit employees' hours, and restrict job \n     growth.\n       The requirement would also disproportionately disadvantage \n     low-income workers and the businesses that employ them, since \n     these are the workers that would trigger the penalty \n     provision and subject a business to unpredictable and \n     significant fines. Further, for the first time, the PPACA \n     defines a ``full-time'' employee as someone who works 30 \n     hours per week, rather than the traditional definition of 40 \n     hours per week.\n       It is critical that the employer mandate be removed before \n     it takes effect in 2014 so that employers can focus on \n     strengthening their\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\n     businesses, hiring more workers, and revitalizing the \n     economy. The Chamber looks forward to working with you and \n     your colleagues to enact this vital legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to lend the support of the \n     National Retail Federation (NRF) to employer mandate repeal \n     legislation you have introduced: S. 399, the American Job \n     Protection Act. We strongly support your bill and urge that \n     it be promptly adopted.\n       NRF has myriad concerns with and objections to the \n     Affordable Care Act, even as our focus shifted to trying to \n     help our members comply with the new law. Your legislation \n     appropriately would repeal the employer mandate. We strongly \n     supported your legislation in the 112th Congress and proudly \n     do so again now.\n       Eliminating the employer mandate would greatly aid the \n     greater retail community, which is heavily dependent on \n     labor. One of every four jobs in the American economy is \n     supported by retail, which would be jeopardized by the \n     mandate effective in 2014. The employer mandate is already \n     deterring job growth today at the expense of tomorrow's \n     economy.\n       NRF commends you for introducing this legislation. We note \n     with appreciation that your bill was introduced with 26 \n     original cosponsors. We strongly support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Once again I thank my colleague from Tennessee, and I am \nhoping that others will hear our call for support and join us in these \ntwo crucial efforts to protect individual freedom and to maintain our \nsystem of free enterprise which has built this country and made it the \nbest in the world.\n  So I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                         Correcting the Record\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see the Senator from Maryland is \nwaiting, and I wonder, if we are through with our colloquy, if the \nSenator would allow me 2 or 3 minutes to correct a mistake I made on \nthe floor of the Senate last week.\n  Confessing error: I came to the floor following the vote on the Hagel \nnomination to point out the difference between a vote against a \npremature motion to cut off debate--which I thought the majority leader \nmade--and an effort to kill a nomination with a filibuster, which are \ntwo different things. I pointed out--correctly--that in the history of \nthe Senate, we have never denied to a district judge nominee his or her \nseat because of a failed cloture vote, and I don't believe we should. I \npointed out we have never denied a Cabinet nominee his or her seat \nbecause of a filibuster, with the possible exception of John Bolton, \nwhom the Democrats filibustered. Some Presidents count that nomination \nto the U.N. in their Cabinet and some don't.\n  I then went on to say--incorrectly--that on appellate judges, the \nDemocratic majority had filibustered and killed 10 of President Bush's \nnominations, and Republicans had in response denied two appellate judge \nseats by filibuster. Senator Schumer of New York--ever wary of what I \nmight say--corrected me and said it was less than that. So I have \nconsulted with him and his staff, and the score is actually 5 to 2.\n  The correct result is that before George W. Bush became President--\nand the Senator from Utah knows this story very well--there were no \ninstances of an appellate Federal judge being denied his or her seat \nbecause of a filibuster. Then our friends on the Democratic side \ninvented the idea of filibustering circuit judges and voted against a \nwhole series of President Bush's nominees just as I came to the Senate: \nMiguel Estrada, Charles Pickering, William Pryor, Priscilla Owen, \nCarolyn Kuhl, Janice Brown, and then four more in 2004: William Myers, \nDavid McKeague, Henry Saad, and Richard Griffin.\n  But then we had a cooling of tempers and a coming to our senses and a \nbipartisan Gang of 14 said we don't want to make this a new precedent, \nand we agreed--there was a consensus, anyway--that only in a case of \nextraordinary circumstance would there be a denial of a nominee of an \nappellate judge by a cloture vote. So then 5 of those 10 Bush nominees \nwere approved.\n  So the Schumer staff and my staff agreed with this--and if anybody \nthinks it is wrong, I would like to know--that only in five cases have \nDemocrats denied a Republican President an appellate judge nominee by \nfilibuster and only in two cases have Republicans denied a Democratic \nPresident's nominee by filibuster in the case of appellate judges. As I \nsaid when I began, the answer is never in the case of district judges \nand never in the case of Cabinet members, with the possible exception \nof John Bolton.\n  I am glad to come to the floor and correct the record. I thank \nSenator Schumer for his diligence in noting my error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we return to \nthe Halligan nomination.\n  I also ask further unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nfollowing the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am taking this time on the floor to \nspeak in support of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to be U.S. \nCircuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  I think my comments are at the right time, following Senator \nAlexander's comments about the difficulty we have had in the past \nconfirming judicial nominees and the use of the filibuster that blocked \nthe consideration of Presidential nominees.\n  Senator Alexander pointed with pride to an accommodation that was \nreached a few years ago, before I got to the Senate, that the \nfilibuster would only be used in ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  Ms. Halligan was first nominated by President Obama in September \n2010, after that accommodation had been reached. I am disappointed that \nher nomination was filibustered, nearly on a party-line vote, in \nDecember of 2011. I urge my colleagues to allow an up-or-down vote on \nMs. Halligan's nomination.\n  I would challenge my colleagues who oppose an up-or-down vote to come \nto the floor and explain the extraordinary circumstances that would \nprevent an up-or-down vote on Ms. Halligan's nomination. She is \nextremely well qualified for this position, and I will support her \nnomination.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination last \nmonth. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Ms. Halligan ``well qualified'' to serve on \nthe DC Circuit--the highest rating from its nonpartisan peer review.\n  Ms. Halligan received her A.B. from Princeton University and her J.D. \nfrom Georgetown University Law School. After law school, she clerked \nfor Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and for Judge Patricia Wald on \nthe DC Circuit, the court to which she has now been nominated.\n  After working in private practice, Ms. Halligan joined the New York \nState attorney general's office. She began working in the office as the \nfirst chief of the office's Internet Bureau, where she worked to \nprotect consumers against Internet fraud and safeguard online privacy. \nShe was ultimately promoted to the position of solicitor general, a \nposition she held for 6 years. The solicitor general is basically the \ntop attorney for the State of New York.\n  In that capacity she managed a staff of nearly 50 appellate attorneys \nlitigating in State and Federal appellate courts. Her responsibility \nincluded handling cases of public corruption and judicial misconduct.\n  She then became a leading appellate lawyer in private practice at a \nnational law firm, serving as counsel of record for a party or amicus \ncuriae in nearly 50 matters before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  She is well qualified for the position to which President Obama has \nnominated her.\n  She is currently general counsel at the New York County district \nattorney's office, an office that investigates and prosecutes 100,000 \ncriminal cases annually in Manhattan. In her current position, she is \nfocused on reducing crime, protecting victims of domestic\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nand sexual violence, and reviewing so-called cold cases that remain \nunsolved.\n  Most of Ms. Halligan's career has been dedicated to public service \nand law enforcement. She has also made time over the years to devote \nsubstantial time to pro bono work, including representing the evacuees \nfrom Hurricanes Katrina and Rita who were in danger of losing their \nrental assistance benefits.\n  She has also served as pro bono counsel to the Board of Lower \nManhattan Development Corporation, the entity that is overseeing the \nrebuilding of Lower Manhattan following the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n\n  She has her priorities straight. She is an outstanding attorney. She \nhas used a lot of her time to help people less fortunate receive free \nlegal services as a result of her participation.\n  Ms. Halligan has received widespread support from law enforcement and \nlegal professionals across the political spectrum which I understand \nwill be made part of the Record, so I will not repeat those statements \nnow.\n  I have heard only two substantial reasons in opposition to her \nnomination. Let's review those two points that have been raised to see \nwhether they are extreme circumstances that warrant a vote to support a \nfilibuster. Last time we had over 40 Senators who supported the \nfilibuster basically blocking an up-or-down vote. We had an \naccommodation that would only be used for extraordinary circumstances. \nLet's take a look at the two cases that have been made about why those \nextraordinary circumstances may exist--and, I will submit, they do not \nexist.\n  One argument is that Ms. Halligan is a liberal advocate who cannot \nset aside her personal views on issues, including the second amendment. \nThe other argument is that the D.C. Circuit has too low a caseload to \njustify additional judges.\n  Ms. Halligan was questioned about her views on the second amendment \nissues during her Senate Judicial Committee hearing. She testified, \nboth at her hearing and in response to written questions, that she \nwould faithfully follow and apply the Supreme Court precedent from the \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, which held the \nsecond amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for \nself-defense.\n  When asked by Senator Grassley whether the rights conferred under the \nsecond amendment are fundamental, Ms. Halligan answered: ``That is \nclearly what the Supreme Court held and I will follow that precedent, \nSenator.''\n  Some have also criticized her for her position she advocated while \nsolicitor general for the State of New York. In her confirmation \nhearing, she made it clear she filed these briefs at the direction of \nthe New York attorney general--arguing on behalf of New York State, not \nher own views. It was her responsibility as solicitor general to \nrepresent her client, the State of New York.\n  Of course, she has worked on controversial issues before the State of \nNew York, such as affirmative action, the death penalty, and same-sex \nmarriage. As New York solicitor general, she argued in support of \naffirmative action and in defense of the constitutionality of the death \npenalty because that is what her client's position was and she \nrepresented her client. That is what she is supposed to do. That is \nwhat a lawyer does, represent her client as best as she can, and she \ndid that well on behalf of her client, the State of New York.\n  But I will remind my colleagues what Chief Justice Roberts said \nduring his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in terms of attributing \nthe views of a client to an attorney. Chief Justice Roberts testified \nthat:\n\n       It's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back before \n     the founding of the country that lawyers are not identified \n     with the positions of their clients.\n\n  We should apply the same standard when considering Ms. Halligan's \nnomination, as our legal system requires vigorous advocacy by both \nsides of a dispute.\n  I quote Chief Justice Roberts here in part because Ms. Halligan, \nquite remarkably, has been nominated in 2013 to fill Chief Justice \nRoberts' former seat in the D.C. Circuit, which became vacant in 2005.\n  This brings me to the second argument that has been used. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider whether this is an extraordinary circumstance \nthat justifies a vote in support of a filibuster.\n  The second argument is that this court has a low caseload, which is \njust not the case. Chief Justice Roberts was elevated from the D.C. \nCircuit to the Supreme Court in 2005. His seat has been vacant for 8 \nyears, one of the longest circuit vacancies in the country. The D.C. \nCircuit has four vacancies on the 11-member court. That is one-third of \nthe court that is currently unfilled.\n  Ms. Halligan has been nominated by the President for the seat \nformerly held by Chief Justice Roberts, so, of course, the Senate \nshould act as quickly as possible to fill this seat.\n  The D.C. Circuit is often referred to as the second most important \ncourt in the land due to the complexity and importance of its caseload. \nThe court regularly reviews highly technical decisions and rulemaking \nof Federal agencies that are based in Washington, often without a lower \ncourt decision of a Federal district court.\n  The D.C. Circuit proclaims the final law of the land for many \nenvironmental, health, labor, financial, civil rights, and terrorist \ncases. The Supreme Court only accepts a handful of cases each year, so \nthe D.C. Circuit is often the last word in these cases.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Court, the \ncaseload per active judge in the D.C. Circuit has increased 50 percent \nsince 2005, when this vacancy was created. It was also the year the \nSenate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th seat on the \ncourt. Let me repeat that. We in 2005 confirmed President Bush's 11th \nseat of the 12-seat court. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n  To remind my colleagues, the Senate confirmed President Bush's \nnominees for the 9th, 10th, and 11th seats on the D.C. Circuit. Ms. \nHalligan is President Obama's first nominee to the District Circuit to \nfill the eighth seat. The Senate confirmed four of President Bush's \nnominations to the D.C. Circuit, twice filling the 10th seat and once \nfilling the 11th seat.\n  So there is no extraordinary circumstance that exists. Let's be clear \nabout that. A vote against moving forward is filibustering a judicial \nnominee in an effort to kill the nominee and not allow an up-or-down \nvote. There are no extraordinary circumstances that would justify the \ndelay and not allowing us to have an up-or-down vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for us proceeding and not using the \nfilibuster; to adhere to the agreement that was reached. Again, it was \nbefore I got to the Senate. It was the right agreement, that there \nshould truly be an extraordinary circumstance that prevents an up-or-\ndown vote on a judge. It does not exist in this case. President Obama's \nnominee is well qualified. The court is in desperate need of additional \njudges, being four seats short today, only two-thirds of the bench \nhaving been appointed and confirmed to date. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of proceeding and then, after we have the nominee before \nus, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the confirmation. I \nthink Ms. Halligan will make an outstanding member of the D.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we have before us one of the most \nactivist judicial nominees we have seen in years.\n  Rather than choose a more consensus nominee, President Obama has \nchosen to again provoke a political confrontation.\n  This is unnecessary, divisive, and not in the best interests of \neither the judicial selection process or the judiciary.\n  The Constitution gives the power to appoint judges to the President, \nnot to the Senate. I believe, therefore, that the Senate owes the \nPresident some deference with respect to nominees who are qualified by \nboth legal experience and, more importantly, judicial philosophy.\n  A nominee whose record shows that she has an activist judicial \nphilosophy is simply not qualified to sit on the Federal bench, and the \nSenate owes the President no deference under those circumstances.\n  That is the kind of nominee we have before us today.\n  Nothing has changed since a cloture motion failed on this nominee in \nDecember 2011.\n  Well, that might not be quite true.\n  One thing that has changed is that the need to fill another vacancy \non the\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\nD.C. Circuit is even less today than it was then.\n  Year after year, case filings decrease for the D.C. Circuit while \nthey increase for the rest of the judiciary.\n  Year after year, the D.C. Circuit ranks last among the 12 \ngeographical circuits in the number of appeals filed per three-judge \npanel.\n  The court has even cancelled argument days because of an insufficient \ndocket.\n  And I would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the \nD.C. Circuit's caseload today is lower than when they used this \nargument to block President Bush's nominees to this court--which they \ndid.\n  Looking at the nominee herself, Caitlin Halligan was a member of the \nNew York City Bar's Committee on Federal Courts and signed its March \n2004 report titled ``The Indefinite Detention of `Enemy Combatants': \nBalancing Due Process and National Security in the Context of the War \non Terror.''\n  Based on policy rather than legal grounds, it makes left-wing \narguments that courts and even the Obama administration itself have \nrepudiated.\n  Although she tried to distance herself from the report's left-wing \npositions at her confirmation hearing, Halligan signed rather than \nabstained from the report, as four other committee members had done, \nand never repudiated it before her hearing.\n  If she were a Republican nominee, my friends on the Democratic side \nwould call this a confirmation conversion.\n  Her report argued that the Authorization for the Use of Military \nForce, or AUMF, does not authorize indefinite detention of enemy \ncombatants.\n  The Supreme Court rejected this in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. The Obama \nadministration has sought, and the D.C. Circuit has adopted, a broad \nconstruction of the AUMF.\n  Halligan's report argued that alien terrorists should be tried in \nArticle III courts, with full constitutional protections, rather than \nin military commissions.\n  On March 7, 2011, President Obama signed an executive order re-\nestablishing military commissions for enemy combatants held at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  But Halligan's extreme record on these important issues goes beyond \nthat report.\n  She also authored a legal brief in 2009 arguing that the AUMF does \nnot authorize the seizure and long-term military detention of lawful \npermanent resident aliens.\n  This position again disregarded the Supreme Court's holding in Hamdi \nv. Rumsfeld and appears even to conflict with the Obama \nadministration's justification of assassinating American citizen Anwar \nal-Awlaki.\n  She just won't take no for an answer when pushing such extreme views, \nnot even from the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court itself.\n  That is the classic definition of judicial activism, trying to use \nthe courts to advance a political agenda no matter what the law is.\n  As Solicitor General of New York, Halligan aggressively sought to \nhold gun manufacturers liable for criminal acts committed with \nhandguns.\n  In one speech, she said that the Federal Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act ``would nullify lawsuits. . . including one \nbrought by my office. . . that might reduce gun crime or promote \ngreater responsibility among gun dealers.''\n  The Senate voted overwhelmingly for this legislation in July 2005.\n  Once again, Halligan turned to the courts to push her personal \npolitical views, filing a legal brief challenging the law's \nconstitutionality.\n  In New York v. Sturm & Ruger, she argued that gun manufacturers \nmaintain a ``public nuisance'' of illegally possessed handguns.\n  The New York Court of Appeals rejected Halligan's activist approach, \nconcluding that ``the Legislative and Executive branches are better \nsuited to address the societal problems concerning the already heavily \nregulated commercial activity at issue.''\n  Attempting to address social problems in the judicial rather than the \nlegislative branch is a hallmark of judicial activism.\n  Finally, other legal briefs she has filed similarly demonstrate \nextreme views that the Supreme Court has rejected.\n  In Scheidler v. NOW, Halligan argued that pro-life protesters should \nbe prosecuted under the Federal racketeering statute because they \nsomehow engage in extortion.\n  The Supreme Court voted 8-1 to reject that position.\n  And in Hoffman Plastics Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, the Supreme Court \nrejected Halligan's position that the NLRB can grant backpay to illegal \naliens.\n  As I said, the Senate owes the President some deference with regard \nto his nominees who are qualified by their legal experience and, more \nimportantly, their judicial philosophy.\n  Republicans have consistently cooperated with the President and will \ncontinue to do so. But when a nominee's record clearly shows that she \nhas a politicized view of the courts, I for one have to say no.\n  The political ends do not justify the judicial means.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, last week the U.S. State Department \nissued its new environmental review for the Keystone XL Pipeline. This \nis the fourth environmental review in nearly 5 years of study. \nUnsurprisingly, it said the same thing as all the other reports have \nsaid.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will have no significant impact on the \nenvironment. Again, the Keystone XL Pipeline will have no significant \nimpact on the environment.\n  Ironically, the report indicates that there will be more emissions if \nyou do not build the pipeline than if you do build the pipeline. So \nlet's go through that for a minute. The Keystone XL Pipeline project is \nperhaps the most thoroughly studied and long-delayed project of its \nkind in U.S. history. The State Department's favorable finding in this, \nits most recent report, underscores both the good environmental \nstewardship of this project and the need to begin construction without \nfurther delay. But the State Department now indicates it will hold a \n45-day comment period and an as-yet-undetermined period of time before \nit will issue a final environmental impact statement. Then it will \nconduct an interagency comment period to make its national interest \ndetermination.\n  So while we welcome the finding of no significant impact, for the \nfourth time now, we have yet another indeterminate delay which runs \ncounter to both public opinion and reasonable due diligence. After four \nenvironmental reviews and favorable results, the President needs to \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline project without delay because there \nremains no excuse not to do it.\n  The argument has been advanced that the oil sands will increase \ncarbon emissions and that failing to build the Keystone XL Pipeline \nwill somehow reduce emissions. But the most recent State Department \nreport makes clear that this contention is false. The report actually \nindicates just the opposite, that if the pipeline is not built from \nAlberta, Canada to the United States, the oil will still move to market \nbut it will move to China from Canada's west coast. To get the product \nto China, the oil will be shipped in tankers across the Pacific Ocean \nto be refined in overseas facilities with weaker environmental \nstandards and more emissions than facilities in the United States. The \nUnited States, moreover, will continue to import oil from the Middle \nEast--again on tankers. Factor in the cost of trucking and railing the \nproduct to market over land and the results--contrary to the claims of \nits opponents--will be more emissions and a less secure distribution \nsystem than if in fact we build the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  Let's look at it. This is a commonsense argument. The report \nindicates less emissions if we build the project. Yet it is being held \nup by extreme activists on the basis that if we build the pipeline, \nsomehow we get more emissions. That is just not the case.\n  With the pipeline from up in the Edmonton-Hardisty-Alberta, Canada \nregion, the pipeline brings oil down right\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\nin the North Dakota-Montana area where it picks up 100,000 barrels a \nday from the Bakken. The oil then goes to refineries in Illinois and \nOklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. We have domestic oil, from our country, \noil from our closest friend and ally, Canada, that we are using here in \nour refineries for our customers: more energy, more jobs, more economic \nactivity so we get economic growth, we get revenue to reduce the debt \nand the deficit without raising taxes, and it is a national security \nissue. Instead of having tankers coming from the Middle East bringing \nheavy crude in some cases which in fact has higher emissions than the \nCanadian oil, we rely on oil from our country and Canada. We get what \nAmericans want; that is, no longer depending on the Middle East for \noil.\n  If we do not build the pipeline, the oil is still produced. This oil \nwill be produced, but it will not come to the United States. It is \ngoing--where? It is going to China. And it is going to be sent on \ntankers over to China so you have not only the emissions of those \ntankers but it is going to be refined in Chinese refineries which have \nworse environmental standards than we do, and we continue to bring in \noil from the Middle East. That makes no sense and that is why 70 \npercent of the American people approve the project. Only 17 percent \nhave indicated opposition.\n  This is about President Obama making a decision for the American \npeople rather than for special-interest groups. In my home State of \nNorth Dakota, as I say, we will put 100,000 barrels a day of light \nsweet Bakken crude into that pipeline. That takes 500 trucks a day off \nour roads. That is a safety issue. That is an issue for our roads in \nwestern North Dakota.\n  To recount briefly, this is a $7 billion high-tech pipeline project \nthat will bring 830,000 barrels of oil today from Alberta, Canada to \nrefineries in Oklahoma and the Texas gulf coast, as I said, including \n100,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude from the Bakken oil fields \nin North Dakota and Montana.\n  As the most recent State Department report confirms, it will create \ntens of thousands of jobs during the construction phase, boost the \nAmerican economy, raise much needed revenue for State and local \ngovernments at a time when they very much need it, and do it without \nraising taxes. Perhaps most importantly, it will put our country within \nstriking range of a long-sought goal, and that is true energy security.\n  For the first time in generations, the United States--along with its \nclosest friend and ally Canada--has the capacity to produce more energy \nthan we use, as well as eliminate our reliance on the Middle East and \nother volatile parts of the world such as Venezuela.\n  Even after an exhaustive review process, the consent of every State \nalong its route, the backing of a majority of Congress, and the \noverwhelming support of the American people, the Keystone XL Pipeline \nproject continues to languish at the hands of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  We again ask, as we have before, that President Obama and Secretary \nof State Kerry provide us with an actual timeline and some certainty as \nto when this long-delayed project will finally get approved.\n  The Keystone XL project will provide tens of thousands of jobs and \nhundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to help us reduce our debt \nand deficit, and it will do it with good environmental stewardship.\n  With 70 percent of the American people in support of the Keystone XL \nPipeline and 12 million Americans still out of work, there is no \nreasonable excuse to delay this project any longer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, the Founders of our country, committed to \njustice and fairness for all its citizens and in establishing a \nstructure that would make this country uniquely strong as a democracy, \ngave us three coequal branches of our government. Two of those branches \nhave dominated the national news recently as we lurch from crisis to \ncrisis, from fiscal cliff to sequester. The back-and-forth between the \nPresident and Congress, between the executive and the legislative \nbranches, has been the headline day after day.\n  Meanwhile, the third coequal branch, the judicial branch of our \nFederal Government, has quietly gone about its business, doing its job \nfor the American people, providing fair hearings, equal justice under \nthe law, the basic right to a speedy resolution to any dispute--or has \nit?\n  All around this country members of the judicial branch are getting \ntheir jobs done but with fewer and fewer resources and support, fewer \ncolleagues on the bench than ever before. Nearly 10 percent of all \nFederal judgeships--positions for Federal judges that should be \nfilled--are vacant, empty, leaving those judges who are on the bench \noverwhelmed with steadily increasing caseloads and unable to provide \nthe level of service, certainty, and swift resolution that the American \npeople deserve and upon which our government was predicated.\n  Particularly when you are the one going into court seeking redress or \nwhen you are the one facing legal action, justice delayed is justice \ndenied. As a member of the Delaware bar and a former Federal court \nclerk myself, as well as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nhave seen firsthand the consequences of this ongoing, slow-rolling \ncrisis in our Federal courts.\n  Right now we have more than double the judicial vacancies we had at \nthe same point in the last administration. The Senate has confirmed 30 \nfewer of President Obama's nominees than it had of President Bush's at \nthis same time.\n  One of the most underresourced circuits is right here under our nose \nin Washington, DC. The DC Circuit is often called the second most \nimportant court in the land. Although it may not make the headlines, it \nmay not be as visible to the American people as this ongoing fight \nbetween the Congress and the President, the DC Circuit decides issues \nof national importance, from terrorism and detention to the scope of \nagency power. It has importance to every American, not just the ones \nwho happen to live in the District of Columbia, and yet its bench is \nalmost half empty.\n  Congress has set the number of judgeships needed by the DC Circuit \nCourt at 11, and right now they have just 7. President Bush had the \nopportunity to appoint four judges to the DC Circuit, including the \n10th judicial position twice and the 11th judicial position once. Yet \nPresident Obama has been denied the opportunity to make even a single \nappointment to the DC\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nCircuit Court despite four vacancies. As a result, the per-judge \ncaseload is today 50 percent higher than it was after President Bush \nhad the opportunity to fill that last, the 11th seat. And in terms of \nour obligation to this coequal branch, our obligation to the citizens \nof the United States, and our obligation to provide an opportunity for \njustice, that is an outrage.\n  Today the Senate has the opportunity to take up and consider a highly \nqualified nominee to fill one of these vacancies, to start to do our \njob and bring this vital circuit court closer to full capacity. We can \ndo that by confirming the nomination of a brilliant lawyer and a \ndedicated public servant named Caitlin Halligan.\n  Ms. Halligan, with whom I have met, has been nominated to the DC \nCircuit Court and renominated to the DC Circuit Court and renominated \nto the DC Circuit Court across three sessions of Congress--the 111th, \n112th, and 113th. She has been nominated because of her superb \nqualifications and her impressive personal background.\n  She worked in private practice at a respected New York law firm. She \nserved in public service as solicitor general for the State of New \nYork. She is currently the general counsel of the New York County \nDistrict Attorney's Office--an office that investigates and prosecutes \n100,000 criminal cases every year.\n  Ms. Halligan has earned the support of her colleagues in law \nenforcement and across the spectrum. Everyone, from New York City \npolice commissioner Raymond Kelly to preeminent conservative lawyer \nMiguel Estrada, has supported her nomination. The American Bar \nAssociation's standing committee unanimously gave her its ranking of \nhighest qualification to serve: ``highly qualified.'' Yet Ms. Halligan \nhas had to face, in my view, outrageous distortions of her record that \ncause one to wonder if any nominee to this circuit would be acceptable \non their merits.\n  Ms. Halligan has withstood steady and withering political attacks on \npositions she advocated while solicitor general for the State of New \nYork, positions she argued on behalf of her client--New York State and \nits attorney general--not positions that represented her own personal \nviews. If you reflect on this, it is, as all practicing attorneys know, \ninappropriate to disqualify a judicial candidate because she advocated \na position for a client with which a certain Senator might disagree or \nwhich has been rejected by a court. This fundamental principle that you \ndo not associate an attorney with a position advocated in court has \nbeen widely shared, widely supported, and, in fact, Chief Justice \nRoberts himself said:\n\n       It's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back before \n     the founding of the country that lawyers are not identified \n     with the positions of their clients.\n\n  Even so, Ms. Halligan's positions on issues such as, for example, \nmarriage and States rights have hardly been radical. When asked to \nanalyze New York's marriage law, she concluded that the State statute \ndid not provide same-sex couples with the right to marry. When \npresented with the question of whether a ban on same-sex marriage was \nlegal under the New York Constitution, she merely said that there were \narguments for and against and that it should be left to the courts to \ndecide. What could be more modest than deciding that a constitutional \nquestion should be decided by the courts and not the executive branch? \nYet I have heard on this floor and elsewhere her positions on this and \nother issues mischaracterized as extreme, as out of the mainstream. In \nmy view, this position demonstrates her great respect for our judicial \nprocess and proves that if this body confirms her to the bench, she \nwould fairly and faithfully apply precedent in making important \ndecisions on the DC Circuit.\n\n  She told us directly on the Judiciary Committee that she would \nrespect and apply precedent in other important cases--cases that touch \non the second amendment, such as the District of Columbia v. Heller and \nMcDonald v. Chicago, cases that held that the second amendment protects \nan individual's right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. I am \nconfident, despite what we have heard spun in the press about Ms. \nHalligan's position, that she would faithfully respect precedent in \nthese cases.\n  So in these two areas, I think we can see that Caitlin Halligan is \nnot a radical or an ideologue. She is an attorney, she is a lawyer--and \na good one. In my view, having reviewed her qualifications, having sat \nthrough meetings, and having looked at her record, she has earned her \nnomination to the DC Circuit Court. She deserves this Senate to get out \nof the way and to stop this endless delay of consideration of qualified \ncandidates for the bench and let her get to work.\n  Today the Senate has an opportunity, a chance to do the right thing, \nto stop endless partisan political games, to break through our gridlock \nand get something done in the interest of the American people and \nespecially those who seek swift and sure justice.\n  Every individual and business in this country has the fundamental \nright to a fair and fast trial, to access to the judicial system, and \nto the hearing of their appeals in an appropriate and timely manner. \nAnd judicial vacancies and understaffed courts at the district and the \ncircuit level are denying them that right. This Senate and its \ndysfunction are denying them that right. So today I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to do our job, to confirm Caitlin Halligan \nand recommit ourselves to moving forward in a productive and bipartisan \nway.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague from \nDelaware not only for his typically excellent remarks today but also \nfor his vigilance on these issues. He is a relatively newer member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, but he has jumped into these issues with \ntremendous eagerness, intelligence, balance, and effectiveness. So I \nthank him for his great remarks.\n  I too rise today in enthusiastic support of the nominee to the Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit, Caitlin Halligan. Ms. Halligan has been \nwaiting 23 months for an up-or-down vote. More importantly, the entire \ncountry has been waiting to fill this position--a judgeship on the \nsecond most important court of the Nation--for 23 months.\n  The question we are going to answer tomorrow is, Can we take some of \nour bipartisan good will, our desire to legislate and get things done \nfor the country, and apply it to a nominee who is the very picture of \nmoderation and mainstream legal thinking, a nominee who has dedicated \nher entire career to public service, and a nominee who would be only \nthe sixth woman to join this court in its 212-year history? That is \nright--there have only been five women to serve on the DC Circuit in \n212 years.\n  The D.C. Circuit is currently one-third vacant. Four of its 11 \nslots--37 percent--are without active judges. Ms. Halligan is one of \nthe two nominees for these four slots.\n  Two years ago, when Halligan was first filibustered, many of my \ncolleagues decided they could not support a cloture motion because she \nwould have been the tenth judge on an 11-member court, a court they \nperceived as understaffed and overworked. I take issue with the \nfundamental premise. The D.C. Circuit hears many of the most complex \nand important cases in the country. The court hears appeals from \nvirtually every regulatory agency, reviews statutes, has jurisdiction \nover numerous terrorism cases, including those from Guantanamo Bay. But \neven if I were to accept the faulty premise that the court somehow \nneeds fewer judges than it ever had, the court that hears the most \ncomplex cases, the court is now near a crisis point. There are only \nseven active judges currently sitting. What is more, the caseload per \njudge has risen by 21 percent--21 percent since the last judge was \nconfirmed, and that was under President Bush's administration.\n  I think there is now more than compelling evidence that the caseload-\nbased argument against Halligan is gone, and you would have thought our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\nwould say: OK, four vacancies, the last vacancy filled under Bush, we \ncan now move to support her. But they do not.\n  What else could possibly prevent a vote on Halligan? Is it her \nideology? I submit to my colleagues it cannot possibly be her ideology. \nIf zero is extremely liberal and 10 is extremely conservative, Halligan \nfalls right in the sweet spot of judges who both President Obama and \nPresident Clinton have generally nominated, 5s and 4s, maybe even a 6 \nor two. Opposing Halligan on her ideology, opposing even a cloture vote \nbased on her ideology, can mean only one of two things:\n  First, that some of my colleagues have misread her record. Let me \nclear up a few things today. Halligan is not anti-gun nor anti-second \namendment. She has clearly said at her hearing she fully supports the \nindividual second amendment right to bear arms as the Supreme Court \ndecided in Heller. Her briefs for the State of New York--which were \nproduct liability cases, not second amendment cases--were briefs for a \nclient and not her own views, just as Chief Justice Roberts described \nhis work for clients. In fact, Hallligan, like many of my colleagues, \nenjoys shooting and does so from time to time on weekends. Anyone who \naccepted a meeting with her would have discovered this.\n  Halligan is not anti-law enforcement in any way. She spent most of \nher career in law enforcement. New York Police Department Commissioner \nRay Kelly, hardly a shrinking violet, hardly a wallflower--he is a \ntough-on-crime guy; that is why I like him so much, and he is one of \nthe most respected law chiefs in the country--has written a letter in \nfull support of her.\n  Specifically, Halligan has lived with the consequences of terrorism. \nShe lives not far from the World Trade Center site, and she represented \nthe Redevelopment Corporation there in its post-9/11 efforts. She has \npersonally handled terrorism cases in the New York Manhattan office. In \nher hearing she stated her beliefs regarding the executive's power to \ndetain terrorism suspects.\n  I have heard evasive nominees. She was not evasive. She gave \ncompletely clear answers to every single question that was asked.\n  The second possible reason my colleagues might decide to oppose \ncloture for such a reasonable candidate and such a gifted lawyer is \nthat they want to put their own judges on the D.C. Circuit and they \nwould rather leave it vacant than move Halligan. In other words, it is \nnot that Halligan is extreme--unacceptably extreme in her views; it is \nsimply that she doesn't share all their views. It is one thing to fight \nagainst certain judicial nominees with the sincere belief that they are \noutside the judicial mainstream. It is another for my colleagues to \nfight against a nominee because they disagree with him or her.\n  I always look for judges, when I nominate them, who are moderate. I \ndon't like judges too far right. That is obvious. But I equally do not \nlike judges too far left. My judicial panel will tell you, if I think a \njudge is too far left I will not nominate them, because judges at the \nextremes, whichever extreme, tend to want to make law, not interpret \nlaw. The best judges are those who see things clearly and fairly, not \nthrough an ideological lens, whether that lens is colored red or blue. \nThose are judges who understand the law, understand the role of each \nbranch of government, understand the proper balance between State and \nFederal power, and understand the people who come before the bench.\n  I say one other thing to my colleagues. I just finished working with \na bunch, four of us on each side, on coming up with a compromise so we \ncould work together better. I want to let my colleagues know--I have \ndone it personally with a few--that this vote, the desire to actually \nfilibuster Caitlin Halligan, is causing a lot of consternation on our \nside. Clearly, this is a judge who deserves an up-or-down vote. One of \nthe reasons that many of my colleagues--myself included--thought we \nought to change the rules was because a judge such as Caitlin Halligan, \na nominee such as Caitlin Halligan, should not be filibustered. I have \nrespect for my friends on the other side of the aisle, but when they \nsay--one of my colleagues I heard say this morning--that this one brief \nshe signed with a bunch of others was extraordinary circumstances, that \ndid not ring true. If that is extraordinary circumstances, wearing the \nwrong color tie or the wrong color blouse would be extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  She has a long record. They can hardly find anything. They come up \nwith this one brief. They may not like it. But to say it is \nextraordinary circumstances? No.\n  I say to my colleagues, I plead with them--we are trying to start off \non a good foot here. We are working together better than we have worked \nin a long time. Each side has to give. Part of the deal is amendments. \nThey are going to get a lot of amendments on the other side of the \naisle. But part of our deal is not to block things for the sake of \nblocking them or because there is another agenda. That goes not just \nfor blocking legislation but for blocking nominees.\n  It is true in the deal we made, the agreement we made, it was only \nfor district court judges. That could go seriatim. But the spirit of \nour compromise applies to this court of appeals nominee, and I have not \nheard a single good reason why she should be filibustered.\n  People disagree with her. I voted against some of George Bush's \nnominees because I thought their views were not quite mine, even if \nthey were not extreme. And everyone on the other side of the aisle has \nthe right to do the same. But not filibuster.\n  This court is a very important court. We know it makes lots of \ndecisions about government. But that does not give license to block a \nnominee on what seem to be trivial grounds, inconsequential grounds, \ngiven her long career.\n  So again I urge, plead with my colleagues, please reconsider this \ncloture vote. Please give her the 60 votes she needs so she can come to \nthe floor and get the up-or-down vote she has waited 23 months for. It \nviolates fairness. It violates the comity we are trying to restore in \nthis body. It violates simple justice to vote no on cloture and to \nfilibuster Caitlin Halligan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for allowing me to \ngo for 3 minutes here before he has the next turn. I appreciate that.\n  I come to the floor as some of our colleagues have done already, and \nwe just heard from the great Senator from New York, to discuss the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit Court. Caitlin \nHalligan is currently the General Counsel at the New York County \nDistrict Attorney's Office. New York County is just another name for \nManhattan, so we are talking about a big county and a big office. In \nfact, it handles about 100,000 criminal cases each year.\n  Before that, she was Solicitor General of the State of New York for 6 \nyears and the head of the appellate practice at a major law firm. She \nalso clerked on both the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court and \nhas argued five cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. That is a \nresume.\n  The nonpartisan American Bar Association committee that reviews every \nFederal judicial nominee gave Halligan its highest possible rating, and \nover 100 women law professors and deans wrote a letter saying Halligan \nis exceptionally qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit. There is no \nquestion that she has the experience, ability, and intellect to sit on \nthe Federal bench.\n  It is also important to recognize that she is not an ideological or \npartisan nominee. Well-known lawyer Carter Phillips, who was assistant \nto the Solicitor General in the Reagan administration, has said that \nHalligan is ``one of those extremely smart, thoughtful, measured and \neffective advocates'' and that she would be a ``first-rate judge.''\n  Phillips is not the only conservative lawyer to endorse Halligan. For \nexample, Miguel Estrada signed a letter from 21 prominent attorneys \nwhich stated that Halligan ``brings reason, insight and judgment to all \nmatters'' and ``would serve with distinction and fairness.''\n  Given support like that from people such as Miguel Estrada, I don't \nthink it can be said that Halligan is an extreme ideologue or that she \nis outside the mainstream of legal thought. Her nomination should not \nand cannot be blocked.\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\n  This is a great candidate who will make a great judge. As New York \nCity Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said about her, she ``possesses the \nthree qualities important for a nominee: Intelligence, a judicial \ntemperament and personal integrity.''\n  She must be confirmed without delay. Filibusters are about debating \nissues. This is an individual. We cannot amend her. We simply have to \ndecide whether she is qualified to be on the bench. There is absolutely \nno doubt. People may not agree with every single thing she said. I \ndon't think anyone in this Chamber agrees with every single thing that \njudges have said or that people we put on the Supreme Court have said, \nbut we simply came together and stood up for one principle, that our \njob is to decide if someone is qualified, if they can do the job, if \nthey can interpret the law. This candidate can do it and she can do it \nwell. If Senators ultimately wish to oppose her nomination, fine, that \nis their choice. But they should not filibuster an extremely qualified \ncandidate. Let her have an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for leave to engage \nin a colloquy with Senator Barrasso for a period of time not to exceed \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the President of the United States has spent \nthe last few weeks campaigning around our great country at taxpayer \nexpense, telling Americans about what he characterizes as the \ncatastrophic impact of the sequester. He said, for example, that the \nsequester will visit hardship on a whole lot of people. He said it will \njeopardize our military readiness, it will eviscerate job-creating \ninvestments in education and energy and medical research. He said the \nability of emergency responders to help communities respond to and \nrecover from disasters will be disregarded. Border Patrol agents will \nsee their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. He said Federal \nprosecutors will have to close cases and simply let criminals go. Air \ntraffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, which means \nmore delays at airports across the country. He said thousands of \nteachers and educators will be laid off and that tens of thousands of \nparents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids. And he \nalso continued: Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to \nprimary care and preventive care such as flu vaccinations and cancer \nscreenings.\n  Today we see the predictions of doom and gloom have not come to pass. \nWe have seen that many of these statements have been severely \nexaggerated, if not disproven. People in my home State of Utah have \nfound the effects of the sequester to be not quite what the President \npredicted. One of our local Utah news stations reported that ``there \nwere no signs of sequester pain'' at the airports. When asked about \nsequestration, one Utahn responded: ``If they can't handle a 2 percent \nreduction in spending then I guess we need to get better and \nbrighter,'' meaning we need to get better and brighter people running \nour government.\n  Other press reports indicate the administration's doomsday claims \nhave misled the public. The Washington Post reported that the Education \nSecretary's claims about teacher layoffs turned out simply not to be \ntrue. And Politico recently published a story showing the President's \nclaims about some capital staff getting pay cuts to be false.\n  I ask Senator Barrasso, after all these scare tactics over the last 2 \nweeks, does the President have a credibility problem with the American \npeople when it comes to the sequester?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I believe my friend from Utah is absolutely correct. \nThere is a creditability gap here. These modest cuts should prompt \nWashington to take a closer look at how we spend taxpayers' money. I \nsaw today that the White House is now--they claim because of the \nsequester--canceling White House tours. It is astonishing when they say \nthey will not cut the personnel there in terms of the security, but \nthey will cancel the tours. I would invite people from all around the \ncountry who are planning a trip to Washington to come to the Senate, \ncome to the House, and come to the Capitol. We will make sure they \nreceive tours if they would like.\n  Talk about a loss of credibility. The Washington Post evaluates \nstatements of folks, and over the last week they have given Pinocchios \nfor those who are not telling the truth. There has been a parade of \nPinocchios--a dozen of these Pinocchios that were given. One statement \nis the President's false claim on Friday during his news conference \nthat Capitol janitors will be receiving a pay cut. They gave him four \nPinocchios for that. It is not true.\n  ``The threat to free meals for seniors,'' there are Pinocchios there. \nThe false claim of pink slips for teachers by the Secretary of \nEducation, another four Pinocchios. There are two Pinocchios for the \nclaim that ``up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and \nearly Head Start services.''\n  The Senator from Utah mentioned the concerns about the FAA with \nfurloughs and closed air towers. The verdict is still pending on that. \nThere is a parade of Pinocchios for the administration at a time when \nthe American people know so much of their taxpayer dollars are being \nwasted.\n  I traveled around Wyoming this past weekend, and people at home think \nthat at least half of the money they send to Washington is wasted. It \nis time now to take an opportunity to eliminate wasteful and \nduplicative spending. We should streamline the Federal bureaucracy. We \nshould make government programs more efficient. We should be more \nthoughtful in terms of how targeted cuts will work to ensure vital \nprograms continue without interruption.\n  At the end of the day, we should make sure taxpayers are getting \nvalue for their hard-earned dollars. The administration does not see it \nthat way at all. Instead of promoting responsible spending, the \nadministration is promoting panic.\n  As Senator Lee pointed out, the administration is threatening the \nAmerican people with pink slips for teachers, cuts to airport security, \ncuts to the Coast Guard patrols, cutting border patrol and enforcement, \nclosing national parks, cutting food safety inspections, eliminating \nHead Start, Meals on Wheels, and the list goes on.\n  We need to be honest with the American people that we are $16.5 \ntrillion in debt. That is not a threat; it is the truth. We can no \nlonger afford to ignore the truth. Washington is burying our children \nand grandchildren under a mountain of debt, and if we don't treat \nWashington's spending addiction, the problem is just going to get \nworse. We must not allow the debt to tie the hands of future \ngenerations and prevent them from reaching their dreams.\n  I believe we have to take responsibility for the reality we are \nfacing and we have to take action to change the course we are on. Of \ncourse, that means difficult decisions have to be made, but these \ndecisions don't need to be reckless. They don't need to be dangerous. \nThey don't need to imperil our students, teachers, military, senior \ncitizens or our national security. They need to be smart, they need to \nbe targeted, and they need to maximize the value of each dollar spent \nand minimize the risks and burdens to taxpayers.\n  I say to my colleague from Utah that instead of hitting taxpayers \nwhere they will feel it the most, the administration has an obligation \nand a responsibility to work hard to cut spending where the need is the \nleast. I know the leadership the Senator from Utah has shown on ``Cut \nthis, not that'' is something I think Americans would agree with \ncompletely.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank my friend, Senator Barrasso. I find it interesting \nthat what the Senator has observed on the streets of towns such as \nEvanston, Cheyenne, and Gillette in Wyoming is backed up by a recent \npoll conducted by Gallup. That poll shows Americans understand that a \nlot of money Washington spends is wasted. This Gallup poll shows that \nthe average American believes Washington wastes 51 cents out of every \n$1 it spends--51 cents. More than half of every dollar that hard-\nworking Americans earn and send to Washington gets wasted.\n  Congress and the President should be working together to target, \nreform, reduce, and eliminate wasteful spending\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nthat the American people are noticing. They should be working to get \nrid of and reform ineffective programs.\n  Meanwhile, the President is threatening to make cuts to government \nspending as painful as it can possibly be. Instead of targeting waste, \nthe President is using scare tactics to persuade Americans that cuts \nhave to come first from important services such as law enforcement, \nnational security, border patrol, first responders, and educators.\n  Just today, the administration announced it was going to furlough \nschoolteachers who educate the children of military families on U.S. \nmilitary bases, recognizing, of course, that most school systems are \noperated at the State and local level. They are funded primarily at the \nState and local level. The administration started focusing on educators \nwho teach on base to military families, suggesting that those teachers \nwould have to be furloughed.\n  Republicans have a better idea. The Senate Budget Committee--and in \nparticular the ranking Republican serving on the Senate Budget \nCommittee--has found that the cost of President Obama's recent golf \nvacation with Tiger Woods cost Americans an amount of money that, if \nsaved, would have allowed us to prevent the furlough of 341 Federal \nemployees. Can the President cancel a vacation or two in order to avoid \nsome of these furloughs? That is the question that has prompted us to \nstart this information campaign that we refer to as ``Cut this, not \nthat,'' as depicted in this graphic.\n  This graphic shows under ``Cut this,'' golf vacations by the \nPresident, and under the ``not that,'' it shows military base teachers. \nThat is what we should be focusing on. That is where we ought to \nprioritize. We need to identify those areas where there could be a \nlower priority attached to something we are already spending money on. \n``Cut this, not that'' sends a message to the President and the \nAmerican people that Washington should be setting spending priorities \nrather than wasting their hard-earned tax dollars.\n\n  I ask the Senator--through the Chair--how can it be that this \nadministration chooses to cut border law enforcement, first responders, \nand educators instead of the fraud and waste that is so rampant in the \ngovernment?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I appreciate the question. My friend is absolutely \ncorrect. The cuts threatened by the administration simply defy common \nsense and logic. Despite claims to the contrary, the President actually \ndoes have a choice. He can take a thoughtful, reasoned approach to \nimplementing the sequester by cutting wasteful spending that we all \nknow exists or he can continue to threaten and scare the American \npeople with needless cuts to vital programs and services.\n  I put together a list of a few places where I would encourage the \nPresident to look for reasonable cuts because there are so many \nprograms that are inefficient, ineffective or overlap with other \nprograms. There are over 80 economic development programs that operate \nout of 4 different Cabinet agencies: the Department of Agriculture, \nCommerce, Housing and Urban Development, and Small Business.\n  There are 173 programs promoting science, technology, engineering, \nand math education across 13 agencies. These are important, but do we \nneed 173 programs when one department of the government doesn't know \nwhat the other one is doing?\n  There are 20 agencies that oversee more than 50 financial literacy \nprograms. There are more than 50 programs supporting entrepreneurs \nacross 4 different departments of government. There are 47 different \njob training programs. Is job training important? Absolutely. There are \n47 different programs, 9 different agencies, and it cost $18 billion in \nfiscal year 2009. Out of 47 programs, only 5 of them have had an impact \nstudy completed since 2004 to see if they actually work and whether \nparticipants in the program actually get a job. These have not been \nreviewed since 2004. Do we know they work? Do we need 47? Could they be \nimproved upon?\n  We are looking at this sequester. The President proposed this \nsequester. The President signed the sequester into law, and now he \nclaims he cannot live with the effects. I am here to say he is wrong. \nResponsibly implementing the cuts from the sequester is not only \npossible, I believe it is necessary, as we see here: ``Cut this, not \nthat.''\n  This debate is not about--as we read in the Washington Post--the \nPresident trying to force it to an election to the House of \nRepresentatives in 2014, it is about the economy and the future of our \ncountry. It is not just about smaller government, it is about smarter \ngovernment. People think they are not getting value for their money.\n  I believe it is past the time for Washington to take the smarter \napproach to our Nation's spending addiction, and I appreciate the \nleadership of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank the Senator. It is important for us to recognize \nthat all these observations draw back to one central conclusion, which \nis that the sequester and wasteful spending we see so rampant \nthroughout our Federal Government is the natural product of the failure \nby the majority leadership in the Senate to work with Republicans to \npass a budget.\n  Last year, in the Senate, Republicans proposed 3 different budgets \nand received as many as 42 votes. That is 42 more votes than the \nPresident's budget received in this body last year or the year before \nor in the House last year or the year before.\n  The majority party in the Senate--those in charge of this body and \nelected to lead in this body--have refused even to propose a budget for \nthe country for more than 1,400 days.\n  We have spending priorities. I am sure my friends across the aisle \nhave spending priorities as well. It is time we do the right thing for \nthe American people. We need to sit down and have an open and honest \ndialog with the American people and with each other. We need to hammer \nout these ideas and come up with a budget that fairly and accurately \nrepresents the priorities of the American people. We need to pass a \nbudget, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to use an \noversized poster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Government Waste and Duplication\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, there has been a lot made of the \nsequester and the things that may or may not happen associated with it. \nHaving spent the last 8 years looking at the Federal Government, I \nwrote the Secretary of Agriculture a letter this week outlining some \nthings they could do that would not put in jeopardy food inspection and \nother things.\n  In my 8 years of looking at the Department of Agriculture, there is \nextensive waste and duplication--the GAO has confirmed that--and those \nthings should be cut first and eliminated and consolidated before \nstaffs that are in critical positions are furloughed.\n  The USDA currently has 120,000 employees, and they have over 16,000 \noffices. Just thinking about 16,000 offices ought to give us some \npause. Why would any agency, no matter what their requirements, need \nthat number of offices? The agency notes on their Web site that if they \nwere a private company, they would be the sixth largest private company \nin America. That is how big the USDA is and how diffusive.\n  Today, there is one USDA employee for every eight farmers--one USDA \nemployee for every eight people employed in the farm area--or, overall, \none USDA employee for every 18 farms, primary or otherwise. So weekend \nfarmers have a USDA employee, and for regular farmers--people where it \nis their primary business--there is an employee for every eight of \nthem.\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\n  At the end of 2012, USDA was sitting on $12 billion in unobligated \nFederal balances. In other words, that is money that is sitting in an \naccount that has not been obligated to any purpose, sitting there \nwaiting to be spent, where we have borrowed money--$12 billion--that \nthey have not obligated.\n  One of the things my staff has discovered is the USDA has upcoming \nconferences in terms of food tasting and wine tasting on the west \ncoast. Now, in normal times there would not be anything wrong with \nFederal employees traveling to the west coast to both encourage and \nassess where we are in terms of some of our agricultural production. \nBut I would think maybe this is one of the things the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture ought to cancel, given where we are and the threat that \nhas been put out there in terms of food safety that has been announced \nin terms of layoffs or time off for Agriculture Department employees.\n  Two USDA agencies--Rural Development and the Agricultural Marketing \nService--are sponsoring the 26th annual California Small Farm \nConference next week. In addition to speakers from the USDA agency, the \ngathering will feature field trips and tasting receptions. ``The \nTasting Reception,'' according to their Web site, ``is the most well \nattended networking event of the conference and showcases the regional \nbounty from local farms, chefs, wineries, breweries, bakeries and other \nfood purveyors.'' And ``special guest chefs will turn donated local \nagriculture products into tasty dishes to sample with exceptional local \nwines [provided].''\n  There is nothing wrong with that in normal times. There is plenty \nwrong with sending multiple employees to these types of conferences \nwhen we find ourselves in the position we find ourselves in today. \nThese conferences, I am sure, are fun, interesting, and even \neducational getaways for USDA employees, but food inspecting rather \nthan food tasting should be the USDA's priority at this time.\n  Not just to pick on them, but the thing is Americans are not aware of \nhow expansive and duplicative many of these programs are. In the \ndomestic food assistance programs, as shown on this chart, this is what \nGAO shows us we have running: 18 different Federal programs across \nthree Departments that spend $60 billion a year.\n  According to the GAO, the availability of multiple programs with \nsimilar benefits helps ensure that those in need have access to \nnutritious food, but it also does increase the administrative costs of \nthese programs.\n  So while our goal is great, with the fact that we have this many \nprograms doing essentially similar work with similar overheads, the \nGAO's recommendation was to do consolidation. Fifteen of these programs \nare run by the Department of Agriculture, ranging from SNAP to the \nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and the Special Milk Program.\n  According to the GAO, the effectiveness of 11 of these 18 programs is \nsuspect. The reason it is suspect is nobody has done any oversight. No \nMember of Congress has done oversight on it--not the Budget Committee, \nnot the Appropriations Committee, nor the Agriculture Committee.\n  We also have inside the USDA research and education activities within \nthe Rural Development programs that duplicate, predominately, existing \nprograms of almost every other agency in the Federal Government. Let me \nsay that again. Almost every one of these programs is duplicated in \nanother agency of the Federal Government. In other words, we are \nlayering. They both have the same goals, the same hope for outcomes. \nOne is run by one agency. Here are the ones that are run just by the \nUSDA.\n  According to GAO, the Rural Development program administers 40 \nhousing programs, business, community infrastructure and facility \nprograms, as well as energy, health care, telecom programs, most of \nwhich duplicate the initiatives of other agencies, yet under the guise \nof serving exclusively rural citizens. Rural populations are not \nexcluded from the other programs which are run with the same purpose \nthat serve the general population. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, more than 88 programs administered by 16 different \nFederal agencies do the exact same thing these programs do. So we have \n88 other programs from 16 different Federal agencies that are targeting \nrural economic development and needs.\n  It is not hard to see why we are in trouble. The GAO has done the \nwork we have asked them to do. The appropriate committees have not \naddressed any of these issues. They have not offered any amendments or \nbills to reduce, consolidate, or at least look at the outcomes and the \ncost-benefit ratio of having multiple layers of programs doing the same \nthing.\n\n  Let me give you some questionable expenditures of what we have seen \nin the last year: a $54 million loan to build a casino; $1.6 million in \nloans for an asbestos removal company. It created hundreds of jobs in \nGuatemala and eventually went out of business and defaulted on the \nloan. There is $2.5 million in low-interest loans for the construction \nof the Smithsonian-style Birthplace of Country Music Cultural Heritage \nCenter; a Tennessee county spent $10,000 of a Federal Rural Development \ngrant to upgrade its tourism Web site; $12,500 went to Milk And Honey \nSoap, LLC for the marketing of soaps and lotions made from goat's milk \nand beeswax. These are private businesses, and we are taking taxpayer \nmoney, or we are borrowing the money, and we are subsidizing private \nindividual businesses with grants.\n  We also have within the USDA research and education activities: the \nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture spent $706 million last year \non research and education activities through more than 45 different \nprograms. Meanwhile, their Agricultural Research Service has budgeted \n$1.1 billion annually and is home to an additional eight Federal \nresearch and educational activity programs.\n  So what we have is layer after layer after layer--most of them well-\nintentioned. I am not denying that some of these are significant roles \nof Federal Government. But Congress is the problem because we have not \naddressed any of the recommendations the Government Accountability \nOffice has given us in the two reports thus far, and the final report \nthat will come out this year on overlap and duplication.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about the USDA's Market Access Program. At \nthe request of Congress, the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent more \nthan $2 billion on the Market Access Program, which has directly \nsubsidized the advertising of some of the most profitable companies and \ntrade associations doing business overseas. So we are subsidizing \ncompanies such as Welch's, Sunkist, and Blue Diamond. The combined \nsales are greater than $2 billion a year, and we gave them $6 million \nlast year to advertise their products.\n  It is one thing to promote exports, but we do not do that with every \nother business in America. Not every business that has $2 billion in \nsales gets $6 million of the Federal taxpayers' money to promote their \nproducts overseas.\n  So we have this disparity. I do not know if this is good policy or \nbad policy. What I do know is, it is discriminatory in terms of how we \ntreat one group of businesses versus another group of businesses.\n  Also receiving money from the taxpayers for private overseas \nadvertising are trade groups such as Tyson Foods, Purina, Georgia \nPacific, Jack Daniels, Hershey's, the California wine industry. They \nhave domestic sales of $18 billion a year. They took in $7 million to \npromote their products overseas. The Cotton Council, on behalf of \nAmerica, received $20 million from the Market Access Program and \nanother $4.7 million from the USDA Foreign Market Development Program.\n  So I come to the floor so the American people can see that we have \nplenty of ways to save money. What we have is an intransigence in \nCongress to do the hard work and also an intransigence by the \nadministration to recognize the need to lead on eliminating these areas \nof duplication.\n  Last week on the floor, I put a letter into the Record from the mayor \nof McAlester, OK. The Presiding Officer is a native of Oklahoma. She \nknows that town. He had a budget shortfall. He outlined the steps he \nwent through with the help of the city manager to meet that. They did \nit in a way we would all be proud of. He gave us an example.\n  Today I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\nfrom the mayor of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in terms \nof what they have done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             Board of Supervisors,\n\n\n                                        County of Los Angeles,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, April 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: I commend you and your colleagues with \n     your bipartisan effort to reduce spending, taxes, debt and \n     forge a more streamlined and ``right size'' a cost-effective \n     federal government.\n       While Los Angeles County's $23.5 billion budget pales in \n     comparison to the United States budget, some of the \n     successful reforms implemented by our County Board of \n     Supervisors could result in similar results for the federal \n     budget.\n       Since 70-80% of the federal budget consists of personnel \n     compensation, productivity and efficiency can be improved by \n     consolidating and eliminating agencies, programs and \n     personnel with duplicative or overlapping functions. Every \n     federal department and agency should be evaluated, services \n     prioritized, programs streamlined and all waste eliminated.\n       Many federal agencies and departments have traditionally \n     inflated their budgets with unfilled positions. Those that \n     have been vacant for more than 12 months should be \n     eliminated. Employees who have left their positions due to \n     injury or illness need to be aggressively pursued to ensure \n     that their conditions are legitimate.\n       It is also vital to reform the civil service process and \n     the public employee pension system. Some states are adopting \n     forward-thinking reforms including reducing pension benefits \n     for new hires and establishing a defined benefits program for \n     current employees.\n       These common sense solutions have allowed us to \n     consistently balance our County budget and could serve as \n     guidelines in your effort to ``right size'' the federal \n     government.\n           Best regards,\n                                            Michael D. Antonovich,\n                                        Mayor, Los Angeles County.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This was a letter I received in 2011 when we started \nraising the issue of duplication and making tough choices so that we \ncould continue to provide benefits, we could continue to create and \nsupport a safety net for those who were truly dependent on it, but we \ndo not waste money we do not have, spending it on things we do not \nabsolutely need.\n  I would put forward that when we have a multitude of programs and \nthey overlap, we as Members of Congress do not have an excuse for not \nfixing that, because the things that are critical in people's lives \neventually are going to suffer. Every dollar we spend on low-priority \nduplication, every dollar we spend that does not have a metric to say \nit is doing what it is should be doing is eventually going to be a \ndollar that is not there to support a food stamp recipient or a \nMedicaid recipient or housing for the indigent or care for the homeless \nor implementing Justice grant programs for policing and tribal courts.\n  So it is not a matter of just solving the duplication problem, it is \na matter of the arithmetic that is going to hit our country and that by \ndelaying the time at which we decide we are going to address this \nmultitude, which is now 1,400 programs through the first 2 years of \nreports from GAO and $367 billion of expenditures--and that does not \ncount the other $800 billion that goes out of the Federal Government \nevery year for grants that also address some of these same issues. So \nthe time is now. Sequestration gives us a good time to start looking at \npriorities.\n  One of the things I am thankful for is that we have tremendous \nFederal employees. We are starting to hear them speak up now: What can \nbe cut? What is wasteful? They now feel the freedom to not be \ncriticized because they are going to take a critical eye to the way \nAmerican taxpayer dollars are being spent in their own agency. We are \nstarting to hear from them: Here are things we are doing that we should \nnot be doing. Here are things that are not a priority. Rather than lay \noff a meat inspector, maybe we ought to do this: ``Cut this, not \nthat.'' You know, we ought to cut out wine tastings for Federal \nemployees and keep the meat inspectors employed.\n  There is no reason we need to furlough the first--with the waste in \nthe Department of Agriculture, there is no reason that any significant \nprogram in the Department of Agriculture ought to suffer a furlough or \nlayoff. There is no reason for it because there are billions of dollars \nthere that are not wisely spent--well intended, not questioning motive, \nbut poorly spent with poor return.\n  When there are two programs doing the same thing, let me describe \nwhat happens on the beneficiary end of that. People do not know where \nthere is a need. What the requirement is in one program is a different \nrequirement in another program. In terms of duplicative grants, what we \nhave is people who apply for a grant and get it from one arm of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and then go over here and make the same \napplication from another arm of the Department of Agriculture, get the \nsame grant, and then go to one of the other agencies that is doing the \nsame thing and get another grant for the same thing--all of them not \nknowing that each has given a grant for the same purpose. So it is just \nnot good business practices, it is not good management, and it is not \ngood stewardship for the future of our country.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to think about the great work the \nGovernment Accountability Office has done. They have done great work \nfor us. We have failed to act on it. It is time we start acting. Come \nApril 1, we will see the final report from the GAO where they now--over \n4 years--will have looked at every program in the Federal Government. \nThey are going to be able to give us a list. I have come out here with \nmy big charts and shown the list of duplications. We are going to have \nthree or four more charts that say the same thing. Think about how \ndiscouraging it is to the people at GAO who do all of this hard work \nand to the people who are trying to meet the needs in the individual \nagencies to know that we are actually duplicating things with poor \nresults.\n  We are not meeting our requirements under our oath. We are not \nmeeting the moral requirements to be prudent with the American \ntaxpayers' money. In the long run, the people who will suffer for it \nwill be the very people we intend to help because if, in fact, we do \nnot respond in a way that creates a positive vision for our country in \nterms of growth again and a positive vision in terms of responsible \nbehavior by Congress, ultimately the arithmetic swallows us up.\n  I will close with this: If you take today's budget, when the Federal \nReserve starts unwinding the quantitative easing they have done--these \nvery low, artificially low interest rates--or if something were to \nhappen where the world economy would look at us and say: We do not \nthink you are deserving of our AAA-minus rating--the difference in \ninterest costs historically is about 3 to 4 percent. Let's take a \nconservative estimate; let's say it is 3. Our historical average is \n5.83 percent, what we have borrowed money at historically over the last \n50 years. We are borrowing at under 2 percent right now. Three percent \ntimes $17 trillion is $510 billion a year. We all lose when that \nhappens. How do we lose? Because the dollar we are going to be spending \non that additional interest cost is a dollar that is not going to help \nsomeone who is homeless, it is a dollar that is not going to provide \nfood that needs to be provided for those who are depending upon us, and \nit is a dollar that is not going to go to match the FMAP for Medicaid. \nConsequently, the cuts we will make then will be much harsher than the \ncuts if we decide to do it proactively now.\n  You do not have to have partisan disagreement about the goal of a \nprogram, but certainly we should be able to come together and say: We \ndo not want duplication. We want to have good outcomes. We want to put \nmetrics on it to measure it to see if it is working.\n  There cannot be any disagreement on that. That is plain, good-old \ncommon horse sense. Yet there has been no action in 3\\1/2\\ years on any \nof these recommendations by the Government Accountability Office. Now, \nthe administration has paid attention. I will give them credit. In a \nlot of areas where they have seen it, they have done what they can do, \nbut we have not. I do not want the heritage of my time in the Senate to \nbe when we were the Congresses that failed to meet the challenge.\n  I believe our country can cheat history. If you look at history, it \nis not great for republics. They have all failed. But we have the \nopportunity to cheat history, and the way we do it is by getting off \nour rears and starting to\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\ndo the job we were sent up here to do, which is oversight and legislate \nthe elimination of waste, abuse, and duplication. We can do that, but \nit requires leadership. It requires leadership on the part of Senator \nReid, on the part of Senator McConnell, every committee chair, every \nranking member. It requires leadership that we are going to do that.\n\n  I am proud to say that Tom Carper, chairman of Homeland Security--we \nhave a plan to oversight all of homeland security over the next 4 \nyears, the whole thing, and the rest of the government as well because \nwe do not really believe the rest of the committees are going to do it. \nSo we are building our staffs for oversight to grab this information, \nto make cogent recommendations and legislation, where we can, that will \nactually address these problems. We are way past the starting point of \nwhen we should have begun. It is not too late, but it requires us to \nmake a decision: Are we more interested in the parochial benefits of \nallowing programs that are not effective or duplicative to continue to \nrun because we will not get any blowback or are we courageous enough to \nsay that we are going to do what is right for the right reasons for the \nlong-term well-being of our country?\n  I believe that is the feeling of most of the Members of the Senate. I \njust think we need the leadership to call us back.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to be a circuit judge on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  The D.C. Circuit is arguably the most important Federal appellate \ncourt in our country's judicial system, with primary responsibility to \nreview administrative decisions made by many Federal departments and \nexecutive branch agencies. It has also served, in many instances, as a \nstepping stone of sorts for judges later appointed to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. As a result, the Senate has a longstanding practice of carefully \nscrutinizing candidates to the D.C. Circuit.\n  When evaluating particular nominees, we also carefully consider the \nneed for additional judges on that very court. In July 2006 President \nBush nominated an eminently qualified individual named Peter Keisler to \nfill a seat on the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Keisler, whom I know personally, \nis among the finest attorneys in the country and is also among the \nfinest individuals I know. Because of his nonideological approach to \nthe law, Mr. Keisler enjoys broad bipartisan support throughout the \nlegal profession. Despite these unassailable qualifications, Democratic \nSenators blocked Mr. Keisler's nomination. He did not receive any floor \nconsideration whatsoever, not even a cloture vote, and his nomination \nlanguished in the Judiciary Committee. At the time a number of \nDemocratic Senators sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee chairman \narguing that a nominee to the D.C. Circuit ``should under no \ncircumstances be considered--much less confirmed--before we first \naddress the very need for that judgeship.'' These Senators specifically \nargued that the D.C. Circuit's comparatively modest caseload in 2006 \ndid not justify the confirmation of an additional judge to that Court, \neven though this was a position that by law already existed.\n  More than 6 years have passed, and Ms. Halligan has been nominated \nonce again to that very same seat on the D.C. Circuit--the same seat \nfor which Peter Keisler was nominated--but the court's caseload remains \njust as minimal as it was then. According to the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts, the D.C. Circuit caseload is so light that the \nnumber of appeals pending per judicial panel is 54 percent less than \nthe average for Federal courts of appeal. With just 359 pending appeals \nper panel, the D.C. Circuit's average workload is less than half that \nof other similar appellate courts.\n  The D.C. Circuit caseload has actually decreased since the time \nDemocrats blocked Mr. Keisler. Indeed, since 2005 the total number of \nappeals filed is down over 13 percent. The total number of appeals \npending is down over 10 percent. Some have sought to make much of the \nfact that since 2005, two of the court's judges have taken senior \nstatus, leaving only seven active judges on the D.C. Circuit today. But \nthe court's caseload has declined so much in recent years that even \nfilings per active judge are only slightly higher than they were in \n2005. Of course, that does not account for the six senior judges on the \nD.C. Circuit who continue to hear appeals and offer opinions on a \nregular basis. Their contribution--the contributions of the senior \njudges on that court--is such that the actual work for each active \njudge has declined and the caseload burden for D.C. Circuit judges is \nless than it was when Democrats blocked Mr. Keisler on the basis of a \ndeclining, insufficient caseload.\n  Indeed, the average filings per panel--perhaps the truest measure of \nthe actual workload per judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals--is down \nalmost 6 percent since that time.\n  In each of the last several years, the D.C. Circuit has cancelled \nregularly scheduled argument dates due to the lack of pending cases. \nThose who work at the courts suggest that in reality the workload isn't \nany different today than it has been in the past.\n  According to the Democrats' own standards, and particularly when \nthere are judicial emergencies in other courts across the country, now \nis not the time to confirm another judge to the D.C. Circuit. It is \ncertainly not the time for us to consider confirming a controversial \nnominee with a record of extreme views with regard to the law and the \nConstitution.\n  Make no mistake, Ms. Halligan is not what we would call a consensus \nnominee. The Senate has already considered and rejected her nomination. \nNothing material has changed since that time.\n  Many of my colleagues have discussed a wide range of Ms. Halligan's \nviews, so I will limit myself to one example. In 2003, while serving as \nSolicitor General for the State of New York, Ms. Halligan approved and \nsigned a legal brief arguing that handgun manufacturers, wholesalers, \nand retailers should be held liable for criminal actions that \nindividuals commit with those guns. Three years later, in 2006, Ms. \nHalligan filed another brief arguing that handgun manufacturers were \nguilty of creating a public nuisance.\n  Such arguments amount to an invitation for the courts to engage in \nsweeping judicial activism. The positions she took are both bewildering \nand flatly inconsistent with the original understanding of the second \namendment rights all Americans enjoy.\n  In conclusion, as measured by the Democrats' own standards and their \nown prior actions, now is not the time to confirm another judge to the \nD.C. Circuit, and it is certainly not the time to consider such a \ncontroversial nominee for that very important court. The Senate has \nalready spoken and rejected Ms. Halligan's nomination. I urge my \ncolleagues once again to oppose her confirmation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to vigorously support the \nconfirmation of Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \nMs. Halligan is an exceptionally qualified nominee, and the D.C. \nCircuit needs her. I urge all my Senate colleagues to join me in voting \nfor her.\n  The breadth and depth of Ms. Halligan's legal experience and \nexpertise are very impressive. After law school, she clerked for \nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and for Judge Patricia Wald on the \nD.C. Circuit, the court to which she has been nominated. She continued \nher public service as the solicitor general of the State of New York \nfor 6 years, spent some time in the private sector, and is currently \ngeneral counsel at the New York County District attorney's office, an \noffice that investigates and prosecutes 100,000 criminal cases annually \nin Manhattan. Throughout her career, Ms. Halligan has served as counsel \nof record in nearly 50 matters before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing \nfive cases before that court and many cases before Federal and State \nappellate courts. Her legal and oral advocacy training is as extensive \nas any nominee that the Senate has confirmed.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to speak about Ms. Halligan today is \nbecause\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\nher reputation precedes her. The American Bar Association's nonpartisan \nstanding committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. \nHalligan ``well-qualified'' to serve on the D.C. Circuit, the highest \npossible rating. Messages of support for her nomination have poured in \nfrom hundreds of female law school deans and professors, former U.S. \nSupreme Court clerks and current judges, preeminent lawyers across the \npolitical spectrum from Ronald Reagan's solicitor general to the \nlegendary D.A. Robert Morgenthau, and law enforcement associations. Put \nsimply, this woman has proven herself to be worthy of our vote and the \npublic's trust.\n  But there is another reason we must confirm Ms. Halligan today: the \nunacceptable delay in her nomination is causing a growing gap in the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms. Halligan was first nominated by \nPresident Obama three years ago. Now, this important court in our \ncountry--often called ``the second most important court in our land'' \nbecause of the high profile, complex cases it handles--is one-third \nvacant. The caseload for the existing judges is growing, and justice is \nbeing held up.\n  Finally, if confirmed, Caitlin Halligan would become only the sixth \nfemale judge in the D.C. Circuit's 120-year history, a change I would \ncertainly welcome for this important court. We need to continue \nbuilding on the important legacy of diversity and inclusion that \nPresident Obama has established by nominating record numbers of women \nto the Federal bench. Thanks to his leadership, women today make up \nroughly 30 percent of the Federal judgeships at every level for the \nfirst time in history: in trial courts, courts of appeal, and the \nSupreme Court. This diversity bolsters the legitimacy of our court \nsystem, and the public's confidence in it. We should continue this \nprogress by confirming Ms. Halligan.\n  For all these reasons, I look forward to voting for Caitlin \nHalligan's nomination to the D.C.

Mr. President, this morning we received news in Chicago \nthat Dawn Clark Netsch has passed away. She died from complications \nfrom Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 86. It was a surprise to lose \nher this quickly, although all of us knew she was struggling with this \nterrible disease.\n  When the history of her contribution to Illinois is written, it will \nundoubtedly note the obvious: She had worked in Illinois government \nsince the 1950s, under then-Governor Stevenson. She was a law professor \nat Northwestern University Law School. She was elected State senator in \nthe 1970s. She was elected our State's comptroller after that, and she \nhad an ill-fated run for Governor.\n  If that is all it says, though, it will miss the most important part \nof her life because, you see, Dawn Clark Netsch was an iconic, historic \nforce in our State. More than any person in Illinois history, Dawn \nClark Netsch created the modern era of women in Illinois political \nleadership. As always, those who were charged with opening the doors of \nopportunity have to come to that task extraordinarily gifted, \ndetermined, and patient. Dawn Netsch was all of these and more.\n  Early in my life, fresh out of law school, I was a lawyer working in \nthe Illinois State Senate, and I saw firsthand the talents of this new \nsenator, Dawn Clark Netsch. Her political base was the Lakeshore \nliberal base in Chicago--the group who was always at war with the \nChicago machine and proud of it. She was elected from that base but \nthen surprised most everyone when she came to Springfield and struck up \na friendship, a genuine friendship, in the constitutional convention \nfirst and then in the State Senate with a young State senator named \nRichard M. Daley, son of Mayor Daley. Dawn Netsch proved that a \npolitician can be both principled and effective and civil. Her ill-\nfated run for Governor lacked the political polish of many winning \ncampaigns, but her thoughtfulness, her candor, and her blunt honesty \nabout the challenges Illinois faced will always be remembered.\n  The Illinois political scene will not be the same without that pool-\nshooting Sox fan with a cigarette holder, but generations of Illinois \nwomen can thank the indomitable force of Dawn Clark Netsch for blazing \ntheir path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1122-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM J. RISSEL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a Kentuckian \nwho has both faithfully served his community and the men and women of \nthe U.S. Army for more than two decades. I speak of Mr. William J. \nRissel, the president and chief executive officer of the Fort Knox \nFederal Credit Union, a stalwart member of the Fort Knox CORE \nCommittee, and a long-time friend.\n  Under Bill's leadership, the Fort Knox Federal Credit Union has \nachieved impressive growth and has done much to help the local \ncommunity. Bill has worked in the financial services industry for more \nthan 30 years, and he has headed the Fort Knox Federal Credit Union \nsince 1991. In that time, it has expanded from 4 branches primarily \nserving Hardin County to 14 branches across central Kentucky. Fort Knox \nFederal Credit Union was recently awarded the Department of the Army's \nDistinguished Service Award. It won this recognition in competition \nagainst all other on-post credit unions in the Nation.\n  If there is a cause that is near and dear to Bill's heart in addition \nto Fort Knox Federal, it is that of Fort Knox and the surrounding \ncommunity. In 2011, under Bill's guidance, Fort Knox Federal sponsored \na platoon deployed to Afghanistan. The staff shared messages of support \nand care packages with the soldiers to remind them of home and let them \nknow that they remained in the thoughts and prayers of the local \ncommunity. Bill and I have worked together for years trying to ensure \nthat Fort Knox has what it needs to support its mission and the \nmilitary personnel and their families who call the post home. Bill has \nbeen a member of the Fort Knox CORE Committee since 1993 and has served \nas president of the organization since January 2006.\n  Bill is also active in the local area, having served as a Radcliff \nChamber of Commerce board member; president of the Association of the \nUnited States Army, Fort Knox chapter; the United Way Advisory \nCommittee; the Radcliff Industrial Foundation Board; and Rotary \nInternational. He also visits Fort Knox Elementary School and reads to \nMrs. Trimble's class every year.\n  Bill and his wife Rosie are completing their dream house in Florida \nwhere they may both enjoy the warm weather, but I know his heart will \nalways remain in central Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Mr. William J. Rissel for his successful career and \nthank him for his service to the community and to Fort Knox.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1122-5", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1122-S1123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NORTH LAUREL HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADER TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a group of young ladies who have found great success in their \nathletic endeavors on the national and international level. The North \nLaurel High School cheerleaders have represented their county and the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky well with their hard work, skill, and success. \nOn February 10, the North Laurel High School cheerleaders won both the \nWorld School and International Cup at UCA Nationals in Orlando, FL.\n  The cheerleading squad from North Laurel High School not only \nreclaimed the title of first place in World School at the UCA, \nUniversal Cheerleaders Association, Nationals in Orlando, but they went \non to become champions of the International Cup, beating out teams from \nCanada, Ecuador, and China. They also went on to win first place in the \nmedium 2A Division representing the 13th Region at the 2013 KHSAA, \nKentucky High School Athletic Association, Competitive Cheer State \nChampionship held in Bowling Green, KY on February 23. Team members \nAutumn Asher, Madison Asher, Machenzie Burns, Raye Lynn Campbell, \nTaylor Crockett, Channing Ely, Emily Evans, Katlyn Helton, Malari \nHoskins, Sara Kaminsky, Peyton Lankford, Katie Mays, Tara McClure, \nAubree Oakley, Katelyn Sharp, MaKayla Vaughn, Mary Kate Whitfield, and \nMaddie Wood as well as\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\ncoaches Kimberly B. Wood, Toni Blake Greer, and Jomo K. Thompson saw \ntheir dedication and hours of practice pay off with victory. Truly, \ntheir efforts reflect well on their community, and they represent to \ncompetitors all over the world the unbridled spirit of Kentuckians.\n  At this time, I would like to publicly declare Kentucky's \nappreciation for this team, their coaches, and their parents who have \nreceived well-deserved recognition and success for their commitments \nand practice. The North Laurel High School cheerleaders have \nrepresented Kentucky well, and we are both grateful and proud. I would \nask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in acknowledging their \nachievements, and I ask unanimous consent that an article detailing \ntheir success from the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Feb. 14, 2013]\n\n              NLHS, E.B. Cheer Teams Win Big at Nationals\n\n       Laurel County, Ky.--Laurel County cheer teams received high \n     honors at the UCA Nationals in Orlando, Fla., this weekend.\n       The North Laurel High School team earned first place in the \n     medium varsity division, as well as being named the first-\n     place winners in world school and international cup \n     competitions.\n       This was the first time the team has won first place at \n     nationals since 2009.\n       ``We have a very young squad,'' said Kim Wood, coach. ``Our \n     goal going into this was to hit a solid routine. We told the \n     girls to focus just on us, not the other teams, and doing the \n     absolute best we could do.''\n       Although the team won first in world school last year, this \n     was the first year they were named as champions of the \n     international cup against teams from Canada, China, and \n     Ecuador.\n       The outcome was a wonderful surprise, she said.\n       ``It was our best performance at national level. It was \n     pretty perfect in our eyes,'' Wood continued. ``The awards \n     were the icing on the cake.''\n       It was ninth-grader Taylor Crockett's first high-school \n     nationals. Crockett has competed in cheerleading since the \n     sixth grade.\n       ``It took a lot of hard work. At the beginning of the year, \n     we really didn't know each other,'' she said. ``We just \n     started bonding as a team. That bond helped us.''\n       Senior MaKayla Vaughn said this year was both ``amazing'' \n     and ``bittersweet'' because it will be her last.\n       During competition, Vaughn said the team helped to keep \n     each other calm, encouraging and supporting one another.\n       ``We were the first team to go on,'' she said. ``We told \n     each other to set the bar high.''\n       The East Bernstadt Tumble Cats also took home a big win \n     this weekend at UCA Nationals.\n       The Tumble Cats won first place in the youth rec, or \n     elementary, division against seven other teams.\n       In January, the Tumble Cats were named the elementary state \n     champions for the second year in a row at the Kentucky Middle \n     School State competition in Richmond.\n       The elementary team was formed just three years ago.\n       ``They've gotten progressively better over time,'' said \n     Coach Cristin Adams. ``They worked really hard this year. \n     These kids and their parents are very dedicated.''\n       This was the first year Adams and Coach Darrin Spencer took \n     the team, comprised of first- to fourth-graders, to UCA \n     Nationals.\n       ``We (she and Spencer) saw the potential of this team. Our \n     goal was to make the top 3 (at nationals). We exceeded that \n     and got first place.''\n       Prior to competition, even making the top 3 looked to be a \n     big feat.\n       ``One week before we left (for nationals), we had two girls \n     break their fingers,'' Adams said. ``We had to rework our \n     routine, and that's not easy, especially at this age, but we \n     hit the routine solid.''\n       The team trains at Damar Gymnastics in Lily, who \n     choreographed their routine.\n       ``Gymnastics is where the foundation starts,'' Adams said. \n     ``Technique is very important.''\n       The majority of the 20-member team are third-graders, and \n     most, Adams said, have been on the team for three years.\n       ``Starting young helps feed into the older teams,'' she \n     said. ``And we want to be a good feeder program for North \n     Laurel Middle and North Laurel High schools.''\n       The North Laurel Middle School cheerleading team took \n     second place in their division at UCA nationals.\n       NLMS team coaches include Katie Sizemore, Paula Crawford, \n     and Susan Tolliver.\n       NLHS team coaches include Wood, Toni Blake Greer, and Jomo \n     Thompson, who is also the University of Kentucky head \n     cheerleading coach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1123-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1123-S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PANDEMIC AND ALL-HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor in \nsupport of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization \nAct of 2013, PAHPRA.

Over the past \ndecade, multiple Congresses and administrations have worked together to \nput in place critical medical and public health preparedness and \nresponse programs and policies. As a result of the passage of the \nPandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, PAHPA of 2006, the Federal \nGovernment, in partnership with State and local governments, took \nsignificant steps to strengthen our Nation's medical and public health \npreparedness and response capabilities. This bipartisan reauthorization \nbuilds on these efforts by enhancing existing programs and authorities \nusing lessons learned over the past 5 years to maximize our Nation's \nresilience to threats, whether naturally occurring or deliberate.\n  I thank Senators Harkin, Enzi, Burr, Alexander, and Casey for their \ndedication and commitment to reauthorizing the programs in this bill \nand protecting our country from threats. By coming together, passing \nthis bill, and sending it to the President to get signed into law, we \nwill strengthen our Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to all \nhazards emergencies, and we will ensure that we have looked out for our \nchildren. The congenial and bi-partisan process we followed should be a \nmodel for how we do all of our work here in Congress.\n  PAHPRA includes important provisions that I fought for as Chairwoman \nof the HELP Subcommittee on Children and Families. I led the effort to \ncreate a National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters to \ncontinue the good work started by the National Commission on Children \nand Disasters. The advisory committee, established by my amendment, \nwill bring together children's advocates and federal agencies to ensure \nwe are well equipped to care for our most vulnerable population when \npreparing for, responding to and recovering from a disaster. I am \ncommitted to getting this advisory committee up and running this year. \nDoing all that we can to protect our most vulnerable is of the utmost \nimportance.\n  I would also like to thank the American Academy of Pediatrics for \ntheir commitment to children's health and for building a coalition of \nsupport for my amendment to establish the Advisory Committee. Save the \nChildren and the Children's Health Fund were also steadfast advocates \nfor this committee and other important pediatric provisions contained \nin this bill.\n  This advisory committee will include a variety of pediatric experts, \nfrom those who work in Federal agencies, to non-federal health care \nprofessionals, to employees of relevant State and local agencies. I \nmade sure that at least four members of this committee would not be \nfederal bureaucrats to ensure that all views and perspectives are \nconsidered. Community-based pediatricians, nurses, and State and local \npublic health and emergency management professionals are on the front \nlines responding to emergencies every day. These folks know what the \nsituation is like on the ground.\n  The advisory committee will serve an important role in making sure \nthat the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of \nHomeland Security swiftly implement the medical and public health \nrecommendations put forth by the National Commission on Children and \nDisasters. Committee members will also advise federal agencies on the \nmedical and public health policies and\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\nprocedures that the agencies and their grantees should implement to \nmeet the needs of children when preparing for, responding to, and \nrecovering from all-hazards.\n  As we all know, children are not little adults. Kids who are battered \nduring a disaster and suffer physical harm or are exposed to an \ninfectious disease, need special medications, devices, and supplies, \nwhether it is a liquid form of a medication, a pediatric ventilator, \nbaby formula, or even diapers.\n  PAHPRA reauthorizes several provisions that I have fought for over \nthe years that support the research and development of chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures. Project \nBioshield and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development \nAuthority, BARDA, are economic engines of Maryland's economy supporting \nboth biotech innovation and domestic manufacturing. Project Bioshield \nis a secure funding source dedicated to the purchase of medical \ncountermeasures. BARDA contracts with companies to support the \ndevelopment and commercialization of medical countermeasures and \ncarries out all Project Bioshield acquisition contracts. Project \nBioshield and BARDA together provide drug manufacturers with the \nincentives they need to enter this market and develop lifesaving \ntherapeutics.\n  Maryland companies are investing in research and development of \nmedical countermeasures for bioterror threats because they know there \nis a federal market to buy their drugs, vaccines, needles and masks for \nthe Strategic National Stockpile for use when a disaster strikes. \nMarylanders are working hard every day to create countermeasures that \nwe hope to never use but will rely on when we are most at need to save \nour lives and our kids' lives. They are developing the next generation \nanthrax, influenza, and smallpox vaccines for the Strategic National \nStockpile. The drugs we are working so hard to develop also protect our \ntroops deployed around the world so that our soldiers get the right \ntreatments to keep them safe.\n  PAHPRA also codifies the Public Health Emergency Medical \nCountermeasures Enterprise Strategy and Implementation Plan. I worked \nto ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services would report \non what our country needs to protect our kids so that companies will \nknow what countermeasures to develop and HHS and Congress will know how \nmany and which products to buy for the stockpile. I also made sure that \nFDA would report to Congress annually on the scientific challenges and \nprogress made in developing and licensing countermeasures for pregnant \nwomen and children.\n  I also fought to make sure that State and local health departments \nwould have the workforce and financial resources they need to prepare \nfor infectious disease outbreaks like the H1N1 influenza, earthquakes, \nand floods, as well as numerous other public health threats that \ncommunities face on a day-to-day basis. In that vein, I worked to \nimprove state and local disaster planning for kids. It is important \nthat local education, child care, and other agencies are regularly \npartnering and consulting with health departments as they develop and \nrevise their preparedness plans. PAHPRA supports the good work that \nhappened in our communities during H1N1. State education, child care \nand health agencies were partnering and consulting with each other day \nin and day out for almost a year to minimize the ill health effects of \nthis novel virus. Our public servants at the federal level were \ncritical to the response and they worked closely with local officials \nto protect us every hour of every day during the pandemic.\n  We must prevent and respond to health threats before they are on our \ndoorstep. Making this bipartisan legislation the law of the land will \nhelp do just that. And I will fight to make sure we are funding these \nprograms so that we can be prepared for any and all emergencies that we \nmay face here in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1124-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VEHICLE FLEET\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, with a $16.5 trillion national debt, the \nFederal Government needs to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently and \nreduce costs during these tough fiscal times.\n  In 2011, the Federal Government owned nearly 660,000 vehicles. \nAlthough the size of the fleet decreased slightly from the previous \nyear, it had still increased significantly over the past several years. \nBetween 2006 and 2011, the Federal Government fleet has grown by more \nthan 29,000 vehicles.\n  A 2012 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report examined the \nincrease in the number of Federal vehicles, excluding postal and \nnontactical military vehicles. According to the study: ``Since fiscal \nyear 2005, the number of federal non-postal civilian and non-tactical \nmilitary vehicles has increased about 7 percent, from about 420,000 to \n449,000 vehicles.''\n  On February 28, 2013, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would \nsave millions in taxpayer dollars by reducing the amount the Federal \nGovernment can spend on buying and leasing nonessential vehicles. In \nits recommendations, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \nand Reform strongly endorsed trimming the Federal vehicle fleet, and \nestimated it would save approximately $500 million.\n  This bill would reduce by 20 percent the Federal funding available \nfor the acquisition and leasing of new Federal vehicles. It would also \nrequire agencies to maintain this funding level through 2017. Like the \nFiscal Commission, however, this bill exempts the U.S. Postal Service \nfrom the reduction. It also provides an exception for vehicle purchases \ncritical for national security reasons. Similar legislation passed by \nvoice vote in the House of Representatives in September 2012.\n  This legislation would simply do what most American families are \ndoing on a day-to-day basis. The Federal Government has to learn more \nwith less.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this \ncommonsense legislation. I want to thank my colleagues for the \nopportunity to speak on the Senate floor today in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1124-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING WOODY HAYES' 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my dear \nfriend and lifelong Connecticut resident and business owner, Bob Rich, \nwho passed away this past November.\n  Born in Stamford, Mr. Rich graduated from Stamford High School in \n1944 and from Princeton in 1948. He returned to Connecticut to \neventually take over his father's business, the F.D. Rich Company, \nwhich had been founded in 1920. For more than 60 years, he and his \nbrother, Frank D. Rich, Jr., grew their father's construction company \ninto one of our Nation's foremost real estate development firms. Their \nfamily history in construction and real estate development became an \nimportant part of our national history of economic growth.\n  Under Mr. Rich's leadership, the F.D. Rich Company built innovative \nbuildings where there was a great need both in Stamford, CT, and across \nthe Nation--from shopping centers and office buildings to schools, \nhospitals, and hotels. In 1958 the F.D. Rich Company made its mark on \nour Nation's Capital when it completed the aircraft hangars for Air \nForce One at Andrews Air Force Base. To this day, F.D. Rich continues \nto create interesting and functional urban and suburban buildings that \nadd to our country's landscape.\n  Since his death, Mr. Rich has been deservedly memorialized for \nplaying a significant role in revitalizing the city of Stamford between \n1970 and 2000. The New York Times wrote that he ``transform[ed] \nStamford from a fading industrial town suffering from severe urban \nblight to a thriving city which has emerged as an important center for \ncommerce, culture, education and recreation.'' Mr. Rich led the \ncreation of countless buildings, including an addition to the Stamford \nHospital in 1967, One Landmark Square in 1973, and the Rich Forum in \n1992, which continues to house the city's center for the arts.\n  The University of Connecticut and the Rich family are also closely \nconnected. In 1934 Mr. Rich's father oversaw the construction of the \nWilbur Cross Library at UConn's Storrs campus. When UConn opened its \ndowntown Stamford campus, the Riches helped build the Rich Concourse, \nwhich to this day serves as a central meeting place on campus.\n  In addition to Bob Rich's community involvement through the F.D. Rich \nCompany and at UConn, he was involved in numerous national and local \norganizations including the Boys and Girls Club of Stamford, the \nRegional Plan Association, and Stamford's State Street Debating \nSociety. He and his family founded the Rich Foundation, which continues \nto serve nonprofit organizations, primarily in Fairfield County, \nenriching Connecticut's arts, education, health care, and social \nservices.\n  Bob was beloved by family and friends throughout his life, and he \nwill be remembered by countless residents who live and make memories in \nthe spaces he built. I invite my colleagues to pay tribute to a man who \nforever changed the Stamford skyline and improved the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1125-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING LAVONE PAIRE DAVIS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Lavone ``Pepper'' Paire Davis, the baseball star and \npioneer in women's professional sports who died in Los Angeles last \nmonth at age 88. Ms. Paire Davis was one of the models for Dottie \nHinson, the immortal Geena Davis character in the hit film ``A League \nof Their Own,'' and she was a role model for millions of women and \ngirls across the country.\n  Lavone Paire was born in Los Angeles and grew up playing baseball \nwith her older brother Joe on the streets of West L.A. By age 9, she \nwas playing for an amateur team in Santa Monica and later she and her \ngood friend Faye Dancer played together on a girls softball team known \nas the Dr. Peppers.\n  In 1944, Lavone was working as a shipyard welder and taking classes \nat UCLA when she and Faye were recruited to join the All-American Girls \nProfessional Baseball League, AAGPBL, which recently had been launched \nby Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley and other major league owners \nto help maintain fan interest while many major league players were away \nat war.\n  Pepper Paire quickly distinguished herself as an outstanding \ndefensive catcher who could also play shortstop and third base, pitch \nwhen needed, and drive in runs in clutch situations. She also cowrote \n``Victory Song,'' the AAGPBL's anthem, which was later featured in ``A \nLeague of Their Own.'' She helped the Racine Belles win the league \nchampionship in 1946 and was named to the AAGPBL all-star team in 1948.\n  In 1953, Pepper left baseball to marry Robert Davis, start a family, \nand establish an electronics business with her friend Faye Dancer. But \n``A League of Their Own'' brought Ms. Paire Davis back in the public \neye. A popular speaker, she used her renewed fame to promote women's \nprofessional sports and urge girls to fulfill their athletic dreams. In \n2009 she published ``Dirt in the Skirt,'' a book about her adventures \nin the AAGPBL.\n  Lavone Paire Davis was a true inspiration both on and off the \nbaseball diamond. On behalf of the people of California, I send my \ngratitude and condolences to her brother Joe, sons William and Rob, \ndaughter Susan Gardner, four grandchildren, and great-grandson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1125-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agree \nto the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 307) to reauthorize \ncertain programs under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to public health security and \nall-hazards preparedness and response, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 1928a, and \nthe order of the House of January 3, 2013, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Members on the part of the House to the United States Group \nof the NATO Parliamentary Assembly: Mr. Poe of Texas, Vice Chair, Mr. \nShimkus of Illinois, Mr. Jeff Miller of Florida, Mr. Guthrie of \nKentucky, Mr. Marino of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Cotton of Arkansas.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to section 3166(b) of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law \n112-239), the Minority Leader appoints the following individual on the \npart of the House of Representatives to the Congressional Advisory \nPanel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise: Ellen \nTauscher of Washington, DC.\n  The message further announced that pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2702, the \nMinority Leader appoints the following member on the part of the House \nof Representatives to the Advisory Committee on the Records of \nCongress: Mr. John A.

A bill to promote the development of local strategies to \ncoordinate use of assistance under sections 8 and 9 of the United \nStates Housing Act of 1937 with public and private resources, to enable \neligible families to achieve economic independence and self-\nsufficiency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Family Self-\nSufficiency Act, and I am pleased this Congress to be joined in this \neffort by my colleague, Senator Blunt of Missouri.\n  The Family Self Sufficiency, FSS, program is an existing Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, HUD, employment and savings incentive \ninitiative for families that have section 8 vouchers or live in public \nhousing. The FSS program provides two key tools for its participants: \nfirst, it provides access to the resources and training that help \nparticipants pursue employment opportunities and meet financial goals, \nand second, it encourages FSS families to save by establishing an \ninterest-bearing escrow account for them. Upon graduation from the FSS \nprogram, the family can use these savings to pay for job-related \nexpenses, such as additional workforce training or the purchase or \nmaintenance of a car needed for commuting purposes.\n  Our bipartisan legislation seeks to enhance the FSS program by \nstreamlining the administration of this program, by broadening the \nsupportive services that can be provided to a participant, and by \nextending the FSS program to tenants who live in privately-owned \nproperties with project-based assistance. In short, we seek to make the \nFSS program easier to administer and more effective.\n  First, to streamline the FSS program, our bill would combine two \nseparate FSS programs into one. Today, HUD operates one FSS program for \nthose families served by the Housing Choice Voucher Program and another \nfor those families served by the Public Housing program. This is the \ncase even though the core purpose of each FSS program, to increase \neconomic independence and self-sufficiency, is the same. Unfortunately, \nPublic Housing Agencies, PHA, have to operate essentially two programs \nto achieve the same goal. With our bill, PHAs would be relieved of this \nunnecessary burden.\n  Second, our legislation broadens the scope of the supportive services \nthat may be offered to include attainment of a GED, education in \npursuit of a post-secondary degree or certification, and training in \nfinancial literacy. Providing families in need with affordable rental \nhousing is critical, but coupling it with the support and services to \nhelp families get ahead increases the effectiveness of this federal \ninvestment. Our legislation makes it easier for FSS participants to \nobtain the training necessary to secure employment and the education to \nmake prudent financial decisions to better safeguard their earnings.\n  Lastly, our bill opens up the FSS program to families who live in \nprivately-owned properties subsidized with project-based rental \nassistance. It shouldn't matter what kind of housing assistance a \nfamily gets, and families seeking to achieve self-sufficiency shouldn't \nbe held back by this sort of technicality.\n  I thank Senator Blunt for his partnership, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this bipartisan bill, which will help give those receiving \nhousing assistance a better chance to build their skills and achieve \neconomic independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Johanns):\n  S. 458. A bill to improve and extend certain nutrition programs; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, my colleagues, I rise today to introduce \na bill that has a long title: Improve Nutrition Program Integrity and \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2013. Big title, but it is a good bill.\n  Last June, I stood in this body, along with Chairperson Stabenow of \nthe Agriculture Committee, to encourage my colleagues to pass \nbipartisan reform legislation known as the farm bill.\n  The legislation we put together in the Senate Agriculture Committee \nwould have strengthened and preserved the safety net for our farmers \nand ranchers while also being responsible to taxpayers by providing \nbillions of dollars for deficit reduction. At the time we were told by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, that the farm bill passed by \nthe Agriculture Committee, one of the first bills, by the way, that we \nwere able to pass under regular order and in record amount of time, \n2\\1/2\\ days--the CBO estimated at that time the farm bill that was \npassed by the Agriculture Committee in the Senate would save $24 \nbillion over 10 years, including $4 billion from the nutrition title.\n  However, according to the latest CBO projections, a projection that \nhas reverberated in farm country, released just last Friday, the farm \nbill we passed last year would now only save $13 billion and no longer \nrepresents savings in the nutrition title. We could have done more last \nyear, and we must do more this year to rein in the largest expenditure \nwithin the Department of Agriculture budget.\n  No, it does not go to farmers. We are talking about specifically the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, called SNAP, more commonly \nknown as food stamps.\n  In the context of sequestration, SNAP was exempted from any across-\nthe-board cuts, along with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. It \nwas in that pasture. A lot of other things were in different pastures, \nespecially national security.\n  However, it is clear there are several areas within the program that \ncould provide significant savings that were, unfortunately, left \nuntouched. The legislation I introduce today, along with Senator \nJohanns and Senator Thune, builds off of several amendments previously \noffered in a piecemeal fashion. We have wrapped them all together. Each \nshould be enacted, but combined in this bill they represent over $36 \nbillion in savings.\n  By eliminating loopholes, duplicative programs, unnecessary bonuses, \ninflation adjustments, and restricting lottery winners from receiving \nbenefits, this legislation will instill and restore integrity to SNAP \nwhile still providing benefits to those truly in need. I ought to \nrepeat that this restores integrity to SNAP while still providing \nbenefits to those truly in need.\n  I am not proposing a dramatic change in the policy of nutrition \nprograms. Instead, this legislation enforces the principles of good \ngovernment and returns SNAP spending to much more responsible levels. \nWhile saving over $36 billion, our legislation also makes commonsense \nand comprehensive reforms to SNAP, the Food Stamp Program, that can and \nshould be enacted immediately.\n  Over one-half of the SNAP food benefits in our country are utilized \nby households with children, and SNAP can play, and does play, a \ncritical role in helping people put food on the table in times of need. \nHowever, at least 17 States, I am sorry to report, 17 States are gaming \nthe system by designing their Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram--the acronym for that is\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nLIHEAP, a very commonly used term with regards to nutrition programs \nand the energy programs. But these 17 States designed their programs to \nexploit the Food Stamp Program. This is not right. It is not right.\n  The LIHEAP loophole works like this: A participating State agency \nannually issues extremely low LIHEAP benefits to qualify otherwise \nineligible households for standard utility allowances, which then \nresult in increased monthly food stamp benefits. For example, today a \nState agency can issue only $1 annually in LIHEAP benefits to increase \nmonthly food stamp benefits on an average of $90 a month. That is \n$1,080 per year for households that do not otherwise pay out-of-pocket \nutility bills.\n  That is not right. Last year the Senate farm bill included a \nprovision to tighten the LIHEAP loophole. Even though it would only \nreduce the loophole, it set the minimum qualifying LIHEAP benefit at \n$10 annually--not $1, $10. At the time it would have saved taxpayers \nnearly $450 million every year for a total of $4 billion over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  Completely eliminating the LIHEAP loophole, as my legislation does, \nwill save taxpayers $12 billion. Let me be very clear about it. \nEliminating the LIHEAP loophole does not affect SNAP eligibility for \nanyone using the Food Stamp Program. Eliminating the LIHEAP loophole \nwould only decrease SNAP benefits for those who would not otherwise \nqualify for the higher SNAP benefits, the food stamp benefits.\n  Let me point out another area that must be reformed: States using \ncategorical eligibility for automatic eligibility to provide food stamp \nbenefits. Categorical eligibility is simply known as Cat-El. It was \ndesigned to help streamline the administration of SNAP by allowing \nhouseholds to be certified as eligible for the food stamp benefits and \nbe certified without evaluating household assets or gross income, a \nprevious requirement.\n  Now, 42 States, unfortunately--I do not like to report these kinds of \nthings. However, 42 States are exploiting an unintended loophole of the \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families Program and simply provided \ninformational brochures and informational 1-800 numbers to maximize the \nfood stamp enrollment and the corresponding increase in Federal food \nbenefits.\n  These States are gaming the system to bring otherwise ineligible SNAP \nparticipants into the program. My legislation ties categorical \neligibility to cash assistance, thereby eliminating this loophole. That \nsaves taxpayers $11.5 billion, a lot of money. To be clear, this \nrepresents a cut to SNAP food benefits. However, this amount represents \nthe amount of benefits to people who would not otherwise be eligible \nfor these benefits were it not for States gaming the system.\n  In an ongoing effort to streamline government programs and reduce \nredundancy and taxpayer spending, we should also look at the \nunnecessary spending in Federal employment and training programs. \nAccording to a GAO report last year, there are currently 47 such \nprograms that annually cost $18 billion. Let me repeat that. There are \n47 programs annually costing $18 billion--Federal employment and \ntraining programs.\n  Nobody would object to a Federal employment and training program \ngiven the problems we have with our country. But 47, according to a GAO \nreport, $18 billion. Eliminating the duplicative SNAP employment and \ntraining programs would save more than $4 billion and would not affect \nSNAP food benefits. I repeat. This provision of this legislation would \nnot cut the buying power of any food stamp household to put food in \ntheir refrigerators and also their kitchen cupboards.\n  What am I talking about? In addition to the base program funding that \nwe are talking about with employment and training help, States have the \noption of providing their own funding to their State education and \ntraining program. Then the Department of Agriculture is required to \nmatch that.\n  Currently, four States receive over 80 percent of the total 50-50 \nmatch funding. Four States, 80 percent? What about the rest of the \nStates? They include New York, California, Pennsylvania, and New \nJersey. New York, 36, 37, percent; California, 21 percent; \nPennsylvania, about 13 percent; New Jersey, about 10.\n  This optional 50-50 Federal match is uncapped. It can be used by \nStates to provide reimbursement for participant expenses in regard to \neducation and training that are deemed reasonable and necessary. But \nsomebody has to define ``reasonable and necessary.'' The following \nitems have come under ``reasonable and necessary,'' especially in these \nfour States: union dues, test fees, clothing and tools required for the \njob, relocation expenses, licensing, bonding fees, transportation, \nchildcare, tennis lessons. I made that up. I thought it would catch \nyour attention, Mr. President. No, there are no tennis lessons. There \nmight be, could be. But at least in regards to this reform, let's go to \nanother provision of my legislation.\n  It ends the USDA practice of giving $48 million in awards every year \nto State agencies for basically doing their job to ensure proper use of \nthe American tax dollar. Currently, bonuses are given to States for \n``best program access,'' signing up as many people for food stamps as \npossible. ``Most improved program access.'' How many more people signed \nup for SNAP compared to the previous year? So if you sign up more \npeople then you signed up last year, well, you get an award. ``Best \napplication timeliness.'' That is handling applications within the \nrequired guidelines, and we are getting a benefit from that.\n  State agencies are rewarded for performing the minimum expectations \nfor stewardship of the Food Stamp Program and also of the American tax \ndollar. The bonuses are not even required to be used for food stamp \nadministration. A recipient State may choose the funding for any State \npriority. So we are talking about $48 million.\n  That goes to State agencies of these four Oscar Awards in regard to \nfood stamps, but they can use the funding for anything, for any State \npriority. Eliminating these unnecessary State bonuses will save \ntaxpayers, over 10 years, $480 million.\n  Another area where my legislation streamlines government programs is \nthrough the elimination of the SNAP Nutrition Education Grant Program. \nA number of existing nutrition education programs are delivered more \nequitably with a cost-benefit ratio that makes more sense, at least six \nFederal programs administered by the Department of Agriculture and the \nNational Institutes of Health and Land Grant University Extension \nPrograms.\n  In practice, the SNAP Nutrition Education Program is inequitably \ndistributed with the top four States--here we go again--receiving over \n54 percent of the funding. The bottom 33 State agencies receive less \nthan 1 percent of the total funding. That is not right.\n  Additionally our bill ends inflation adjustments for countable \nresources and for emergency food assistance, saving over $600 million.\n  The legislation also terminates the ongoing stimulus of several years \nago enacted by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, \nwhich provided extra funding to increase monthly SNAP food benefits.\n  Finally, the legislation does prohibit lottery winners--Senator \nStabenow insisted on this in the last farm bill and it makes a lot of \nsense--from receiving SNAP benefits and keeps them from receiving new \nbenefits if they do not meet the financial requirements of SNAP.\n  Overall, by eliminating several duplicative programs, closing \nloopholes, and ending unnecessary spending, the Improve Nutrition \nProgram Integrity and Deficit Reduction Act will save taxpayers over \n$36 billion, the latest score by the CBO.\n  I understand the importance of domestic food assistance programs for \nmany hard-working Americans, including many Kansans. I know that. In \n1996, when I was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, there was \nan effort to send the Food Stamp Program back to the States--and the \nGovernors wanted it. They wanted the money, they didn't want the food \nstamps. We made an effort under a very historic farm bill at that time \nnot only to save and reform but restore integrity to the Food Stamp \nProgram. We have another opportunity right now. I do understand the \nimportance of domestic food assistance programs for many hard-working \nAmericans and Kansans.\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\n  My goal is very simple, again restoring integrity to the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program in a commonsense and comprehensive manner. \nEnacting this package of reforms will allow the Federal Government to \ncontinue to help those who truly need SNAP food benefits and \nassistance.\n  Again, I thank Senators Thune and Johanns for their assistance in \nthis effort. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nthese reforms for the benefit of all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Casey, Mr. Franken, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Baldwin, \n        Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Merkley, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Cowan):\n  S. 460. A bill to provide for an increase in the Federal minimum \nwage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for several years now I have come to the \nfloor to talk about the need to bolster the middle class in this \ncountry and restore the American Dream. The American Dream is supposed \nto be about building a better life. If you work hard and play by the \nrules, you should be able to support your family, join the middle \nclass, and provide a bright future for your children.\n  But tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are earning at or \nnear the minimum wage are not only struggling to reach the middle class \nand achieve the American Dream, they are falling behind. We need to do \nmore to support these workers as they try to build opportunity for \ntheir families and their futures. A critical first step is to ensure \nthat they earn a fair day's pay for a hard day's work. That is why \ntoday I am joining with Congressman George Miller to introduce the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 2013 to raise the minimum wage.\n  Our bill will do three things: first, it will gradually increase the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three annual steps. Second, our bill \nwill link future increases in the minimum wage to the cost of living, \nthrough the Consumer Price Index, so that people who are trying to get \nahead don't fall behind as our economy grows. Finally, our bill will--\nfor the first time in more than 20 years--raise the minimum wage for \nworkers who earn tips, from a paltry $2.13 per hour to a level that is \n70 percent of the regular minimum wage. This will be gradually phased \nin over the course of 6 years, which will give businesses time to \nadjust while providing more fairness for hardworking people in tipped \nindustries.\n  These raises are long overdue. Over the past several decades, average \nwages in this country have stagnated, but the minimum wage has actually \ndeclined in real terms. It has not kept up with costs, average wages, \nor rapid growth in productivity.\n  Since its peak in 1968, the minimum wage has lost 31 percent of its \npurchasing power. That means minimum-wage workers are effectively \nearning almost a third less than they did four decades ago. In fact, if \nthe minimum wage had kept up with rising prices for food, rent, \nutilities, clothing, and other goods, then the wage would be $10.56 \ntoday. But instead it's $7.25. My bill will restore much of the buying \npower of the minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage also used to be a meaningful standard compared with \nwhat most people earned and compared with what workers in the economy \nproduced. In 1968, it was just over half of average production wages. \nBut today the minimum wage has fallen to 37 percent of the average \nproduction wage.\n  While Americans are working longer and harder than ever, their \npaychecks don't reflect their contribution. Workers are much more \nproductive now than in the past. Productivity has risen more than 130 \npercent since 1968. But average wages have not budged in real terms and \nthe minimum wage has lost ground. So while companies have reaped the \nbenefits of all this productivity growth, the people who actually do \nthe work have seen none of these gains.\n  As Congress has allowed the minimum wage to languish, working \nfamilies have fallen below the poverty line. In the 1960s and 1970s, \nthe minimum wage kept a family of three above the poverty line--20 \npercent above it in 1968. But today, a family of three with one minimum \nwage earner working full-time, year-round, will bring home a paycheck \nthat is 18 percent below the poverty line.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act will restore the value of the minimum wage, \nbringing families back above the poverty line, to 106 percent of the \npoverty line for a family of three. With its provision to index the \nminimum wage to the cost of living in the future, the minimum wage will \nno longer lose value. It will rise as the economy grows, which will \nallow working families to keep up with rising costs.\n  I think it is very important that we talk about the people who will \nbenefit from the Fair Minimum Wage Act. There are 30 million Americans \nwho will get a fair wage because of this bill, either directly by the \nlegislation or indirectly through the ``trickle up'' effects of a \nhigher wage floor. That's one out of five workers in our country that \nwill be impacted.\n  They do the hard, important jobs to keep our economy running. They \nare cashiers and sales help in stores; waiters, waitresses, bussers, \nrunners and hostesses in restaurants. They care for our children, \nelders, and other loved ones. They help us at the gas station or in the \nparking garage. They clean offices and homes, and maintain buildings \nand grounds. They provide administrative support in offices. They work \nin the fields to bring food to our tables. They all deserve a fair \nwage.\n  The families of these 30 million workers will also benefit. Eighteen \nmillion children have parents who will get a raise. This will be so \nmeaningful for these families, who are working to build a better life. \nFor a full-time, year-round worker earning right at the minimum wage, \nit will mean gradually moving from $15,000 a year to $21,000 a year. \nThink about that. Most of us in this Chamber would not take too much \nnotice of a $6,000 raise. But for minimum wage workers, that's nearly \n40 percent more, and that will go a long way to buying groceries and \nschool supplies, paying rent, and saving for college or retirement.\n  Everyone in our country who works hard and plays by the rules \ndeserves these opportunities: and not just to survive, but to aspire to \nthe middle class.\n  Raising the minimum wage will benefit our economy as well. With an \nincrease in the minimum wage, workers will have more money to spend. \nThis is just basic economics: increased demand means increased economic \nactivity. They will spend their money in their local economies, giving \na boost to Main Street. In fact, economists estimate that the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act will boost our GDP by $33 billion as it is implemented \nover the course of three years, generating 140,000 jobs in that time.\n  We know we can afford this. Wages aren't stuck at rock-bottom levels \nbecause our economy isn't growing. Our economy is growing. The problem \nis that growth is going to profits, to shareholders and executives. \nInequality is at the highest level we have seen since the eve of the \nGreat Depression. CEOs are raking in millions, while the people who do \nthe real work in this country are struggling just to get by. In 2011, \nS 500 CEOs earned an average of $13 million. The average CEO earns \nmore before lunchtime on his first day of work than a minimum wage \nworker earns all year. That is simply appalling.\n  Now some people, specially the big corporations with these lavish \nsalaries, will criticize my bill, saying it will force businesses to \nlay off workers or cut back their hours. They say workers will be hurt \nif the minimum wage goes up. But history proves that these assertions \nare just plain wrong. We know from decades of rigorous research \nanalyzing the real-life effects of minimum wage increases that minimum \nwage raises along the lines what I am proposing do not result in job \nlosses or reduced hours. Second, these raises do, in fact, boost \nworkers' earnings. This research applies to teenagers, too. I will say \nit again: minimum wage increases do not cause teenage unemployment.\n  So we will not see negative effects from raising the minimum wage. \nBut\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nwe will see positive effects for businesses and our economy. We know \nthat increased wages boosts productivity and morale. Turnover falls \nsignificantly, which saves businesses thousands of dollars in \nrecruitment, hiring, and training costs. Moreover, all businesses would \nhave the same minimum wage, meaning businesses that are doing the right \nthing by paying fair wages will not be undercut by competitors who pay \nrock-bottom wages.\n  The American public knows that opponents' outlandish claims about \nraising the minimum wage don't hold water. That is why raising the \nminimum wage is incredibly popular among the American public. A \nnational poll last year showed that 73 percent of Americans support \nraising the minimum wage to $10 an hour and linking it in the future to \nthe cost of living. Even 50 percent of Republicans support raising and \nindexing the minimum wage. A 2011 poll showed that more than seventy \npercent of Americans believe that indexing the minimum wage to keep up \nwith inflation will be good for the country.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act has been endorsed by nearly 200 national \nand local organizations around the country, and the support is only \ngrowing. They represent a wide cross-section of the American community. \nThey are working to end poverty, hunger, and homelessness; to increase \ncommunity involvement; and to ensure fairness for women and people of \ncolor. They are organizations of people of faith and organizations of \nworkers. They are retirees and moms and members of the LGBT community. \nThey are social workers, direct care workers, and steelworkers. And \nthey are small businesses. The bill has been endorsed by the US Women's \nChamber of Commerce, representing 500,000 small businesses around the \ncountry; by the Main Street Alliance, with chapters in a dozen states \nand 12,000 small business members; by the American Sustainable Business \nCouncil, which along with its member organizations represents more than \n150,000 businesses nationwide, as well as more than 300,000 \nentrepreneurs, managers and investors; and by Business for a Fair \nMinimum Wage and Business for Shared Prosperity.\n  Because raising the minimum wage is so popular, and so necessary, \nmany States have moved ahead of the Federal Government to do so. \nNineteen states and the District of Columbia have raised their minimum \nwage above the federal level, all across the country. Ten states have \nalready implemented annual indexing of the minimum wage to keep up with \nthe rising cost of living. Thirty States have increased their minimum \nwage for tipped workers above the Federal level.\n  I am proud to introduce the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013. It is long \npast time to give Americans a raise. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to declare English as the official language of the \nUnited States, to establish a uniform English language rule for \nnaturalization, and to avoid misconstructions of the English language \ntexts of the laws of the United States, pursuant to Congress' powers to \nprovide for the general welfare of the United States and to establish a \nuniform rule of naturalization under article I, section 8, of the \nConstitution; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that I believe is of great importance to the unity of the \nAmerican people--the English Language Unity Act of 2013.\n  That English Language Unity Act of 2013 recognizes the practical \nreality of the role of English as our national language and makes \nEnglish the official language of the United States government, a status \nin law it has not had before, and calls on government to preserve and \nenhance the role of English as the official language.\n  Let me be clear, nothing in the bill prohibits the use of a language \nother than English. The bill specifically exempts certain actions from \nrequiring English, such as actions necessary for national security, \ntrade, and protecting the public health and safety. The English \nLanguage Unity Act is an attempt to legislate a common sense language \npolicy that a nation of immigrants needs one national language. Our \nNation was settled by a group of people with a common vision. As our \npopulation has grown, our cultural diversity has grown as well. This \ndiversity is part of what makes our nation great.\n  However, we must be able to communicate with one another so that we \ncan\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\nappreciate our differences. When members of our society cannot speak a \ncommon language, misunderstandings arise. Furthermore, the individuals \nwho do not speak the language of the majority miss out on many \nopportunities to advance in society and achieve the American Dream.\n  The English Language Unity Act of 2013 requires the establishment of \na uniform language requirement for naturalization and requires that all \nnaturalization ceremonies be conducted in English. I want to empower \nnew immigrants coming to our nation by helping them understand and \nbecome successful in their new home. I believe that one of the most \nimportant ways immigrants can achieve success is by learning English.\n  There is enormous popular support for English as the official \nlanguage according to polling that has taken place over the last few \nyears. A large majority of Americans support making English the \nofficial language of the United States. There is also widespread and \nbipartisan support for this legislation, and I hope that you will join \nme this Congress in supporting the English Language Unity Act of 2013.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``English Language Unity Act \n     of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds and declares the following:\n       (1) The United States is comprised of individuals from \n     diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds, and \n     continues to benefit from this rich diversity.\n       (2) Throughout the history of the United States, the common \n     thread binding individuals of differing backgrounds has been \n     the English language.\n       (3) Among the powers reserved to the States respectively is \n     the power to establish the English language as the official \n     language of the respective States, and otherwise to promote \n     the English language within the respective States, subject to \n     the prohibitions enumerated in the Constitution of the United \n     States and in laws of the respective States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about a \nresolution I have submitted which calls on the President of the United \nStates to posthumously pardon the world's first African-American \nheavyweight champion, John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson. I am proud to be \njoined in this effort by my friend, the majority leader, Harry Reid and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts Mr. Cowan.\n  I would point out that the majority leader of the Senate was once an \nexcellent fighter himself, of great skill and agility, which he \ncontinues to display here as majority leader of the Senate. I would \nalso like to thank him for his commitment to the sport of boxing and \nfor joining me again in attempting to do justice for a man who was done \na great injustice.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the story of the late \nJack Johnson, he is considered by many to be the most dominant athlete \nin boxing history. Arthur John Johnson was born in Galveston, TX, in \n1878 to parents who were former slaves. At an early age, he realized \nhis talent for the sweet science. In order to make a living, Johnson \ntraveled across the country fighting anyone willing to face him. But he \nwas denied repeatedly, on purely racial grounds, a chance to fight for \nthe world heavyweight title. For too long African-American fighters \nwere not seen as legitimate contenders for the championship. \nFortunately, after years of perseverance, Johnson was finally granted \nan opportunity in 1908 to fight the then-reigning title holder, Tommy \nBurns, in Sydney, Australia. Even though the fight lasted 14 rounds, \nJohnson handily defeated Burns to become the first African-American \nheavyweight champion of the world.\n  Jack Johnson's success in the ring, and sometimes indulgent lifestyle \noutside of it, fostered resentment among many and raised concerns that \nhis continued dominance in the ring would somehow disrupt what was then \nperceived by many as a racial order. So as history tells us, a search \nfor a Caucasian boxer who could defeat Johnson began. This recruitment \neffort became known as the search for the ``Great White Hope.'' The so-\ncalled hope arrived in the person of former champion Jim Jeffries, who \nreturned from retirement to fight Johnson in 1910. Johnson went on to \ndefeat Jeffries, and as a shameful consequence race riots broke out in \nseveral cities as many sought to avenge Jeffries' defeat.\n  Following the loss of the ``Great White Hope,'' the Federal \nGovernment launched an investigation into the legality of Johnson's \nrelationships with Caucasian women. At that time the Mann Act, which \nwas enacted in 1910, outlawed the transport of Caucasian women across \nState lines for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery or for ``any \nother immoral purpose.'' Using the ``any other immoral purpose'' clause \nas a pretext, Federal law enforcement officials set out to get Jack \nJohnson.\n  On October 18, 1912, the Federal Government got their man. On that \nday, Johnson was arrested for transporting his Caucasian girlfriend \nacross State lines in violation of the Mann Act. However, the charges \nwere subsequently dropped when the Caucasian female, whose mother had \noriginally tipped off Federal officials, refused to cooperate with \nauthorities. She later married Jack Johnson.\n  Not to be outdone, the Federal authorities remained persistent in \ntheir determination to persecute Johnson, persuading a former scorned \nCaucasian\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\ngirlfriend of Johnson's to testify that he had transported her across \nState lines. Her testimony resulted in Johnson's conviction in 1913, \nwhen he was sentenced to 1 year and a day in Federal prison. During \nJohnson's appeal, one prosecutor admitted:\n\n       Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but \n     that it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the \n     evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks.\n\n  After the trial, Johnson fled the country to Canada and then traveled \nto various European and South American countries before losing his \nheavyweight champion title in Cuba in 1915. Ultimately overcome by \nhomesickness, Jack Johnson returned to the United States in 1920, \nsurrendering to Federal authorities, and served nearly 1 year in \nFederal prison. Despite this obvious and clear injustice, Johnson \nrefused to turn his back on the country that betrayed him. Mr. Johnson \ndied in an automobile accident in 1946 at the age of 68 years.\n  Today, as we look back on our Nation's history, the Jack Johnson case \nis a shameful stain apparent to all. Rectifying this injustice is long \noverdue. The resolution we submit today calls on the President to \npardon Mr. Johnson posthumously. It recognizes the unjustness of what \ntranspired and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was \nforced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice. Jack Johnson may have \nbeen a flawed individual, and he was certainly controversial during his \nday, but he was also a historic American figure whose life and \naccomplishments played an instrumental role in our Nation's development \nand progress toward true equality under the law.\n  There is no doubt Jack Johnson deserved much better than a racially \nmotivated conviction which denied him his liberty and served to \ndiminish his athletic, cultural, and historic significance. As a body \nwe should adopt this resolution and continue to fight for a posthumous \npardon for Jack Johnson to afford future generations the opportunity to \ngrasp fully what Jack Johnson accomplished--against great odds--and \nappreciate his contributions to society unencumbered by the taint of an \nunjust, racially motivated criminal conviction.\n  Sadly, there is no way for us to possibly right the wrong that was \ndone to Jack Johnson during his lifetime, but what we can do is take \nthis small step toward acknowledging his mistreatment and remove the \ncloud that casts a shadow on his legacy. After all, that cloud over \nJack Johnson's legacy says more about our past wrongs than it could \nhonestly ever say about Johnson's own. As such, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport and swiftly adopt the resolution which requests the President \nof the United States grant Jack Johnson a posthumous pardon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/05/senate-section/article/S1134-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1134-S1135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nJOHN ARTHUR ``JACK'' JOHNSON SHOULD RECEIVE A POSTHUMOUS PARDON FOR THE \n  RACIALLY MOTIVATED CONVICTION IN 1913 THAT DIMINISHED THE ATHLETIC, \n    CULTURAL, AND HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF JACK JOHNSON AND UNDULY \n                        TARNISHED HIS REPUTATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Cowan) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                             S.
