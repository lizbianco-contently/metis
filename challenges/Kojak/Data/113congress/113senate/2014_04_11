Mr. President, this week we celebrate the 30th annual \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week, and the 30th anniversary of the \npassage of the Victims of Crime Act. It is a time to recognize the \nlosses faced by victims of crime and their families, and to acknowledge \nthe efforts of those who work so hard to ensure the protection and \nwell-being of crime victims in Vermont and across the nation. It is \nalso a time to reflect on all that we have accomplished together over \nthe past three decades, and to focus on what more we must do to support \nand protect victims of crime. I have long supported victims of crime \nthrough the Victims of Crime Act, and I was proud to cosponsor the \nSenate resolution supporting the mission and goals of National Crime \nVictims' Rights Week 2014.\n  One of our most effective tools to serve and support victims is the \nCrime Victims Fund. In 1984, the Senate voted to pass the Victims of \nCrime Act--VOCA--which created the Fund. The Fund is rightfully \nsustained by criminal fines and penalties, not by taxpayer dollars, and \nprovides funding and support for victim services across the country. \nThese services include funding for victim assistance, and compensation \nprograms to help with medical, funeral, and burial costs, mental health \ncounseling, and lost wages.\n  In 1996, after the Oklahoma City bombing, I supported the creation of \nan Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve Fund to support communities in the \nwake of acts of mass violence. These funds provide emergency relief and \nassistance in the wake of tragedies that might otherwise overwhelm the \nresources of the State's crime victim compensation and victim \nassistance services. That Emergency Reserve Fund has been used to \nsupport communities in the aftermath of shootings at Virginia Tech, \nAurora, and Newtown, and most recently to cover longer term victim \nassistance for the marathon bombing victims in Boston. The Office of \nVictims of Crime also provides funding directly to other federal \nagencies to support assistance to victims of mass violence and \nterrorism, including the Department of the Army following the 2011 Fort \nHood shooting.\n  The Crime Victims Fund has a long history of supporting victims of \ncrime. I am grateful that in the Fiscal Year 2014 Omnibus \nAppropriations Bill, we were able to raise the cap on the Fund by $15 \nmillion. This is a historic and hard-won achievement that translates to \nmore money for victims' assistance grants. Yet despite the increase, \nsupport for direct victim assistance remains 13 percent behind where \nfunding levels were 15 years ago. As a result, 1.3 million fewer \nvictims today are receiving help funded under VOCA. It is clear that \nmore work remains to be done on behalf of victims of crime.\n  This year, I led a letter with Senator Crapo requesting that the \nSenate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\non Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies set the cap on \nobligations from the Fund as high as possible. As States are forced to \ntighten their belts, victim services are being cut all over the \ncountry. Without Federal assistance from this trust fund, victims' \ncompensation programs and victims' assistance programs and services \nwould be unavailable to many.\n  I am also proud to be the lead sponsor of the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act, which is another important measure that \nstrengthens crime victims' rights and improves crime victims' services. \nThis bipartisan bill was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nOctober 2013 and every Democratic Senator has cleared this bill for \nimmediate passage by the Senate. This is a strong, comprehensive bill \nthat has the support of many Senators, including Senators Cornyn and \nMcConnell. There is no reason that this important bill should not be \npassed as soon as possible.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the original Justice for All Act of \n2004. The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an \nenormous impact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them. This \nlegislation strengthens key rights for crime victims, reauthorizes the \nDebbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, includes provisions to improve \nthe quality of indigent defense, and increases access to post-\nconviction DNA testing to protect the innocent. It strengthens the \nrights guaranteed to crime victims in the criminal justice process and \nensures that basic services, like the rapid testing of rape kits, help \nvictims receive the justice, safety and closure they deserve. This \nlegislation also increases authorized funding for the Paul Coverdell \nForensic Science Improvement Grant Program. This vital program assists \nforensic laboratories in performing the many forensic tests that are \nessential to solving crimes and prosecuting those who commit those \ncrimes so that victims have peace of mind knowing that justice will be \nserved. I urge my fellow senators to support the passage of this vital \nlegislation.\n  I was also extremely proud when the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013 was signed into law last year by \nPresident Obama. This is legislation, which I introduced with Senator \nCrapo, reauthorized the critical Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. \nWhen we enacted VAWA 20 years ago, it sent a powerful message that we \nwill not tolerate crimes against women, and the law forever altered the \nway our Nation combats domestic and sexual violence. Just as it did \nnearly 20 years ago, this reauthorization offers support to the victims \nof these terrible crimes and helps them find safety and rebuild their \nlives. It was crafted with a great deal of input from victims and the \ntireless professionals who work to support them every day, and I am \ngrateful for their support and assistance.\n  The VAWA reauthorization takes responsible and moderate steps, in \nthis case to protect immigrant and Native women, and ensuring services \nto all victims, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThis legislation also includes new protections to prevent stalking and \ncampus assault. It is particularly fitting to talk about this in April, \nwhich is also Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.\n  I am glad that the Senate was able to quickly move on this bipartisan \nbill and ensure it was passed in a timely manner. The reauthorization \nof VAWA was approved by the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 78-22. \nThis is an issue that has and should continue to transcend \npartisanship, and we did just that last year when an overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate voted in favor of VAWA. I hope we can continue \nto work together to support women's and victims' rights in the future.\n  This includes supporting the Criminal Justice and Forensic Science \nReform Act, another bipartisan bill that I introduced in March. This \nlegislation represents a comprehensive and commonsense approach toward \nguaranteeing the effectiveness and scientific integrity of forensic \nevidence used in criminal cases. It is critical that Americans have \nfaith in their criminal justice system, and this legislation aims to \nachieve that by promoting national accreditation and certification \nstandards and stronger oversight for forensic labs and practitioners. \nThe Criminal Justice and Forensic Science Reform Act ensures that \nreform efforts will be guided by experts and practitioners with both \ncriminal justice expertise and scientific independence, and it \nestablishes consistent standards in the forensic science disciplines. I \nam glad to be working with Senator Cornyn on this important effort.\n  I have always supported and will continue to support victims' rights. \nAs we recognize the horrific losses victims of crimes have endured, it \nis important that we work towards lessening the effects of these \ntragedies and help victims can recover and rebuild. I look forward to \nworking with my fellow Senators on both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat crime victims are never forgotten, and that they have our strong \nand enduring support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2404-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2404-S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RICHARD CODY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month, I spoke on the Senate floor \nabout a friend from my hometown of Montpelier, VT, GEN Richard Cody. \nGeneral Cody left Montpelier--one of our Nation's smallest State \ncapital--to serve his country, beginning as a student at West Point. He \nhad an outstanding military career serving all over the world and \nculminating with his service as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.\n  General Cody recently returned to Vermont, where he was honored by \nhis alma mater, Montpelier High School. Prior to the testimonial dinner \nsaluting him, General Cody went back to the high school, where he \ninspired students with his patriotism and commitment to making a \npositive difference in the world. In fact, his student audience was so \ninspired with this tremendous leader that he received a standing \novation at the end of his remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article by \nAmy Nixon published in the April 5, 2014, edition of the Barre-\nMontpelier Times Argus in honor of General Cody's return to Vermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, Apr. 5, 2014]\n\n                    General Welcomed Back to Capital\n\n                             (By Amy Nixon)\n\n       Montpelier.--Gen. Richard Cody, a retired four-star general \n     who came up through the ranks at Montpelier High School, \n     returned to his alma mater Friday afternoon to share with \n     students, staff and faculty his story, as well as inspiration \n     for how the coming generation of young Americans can serve \n     their nation as leaders, whether or not they choose to wear a \n     uniform.\n       Cody is a graduate of the Class of 1968, and the message \n     board in front of the high school was changed to welcome him \n     back for the day's events. After high school he went on to \n     West Point and ascended through the ranks to become a four-\n     star general and the 31st vice chief of staff of the Army. He \n     retired in 2008, and serves today as the chairman of the \n     board for ``Homes for our Troops,'' a national nonprofit \n     organization which builds handicapped-accessible homes for \n     disabled veterans and their families.\n       Cody served in the Army for 36 years, and was one of fewer \n     than 40 four star generals in all of the armed forces \n     combined at the time of his retirement.\n       His visit was sponsored by the Montpelier High School \n     Boosters, who are also hosting a dinner tonight in Cody's \n     honor at the Capitol Plaza Hotel as part of their Celebration \n     of Excellence program. A short film presented to Cody at his \n     retirement, about eight minutes in length, was shown, with \n     photos of him as a young boy growing up here to his high \n     school sports accomplishments in newspaper headlines of the \n     day, his high school photo, shots of him during his career in \n     the Army and during his time at West Point, at his wedding, \n     with his children, and with the troops with whom and for whom \n     he served for nearly four decades--including several \n     returning soldiers whose bodies had been tangled by war, and \n     were in military hospitals with the General visiting their \n     bedsides.\n       Cody was known as the ``G.I.'s General,'' and at one time \n     former President George H.W. Bush introduced Cody, quipping, \n     ``Take a good look at him. I'm glad he's on my side!''\n       The film ended with Cody stating, ``You can't ever leave \n     the Army, you just take the uniform off.''\n       After the film, Cody shared stories of what it was like to \n     be the second in command of the U.S. Army, with more than 1.1 \n     million American men and women in active duty, the reserves \n     and National Guard being his responsibility.\n       ``It's great to be back at Montpelier High School with the \n     Solons,'' he said, offering a walk-back through his life \n     before and after the Army by way of providing some life \n     lessons to the hundreds of young people sitting before him in \n     the same seats he once sat in.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n       ``I think back on all the things I learned in the schools \n     here,'' began Cody, saying as he came of age and entered West \n     Point, the United States was in troubled times, with riots \n     playing out in Detroit and elsewhere and an unpopular war in \n     Vietnam being waged. He said he enrolled at West Point with a \n     desire to learn to fly helicopters, thinking he'd be back \n     home in Montpelier in five or six years working at his \n     family's car dealership washing cars and changing oil. \n     Instead, he rose through the ranks and ended up in the halls \n     of the Pentagon.\n       ``I had no idea that I would spend four decades in uniform \n     and travel all over this world,'' he told students, coming \n     down off the stage with a microphone in hand to answer \n     questions after he spoke for some time.\n       Cody credited his upbringing and family, and his teachers \n     and coaches here with helping him to succeed, saying many of \n     the people who supported him through the years in the city's \n     schools ``saw potential in me,'' and encouraged him, as he \n     encouraged the students before him in the assembly to \n     ``choose the harder right over the easier wrong.'' He told \n     the group that really everything they need to know in life \n     they learned as little kids, from saying please and thank you \n     to not cutting line, to holding hands with a friend going out \n     to recess, to sharing toys, and cleaning up your toys when \n     you're done. He urged the high schoolers to be kinder to one \n     another, to support one another, to honor and respect the \n     people in their company now--and always.\n       ``My hope is you will reach the highest potential you have, \n     no matter what it is,'' said Cody. ``Do what's right when \n     everybody else wants you to do something different,'' he \n     urged. He told the students to ``seek the whole truth versus \n     the half truth'' in life.\n       Having traveled the world, including war zones in \n     Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, Cody said ``People want what \n     you have,'' from clean water to plentiful food, sewers that \n     work, books, schooling--including for females--and peace and \n     safety. ``This is a great country. We need to make it \n     better.''\n       ``What type of American citizen do you want to be?'' Cody \n     asked. He urged them to be the type that ``goes into this \n     world to make a difference.'' He told them to be the people \n     who can look themselves in the mirror ``and say, I `did \n     good.' ''\n       Shelby Copans, 18, a junior, asked the general about the \n     lessons he learned, and he responded, ``As a leader, you have \n     to believe every day that everyone in your unit will do well. \n     Everybody has great potential. . . . It's your job to help \n     them reach that potential.'' He also said he learned to not \n     play favorites, ``because that really erodes team work.''\n       ``Respect for each other,'' was another critical component, \n     he said.\n       Students asked him about the Middle East, about the recent \n     shooting at Fort Hood by a military man, and conflicts around \n     the world.\n       Of Aghanistan, he said, ``It's not any better today than it \n     was on 9/11, and I could make the case it's worse.'' Some of \n     the hopes to really change conflicts in other parts of the \n     world are so deep culturally they are things that will take a \n     century to try to change, but the U.S. over and over works to \n     reduce violence, to ``stop things from boiling over,'' he \n     said.\n       A major problem worldwide, he said, is the lack of job \n     opportunity for young people, leading to unrest and \n     recruitment by terrorists.\n       Samantha Flanagan, 15, a freshman, asked Cody about the \n     recent shooting at Fort Hood, where Cody was twice stationed. \n     That shooting left four dead, including the shooter, all \n     members of the military.\n       Cody said the man was likely suffering from post traumatic \n     stress, saying, ``When you mix guns and you have medical \n     issues and mental health issues, it's tragic. We need to \n     figure out why can't we get medical and mental help they need \n     to them faster?''\n       In closing, Cody told students, ``You don't have to join \n     the military to serve this country. You can serve this \n     country in many ways, but if you go into the military, you'll \n     grow faster.''\n       ``Treat each other well, take care of each other,'' he \n     said, thanking those in the auditorium as they rose to their \n     feet, applauding their hometown hero.\n       As the event closed, it was announced that Cody is donating \n     a new custom-made, illuminated scoring table to his alma \n     mater.\n       After the auditorium event, Cody was given a tour of the \n     high school, and there was a reception for him in the \n     library. Later Friday afternoon, Cody was celebrated during a \n     meet and greet at VFW Post 792, an event sponsored by the \n     Montpelier High School Boosters and the American Legion Post \n     3.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2405-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      LOSS OF THE USS ``THRESHER''\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 51 years ago the USS Thresher, a \nnuclear-powered attack submarine built and maintained at Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard, left safe harbor on what was to be her final voyage. \nShe was manned by a crew of 16 officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians. \nJust 1 day later, on the morning of April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher \nwas declared lost with all hands, the largest loss of life in a \nsubmarine accident to-date.\n  I rise today to commemorate the loss of the Thresher and her crew, \nbut also to highlight an important legacy that was borne of this \ntragedy. In the aftermath of the Thresher sinking, the United States \nNavy redoubled its submarine safety certification efforts, resulting in \nthe establishment of the Submarine Safety and Quality Assurance \nProgram, known as SUBSAFE. Today, SUBSAFE is regarded as one of the \nmost comprehensive military safety programs in the world and safeguards \nthe vessels that carry our U.S. Navy personnel to the far depths of the \noceans in defense of our freedom. In the time since the SUBSAFE program \nwas implemented, no SUBSAFE certified submarine has been lost at sea.\n  The legacy of the Thresher and ensuing efforts to improve submarine \nsafety is a testament to the devotion of all submariners past and \npresent and to the commitment of those who support them from land. In \norder to preserve this example of duty for future generations, I have \njoined with members of the New Hampshire and Maine Congressional \ndelegations, both past and present, to support the authorization of a \nmemorial to the USS Thresher on the grounds of the Arlington National \nCemetery. A memorial consistent with the Cemetery's vision of serving \nas ``A national shrine--A living history of freedom--Where dignity and \nhonor rest in solemn repose'' is a fitting tribute to those lives lost.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me today in remembering \nthe USS Thresher. As we remember with profound sorrow the loss of her \ngallant crew, we must also recall the countless lives that have been \nsaved as a result of this sad event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2405-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2405-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2405-4", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Res. 423\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (referred to in this preamble as the ``FDIC''), \n     at least 28.3 percent of households in the United States, or \n     nearly 34,000,000 households with approximately 67,888,000 \n     adults, are unbanked or underbanked and therefore have not \n     had the opportunity to access savings, lending, and other \n     basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the FDIC, approximately 30 percent of \n     banks reported in 2011 that consumers lacked understanding of \n     the financial products and services banks offered;\n       Whereas according to the 2013 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling--\n       (1) approximately 40 percent of adults in the United States \n     gave themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of \n     personal finance, and 78 percent of adults acknowledged that \n     they could benefit from additional advice and answers to \n     everyday financial questions from a professional;\n       (2) 26 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     approximately 61,000,000 individuals, admitted to not paying \n     their bills on time;\n       (3) only 40 percent of adults in the United States reported \n     keeping close track of their spending, a percentage that has \n     held steady since 2007; and\n       (4) more than 40 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     over 100,000,000 individuals, said not having enough ``rainy \n     day'' savings for an emergency is their greatest financial \n     concern, while a slightly lower percentage said that their \n     greatest financial concern is\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\n     not having enough money set aside for retirement;\n\n       Whereas the 2013 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 13 \n     percent of workers were ``very confident'' about having \n     enough money for a comfortable retirement, which is a sharp \n     decline in worker confidence from the 27 percent of workers \n     who were ``very confident'' in 2007, while approximately 54 \n     percent of workers say they or their spouses have not \n     calculated the amount of money they need to save for \n     retirement;\n       Whereas according to a 2014 ``Flow of Funds'' report by the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, outstanding \n     household debt in the United States was $13,100,000,000,000 \n     at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013;\n       Whereas according to the 2014 Survey of the States: \n     Economic and Personal Finance Education in Our Nation's \n     Schools, a biennial report by the Council for Economic \n     Education--\n       (1) only 24 States require students to take an economics \n     course as a high school graduation requirement;\n       (2) only 22 States require testing student knowledge of \n     economics; and\n       (3) only 17 States require students to take a personal \n     finance course either independently or as part of an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement;\n\n       Whereas according to the Gallup-Operation HOPE Financial \n     Literacy Index, only 52.3 percent of students in the United \n     States have money in a bank or credit union account;\n       Whereas expanding access to the safe, mainstream financial \n     system will provide individuals with less expensive and more \n     secure options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     household, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas in 2003, Congress determined that coordinating \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulating a national \n     strategy is important;

and\n       (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of \n     understanding about personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe Financial Literacy Month with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2407-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 424--SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF 2014 \n NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK, WHICH INCLUDE INCREASING PUBLIC \nAWARENESS OF THE RIGHTS, NEEDS, AND CONCERNS OF, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE \n     TO ASSIST, VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Schumer) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

\n     and\n       (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, \n     juvenile, Federal, tribal, and civil justice systems in the \n     United States when such victims and survivors report crimes;\n       Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States, \n     and the families of such victims and survivors, need and \n     deserve support and assistance to help cope with the often \n     devastating consequences of crime;\n       Whereas 2014 marks the 30th anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.) \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``VOCA''), which is the \n     hallmark of the commitment of the Federal Government to \n     supporting rights and services for victims and survivors of \n     all types of crime;\n       Whereas VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund, which is \n     paid for by criminal fines and penalties, rather than by \n     taxpayer dollars;\n       Whereas the Crime Victims Fund has collected more than \n     $20,400,000,000 from criminals to be used exclusively to help \n     victims and survivors of crime;\n       Whereas during each year between 1984 and 2014, communities \n     across the United States have joined Congress and the \n     Department of Justice in commemorating National Crime \n     Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a shared vision of a \n     comprehensive and collaborative response that identifies and \n     addresses the many needs of crime victims and survivors, and \n     the families of such victims and survivors;\n       Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a \n     renewed commitment to serving all victims and survivors of \n     crime in the 21st century;\n       Whereas the theme of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights \n     Week, celebrated during the week of April 6 through April 12, \n     2014, is ``30 Years: Restoring the Balance of Justice'' and \n     highlights the many challenges that confront crime-victim \n     assistance, justice, and public safety; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States recognize and \n     appreciate the continued importance of--\n       (1) promoting the rights of, and services for, crime \n     victims and survivors; and\n       (2) honoring crime victims and survivors and individuals \n     who provide services for such victims and survivors: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the mission and goals of 2014 National Crime \n     Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing individual and \n     public awareness of--\n       (A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors, and the \n     families of such victims and survivors;\n       (B) the challenges to achieving justice for victims and \n     survivors of crime, and the families of such victims and \n     survivors; and\n       (C) the many solutions to meet such challenges;\n       (2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors, and the \n     families of such victims and survivors, should be treated \n     with dignity, fairness, and respect; and\n       (3) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the \n     Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/11/senate-section/article/S2407-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.
