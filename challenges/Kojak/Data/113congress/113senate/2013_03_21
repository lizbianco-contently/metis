Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 8, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 8) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2014, revising the appropriate budgetary levels \n     for fiscal year 2013, and setting forth the appropriate \n     budgetary levels for fiscal years 2015 through 2023.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we just heard, the Senate has resumed \nconsideration of the budget debate of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget \nresolution. We will continue debate during today's session. Senators \nwill be notified when votes are scheduled, of course.\n  The budget has 34 hours left, and then following that, we will have \nsome votes. It is up to the two managers of this bill if we have votes \nbefore the 34 hours expire. These are two experienced Senators and they \nknow how to handle this budget, but it would seem to me that we should \nmove as quickly as we can to debate these issues. I hope Senators come \nand offer their opinions as to the budget that Chairman Murray has \nbrought to the Senate floor. Maybe some people will want to talk about \nwhat passed in the House yesterday, the Ryan Republican budget.\n  Everyone should understand that this time will run out at the latest \nat 7 p.m. tomorrow night. It seems to me the two managers could reduce \nthat time somewhat. If they don't, it doesn't matter; we will be here \nuntil we finish this budget. If we are here all night Friday, we will \nbe in all night Friday. I spoke to Senator Murray, and she was willing \nto be in all night last night; she is willing to be here all night \ntonight and all night Friday night until we finish this. We are going \nto move forward and finish this budget.\n\n\n                          affordable care act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, three years ago this coming Saturday was a \nhistoric time in this country and in the world, actually, because the \nAffordable Care Act passed. It was a very wintry night when it passed--\nvery cold. It was the greatest single step in generations to help the \nAmerican people.\n  This was unique because for the first time--going back to the days of \nHarry Truman where he talked about a health care bill for the country, \nto Eisenhower, who talked about a health care bill for this country--we \nwere finally able to accomplish it. We ensured access to quality, \naffordable health care for every American with ObamaCare, the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Millions and millions of Americans, as we speak, are benefiting from \nthis legislation. Insurance companies can no longer arbitrarily place \nlifetime caps on insurance policies during someone's care. No longer \ncan they suddenly say: Sorry, you have cancer or had that bad accident, \nbut you reached $1,000--or whatever limit they set, $10,000--and you \nare through. Go get help someplace else because insurance is over. That \narbitrary lifetime cap by insurance companies put Americans just a car \naccident or an illness away from doom.\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\n  Today children are no longer denied insurance because they were born \nwith a disease, disability, or some other problem. They no longer are \ndenied insurance. And being a woman, like my daughter, is no longer a \npreexisting medical condition. Before ObamaCare passed--and everyone \nneeds to understand this--my daughter Lana had a preexisting condition; \nshe was born a girl. That is gone.\n  In less than a year, about 130 million Americans with preexisting \nconditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes can rest assured \nthey will have access to affordable insurance and lifesaving care \nregardless of their health and how much money they make.\n  In Nevada alone--a sparsely populated State of some 3 million \npeople--tens of thousands of seniors have saved tens of millions of \ndollars because 3 years ago we filled the doughnut hole. What that \nmeans is they don't have to pay exorbitant prices for their \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Health care reform is not only saving money, it saves lives. In \nNevada there are thousands of examples, but I will give one about a 26-\nyear-old woman named Sarah Coffey Kugler, a native of Gardnerville, NV. \nGardnerville is a beautiful place next to the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n  Well, this young lady, who was very smart--and still is--was half way \nthrough her first year of law school at the University of Connecticut \nwhen she was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's disease. Not stage 1, 2, \nor 3, but the worst, stage 4. She had done everything right. She knew \nshe needed insurance, so she went to the University of Connecticut and \nbought the best plan she could for students so she would have health \ninsurance. Due to her cancer and the difficult treatment to fight it, \nshe had to drop out of school. She had no insurance because insurance \nwould not cover her.\n  As I said, she was no longer a student and, as a result, no longer \nqualified for student health insurance. What was she to do? She needed \na bone marrow transplant. She and her family thought there was a very \nstrong possibility she would pass away.\n  Before ObamaCare, Sarah would have been one of tens of millions of \nAmericans who desperately needed lifesaving care but didn't have \ninsurance to take care of it. Before ObamaCare, Sarah might have even \nbecome 1 of the 45,000 Americans who die each year because they lacked \nhealth insurance. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, \nSarah was able to sign on to her parents' insurance policy.\n  Sarah is 1 of 3.1 million young people in America--approximately \n35,000 in Nevada--who have benefited from a law that allows children to \nstay on their parents' health plans until they are 26 years old.\n  Sarah's story has a happy ending, as so often happens in America \nwhere we can get health care. She got the treatment she needed. Her \nmost recent PET scan was clear, and she plans to return to school this \ncoming September and finish law school.\n  Her mother Sue sent me a letter. She wrote that ObamaCare and the \ndedicated doctors who took care of her daughter saved her life. There \nare so many legacies of this landmark legislation. No American will end \nup in an emergency room because they have no insurance. No American \nwill live in fear of losing his or her insurance because they don't \nhave a job. And in the richest Nation in the world, no insurance \ncompany ever again will put a pricetag on a human life.\n  Long, long ago Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``The care of human life and \nhappiness . . . is the first and only object of good government.''\n  I am gratified that the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, meets Thomas \nJefferson's standard. I am so happy this law came into being. For all \nof us who participated in that, we will always remember that cold \nwinter when we were in session longer, I am told, than any other time \nin the history of the country to pass this legislation. We worked hard \nto pass it. It is already insuring the care of human life, which \nremains the first object of government, as Thomas Jefferson said it \nshould.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank my ranking member, \nSenator Sessions. We had a good debate, and I think everyone had a \nchance to see the differences about the values and priorities that \ndrive us, how we see our country, and our future. I am looking forward \nto having that conversation again today.\n  The budget we are debating on the floor this week puts our middle-\nclass families first. It reflects our progrowth, pro-middle-class \nagenda that the American people went to the polls in support of at the \nelection just a few months ago. It takes the kind of truly balanced \napproach that families across our country strongly support, and I \nbelieve it is a strong and responsible vision for building a foundation \nfor growth and restoring the promise of American opportunity.\n  I spoke at length last night about our budget. It is built on three \nprinciples. No. 1, we have to protect our fragile economic recovery, \ncreate jobs, and invest in our long-term growth. This is something \nevery family in America is asking us to focus on.\n  No. 2, we need to tackle our deficit and debt fairly and responsibly. \nAs Democrats we understand it is a responsibility we bear today, and we \ndo it in this budget. No. 3, we need to keep the promises we made as a \nNation to our seniors, our families, and our communities. There are \nmany people who have struggled so much over the last few years and they \nare counting on us to be there for them again now.\n  We are going to hear a lot more about all of these principles today, \nand we are going to discuss the stark contrast between the budget that \nis expected to move in the House of Representatives today and the plan \nand path we have put forward here in the Senate as Democrats.\n  At this time, I yield to Senator Sessions for his opening remarks, \nand we will continue this debate throughout the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and express my appreciation to \nSenator Murray for her leadership, her courtesy, and her skill in \nmanaging the bill through the committee and on the floor. She is an \nexperienced legislator who has strong convictions, but she is easy to \nwork with, courteous, and effective in what she does every day. I thank \nSenator Murray, and I enjoy working with her.\n  Well, our Chair says this is a pro-growth, pro-middle-class budget. I \nsay it is a pro-tax, pro-spend, and pro-debt budget. It is a budget of \ndeep disappointment. It is a budget that comes nowhere near doing the \nthings necessary to put America on a sound path. It is a budget that \ndoes, indeed, reflect the stark differences between our parties. It is \nrather remarkable to me, the extent to which our majority party in the \nSenate has no interest in producing a budget that actually balances and \nactually puts America on the right path.\n  They say they care about growth, and I know they do. I know they \nwould like to see the economy grow more and more jobs being created \nbecause we have had the slowest recovery during this recession since \nanytime after World War II, at least. It has been very, very slow. But \nwe have done something to a degree we have never done before; that is, \nborrow and spend to stimulate the economy.\n\n  Someone has compared borrowing and spending to stimulate the economy \nto the idea of someone taking a bucket and scooping up water in one end \nof the swimming pool and pouring it into the other. We have no net \ngain. The truth is that we lose some of the water out of the bucket as \nwe walk along the shore. In this case, what we lose is interest on the \ndebt indefinitely because there is no plan to pay down the debt.\n  So this budget that is before us today does not balance, it does not \nput us on a sound path, it does not create confidence among the \nAmerican citizens that the future is going to be sound, that we have \ngotten this country reoriented in a way that is going to produce long-\nterm growth. Indeed, it is going to do exactly the opposite. It is \ngoing to do exactly the opposite. It says, once again, that this Senate \nis not willing to do the things necessary to put America on a sound \ncourse. And it is not that hard. We can do this. It is within our \ngrasp. But our leadership in this Senate, contrary to the House, is not \nwilling to take those good, solid but achievable steps necessary to put \nthis country on a sound path. I just feel that very deeply.\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n  Hopefully, in the context of our debate and a budget being moved \nthrough here on a party-line vote, I suppose, as it was in committee, \nmaybe some connection will be made amongst ourselves and our Members \nand our brains about the real issues facing the country and what we \nneed to do to get on the right path. And maybe even in conference, if \nnot here on the floor, we can have some miraculous agreement that would \ncreate the kind of long-term confidence businesspeople and the American \npeople are looking for from the U.S. Congress and the government.\n  Senator Reid indicated he would like to finish. I would like to \nfinish too. We were under the impression that we could have started \nthis voting process on the budget as early as Monday, if not Tuesday. \nThat could have happened. Apparently, the leadership decided to block \namendments. That created, on this side, a number of Senators who felt \nvery strongly that they, in fact, had relevant amendments and they \nwanted them voted on, and they would not agree to time limits until the \nmajority agreed to give them a vote. Whether I was for or against the \namendments is not relevant. I thought they should have been given a \nvote. They are Senators. A big bill moving forward, several \nappropriations bills cobbled together to fund the government, and we \nonly have four or five amendments. Serious amendments, such as the \nMoran amendment with 28 cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, was \nblocked. He couldn't get an amendment on a relevant issue involving the \nhealth and safety of America.\n  So that has put us behind in the schedule, not anything we have done. \nThere was not a problem on this side. If they had been given \namendments, they would have been done in very short order and could \nhave been completed Monday or early Tuesday.\n  So here we are. We have under the law 50 hours of debate on the \nbudget, 25 to a side, and an unlimited number of amendments can be \noffered. So that is going to take time, as it always does, and I am \nsorry it is getting pushed into the weekend.\n  I would also just say briefly that as time has gone by, I have been \nmore and more convinced of what I believed from the beginning, which is \nthat this Congress is not capable of producing a massive overhaul of \nthe Federal health care program. I remember the night Senator Reid \nrefers to when the final passage, I guess, occurred or the day that it \noccurred. But what I remember most is being here Christmas Eve--my \nbirthday--when the bill cleared the Senate on a straight party-line \nvote, 60 to 40. Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected on a \npromise to block and kill the legislation. The American people were \nconsistently opposing the legislation. They were able to ram it through \nbefore he could take office and cast the deciding vote. They got the \nabsolute minimum number of votes--60--to pass this monstrosity.\n  I am told now the regulations in the bill are 6 feet high when \nstacked. We still haven't seen them. That legislation has 1,700 \nreferences to this section to be effectuated by regulations to be \nissued by the department. Regulations continue to pour out in record \nnumbers to try to clarify the hundreds and thousands of ambiguities in \nthe bill.\n  We were told that people's health insurance premiums would go down, \nthat this was going to bend the cost curve to bring health care costs \ndown. We warned that would not happen. Who was correct 3 years ago? \nHealth care costs are surging. They are not through surging yet. We are \ngoing to have more increases as the health care bill takes effect in \nJanuary of next year. The average person's premium has already gone up \n$2,000-plus a year. Small businesses all over America are telling us \nthey are not hiring because of the health care bill. This has clearly \nbeen a deficit and a detriment to job creation.\n  We had no ability to write this health care law. We didn't know \nenough about it. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: Well, we have to write it \nto see what is in it. What she meant was that we are just going to pass \nsome vision of health care reform and the bureaucrats will take care of \nit. Well, they are not taking care of it well. We are not capable of \nmanaging it.\n  We are endangering the greatest health care system the world has ever \nknown. We are going to see fewer and fewer top-quality young people go \ninto medicine. I am hearing that over and over again. Doctors are \ntelling me they don't know what to tell their children about going into \nmedicine.\n  This is just one example of what happens in this country when people \nin Washington take on the arrogant view that they know how to fix the \nhealth care system--one of the most massive, complex, marvelous systems \nthe world has ever known.\n  You can go to Alabama and see some of the best doctors in the entire \nworld in our State. People go there from all over the world. Dr. \nAndrews treated RG3 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, his \nprivate practice in Birmingham. People can go to top-quality surgeons \nin Mobile, Montgomery--throughout the State--Auburn-Opelika, \nTuscaloosa, Huntsville. This is true for every State in America.\n  For people to say our health care is not the best in the world--why \ndo people come here from all over the world? That is one of the most \nhorrible things I have ever heard, really, around here, suggesting we \ndon't. So we have people who die sooner than in some other countries. \nWe have a lot of causes. We have more obesity. We have more smoking. We \nhave fewer people taking care of themselves sometimes. We have a lot of \nindividual problems. We have a higher murder rate. We have high \naccident rates in automobiles. So we have things that pull down our \nlifespan, but that doesn't mean our health care isn't good. It doesn't \nmean our health care is not the best in the world. All of us have seen \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I wish to ask Chairman Murray where we are now on \ngoing through the business of the day. I appreciate the chairman's \nleadership and suggestions as to going forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Absolutely. I am happy to get things going here today. \nDoes the manager on the other side have an amendment he wishes to start \nwith this morning?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to start with a motion, yes, and I am \nprepared to do that, and I thank the chairman.\n  I offer a motion to recommit this budget that is on the floor today \nto the committee with instructions that it be altered to produce a \nbalanced budget.\n  That is what I think this Nation needs. I think that is what the \nAmerican people want, and that is what we are determined to fight for \nbecause it is the right thing for the country, not because it is some \ngreen eyeshade goal. I have heard that argument, and that is not what \nis on our minds when we say: Let's balance the budget. It is not what \nthe American people have on their minds when they say: Why don't you \nguys balance our budget?\n  What is it that is necessary here? We believe that if we alter our \ndebt course in a responsible way and we begin to reduce the deficits \nregularly and steadily in an effective way, we can reach a balanced \nbudget and we can keep on that balanced budget without cutting \nexpenditures. The facts are quite clear that we can increase spending \nevery year, just not as much as we are increasing spending today and \njust not as much as our Democratic budget increases spending. That is \nwhat we believe we should do. I will explain as we go forward how that \ncan create jobs, create growth, will make this country healthier, will \ncreate confidence in the world financial community, will see more money \ncome to the United States, and will allow businesses that are sitting \non cash to begin to invest and hire people. That is the direction in \nwhich we should be going. That is what would be good for America.\n  But first and foremost, as I explained last night, the Democratic \nbudget on the floor today comes nowhere close to that. It is nowhere \nclose to setting forth a plan that would actually balance the budget. \nIndeed, the budget never balances under their plan, and it won't \nbalance in the future. Things are only going to get worse. They are \ngoing to get worse because it deals in no way with the fundamental, \ndriving forces of the debt this country faces. It does not deal with \nthat. If we don't deal with those issues, then we are not going to get \nthe debt under control. But we can do it. We can do it in a number of \nways.\n  Now, the President has sent a very clear message. Recently on ABC, \nwith George Stephanopoulos, the President said: And so, you know, my \ngoal is not to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance.\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n  Who said we are trying to chase a balanced budget just for the sake \nof balance? That is not what we are doing. We are trying to put America \non a sound debt path. We are trying to put America on a sound financial \npath that will create confidence and avoid the danger of a fiscal \ncrisis.\n  We started counting last night. My colleagues, yesterday and last \nnight--I think we stopped counting--used the phrase ``balance'' 24 \ntimes: This is a balanced approach. It is a balanced plan. We are \nseeking primary balance. We are going to have a responsible, balanced \nplan.\n  Pretty soon, they will say they have a balanced budget. Well, they \ndon't have a balanced budget. We need to understand that fully.\n  Secondly, the budget that has been produced does not even put us any \ncloser to a balanced budget than we are today. When we add up the taxes \nthat are being increased, when we add the new spending that is in this \nbill, it doesn't change the debt course at all.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. Elmendorf, the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office, testified before our Budget Committee. Mr. Elmendorf is \nan excellent scholar and a man who has managed the money of the budget \nwell. Mr. Elmendorf is--Mr. President, I am having a little trouble \nconcentrating with the roar going on in my background. I would \nappreciate it if we could keep it down a little bit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Regular order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So Mr. Elmendorf told us at the Budget Committee that \nwe are on an unsustainable path. OK. This is after the Budget Control \nAct, after we reduced the growth of spending $2.1 trillion, and that \nincludes the sequester. After we did all that, this year he told us we \nare on an unsustainable debt course. He said this is a danger to \nAmerica and we have to get off it and we need to make further changes \nto get on the right course.\n  So we have looked at this budget, and we thought the committee, which \ncalled him, would listen to him, and we wanted to see if the budget \nthat is on the floor now actually helps us get toward a sound financial \nfuture. I have to say it does not. It does not change the course we are \non. It raises taxes dramatically, but it raises spending and eats up \nall the new taxes, not altering the amount of debt that will be raised \nover 10 years.\n  Isn't that a failed budget plan? Isn't that a failure of leadership? \nI hate to say that. But the challenge of our time is to deal with our \nfinancial crisis. The challenge of our time is to alter the debt course \nwe are on and put us on a sound path, and it has not been met by this \nbudget.\n  The House budget--we all may have different ideas about some of the \nthings in it--provides for increased spending every single year, but it \nbalances the budget, totally balances the budget, in 10 years. It would \nbalance in 10 years and does it by increasing spending every year, on \nan average of 3.4 percent a year. So we can increase spending at 3.4 \npercent a year--increase spending--and balance the budget.\n  But the problem is the budget the majority sends forth would increase \nspending at 5.4 percent a year. That does not sound like a lot, but the \ndifference is trillions of dollars. The difference is a plan that puts \nus on a sound financial path to the future and a plan that leads us on \nthe unsustainable debt course we are now on.\n  My Democratic colleagues need to look at this. We saw, I guess, in \nPolitico--I had the quote here yesterday that said fundamentally the \nmajority's plan was written by the left of the Democratic conference--\nthe left--and it said explicitly to the left of President Obama. That \nmakes sense if we look at what is in the budget. Look how much they \nspend, how much they tax, and how they do not reduce the debt we are \nadding every single year. So that is what we have.\n  As Chairman Murray said, budgets present a contrast. Budgets lay out \nyour vision for the future. A budget defines who you are because it \nsays how much you want to tax in the next 10 years, it says how much \nyou want to spend in the next 10 years, and it requires you to state \nhow much debt you are going to accumulate for America over the next 10 \nyears.\n  This plan will add another $7.3 trillion to the debt of America. We \nare already at almost $17 trillion. That will take us to about $24 \ntrillion in 10 years. Interest on that debt is huge. By their own \nnumbers, interest on their debt would amount to approximately $800 \nbillion in 1 year. Interest on the debt, under their budget, would rise \nto the point of $800 billion in 1 year. We spend about $100 billion on \neducation. We spend about $40 billion-plus--a little over--on highways, \nroads, and bridges. That is just an example. We are now surging from \n$200 billion, $250 billion in interest to $800 billion in interest. As \na result of the accounting CBO has provided us, if we follow this path, \nit is going to crowd out spending for research, it is going to crowd \nout spending for children, education, health care, and any other \nprogram this government wishes to undertake, including defense.\n  Mr. President, what kind of time limit is there, might I inquire? Is \nthere 30 minutes on this side on this motion?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the motion, there is 1 hour, \nequally divided.\n  Would the Senator like to call up his motion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The first question would be how much time is left on my \nhalf of that hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion has not yet been \noffered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up the motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] moves to recommit \n     Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 back to the Committee on the \n     Budget with instructions to report back no later than March \n     22, 2013 with such changes as may be necessary to achieve \n     unified budget balance by fiscal year 2023.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This motion would simply say this to our colleagues--it \nwill be a defining vote for our Members; and Members need to understand \nthe meaning of this vote--the question will be: Do you favor a balanced \nbudget? Is it important to you? Have you said: I am going to vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment. Have you said in your townhall meetings and \nin your campaigns and in your debates: I believe in a balanced budget \namendment or I believe in a balanced budget, period.\n  What we are saying is that this country can balance its budget. We \ncan balance the budget in America today if we set forth a plan that \nallows the spending levels to increase by 3.4 percent a year for the \nnext 10 years. Isn't that great news? We can spend 3.4 percent more \neach year. According to the data the Congressional Budget Office gives \nus and we rely on, we can do that and still increase spending over the \nnext decade.\n  Inflation is going to increase about 2 percent or a little over, \naccording to CBO. Inflation will increase about 25 percent over the \nnext 10 years and about 40 percent if we increase spending each year at \n3.4 percent. That puts us on a path to balance. It begins to reduce the \ndebt overhang for our country. It brings down the amount of debt we \nhave in our country and puts us on a sound path. It does all the things \nwe need. It sends a message to the world that we have our financial \nhouse in order. I believe good Members of this body--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--have told their constituents and are sincerely of \nthe belief that we can and should balance our budget. When I say \n``balance,'' I mean honest balance, not some balanced approach, not \nsome primary balance, none of that; that when the revenue comes in and \nthe money goes out, it is the same. We are not sending more money out \nthan we are bringing in, in revenue, having to borrow the difference \nand pay interest on it. Because that is what we have been doing to a \ndegree we have never, ever done before in this country. We have never, \never done before what we are doing now. We have never, ever had 4 \nconsecutive years of trillion-dollar deficits--nothing close to it.\n  People say President Bush was irresponsible. He should have been more \nwary of the grand promises that the economy would never have a \nrecession and that things are going to go great. He should have. The \nnext to the last\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nyear he was in office, the budget deficit was $167 billion. It had \ndropped from a higher figure in his time in office. His last year, it \nwas $450 billion or $460 billion.\n  President Obama has been in office 4 full years, starting his fifth, \nand his deficits have been averaging $1,200 billion a year. We have \nnever, ever, ever seen anything like this before. The debt of the \nUnited States of America has surged, and our Democratic colleagues do \nnot have a plan that will put us on a sustainable path in the future.\n  If we come back out of the economy and we restrain the spending \ngrowth just a little bit, we can balance the budget. That is what we \nought to do. Again, the goal of balancing the budget is not some \nfrivolous goal for political reasons. The goal of a balanced budget is \nthat we would put us on a sound financial course. It will mean we have \nconfronted the challenges of our time. It means we know we cannot \ncontinue to spend systemically more than we bring in, that a debt \ncrisis could occur and we could have a decline in wealth in America.\n\n  So when we say we want to recommit to the committee, colleagues, you \nneed to know what this means. It simply means this: We are directing \nthe committee, the majority of whom are Democrats--and they can write \nthe budget as they choose, using whatever tax changes they want to make \nand whatever spending changes they want to make--but the budget that \nhits this floor would be a budget that balances, that creates growth, \nconfidence, and prosperity for America. That is what we are asking you \nto cast a vote for, and I believe you should break ranks on this. I \nbelieve you should vote your conscience. I believe every Senator should \nvote the beliefs of their constituents. Poll after poll after poll \nshows that the American people prefer a balanced budget. They know we \ncannot continue to do what we are doing.\n  I think it has potential. We are willing to work with the majority. \nWe may disagree with the results, but, my goodness, wouldn't it be \ngreat if the Senate produced a budget that balances--and it has one \nvision of how to balance the budget, the House produced a budget that \nbalances and they have their vision about how to balance the budget--\nand we go to conference and we could actually reach some sort of a \ncompromise that would fix the financial future of America? The whole \nworld would be amazed. They would say: My goodness, the United States--\nlook at this--they have gotten themselves together. We thought they \nwere going goofy. We thought they had completely sold out to spending \nand borrowing and look at this.\n  There would be more investment. American businesses would feel \nbetter. American workers would feel better. We would begin to have more \ngrowth that way.\n  That is the way we believe jobs and growth are best created, not by \nthe sugar high that comes from borrowing and spending money.\n  Back when we did the stimulus bill--I would like to share this with \nmy colleagues because a very important concept was explained us to by \nMr. Elmendorf, the CBO Director. Back when we did the stimulus bill, \nthe $800 billion-and-something that President Obama passed that was \ngoing to reduce the unemployment rate dramatically, put the country on \na sound path, and stimulate the economy, we asked how were we going to \ndo it? We were going to borrow money--every penny of the $830 billion--\nnow $1 trillion with interest--was borrowed and we spent it.\n  This is what the Director of the Congressional Budget Office said \nabout that. He said: Yes, it will create growth in the short term. It \nwill enhance the growth in the short term. One financial expert called \nit a sugar high. We will get that. But once that is over and we have \nthe burden of the debt, it begins to cost us every year and it will \ncost us as long as that money has been spent, as long as we pay \ninterest on that money, and we are going to pay interest--young people, \nAmerican people--indefinitely because we have no plan to pay down this \ndebt that we have accumulated. We will be paying interest on that \nindefinitely.\n  This is what CBO said back in 2009 when the stimulus bill was passed. \nThey said: Yes, you get a short-term benefit. But CBO said that over 10 \nyears, you will have less net growth than if you did not have the \nstimulus package at all. Think about that.\n  So we took the sugar high. We voted to borrow the money. I did not. I \nopposed it. But it passed to borrow more money, to spend now to try to \ncreate a sugar high, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, pour one \nbucket of water from the pool into another, and this is going to \nsomehow permanently fix our economy.\n  There were some things that I think would have been legitimate for us \nto do at that time. I supported a more restrained package that had more \ninfrastructure and actual benefits in it. But, fundamentally, we are \nalmost now at the point where the benefits of that spending have been \ngone and the detriment is already here. Multiply that. Multiply that by \nthe fact that we now have a total of $17 trillion borrowed from around \nthe world, and we are paying interest on that every day. But we are \npaying extraordinarily low interest rates, unlike any we have seen in \nthe history of the world, and those low interest rates are not expected \nto remain.\n  This is why they project that with this budget we will have a $24 \ntrillion debt by 2022, resulting in $800 billion a year in interest. \nThis would be more than the Defense Department, more than we pay on \nSocial Security today, and more than we pay on Medicare today. This is \na huge item.\n  I would say we want growth. We want prosperity. We want to unleash \nthe natural, inherent, entrepreneurial power of the American spirit, \neconomy, and culture. It is a wonderful thing we have. Our free market \ninfrastructure is magnificent, but it is being handicapped by poor \neconomic financial policies of this country. We need to exit this path \nand return to a path for a balanced budget amendment.\n  I thank you for the opportunity to make this motion and hope it will \nbe considered. It would provide the committee with full freedom to \nproduce a balanced budget through any way you choose, through any mix \nof tax-and-spend policies which would be chosen by the committee. It \nwould then come back to the floor. If we were to vote for it, then it \nwould go to conference and put us in an extraordinarily better position \nto achieve a bipartisan agreement this year, which could help pull us \nout of the economic doldrums. This would put us on a path to economic \nprosperity to eliminate the debt drag which international studies, the \nIMF, European Central Bank, Bank of International Settlements, and \nProfessor Rogoff and Professor Reinhart have all shown pulls down \ngrowth. They are saying our debt is so high it is lowering economic \ngrowth right now.\n  We would change all of this through a balanced budget coming out of \ncommittee. It would put us on the right path without having to reduce \nspending, actually. We could still increase spending every single year.\n  I submit my motion, and I yield to the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to use time in opposition to the \nresolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Our colleagues have sent a motion to the desk which \nsends our budget back to committee to balance.\n  I think we all know what this means. They wish to send our budget \nback to take months and weeks to put together a budget, which does one \nof two things in order to balance: It either raises incredible revenue \nor has devastating cuts. We have seen the package they are talking \nabout. It is the Ryan budget being debated in the House right now. They \nsay they would eliminate the deficit in 2023.\n  The Republicans have not put this budget out here right now, because \nthey don't want to specify what the cuts are and be responsible for \nthem. They just want some mystical moment to happen back in committee \nwhere these tough decisions are made.\n  We know what they are looking at. They are looking at the Ryan \nbudget. They say it eliminates the deficit, but it does so in a \ndevastating way to middle-class families across this country, families \nwho are already struggling so much.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  We hear a lot about balance these days. I want to clarify some real \ndifferences, important differences between how the Senate and the House \nbudget use the word ``balance.''\n  The proposal which passed through the Budget Committee in the House \nwould be devastating for our economic recovery. It would really \nthreaten hundreds of thousands of jobs this year alone. It makes \nextreme cuts to our infrastructure, which is crumbling; to education, \nwhich is so important to our future; to the innovation this country has \nbeen built on, which would lay down a strong foundation for broad \neconomic growth--which our Senate budget is working so hard to make \nhappen.\n  Their budget in the House which the Republicans now want us to go \nback to committee and put in place would dismantle Medicare and cut off \nprograms to support our middle-class and most vulnerable families. This \nsounds pretty unbalanced to me.\n  Frankly, their budget gets worse. As we learned last week, House \nRepublicans have put forth a budget which calls for huge tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest Americans and makes it unclear how it will be paid for.\n  Those pay-fors will come on the backs of families who are working \nhard, average families who would see their taxes increase in order to \ngive that tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. This is what they call \nbalance.\n  I don't think that is balance. House Republicans like to say they are \noffering a balanced budget, which I would note also includes savings \nfrom the Affordable Care Act they vowed to repeal and tax increases on \nthe wealthiest, which they strongly oppose. They haven't explained how \nthey will reach that goal of reducing those rates down to 25 percent \nand who will pay for this. It is pretty clear, when you look at the \nnumbers, how that will happen.\n  The House Republicans never explain how they get to what they call \n``balance,'' because the only way they can do it is by raising taxes on \nthe middle class or making deep cuts to vulnerable families and \nseniors, who depend on these benefits.\n  Our budget takes a very different approach to balance. We ensure our \nfamilies today have the ability to get what they need to put their \nfamilies back on a stable path to recovery. We make sure we invest in \nthe important things this country needs to ensure our middle class has \nwhat they need in education and infrastructure. These are the things \nwhich allow families to know their kids can go to college, pay their \nmortgage, receive job training, and get back to work. That is balance.\n  When we have a responsible approach to spending cuts and to revenue, \nbalance is an important word. Balance is about making sure we do what \nthe Simpson-Bowles report has recommended, what every bipartisan group \nhas said, and contains a responsible mix of revenues and spending cuts. \nThis ensures no one bears the burden of the challenges of this country \nalone.\n  I would not call the House Republican bill balanced. Their balance \nsays the wealthiest Americans, the biggest corporations don't \ncontribute to this problem at all. Everything is done on the backs of \nour middle-class families.\n  Balance is an important word. It is an important word to every \nfamily, every community, every American. The approach we take is \nbalanced, making sure everyone has an opportunity in this country for \nthe future we need. This ensures everybody participates in solving the \nproblems in front of us.\n  I take a backseat to no one when it comes to making sure we have a \nbalanced approach. Our budget does that. We are going to be hearing \nmore on it right now. We have a number of colleagues on the floor.\n  Let me make this very clear. The motion to recommit the Senators on \nthe other side have offered simply says we will return to committee \nuntil we get the Ryan bill in front of us. This is something we soundly \nreject.\n  I have a number of colleagues here who will participate. I yield to \nthe Senator from Delaware and thank him for his great contributions to \nour committee this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield time from the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy for up to 30 minutes with Senators from California, New York, \nIllinois, and Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, at its heart a budget is a statement of \nvalues. Last week I joined with my colleagues on the Budget Committee \nto pass a budget resolution firmly rooted in our values.\n  With appreciation to the chairmanship of Chairman Patty Murray, the \nbudget we passed reduces our deficit and stabilizes our debt in a \nbalanced, responsible way, relying on an equal mix of spending cuts and \ncuts to spending through the Tax Code, which is a balance of cuts and \nincreased revenue through tax reform.\n  This first chart briefly shows we have made significant progress \ntoward the Simpson-Bowles goal of $4 trillion in reduced Federal \nspending over the next 10 years. Our budget relies on these two next \npieces, reducing loopholes, tax expenditures, and spending cuts. This \nis the balance I believe the American people called for in the last \nelection.\n  Our budget promotes economic growth and job creation in the short \nterm, makes critical investments in our competitiveness for the long \nterm. It does all of this while putting a circle of protection around \nthe most vulnerable in our society: children, low-income seniors, and \nthe disabled.\n  Unfortunately, in my view the budget resolution passed by the House \nBudget Committee, led by Chairman Ryan, does not reflect these same \nvalues or this same balance. It is wildly unbalanced, relying only on \nspending cuts in order to achieve claims of enormous savings.\n  Yet when you look closer--and we will turn to this in more detail \nlater in this colloquy--the Ryan budget actually relies on a whole \nseries of deceptive gimmicks, impossible arithmetic, and unrealistic \nassumptions. The only way to make the Ryan budget add up is to increase \nour deficit or to raise taxes on the middle class by as much as $3,000 \na year.\n  In my view, the House Republican budget either fails the test of \ndeficit reduction or fails the test of basic fairness. It also, I \nbelieve, fails the test of economic growth and would put us on a fast \ntrack to austerity.\n  Let me turn now, if I might, to my friend and colleague from the \nState of Maryland to ask for his further comments on the contrast \nbetween the budget we have adopted here in the Senate and the budget \noffered over in the House.\n  Senator Cardin.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank my friend from Delaware, Senator Coons. The \nSenator is exactly right, as he talks about balance. Senator Murray is \nabsolutely right about the balance we have and the budget which has \ncome out of the Budget Committee.\n  Yesterday we did something which was the right thing to do. We passed \nthe continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations bill. The good \nnews is we worked together. We completed it, and it was a major \nimprovement from what the House did. The House again was acting in a \nvery partisan, one-way direction which would have caused additional \nharm.\n  I was disappointed the bill we passed yesterday was at the \nsequestration levels. I am against sequestration. I think we should \nsubstitute it for strategic reductions in the deficit. This is exactly \nwhat the budget coming out of the Budget Committee would do. It will \nsubstitute for sequestration a strategic way to get our budget into \nbetter balance. This is what we need to do.\n  The budget, as Senator Coons has pointed out, is our blueprint. It \nspeaks to the priorities we have as a Nation. It is a framework. All of \nthe elements which are necessary for a responsible budget are included \nin the budget document, which has been brought to the floor. I am proud \nto support it. It gives us the right blueprint for America's future.\n  The most important thing is it does get rid of sequestration. \nSequestration is across-the-board mindless cuts. It says every priority \nin this country is exactly the same. That is not the case. The budget \ncoming out of the Budget Committee is a responsible way of substituting \nfor sequestration.\n  Senator Murray mentioned balance. I wish to speak about this chart, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\npoints out the fact of how balanced the budget is. The Senate \nDemocratic budget balances additional spending cuts--Senator Coons is \nabsolutely right--and additional cuts in what we do in the tax \nexpenditures. We spend money through the Tax Code and through \nappropriated bills. The budget you brought out balances reductions in \nboth categories. Sequestration only applies through the appropriations \nprocess. It doesn't apply to how we spend money through tax \nexpenditures.\n  It is very interesting, as this is very similar to the other \nbipartisan proposal which has been brought forward. We talk frequently \nabout Simpson-Bowles. Some of us may have disagreed with the specifics, \nbut we thought it was the right blueprint and the right balance between \nspending reductions and tax expenditure reductions.\n  The Senate Democrats' proposal is very similar to Simpson-Bowles on \nthe ratio of cuts. Actually it has more spending cuts and a little bit \nless revenue. Again, the Gang of Six is very similar. We are very proud \nour colleagues came together in an effort to try to bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together. The Democratic budget in the Senate builds upon \nthat bipartisan cooperation. It is very similar.\n  When we look at the House Republicans, they are totally out of step \nwith what is necessary in order to get our country back into balance.\n  This provides a framework for investment. I appreciate the fact \nSenator Murray has provided ways in which we can invest in \ninfrastructure, invest in research and development, and how we may \ninvest in education. This translates into job growth. The more jobs we \ncreate, the more people pay taxes and the less revenue which is used. \nThis is how you also balance the budget.\n  The Senate Democratic budget, the budget coming out of the Budget \nCommittee, provides for those types of important investments. You also \nprotect the most vulnerable citizens. This is so important. You protect \nMedicare. Why? Because it is important for the dignity of our seniors.\n  I particularly appreciated the statements which were made by Senator \nDurbin, who was a major player in bringing this out, that going into \ndeficit reduction we want to protect the most vulnerable. We don't want \nto add to the poverty of America. The Democratic budget which you \nbrought out carries out that commitment, protecting our most \nvulnerable.\n  You also lived up to the commitment to our veterans, and I appreciate \nthat very much. President Kennedy said, ``As we express our gratitude, \nwe must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter \nwords, but to live by them.''\n  We all say how much we appreciate our veterans and our soldiers and \nwhat they have done for our country, protecting the democracy and \nfreedom of our country. This budget does more than just say our \nappreciation, it acts by deeds, carrying out our commitment to the best \nhealth care for our veterans, including mental health services. I \nparticularly appreciate the reserve fund that is permitted that makes \nmore veterans eligible for benefits and improves the efficiency of the \nclaims processing, which is particularly important in our region where \nso many veterans have waited way too long to get the benefits to which \nthey are entitled.\n\n  Let me mention one last point, which is a huge difference--and \nSenator Murray and Senator Coons have mentioned it. The main difference \nbetween the budget the Democrats have brought out and the Republican \nbudget conceived in the House is this is a credible way to manage our \ndeficit, which is the most important thing--managing our deficit in a \ncredible way--that will get our deficit under control. It builds on the \ndeficit reductions we have already done. Since we started this debate \nand the Simpson-Bowles recommendations came out, we have already done \n$2.4 trillion in deficit reduction, $1.8 in spending reductions, and \n$600 billion in revenues. This is very similar to how the Simpson-\nBowles proposal was made to have a plausible baseline.\n  Now, I am not going to get too technical about all this, but it means \nwe are not using smoke and mirrors but are using a realistic baseline \nin order to do the deficit reduction. It is achievable, it is doable, \nit is credible, and Senator Coons deals with tax extenders.\n  One more word about tax extenders, because Senator Coons is \nabsolutely right. We have provisions in the spending programs of this \ncountry that invest in energy security that are subject to \nsequestration because it is an appropriations bill. But we have \nprovisions in the Tax Code that give special breaks to the oil and gas \nindustry. These are expenditures. These are revenues we are \nhemorrhaging. They should at least be under the same scrutiny as the \nappropriations bills. What this budget is saying is that we can get \nsome savings from these tax expenditures and then use that to get our \ndebt under control.\n  Senator Murray is absolutely right. One of the huge differences \nbetween the Democrats and the Republicans is the Republicans want to \nreduce the tax breaks for middle-income families to give bigger tax \nbreaks for high-income families. We say we can make the Tax Code more \nefficient and have a budget that allows for the growth of the middle \nclass and manage our debt in a better way.\n  The bottom line is this budget produces $4.25 trillion over the 10-\nyear window compared to Simpson-Bowles, which was $4 trillion. It is \neven more deficit reduction than the Simpson-Bowles proposal. It puts \nus on a sustainable path for a manageable deficit.\n  What we need to do now is negotiate and get this done for this \nNation, and this framework gives us the ability to do that. What \nAmericans want is a balanced approach that allows for growth and that \nis credible. This budget gives us that pathway and, most importantly, \nit will give predictability to the American economy, which is what I \nhear more and more as I go around. People want us to make decisions. We \nare prepared to make decisions. This budget gives us that pathway, and \nI congratulate Senator Murray. I also congratulate Senator Coons for \nthe work he has done.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator for his comments and for his \nleadership in the Budget Committee and his hard work in the Chamber \nover many years.\n  The budget we are bringing forward to this floor today is one that \ninvests in growing the American economy; that gives us a real path \nforward toward out-educating, out-innovating, and out-building our \ncompetitors globally; and one that is focused on job creation but also \non deficit reduction in a responsible and balanced way. In my view, the \nRyan Republican budget, if adopted, would give us a cure worse than the \ndisease.\n  To talk about the budget's impact on America's treasured entitlement \nprograms and the promises we have made to our veterans and our seniors, \nI am grateful to turn to my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia, who has joined us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Coons so much for including me in this \nopportunity to speak about the choices we have before us.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains for Senator Coons so I \nhave some idea?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). There is 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We all know a budget is critical because it is not just a \nbunch of numbers, it is a statement as to who we are as a people--what \nare our values, what we think is worth investing in, what we think we \nshould cut, and so on. It is interesting because we have been \nattacked--Senator Murray and the Democrats--for backing a budget the \nRepublicans say is not in balance. Well, I want to argue the point. I \nthink it is, in fact, the only budget, between this budget and the \nRepublican budget in the House--which is the one embraced by the \nRepublicans--that is balanced in many ways.\n  The first way this budget is balanced is between investments--the \nthings we need to invest in for our Nation; in innovation, education, \ninvesting in our kids, investing in their health--and commitments we \nhave made over the years to our senior citizens. I am going to talk \nmore about that in a minute, about what the Republicans do to Medicare \nin their budget--by the way, they kill it. I will explain how and why. \nOur budget also moves us toward numerical balance in a way that \neconomists of all sizes and stripes believe is wise, which is to get \nthe deficit down below 3 percent of GDP.\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n  My colleagues don't think that is good enough, although I never heard \none word from them--not one word--when George W. Bush came in and \nshredded the budget. He took a surplus that Bill Clinton and the \nDemocrats, with the help of some Republicans, had put in place, and \nthey shredded it under George Bush by giving tax breaks to the \nwealthiest, putting two wars on the credit card, adopting a \nprescription drug plan that didn't allow Medicare to negotiate for \nlower prices, and the deficit went wild. And it didn't even make sense. \nI am an old--well, I am old--economics major, and I remember the \nbasics. You don't go into such deep debt because, if there is a \nrecession, you can't really help but spend your way out of it.\n  So what happened when President Obama got elected is he faced the \nworst deficit crisis, and that deficit went up to well over $1 \ntrillion. He has gotten it back to $850 billion. It is still too high, \nbut the fact is I never heard a word from my really good friends on the \nother side of the aisle when they were racking up those debts. It was, \noh, this supply side stuff is going to be great. Well, it wasn't great. \nIt wasn't good. And I am glad this budget takes us back to the notion \nof the Clinton years, which is we have a balanced approach between \nrevenues, investments, and commitments to our people.\n\n  If we look at the Republican budget--that Ryan budget over there that \npassed with huge Republican support--we can see what he does. I have to \ntell the people something they may not know. The Ryan budget, the \nRepublican budget, includes more tax breaks for the people at the top. \nSurprise. I thought we had an election about this. That didn't seem to \nmatter to the Republicans. A new tax break of $200,000 a year for \npeople making over $1 million. Just what we needed, Mr. President. More \ntax breaks for the people at the top. This is per year. Think about \nthat. The average income is about $50,000 a year, and the Republicans \nare giving $200,000 a year to millionaires. Forget it. That is why they \nwant us to send this budget back--to come out with that kind of a \nbudget? No way. I want a balanced budget.\n  By the way, how do they pay for this? With unspecified closing of tax \nloopholes. Well, let me tell you, the amount of money they are putting \nin these new tax breaks--$5.7 trillion--is so high they will have to \nend the home mortgage deduction, which the middle class really needs. \nThe wealthy people don't need mortgages, they can buy their homes \noutright. The middle class, the upper middle class need this tax break. \nCharitable deductions, which our charities count on, is another of \ntheir loopholes; and making sure you can write off State and local \ntaxes, which helps our States and our cities. That is what they are \ngoing after. They do not say it because it is ``unspecified.''\n  I hope I have made the point that the Republican budget is basically \na sham because I don't know any Senator on either side of the aisle who \nwould vote today to do away with the charitable deduction, the home \nmortgage deduction, or State and local tax deduction. Maybe a couple of \nthem would, but I can tell you, hearing from my folks at home and the \ncharities that depend on that deduction and the real estate people who \nare finally seeing a little recovery, what a time to do that. So I say \nthat budget is a sham. It doesn't balance and, worse yet, it hurts our \npeople.\n  I have only one more point to make and then I will yield back the \ntime to my friend.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes is remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Chair will advise me when I have used 5 minutes.\n  So let me now tell you about Medicare. In the Republican budget, if \nyou are younger than 55, instead of getting the same Medicare your \nparents had and the same Medicare you have paid into and the same \nMedicare that you counted on, it is over, folks. It is over. You will \nget a voucher. There is no more Medicare. They tell you to go out with \nthat voucher and find your own insurance.\n  Now, we know, because studies have shown us, that plan says you will \nbe paying $6,000 a year more out of your own pocket for health care. \nThat is what this so-called Medicare--new Medicare--Program is. It is \nnot Medicare. Medicare is a guaranteed benefit where you take the card \nand go to the doctor. Here you take a voucher.\n  So now you are 55, and then you get older. If you are lucky enough to \nget health insurance, and you get older and now you are 70 or 80, and \nyou are taking an insufficient voucher--you are retired--this is a \ngiant nightmare. These are supposed to be the golden years. Well, the \npeople who lose this will have lost the golden Medicare guarantee, I \nwill tell you that.\n  Here is the final point. The Republicans say if you have Medicare, \ndon't worry. You are fine. Baloney. If you end Medicare, destroy it \nlike the Republicans do, the people left in it are part of a dying \nprogram that is being phased out. Who is going to try to improve the \nquality of that program? It is going to be like fixing an Edsel or \nfixing your typewriter. There is no more Medicare. It is going to be a \nprogram that is dying, that is being phased out, and that will hurt \ncurrent senior citizens.\n  So let's be clear. The Ryan budget, the Republican budget, takes the \nMedicare promise and shreds it, destroys it, and it is the end.\n  When President Johnson signed the Medicare law in 1965, here is what \nhe said:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings they have carefully put away over a \n     lifetime. No longer will young families see their own incomes \n     eaten away because they are carrying out their deep moral \n     obligation to their parents, to their uncles and their aunts.\n\n  So I am saying to Senator Murray: Thank you, thank you, thank you, \nfor your leadership. I am saying to Democrats such as Senator Coons, \nwho has organized this today, thank you for your leadership, thank you \nfor a budget that recognizes our obligations to our seniors, to our \nveterans, to our children, to this Nation, to make sure this is a \nNation of innovation, and thank you for protecting transportation, an \nissue that I care deeply about as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. Without being able to move people and move \ngoods, our Nation will not be a leading economic power.\n  So I thank you, and I yield back to Senator Coons.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank my good friend from California and the other \nmembers of the Budget Committee who have worked so hard to pull \ntogether this proposal, this package, this budget resolution that comes \nto the Senate floor today.\n  I think this is a great week for the Congress. We are at last, in \nstark contrast, presenting to the people of the United States a budget \npath forward adopted by the Republican-led House and a budget path \nforward adopted by the Democrat-led Budget Committee. Hopefully, this \nwill not just be debated but adopted in this Chamber this week.\n  Let me briefly summarize the main points made by my colleagues. \nFirst, as the Senator from California emphasized, one of the core \nelements of the Ryan budget plan that gives us real pause and concern \nis that it doesn't keep our promises to our seniors, to our veterans, \nand to our most vulnerable populations.\n  It block grants Medicaid, it repeals the health care law's expansion \nof Medicaid, it repeals the health care's law exchange subsidies, and, \nmore important than anything else, it turns Medicare into a voucher \nprogram. These are fundamental changes.\n  When Chairman Murray began our deliberations as a budget committee, \nshe laid out three core values she wanted us to keep in mind; that our \nbudget resolution should, first, help grow the economy and help the \nprivate sector create jobs, and I believe it does that by prioritizing \ncritical investments in infrastructure, in education, and in R \nsecond, to keep our promises to our seniors, to our veterans, to those \nin our country to whom we have made commitments over decades--something \nI would add, that we also continue to respect and embrace a circle of \nprotection for the most vulnerable in our society; and last, that we \nmake credible progress toward reducing our deficit and debt but in a \nsustainable way that allows us to continue to grow our economy from the \nmiddle out.\n  Let me turn for a few minutes to some criticisms or challenges that\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nmany of us on the Democratic side of the Senate have of the Ryan \nRepublican budget. Briefly, it relies on outlandishly rosy assumptions \nabout revenue and spending levels. It counts $716 billion in Medicare \nsavings from the very health care reform law it says is repealed, and \nthat tension within the Ryan budget is irresolvable.\n  Third, $810 billion in Medicaid savings are just cost-shifted onto \nthe State governments. As we know, States all across this country are \nstruggling to balance their budgets today. These costs are not trimmed. \nThey are simply shifted from the Federal Government onto the States.\n  Fourth, Ryan relies on $800 billion in undefined savings in mandatory \nprograms, significant cuts that would have dramatic and negative \nimpacts on our country and on our economy. There is $800 billion in \ncuts that he doesn't specify out of his total $962 billion in overall \nsavings to so-called other mandatory spending.\n  Last, Ryan claims his tax cuts for the wealthy--which cost more than \n$4.5 trillion--wouldn't add to the deficit. To give some visual sense \nof the likely impact, it is anything but balanced. While Ryan claims \nhis budget plan would balance the budget--and I challenge that \nassumption, given all these different mathematical and programmatic \nchallenges--it is also doing it in a way that is fundamentally \nunbalanced and that doesn't respect our core values. To double down on \ntax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, to give an additional tax \nbreak of more than one-quarter million dollars a year to the very \nwealthiest Americans while shifting that tax burden onto the middle \nclass doesn't make sense. It doesn't meet the test of fairness and it \ndoesn't meet the test of sustaining economic growth in a balanced way.\n  Last year, the independent Tax Policy Center analyzed the Ryan rate \nreduction, the proposal to reduce rates on the wealthiest Americans to \n25 percent, and estimated that unless those costs were offset with \ncorresponding tax hikes, it would add $4.5 trillion to our deficit.\n  So which one is it? Does the plan shift tax burden to middle-class \nAmericans as was described in some detail by my colleagues or does it \nactually add to the deficit and fail the test of balance?\n  Let me move then to the question of revenue and how our budget \npackage achieves some contribution to balance going forward. One of the \nthings that I think is important for folks watching the difference \nbetween these two plans to grasp is that both plans make significant \nchanges to what my colleague from Maryland talked about as spending \nthrough the Tax Code.\n  We spend almost as much as we receive in revenue through a Tax Code \nthat, in the many years since 1986, has become riddled with loopholes, \nexemptions, and special treatments, particularly for the wealthiest and \nbest connected. Both plans--the Ryan plan in the House and the \nDemocratic plan in the Senate--both close tax loopholes. Out of an \nestimated $14 trillion in these tax expenditures over the next decade, \nthe Ryan plan actually cuts $5.7 trillion. The Democratic plan that we \nare moving forward today only cuts 7 percent of these tax expenditures. \nThat is how I think we can credibly say it would not cut into those tax \nexpenditures relied on by the middle class--things such as the home \nmortgage deduction, the deduction for employer-provided health care, \nthe deduction for charitable contributions. This 7-percent reduction in \ntax expenditures is much more modest than the significant amount of \nrevenue raised in the Republican plan.\n  The more important contrast, though, is to what end. What do we do \nwith these two significant differences in revenue raised through \nclosing tax loopholes? As I said a few minutes ago, the Ryan plan would \ndedicate it almost exclusively to reducing tax rates for corporations \nand the wealthiest Americans while, in our balanced plan, this is half \nof the total contributions we make toward deficit reduction.\n  Let me move toward a close with a few conclusory comments. There are \nreasons to say the House Republican plan makes cuts that will grind our \neconomy to a halt, makes cuts that are unduly focused on just those \nareas that we think deserve investment: research and development, \ninfrastructure, education, public health. In my view, it wipes out the \nchance for us to continue to expand high-tech manufacturing to ensure \nthat we have a more competitive economy, to cure life-threatening \ndiseases, and to bring America's economy fully back to health. It \nrelies on budget gimmicks and on faulty assumptions. In my view, the \nplan we move forward today is a more balanced and responsible path \nforward to keeping our promises to seniors and veterans, to protecting \nthe most vulnerable in our society, to dealing with our deficit and \ndebt, and to moving this country forward.\n  The future that our budget plan would move us toward is the kind I \nenvision for my kids, for my State, and for our country--one where we \ncan grow our economy but continue to respect our most basic values.\n  Even though the Ryan plan, in my view, fails a basic test of values, \nit also fails a basic test of balance. We have a budget that this body \nwill take up and consider today and I hope we will pass. As it passed \nout of committee with the strong leadership of Chairman Murray, I am \nconfident it will pass out of this Chamber today. From that passage, it \nis my hope that people of the United States can see us begin to work \ntogether on a balanced bipartisan plan that will responsibly deal with \nour deficit and debt, grow our economy but continue to respect our most \nfundamental values.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, was the time used there time against the \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. The Senator from Washington specified that \nthe time would be taken off the resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we understand what is happening here. \nThe budget produced by the majority does not balance, doesn't come \nclose to balancing, does not change in any measurable way the debt \ncourse we are on that the Congressional Budget Office Director said is \nunsustainable.\n  This budget taxes more, it spends more, and does not change the debt \ncourse we are on; therefore, it is a budget about to bankrupt America \nbecause, as Mr. Elmendorf said, our current deficit plan endangers our \nfuture.\n  They have used--we have counted--now over 30 times the word \n``balanced.'' We have heard a balanced approach, a balanced plan; a \nbalanced approach, a balanced plan. But it does not balance.\n  Senator Coons, a great Senator, was a county commissioner. He \nbalanced his budget and gained acclaim for it, and it wasn't a balanced \napproach--it was a balanced budget.\n  The Presiding Officer has been a Governor and balanced his budget. \nAll former Governors in this body balanced budgets--real balance.\n  A balanced approach means nothing, nada, zero. A balanced approach \nmeans nothing. It is an excuse to tax and spend and not change the debt \ncourse of America. At some point, every Senator is going to have a \nmoral responsibility to decide whether they want to stay on that \ncourse.\n  The Ryan budget is not before us. This motion that I have does not \nrequire the committee to have a Ryan budget. This motion would simply \nsay: Committee, go back and look at this budget. Committee, do a budget \nthat balances, and if you want to tax oil companies, if you want to tax \nrich people more, lay it out. If you want to cut spending in some other \narea than Ryan wants to cut spending, do so. But remember, Ryan does \nnot cut spending.\n  We see the chart up here. How much does Ryan cut spending? Ryan's \nbudget doesn't cut spending. Our proposal is not to cut spending. It \nincreases spending every single year. One of the ways this country is \ngoing broke is, when they reduce the growth of spending, they say it is \na cut. That kind of logic is why we are going broke.\n  If we change the growth rate from 5.4 percent that we are on now to \n3.4 percent, this budget would balance. We can grow spending every year \nand balance the budget--no net cuts. Some programs ought to be \neliminated but no net cuts.\n  We are glad to have Senator Thune, who has served so ably on the \nBudget Committee for many years, is thoroughly knowledgeable about \nthese issues and is part of the leadership in\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\nour conference and I yield to him on the resolution.\n  How much time remains on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately, 16 hours, 30 minutes on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \neloquence in laying out what is at stake in this budget debate we are \nhaving and for also pointing out, once again, that the budget before us \nin the Senate doesn't balance.\n  In a way, the speakers who have been here before on the Democratic \nside have been talking about another budget. They are talking about a \nbudget that is under consideration in the other House, in the House of \nRepresentatives. They are not talking about their budget.\n  I suspect one of the reasons they don't want to talk about their \nbudget is it is a budget that, for all intents and purposes, will hurt \neconomic growth, cost jobs, and lower take-home pay for middle-class \nAmericans because it doubles down on the failed policies of the past 4 \nyears, which have consisted of more spending, more borrowing and more \ntaxes, and that is what this budget is about.\n  I wish to quote something from the Washington Post editorial page in \nregard to the Democratic budget that is before us.\n\n       Except for the part about no imminent crisis, the Senate \n     Democratic budget recognizes none of this.\n\n  They are talking about the challenges we face with regard to the \nfiscal crisis we are in.\n\n       Partisan in tone and complacent in substance, it scores \n     points against the Republicans and reassures the party's \n     liberal base--but deepens these senators' commitment to an \n     unsustainable policy agenda.\n       In short, this document gives voters no reason to believe \n     that Democrats have a viable plan for--or even a responsible \n     public assessment of--the country's long-term fiscal \n     predicament.\n\n  This is their assessment of the budget debate that is going on in the \nSenate. The Washington Post editorial page isn't exactly a bastion of \nconservative thought, but note what they say about this: It is not a \nviable plan. It is not even a responsible public assessment of the \ncountry's long-term fiscal predicament.\n  This is precisely what is wrong with this budget and why the \nDemocrats who come down to the floor of the Senate aren't talking about \nit. They are coming down to talk about the budget that is under \nconsideration today in the House of Representatives--which, \nincidentally, does actually balance in 10 years.\n  The first motion that is under consideration in the Senate is to \nrecommit this back to produce a balanced budget.\n  It strikes me, at least, that I think most Americans would accept the \nlogic, if you will--the notion, that we ought to be able to submit a \nbalanced budget--at least a budget that balances in a 10-year period.\n  Most Americans have to make decisions every single year. They have to \nfigure out how they are going to go about balancing their own family \nbudget, how to make what is coming in the door meet the expenses that \nthey have to deal with in their daily lives. Yet the Democratic budget \nthat is before us not only doesn't balance in 10 years, it doesn't \nbalance ever--it doesn't balance ever.\n  That is why this motion that is before us to recommit this budget to \nthe Senate Budget Committee and to produce a budget that actually does \nbalance is something I hope my colleagues on both sides will support.\n  It is time we got serious about doing the important work of the \nSenate, taking care of the people's business, which is to get spending \non a more responsible and sustainable fiscal path so future generations \nof Americans aren't saddled with this massive burden of debt, so we can \nprotect and save programs--important programs such as Social Security \nand Medicare--which are on a pathway to bankruptcy.\n  Social Security is already operating at a cash deficit; in other \nwords, there isn't enough money coming in, in the form of payroll \ntaxes, to pay the benefits that are due to Social Security \nbeneficiaries. Medicare is going to be bankrupt 10 years from now and \neven in the hospital part of that trust fund, by the year 2016, \naccording to the CBO.\n\n  It is clear. These things are looking us right in the face. This is \nnot something out there on the horizon, these are issues today that \nneed to be dealt with. Yet the Democratic budget before us does \nabsolutely nothing to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing \nthis country. What are we going to do to save Social Security and \nMedicare and Medicaid?\n  In fact, according to the CBO, by the year 2023, 10 years from now, \nmandatory spending will represent 91 percent of all Federal spending. \nThink about that. It is about 62 percent today. We are on a trajectory \nand a pathway over the next decade to where 90 cents--over 90 cents out \nof every dollar is paying for those basic core programs with nothing \nleft over. How are we going to fund the military or defense or the \nother priorities this government deals with every single day when over \n90 cents out of every dollar is going to be spent on these programs? \nYet this budget does nothing to address those important fiscal \nproblems.\n  What it does do is it grows government--a 62-percent increase in \ngovernment spending over the next decade. It adds $7.3 trillion to the \nFederal debt, and that is on top of the $6 trillion that has been added \nin the last 4 years. It raises taxes. The Democrats will say it is only \nby $975 billion, about $1 trillion. But if you look inside the numbers, \nthey replace the sequester--another $\\1/2\\ trillion--with a fund, some \nsort of fund. What is going to fund that? Spending cuts? I do not think \nso. We are talking about up to a $1.5 trillion tax increase in this \nbudget on top of the $1.7 trillion tax increase we have already seen \nunder this President and the Democrats here in the Congress.\n  What does that mean? They say it is just a tax on the rich. We just \nneed the rich to pay a little more. They need to pay their fair share.\n  They got a big, fat tax increase with the fiscal cliff. They got a \nbig, fat tax increase with the $1 trillion in ObamaCare. The rich are \ngetting hit with higher taxes, but what is happening is a lot of these \ntax increases are starting to hit the middle class, and they are \nstarting to figure this out. If you are a middle-class American and \nthey are saying: Let's soak the rich a little more, that is OK, the \nrich can pay more--Mr. President, I have to tell you, it is coming at \nyou. If you are a middle-class American, you cannot tax the rich enough \nto do all the things these guys want to do to increase Federal spending \nand grow the size of the Federal Government.\n  Our focus should not be on growing the government; it ought to be on \ngrowing the economy. This budget does absolutely nothing to get the \neconomy growing again. It simply does what we have done in the past 4 \nyears; that is, increase spending, increase borrowing, and increase \ntaxes.\n  If you don't think the taxes are hitting the middle class already, \njust look at your health insurance premiums because the tax increases \nin ObamaCare were taxes on, yes, medical device companies, taxes on \nyour health insurance plan, taxes on pharmaceuticals, all of which are \nbeing passed on in the form of higher costs to average working \nAmericans.\n  We have a crisis in this country that affects the middle-income \nfamilies, people who are out there every single day just trying to do \ntheir best to make their budget balance and do the important things to \nplan for the future of their children and grandchildren, and here we \nare in Washington, DC, debating yet more policies that are going to \nhurt the economy, going to crush job creation in this country and lower \ntake-home pay for those very middle-class American families.\n  This is the wrong approach. I hope as we debate this we will have an \nopportunity to vote on amendments. Perhaps there is a way we can make \nthis better. I doubt that to be the case. This budget is so far off in \nterms of where we need to be going as a country. If we are serious \nabout getting the economy growing and expanding again, creating jobs \nfor middle-class Americans, and doing something about the massive \namount of debt we are passing on to future generations, this budget is \nthe exact wrong prescription for that. We can do much better by the \nAmerican people, and we need to. I hope that during the course of this \ndebate that will\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nbecome clear and that we will move in a different direction for the \nfuture of this country.\n  I see the leader is here on the floor. I will conclude my remarks at \nleast for the time being and allow him to make his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota. \nHe is entirely correct. This budget is extreme, and it is unbalanced. \nWhat would happen if it passed? We would have a tax hike of up to $1.5 \ntrillion. That would be the largest in U.S. history. It would cost the \naverage middle-class family literally thousands.\n  Democrats here in Washington, as Senator Thune and Senator Sessions \npointed out, already just got billions of dollars in new taxes at the \nend of the year--about $600 billion because the tax law expired, the \nfiscal cliff; then they got $1 trillion more out of ObamaCare. So this \nwould be on top of all of that--$1.5 trillion on top of the $1.6 \ntrillion that is already going into effect. And there is a nearly two-\nthirds increase in big government spending.\n  It would siphon $\\1/2\\ trillion out of our economy and into the hands \nof Washington bureaucrats and the people in Congress to spend; 42 \npercent more debt, with each American owing up to $73,000; and an \naverage of 850,000 fewer jobs every year. That is about 11,500 jobs in \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky. Medicare would be allowed to go bankrupt \nin a few years, and this budget would not balance--not this year, not \ntomorrow, not ever.\n  A lot of Democrats here in Washington are saying they simply don't \ncare about balancing the budget anymore. It certainly shows with this \none. Their budget will not give Americans a better economy. There won't \nbe any real job creation or the kind of deficit reduction we all know \nthe country needs, just a massive tax hike and more spending to grow \nthe bureaucracy from the pockets of the middle class out.\n  Our Democratic friends here in Washington like to say that budgets \nare not just about dollars and cents, they are about values. What their \nbudget tells me is that they have completely lost touch with the hopes \nand concerns and aspirations of their constituents, that they are \nputting the needs of government ahead of those who elected them. The \nbudget we waited 4 years for--4 long years we have waited for a \nDemocratic budget--is just a rehash of the extreme policies that \ncontinue to pummel the middle class. As all of us have said, it is time \nto grow the economy, not the government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we have among the many people who serve in \nthe Senate some people who have balanced budgets and done it----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from South \nDakota? The Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota \nsuch time as he and Senator Johanns would utilize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if you would, that would be from the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. We have among the Senators who serve in the Senate people \nwho have balanced budgets and done it the old-fashioned way, the hard \nway, one of whom is the former Governor of the State of Nebraska, now \nSenator, Mike Johanns. Senator Johanns, like me, comes from the \nmidwestern part of the country where common sense prevails and where \npeople are not unaccustomed to having to tighten their belts a little \nbit during difficult times. As a consequence of that, many of those \nStates in that part of the country are well managed, and they elect \nleaders who bring those types of principles to their leadership and to \nthe way they govern among their States.\n  So the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, has a long record--not \nonly as a Governor, I might add, but as a mayor. He has been an \nexecutive. He knows what it is like to make those hard decisions, and \nhe is someone who, like me, is very concerned that we get on a more \nsustainable fiscal path for this country, get our fiscal house here in \nWashington, DC, in order, and make sure we are not bankrupting this \ncountry and saddling the next generation with massive amounts of debt.\n  I yield to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Johanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \na nice introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on the \nbudget that has been proposed by the majority party.\n  If I might lay a little groundwork, in addition to what the Senator \nfrom South Dakota said about me, my time in elected office dates back \nto 1983. I was first elected to be a county commissioner in Lancaster \nCounty. After that, I went to the Lincoln City Council, where I served \nfor a couple of years, primarily because I had concerns about where the \nbudget of the city of Lincoln was headed. I ran for mayor of Lincoln, \nand I served two terms as mayor of the city of Lincoln in a strong \nmayor form of government. From there I went to the Governor's office of \nthe State of Nebraska, and from there I went on to become Secretary of \nAgriculture in the Bush administration, and 4 years ago I joined the \nSenate after running for election.\n  I have dealt with government budgets all of my career. I worked on my \nfirst budget when I was 32 years old. The one thing I knew was that it \nhad to be balanced or it was not going to work. I have submitted \nbudgets over and over again through those years, all balanced.\n  But let me focus a little more intently on the State of Nebraska and \nmy time as Governor there. Nebraskans have a very practical approach to \nspending money. It is very straightforward. If you don't have the \nmoney, you don't spend it. It is that straightforward. You see, in our \nconstitution, when the founders of our State wrote our State \nconstitution, they worried about the very thing that is happening with \nthis budget being presented by the majority. They worried that there \nwould be politicians who would figure out that if they just kept \nborrowing and spending, they could get themselves reelected over and \nover. But they also realized that was no course for a State, so they \nput into our constitution that the politicians could borrow $100,000. I \nsuspect that when our constitution was written over 100 years ago, many \nat that time looked at $100,000 and said to themselves: That is a \nhandsome amount of money. Obviously, in today's world, $100,000 doesn't \nget you very far. In those years--post-9/11, I might add, when the \neconomy had tanked because of what happened on 9/11--we were not only \nbalancing the budget, we were not borrowing money to do it.\n  The other thing I would say is this. The Presiding Officer \nunderstands this as a former Governor. There was always a day of \nreckoning for the Governor. It was called the State of the State \naddress, when you would walk into a chamber like this and you would lay \nout your plan for the State, and every media outlet in the State was \nthere examining every word of the budget you submitted, every single \nsenator was listening to every word you had to say, and if you laid out \na plan that did not work or was filled with gimmicks, then the \neditorials the next day were devastating. You could never do that.\n  Let me compare that experience over those many years doing those many \nthings with what I am faced with today as a Senator. This is what I am \nfaced with. In order to support this budget, I, a former Governor, \nmayor, county commissioner, city council member who has balanced every \nsingle budget I ever submitted, would have to go home to Nebraskans and \nsay this: My fellow Nebraskans, I just supported a budget that has over \na $1 trillion tax increase. I would have to go on to say: That would be \non top of the $600 billion tax increase last year. That would be on top \nof the $1 trillion of new tax increases in ObamaCare, and that is what \nI would have to say in order to support this budget to the citizens of \nNebraska. I would also have to say to them that notwithstanding the \nfact that I have balanced your budgets for over 30 years in every \nbudget I ever submitted, our Nation's debt in this budget will grow by \n$24.4 trillion by the end of the 10-year budget cycle. That is $7.3 \ntrillion in new debt.\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\n  Let me just offer a thought on that. One could argue that at my age, \nage 62, maybe that doesn't mean a lot. After all, the Good Lord \nwilling, I am probably not going to be on this Earth forever. It is \njust the way it works for human beings. Let me look around and see who \nis going to pay for this. Well, I know this weekend when I go back \nhome--if we get back home--I am going to see my kids and grandkids. My \nkids are in their thirties. I am going to see my grandkids who range in \nage from 5 to 13. I am not going to have to look very far because if I \nvote for this budget, I am saying to my kids and my grandkids: I hope \nyour life turns out OK because you are taking on, at the end of this \n10-year budget window, $24.4 trillion of debt.\n  Now, let me compare that to how I started my adult life. When I was \n20 years old, this Nation owed $380 billion of debt. So what I am \nsaying to my kids and grandkids is I supported this budget, because \nhere is where you are going to end up. You are going to end up starting \nyour adult life with about $25 trillion of debt. I started my life with \n$380 billion. So when there is a war--which I wish I could say it will \nnever happen, but it does--when there is a flu pandemic, when you want \nto do something more to educate your children, you are going to be \nhampered.\n  They are going to be paying back the debt I ran up during my life if \nI support this budget. This budget balloons the debt by 42 percent. \nThat is what I will tell my kids and grandkids when I go home this \nweekend if I vote for this budget.\n  Net interest on the debt over the 10 years will total $5.2 trillion. \nWhat do we get out of that? What can we tell our kids and grandkids \nthey get out of that? Well, they get to pay China back for lending us \nmoney. No schools will be built, there are no new teachers who will be \nhired, and there is no better health care which will be provided. That \nis just to service the debt our generation is running up.\n  Our debt, as a percentage of the gross domestic product under this \nbudget, never goes below 90 percent of our economy. Actually, for 4 out \nof the 10 years it is over 100 percent. Every economist will say if we \nget into that stratosphere, the warning lights will be going off, the \nflags will be waving--stop, stop, stop borrowing the money. If I would \nhave suggested anything like this as the Governor of Nebraska or the \nmayor of Lincoln, I would have been laughed out of the chamber.\n  Annual deficits. Even with all of the tax increases and gimmicks \nunder this budget, we never get under $400 billion a year in new debt \nwe are taking on. It ranges between $891 billion annually--on top of \nthe nearly $17 trillion we owe today--to $407 billion annually. We \nnever get close to a balance.\n  Senator Sessions says it so well: Balanced? What is balanced about \nthis? I have been balancing budgets my whole life. This is not \nbalanced. This is crazy. This is insane. This is adding debt to the \nshoulders of our children and grandchildren who are already up to their \neyeballs in debt because of the spending that is going on.\n  Looking at the spending, it actually increases. Today's budget is \n$3.6 trillion. Under this budget--if I vote for this--it will go to \n$5.7 trillion in 2023, and that is a 60-percent increase.\n  Entitlements. You know what. I am 62 years old and in June I will be \n63. Two more years until Medicare, and a little bit after that I will \nreceive Social Security. People have talked about this great benefit \nthat Senators get. Well, I said to a group back in Nebraska, at 65 I am \ngoing to get this great benefit. I am not going to have to pay much for \nit, and it is going to pay for my health care costs until the moment of \nmy death. Everybody was looking at me. Wow, what is that plan? I said: \nLadies and gentlemen, it is Medicare.\n  I said: At a point in my life where I could afford to pay something \nfor it--and I would be happy to do that. I am not the richest person in \nthe Senate, but I am not the poorest either. So I am going to go on \nthis program and pass it on to my kids and grandkids. Is there anybody \nhere who wants to get up and say: My gosh, that is fair.\n  That is not fair. We should not be doing that. It is not right. What \ndoes this budget do to address that problem? Nothing.\n  In a townhall meeting I was at in Lincoln recently, I said: If you \nare 62 years old, it is probably going to work out for you. We will \nprobably borrow enough money to get Medicare and Social Security \nthroughout my life. For those 40-year-old Members in the Senate or \ncitizens who come to my townhall meeting, I am sorry, but I cannot make \nthat promise to them. The trustees are telling us we cannot make that \npromise.\n  We waited 4 years for a budget from the majority. Year after year the \nmajority leader would come down, stand right there and say: We are not \ngoing to be doing a budget this year. I wonder what the city council \nmeeting would have been like if I would have gone down in Lincoln, NE, \nand said: I have been thinking about this, and I will not be doing a \nbudget this year for the city of Lincoln. As Governor, I cannot imagine \nwalking into our chamber back home and saying: I have been thinking \nabout it, and I will not be doing a budget this year. Justifiably so, \nthe people of the great State of Nebraska would have been looking for a \nnew Governor and trying to figure out how to run the existing Governor \nout of office. Yet that is what we have been doing for the last 4 \nyears.\n  We have waited 4 years, and we finally get a budget that does nothing \nfor this country except increase taxes, increase the debt, increase \nspending, increase borrowing, and lay it off on our kids and grandkids \nwith whom we will all go home and spend time this weekend--if we get \nout of here. It is not right.\n  Even the newspapers have figured it out. USA Today says:\n\n       Disappointing . . . namby-pamby plan that underwhelms at \n     every turn . . . neither balances the budget or reins in \n     entitlements.\n\n  Now, I read the Washington Post, but I have to say, they are not \nalways the most favorable to Republicans, and that is the \nunderstatement of the day. Here is what the Washington Post said: \n``Gives voters no reason to believe Democrats have a viable plan.'' \nBoy, talk about a condemnation of a plan.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal said: ``Much higher taxes to fund much higher \nspending to finance a much bigger government.''\n  The Hill said: ``The Murray budget does not contain net spending cuts \nwith the sequester turned off.''\n  I talked at length today about going home and explaining what a \n``yes'' vote would mean on this budget. I am not going to do that. I am \nnot going to go home and tell people I voted for this budget. I just \nwant people to know right now that I will be a ``no'' vote on this \nbudget. I will be a ``no'' vote because somebody has to stand for the \npeople who are ultimately going to pay the bill.\n  We cannot pull the wool over the eyes of Nebraskans. They are just \ntoo darn discerning. They do not believe for a moment that all of this \ndebt and spending and taxation is going to be financed by the rich \nguys. They realize that at the end of the day, this is going to visit \nhome, and this is going to hammer the very people who are out there \nranching, farming, running small businesses, and trying to pay their \nbills and educate their kids so maybe even they can leave a little \nsomething behind for the grandkids. That is what we are facing.\n  We are facing literally a situation where if we don't stand up to \nthis, the day is not very far off where people's Social Security is in \njeopardy, their Medicare is in jeopardy, Medicaid is in jeopardy, and \nwe leave our children and grandchildren with this massive pile of debt. \nThere is just no way to deal with it unless we just slam their standard \nof living and tax the living daylights out of everybody, and that is \nwhere this is headed. There is no way I could justify this vote back \nhome.\n  I proudly announce that today I will be a ``no'' vote on this budget \nresolution, and I will do everything I can to stop it. It is the wrong \ncourse for our country.\n  I yield back to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska could not have \nput it better. He has great experience with budgets and the people of \nNebraska, who are similar to the people I represent in South Dakota.\n  Someone else who is also from a very similar State, the State of \nNorth Dakota--he is yet another Governor who,\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nwhen he came here, came here in many respects because of his record of \naccomplishment as a Governor. The people of North Dakota elected him by \nan overwhelming margin largely because he knows how important it is \nthat a State and country live within their means and that they not \nspend money they do not have. The Governor, and now Senator, of North \nDakota has a long and incredibly strong record when it comes to fiscal \nmatters. Again, like me, he represents a constituency which understands \nvery clearly what is at stake when it comes to balancing our budget and \nmaking sure we are not handing that debt down to those children and \ngrandchildren.\n  It is great to have here the Senator, my colleague and neighbor from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  I am pleased to be here to discuss this very important issue, the \nmatter of our budget, for this great Nation and to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Nebraska. I have had a tremendous \nopportunity to work with both of these Senators. Senator Thune and I \nhave been friends for many years and have worked on many issues \nimportant to this country and the Dakotas. Likewise, I have had an \nopportunity to work with Senator Johanns when I was Governor of North \nDakota; he was Governor of Nebraska.\n  I want to pick up on some of his comments, but I am going to start \nout in a broader sense; that is, we are here today to debate a budget \nfor this country. It is something we need to do. It needs to be a \nbudget that moves the country forward. It needs to be a budget that \nhelps us meet the challenges the American people want us to address. It \nneeds to be a budget that sets the right priorities. It needs to be a \nbudget that will help us truly reduce our debt and our deficit, and \nthat means it needs to balance. It needs to be a budget that balances \nin a timely way. It needs to balance without raising taxes.\n  We have millions of people in this country who want a job. They want \nto get back to work, and raising taxes will absolutely hurt our \neconomic growth and hurt their ability to get a job and to get back to \nwork. At the same time we are talking about reducing our deficit and \nour debt. That means we have to control our spending and find ways to \ncut and reduce spending in an intelligent way, but at the same time we \nneed economic growth. We cannot have higher taxes to hurt that economic \ngrowth, which kills jobs, but also it is that very economic growth, not \nhigher taxes, that produces the revenue--again, combined with the right \nkind of controlled spending reductions--that gets our debt and deficit \nunder control. The fact is this budget doesn't meet those very \nfundamental tests. It raises taxes by $1 trillion--more than $1 \ntrillion. That would be the largest tax increase in the history of our \ncountry. That will hurt our economy. That will hurt our ability to get \npeople back to work. That will hurt the economic growth we need to \nactually create revenue to address the debt and the deficit. So more \nthan $1 trillion in higher taxes that will truly hurt our economy. Yet, \neven with a $1 trillion tax increase, the budget doesn't balance. Think \nabout that: $1 trillion in tax increases and the budget doesn't \nbalance. Does that make sense? I don't mean it doesn't balance this \nyear; I don't mean it doesn't balance in 10 years; it doesn't balance.\n\n  So we can go through all the individual numbers and talk about all \nthe different aspects of this budget in great detail, and we will. But \nfor starters, on a fundamental basis, the Presiding Officer was a \nformer Governor, as was my colleague from Nebraska, and there are \nothers in this Chamber. We were required by the constitution of our \nrespective States to submit budgets that balanced, and balanced every \nsingle year. This budget raises taxes by over $1 trillion on the \nAmerican people, the largest tax increase in the history of our \ncountry, and it never balances. That is not setting the right \npriorities.\n  The Senator from Nebraska spoke a little bit about how he as a \nGovernor approached presenting a budget, and it is something every \nGovernor has to do. They have to present a budget to their respective \nlegislatures that sets the right priorities.\n  When I did that budgeting process, the way I approached it was to \nsay, OK, our budget first has to fund the right priorities. We have to \nset priorities. There is always more demand than there are resources \navailable, so we have to determine what the right priorities are and \nfund those priorities in the best way we can. We can't fund everything, \nso we have to set the right priorities.\n  Second, in our State--and I know in many States--we said as well that \nwe also needed to have a rainy day fund. We needed to be prepared for \nthe future. We shouldn't be running big debt and deficits; we should be \nhaving reserves for a rainy day. We should have an adequate reserve \nfund for the future.\n  Third, we always looked to determine how we could reduce the tax \nburden on our hard-working citizens, the taxpayers of our respective \nStates or the taxpayers of this country.\n  So fund priorities, build proper reserves, be fiscally sound and \nresponsible, just as we do for our homes and businesses. We want to \nmake sure we are in strong financial shape, we are fiscally solid and \nsound, have a reserve, and reduce the tax burden on our hard-working \ntaxpayers. This budget does none of those fundamental things that go \ninto building the right kind of budget. That is why I can't support \nthis budget and we should not pass this budget.\n  As we look at our country today, we have to get people back to work. \nWe have to get our economy growing. We have to reduce our deficit and \nour debt. We need to do it for our well-being today, for the well-being \nof our country today, and we need to do it for our children. This is \nabout our kids. This is absolutely about our kids. So that means we \nhave to have a budget that reduces our spending, that sets the right \npriorities, that controls and reduces spending. At the same time, we \nneed progrowth tax reform and not higher taxes that hurt our economy. \nWe need progrowth tax reform that gets our economy going, that gets \npeople back to work. And with a growing economy, we get revenue from \ngrowth, not higher taxes. We need to reform our vital programs. We \nneed, in a bipartisan way, to reform our programs such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare so we preserve and protect them for the long run. \nThat is what the American people want. That is what the American people \nare asking us to do.\n  So as we set this direction with this budget--something that is \nincredibly important for our country--with all of these different \naspects, we have to have the right priorities. This budget does not \nhave the right priorities.\n  Members have to ask themselves as they vote on this budget: Does this \nbudget set the right priorities? Does it properly control our spending? \nWill it put our fiscal house in order? Does it increase or reduce the \ntax burden on our hard-working taxpayers? We should ask ourselves those \nquestions as we deliberate.\n  I know the American people will be asking those same questions. Those \nare the priorities that have to be fully evaluated and properly \naddressed in any budget, and this budget doesn't do that. For that \nreason I cannot support it, and I believe it should not be passed. I \nbelieve we should go back to work and create a budget that truly does \nthose things: controls spending, sets the right priorities, doesn't \nraise taxes, and that truly does what the American people want and need \nus to do.\n  With that, I turn again to my distinguished colleague from South \nDakota. I thank him for leading this colloquy, and I look forward to \nworking with him on this very important issue.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nthink he put it absolutely right in terms of what the priorities should \nbe and what the stakes are in the budget debate. I thank him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I want to close with one final point he made. He spoke a lot about \nthe impact on the economy and what happens when we get economic growth. \nHis State is a good example of this, because the State of North Dakota \nhas a growing economy. And when we have a growing economy, we have \npeople who are making money, people who are working, people who are \ninvesting, and that means people are paying more taxes, and that is how \nwe get more revenue. What we need is a growing economy.\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\n  In the last 4 years, the average growth rate is less than 1 percent, \neight-tenths of 1 percent. The 60-year average of economic growth, \npost-World War II, is 3.3 percent. So we are growing at less than 1 \npercent. In the last 4 years we have added $6 trillion to the debt, and \nwe still have 12 million people unemployed and an unemployment rate \nthat continues to hover around 8 percent.\n  Having said that, wouldn't we think we would want to try something \ndifferent and go in a different direction? Yet this budget doubles \ndown. It flat doubles down on these failed policies of the past 4 years \nthat are antigrowth, antijobs, and continue to tax and spend and borrow \nas if there is no tomorrow. We need a different path. We need a \ndifferent approach.\n  So I hope, as we have this debate over the course of the next couple \nof days, it will become clear not only to the Senators here in this \nChamber but to the American people who really is interested in getting \nrevenue the right way, which is through growing our economy, creating \njobs, getting Americans back to work, and doing something about the \ndebt and the spending crisis we have in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 60 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia. Both Senators from Virginia are here. They are both great \nmembers of our committee who have contributed a great deal of time and \neffort in helping us get on to a path of sustainable economic recovery \nand deficit reduction. I appreciate the work of both of them.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia to offer a resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank the chairman \nof the committee for her great work in putting together what is this \nfirst step toward getting this issue that has plagued this body and \nplagued this country behind us.\n  This budget, as I have said to her and others, wouldn't have been the \nexact one I would have drafted. However, it reflects the varying \nconcerns of the Democratic caucus. It is a budget that is credible, \nthat is real, that moves us forward, and that has as part of its core \nall of the critical ingredients.\n  Anyone who has looked at this problem--I know the chairman of the \ncommittee has, I know the ranking member has; many of us have wrestled \nwith this; all of the bipartisan groups have wrestled with this issue--\nhave all said we have to do three or four things. No. 1, we have to \nhave additional revenues. No. 2, we have to do entitlement reform. No. \n3, we do need, yes, smart, targeted cuts on both the discretionary side \nand the defense side.\n  The Democratic budget, compared to what has now been as I understand \nin the last hour passed by the House, is the only document, the only \nbudget that has all four of the component parts of any solution that \nwill get this problem of the $16.5 trillion debt that our Nation faces, \nand a debt that goes up by $3 billion a day, to start putting a \nrealistic, real plan in place to attack this problem in a real way.\n  I wish my colleagues from North and South Dakota were still here, \nbecause I, as was my good friend and colleague, the Senator from North \nDakota, was a Governor as well and, yes, we had to balance our budgets. \nI and my colleague, my great friend, the junior Senator from Virginia, \nwas a Governor as well. I have to tell my colleagues, I will match our \nrecord of fiscal responsibility in Virginia and progrowth policies in \nVirginia with any State in the Nation. Independent rankings have named \nVirginia the best managed State in the country, the best State for \nbusiness, the best State for educational opportunity. Those are not my \nwords, not the words of the Senator from Virginia, but independent \nvalidation.\n  How did we get there? Well, the remarkable thing was what we had in \nVirginia because of actions of prior administrations. When I came in \nand when the Senator from Virginia was my lieutenant governor, we had a \nstructural budget deficit. How did we have that structural budget \ndeficit? One, because we had spent too much, yes, but also what we put \nin place was a tax code and a revenue stream that would never meet the \nneeds of basic operations of government.\n  That analogy is actually what we face now in the United States of \nAmerica. Yes, we do need to find ways to limit our spending. But what I \nfind curious from all of my colleagues who talk about this issue is \ntheir constant focus on the spend side with virtually no mention of \nwhat we in this Nation have done on the revenue side.\n  Anybody who can read a balance sheet--and I take great pride in the \nfact that I was a businessman long before I was a politician--realizes \nwe have a revenue side and spending side. If we take a moment and look \nat what previous Congresses have done on the revenue side, back in \nearly 2002, 2003, we put in place a tax cut that cut $4.5 trillion out \nof the revenue stream over 10 years. We had an expectation we would see \nbudget surpluses as far as the eye could see. Well, I think there is \nnot an economist anywhere or, for that matter, virtually any elected \nofficial, who would at least acknowledge privately that in retrospect \nthat was a tax cut of unsustainable proportions. What is particularly \nremarkable when we talk about growth is that some of the period of our \nNation's highest economic growth took place during the 1990s under \nPresident Clinton when we had a Tax Code that generated that additional \n$4.5 trillion of revenue over a 10-year period.\n  What is remarkable about all of the debates and all of the groups \nthat have looked at this, all of which have included new revenue back \ninto the revenue stream along with targeted cuts, along with \nentitlement reform, is that every one of those independent reviews of \nour problem has said the only way we get a balanced approach to get \nthis debt and deficit under control is yes, cuts, yes, entitlement \nreform, but, yes, additional revenue as well.\n  The plan that is most often cited on this floor is the Simpson-Bowles \nreport. Simpson-Bowles, on a 10-year basis, based upon the baselines \nthey used in 2010, would have generated $2.2 trillion of net new \nrevenue--$2.2 trillion of net new revenue. Again, thinking about that \nin the context of what we cut, that is less than half of the amount of \ntaxes we cut back in 2003. So even the most ambitious proposal has said \nwe do not need to go back to the Clinton tax rates when our country was \nprospering at unparalleled rates. We do not need to put back all of \nthat revenue. We do not even need to put 50 percent of that revenue \nback in. But we do need to put somewhere between one-third and 40 \npercent of the revenue back into the revenue stream to make sure we \ncorrect the structural deficit on both the spending side and the \nrevenue side.\n  What does this budget do? Well, we put $600 billion back in on New \nYear's Eve in a deal where many of us maybe had to hold our nose or our \nbreath on, but it was back in the revenue stream. We put on top of that \nnow another $1 trillion back in--$975 billion back into the revenue \nstream. That puts us at $1.575 trillion of net new revenue back in--\n$1.575 trillion--literally only one-third of the revenue that was taken \nout with the $4.5 trillion tax cut in the so-called Bush tax cuts.\n  So I find it a little strange for those who are saying: Let's look at \nthe country's balance sheet--and, yes, we have to cut spending--not to \nreflect back upon the incredible growth we had back in the 1990s and \nrecognize we have both a structural problem on the spending side but \nalso a structural problem on the revenue side.\n  I have to tell you, from any kind of reasonable standpoint, putting \none-third of the revenues we took away back into the revenue stream \nseems to me to be a reasonable, balanced, thoughtful, and, candidly, on \nany kind of operational basis, business basis, fiscally conservative \napproach.\n  I have colleagues here, and I want to engage in a conversation about \nsequester, but I also have to make one other point that particularly \nbothers me about what the House, which just passed their budget, did \nand I assume that many of my Republican colleagues, I guess, are \nendorsing.\n  I 100 percent agree with my colleagues that we have to have a growth \nagenda in America. You cannot, no matter how much you cut, cut your way \nto prosperity. And you cannot--and I know our Republican colleagues \nagree--you cannot spend your way and tax your way to prosperity. You \nhave to have a growth agenda.\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n  Well, for 20 years before I got into politics, my business was \ninvesting in businesses that were growth businesses. I was a venture \ncapitalist. I was proud to cofound Nextel, close to 70 other \ntechnology-related companies. Anybody who was an investor in \nbusinesses--whether you were me or whether you were Mitt Romney at Bain \nCapital--looked at a couple of key components of any business in which \nyou would invest. There were generally three items you would look at on \nany business plan. One was, did that business invest in its workforce, \nbecause in a global economy there is a global competition for talent, \nand the most important criteria you can look at, if a business is going \nto be successful, is, are the workers going to be trained and are they \ngoing to be able to compete and do the job?\n  The second thing you would look at--of any business I would look at--\nis, does that business have a plan to invest in its plant and \nequipment? Whether you are creating software or making widgets, are you \ngoing to stay current in a very competitive marketplace with how you \nmake things?\n  The third issue is, no matter how successful your business is today, \nare you going to stay competitive in this global economy and how do you \nstay ahead of the competition, because no matter how good you are \ntoday, somebody tomorrow is going to come up with a new idea.\n  I would invest in businesses that met those three criteria. I would \nsay that former Governor Romney had a very successful record at Bain in \nmany cases. I bet he looked at those same three criteria.\n  Countries, in a very similar way, have their own business plans, and \nbudgets kind of reflect those business plans. We may call it different \nitems, but we have those same three criteria: workforce, plant and \nequipment, staying ahead of the competition. We just call it different \nitems. We call it our investment in education and workforce training. \nIn terms of plant and equipment, we call it our investment in \ninfrastructure because how well your economy, how well your country is \ngoing to do is how well your roads, your rail, your ports, and your \nbroadband are, how well you can move goods and equipment in an \nefficient and effective manner. The third item is, how do you stay \nahead of your competition? Well, in the global economy, staying ahead \nof your competition means, what is going to be your value added? That \nis going to be your intellectual capital and your ideas. That means \nresearch and development.\n  Well, under the growth agenda criteria, under the business plan \ncriteria, under the investment criteria, the House budget that just \npassed--and I hope I find my Republican colleagues will contradict me \nand say: No, no, we do not want to do this, but the House budget that \njust passed takes Federal domestic discretionary spending, which is \ncurrently only 16 cents on every tax dollar that we spend in America--\nand for those viewers, in English, non-Washingtonese, domestic \ndiscretionary spending is, yes, money we spend on the environment and \nenergy and law enforcement and early childhood, but it is also the \nmoney we spend in the Federal Government on education, infrastructure, \nand research and development. It takes that 16 cents--not a very high \nnumber right now even--and takes it over about a 20-year period to less \nthan 5 cents.\n  I have to tell you, I would never invest in a business that spent \nless than 5 percent of its revenues on its workforce, its plant and \nequipment, and staying ahead of the competition. I would never invest \nas a nation in a nation that is spending less than 5 percent of its \nrevenues on the education of its people, the infrastructure of its \nnation, and the research and development to stay ahead of the \ncompetition.\n  I tell you, I have spent a lot of time as somebody who looks at what \nsome of our competitive countries are doing. China is spending, just on \ninfrastructure, four times the percentage of their GDP what we are; \nIndia, significantly more as a percentage of their GDP on education; \neven Europe, with all its challenges, significantly more than what this \nHouse budget would spend on America's business plan, on America's \ngrowth agenda.\n  I have to tell you, I would never invest in it. I have to tell you, I \nwould really question if Governor Romney, whom I have great respect for \nwith his business acumen--I do not think Bain Capital would ever invest \nin a business plan for America that spent less than 5 percent of its \nrevenue on its growth agenda and its ability to stay ahead of the rest \nof the world.\n\n  So I hope over this coming debate we can talk about growth agendas, \nwe can talk about revenues, we can talk about balance, we can talk \nabout looking at our plan from any historic perspective. But what I \nwant to turn to now--and I apologize to my colleagues who are on the \nfloor--is the question of sequester.\n  Back in August of 2011, when we got close to the budget ceiling \ndebacle--not exactly a high point for this institution or Congress, and \nwe could debate about who had the idea or where it came from \noriginally, but what was curious about that was we set up a process \nthat said: We are going to figure this out in a way where we will never \nget to sequester.\n  I use the analogy for sequester--some of us are old enough--my good \nfriend, the Senator from Maine, may recall the movie ``Blazing \nSaddles.'' In that movie, ``Blazing Saddles,'' the sheriff comes out \nand puts a gun to his head, and all the townspeople come up and say: Oh \nmy gosh, the sheriff may pull the trigger.\n  We in Congress set up that circumstance with the sequester, and \nunfortunately 2 weeks ago we allowed that trigger to be pulled. Because \nI believe, as somebody who cut spending as the Governor of Virginia--\nand I know my colleague, the new Senator from Virginia, cut spending as \nwell--we know how to make cuts. But there are smart cuts and smart ways \nto cut, and there are stupid ways to cut, and there could not be \ncreated a more stupid way to cut than sequester.\n  There are 975 separate line items in the Navy budget. Those 975 \nseparate line items in the Navy budget are not of equal value to the \ntaxpayer, nor are they of equal value to the defense of this Nation. \nBut within the framework of sequester, we do not have any ability to \npick and prioritize the way any reasonable business leader or any \nreasonable Governor would. We had to cut them all of an equal amount. \nThe remarkable thing that is happening--and, again, my friend, the \nSenator from Virginia, will talk to this more--is that there is example \nafter example, under the name of sequester, that supposedly we are \ncutting spending where we are actually going to cost the taxpayer more \nthan any perceived savings. I will just cite two examples before I turn \nto my friend from Virginia.\n  For those viewers, the American government actually does get certain \nthings right. We have even gotten a law that if we do any bulk \npurchases, we have to get at least a 10-percent discount. If we buy 10 \ntanks instead of 1 tank, we get a discount. If we buy more than one \nVirginia class submarine, we get them at $2 billion apiece. If we buy \nthem individually, they cost $2.5 billion apiece.\n  Under the name of sequester, if this is allowed to continue, we will \nhave times where we will have to violate those contracts and not only \npay a penalty cost but then not receive the government discount because \nof volume purchasing. It does not mean we are not going to still have \nto buy the same amount; it just means it is going to cost the taxpayer \nmore money.\n  In the case of research, the National Institutes of Health does some \nremarkable work, but anybody who follows medical research knows you \ncannot normally finish a research project in a single year. So it may \ntake 4 or 5 years to do a cancer research project. If we allow \nsequester to continue, you may have 4 years of a cancer research \nproject done, but because you cannot discriminate between projects, you \ncannot let that fifth year of the contract, so the first 4 years of \nthat research is flushed down the toilet.\n  My colleagues, there has to be a better way to deal with this. Our \nbudget, which replaces sequester with half revenues and half more \ntargeted spending cuts, I believe moves us in that right direction. We \nin Virginia, in many ways, are ground zero of the effects of sequester. \nMany States have not begun to feel it. They will at some point.\n  I would like to turn to my colleague, my good friend, the new Senator \nfrom Virginia, somebody who serves now on the Armed Services Committee \nand has\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nmade hard choices as Governor as well, who knows what it takes to have \na balanced approach to continue to grow the economy. He has continued \nthe kinds of accolades that Virginia has received. I would like to ask \nthe Senator from Virginia if he would be willing to explain in a little \nbit more detail some of the challenges we face at ground zero in \nVirginia around sequester and why the approach we have taken in our \nSenate budget is better than the status quo approach we are now having \nto deal with.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I would be happy to address that question \nfrom my senior Senator and good friend, Mr. Warner. As he indicated--\nand I think I can maybe say it a little bit more strongly than he could \nbecause he would be a little bit modest. I know of many people in this \nbody who have great experience in governance, great experience in the \nbusiness sector. I do not know of anyone who has worked harder on \nissues of fiscal responsibility and who has a greater track record in \nthe business world of understanding what true fiscal responsibility is \nthan my colleague Senator Warner, and I am glad to engage in this \ncolloquy with him.\n  I also want to thank our chairwoman, Senator Murray, for a job well \ndone in helping shepherd this budget through committee to the floor. \nThis debate, both in committee and here on the floor, that will take \nplace in the next few days will illuminate important choices we need to \nmake as a nation and will illuminate important differences between the \nSenate's approach and the House's approach.\n  I echo comments Senator Warner made. This Senate budget is a \ncompromise, like all are, and there will be more compromise that should \ntake place in any normal process. But the budget does a very good job \nin a number of ways. It tackles the task, the challenging task of \ndeficit reduction to get us to figures that would be very much the \nequivalent of what had been recommended in the Simpson-Bowles report, \nas Senator Warner indicated. It focuses upon economic growth, a growth \nagenda, which is the most important thing we need to be focused on in \nthis body, and it does it in a balanced way that incorporates real \nsavings and also appropriate reform of revenues.\n  It is impossible to fix a balance sheet by just focusing on one side \nof the balance sheet. Business leaders know this. Governors know this. \nEveryday Americans know this. I commend Chairwoman Murray and the other \nmembers of the committee, and I echo the comments made by my colleague, \nSenator Warner, about the budget having the critical components.\n  I feel very confident, if this budget were enacted as is with no \nchange to an apostrophe, comma, or a line item, this budget would be a \npositive result for the American economy. It would promote growth, and \nit would find us continuing on a path to responsible deficit reduction \nto reach the levels of debt, deficit, or GDP which are appropriate from \neconomic terms.\n  I would not say the same about the House budget. If it were enacted \nwithout a change, comma, or apostrophe, it would not be a positive \nthing for the American economy--it could be somewhat catastrophic or \ncataclysmic for the economy.\n  To get to the question, my senior Senator and friend has asked me \nabout the effects of sequester in Virginia. As some of you might know, \nI took the floor for my maiden speech on this topic last month--a \nlittle bit earlier than I would have wished to have spoken as a \nfreshman Senator. With the spectre of the sequester having such a \nsignificant effect on the Commonwealth of Virginia, I felt I couldn't \nbe silent on it. A Senator colleague from Hawaii is here, Senator \nHirono, who I know feels equally strongly about this issue.\n  I took a tour throughout Virginia in the middle of February, which \nwas designed as sequester was looming. We spoke to people who were \naffected, especially in the armed services area. I heard their stories \nabout the sequester and the anxieties and threats it posed. Beginning \nin early April, 90,000 DOD civilian employees will begin to be \nfurloughed in the Commonwealth of Virginia, hundreds of thousands \nnationally. This will have a very significant effect on the kitchen \ntable, family pocketbook discussions which are happening all over the \nCommonwealth. This will be a very significant change to the individuals \nand the lives of their communities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KAINE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would ask the Senator, I know he has seen and is very \nfamiliar with these installations and their families because of his \ntenure as Governor. You may also want to make the point: in an area \nsuch as Hampton Roads where you put these folks on furlough with \nliterally 88,000, 98,000 immediately affected, will the Senator speak \nabout the point of the ripple effect this has for literally thousands \nof others who provide the support services--restaurants, gas stations, \nauto repair, you name it--which rely on those folks having jobs as \nwell?\n  Mr. KAINE. Absolutely. I am pleased the Senator brought this up. When \nfolks are furloughed and they see their pay reduced, they will spend \nless at the drycleaner and less at the restaurant. They will delay the \npurchase of the automobile they planned for this year. They will be \ndoing all kinds of things to tighten their spending. This will affect \nshopkeepers and merchants in their area.\n  When I was Governor, early in my term Ford decided to close a plant \nin Norfolk with a couple of thousand workers. The ripple effect of that \nwas felt throughout the economy, a couple of thousand workers, was very \nsignificant. To take 90,000 civilian DOD employees in a State such as \nVirginia, heavily concentrated in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads \nand furlough them and reduce their salaries will be felt throughout the \neconomy. These civilian furloughs are one of the many effects of \nsequester.\n  Sometimes when people hear about furloughs of Department of Defense \ncivilian employees, they might think it is someone sitting in an \noffice. Who knows what they are doing? You need to think about who \nthese people are. I visited Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, one of the \npremier facilities in the United States which treats wounded warriors, \nthe people who have sacrificed so much for this Nation. When I was \ndialoguing with a wounded warrior and his wife at Fort Belvoir \nCommunity Hospital, they raised sequester. I thought they were raising \nsequester about something about their veterans' benefits. No. Instead, \nwhat they wanted to know is, My nurse is a DOD civilian and my physical \ntherapist is a DOD civilian. Are the people we are asking to care for \nthose who have borne the scars of battle--are they going to have \nreduced care because of this sequester? This is who these DOD civilian \nemployees are, doing wonderful work, such as the nurses at Fort Belvoir \nCommunity Hospital.\n  Outside of the DOD civilian space, let's move into the private sector \nworld. On this tour I went to the Newport News Shipyard. Senator Warner \nand I were there last Saturday for a wonderful occasion honoring former \nSenator John Warner. This is a shipyard we in Virginia are proud of and \nproud of nationally. It is a great story. We manufacture the largest \nand most sophisticated items manufactured on the planet Earth in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, nuclear aircraft carriers. They are \nmanufactured and refurbished in Newport News at this shipyard. It is a \nvery special technical expertise, the construction and refurbishing of \nthese aircraft carriers. They are heel-to-toe for months. Then one \nleaves and the next one comes in. If you get out of line or delay, \neverything becomes backed up. The result is your shipping fleet isn't \nready or as operational as it should be.\n  There was a pier, a drydock, filled in because the Truman was \nsupposed to be coming in for a new refurbishment. It was stopped and \nsitting across the water in Newport. They couldn't start work because \nof sequester and uncertainty about the CR.\n  Many other shipyards in the Hampton Roads area, private, small ship \nrepairs but without the financial muscle of a Huntington Ingalls of \nNewport News Shipyard, have issued warn notices to lay off employees \nbecause the Navy indicated in quarters three and four they would need \nto scale back on repairs. These were some of the effects they were \nseeing.\n  I went to a National Guard armory in Stanton, which was very \ninteresting. I\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nlearned the National Guard in Stanton is called the Stonewall Brigade. \nTheir first activity on behalf of the defense of the Nation occurred 20 \nyears before the French and Indian wars. The Stonewall Brigade in \nStanton began in 1740 defending the Nation, and they were talking to me \nabout sequester.\n  How does sequester affect the Guard in Virginia, the Stonewall \nBrigade? It affects their ability to train their people. A whole series \nof training exercises planned for the next months or years is now \njeopardized. They will not be able to train.\n  The commander of the brigade said, My people will do anything, but I \nwould rather have them take on the tasks and the challenge knowing they \nare 100 percent trained and ready, rather than 85 or 90 percent trained \nand ready. This is an important responsibility we have to those men and \nwomen who sign up to be guardsmen in Virginia. Once again, whether it \nwas our DOD civilians, ship repairers, wounded warriors, or guards men \nand women, you see these immediate effects sequester has in Virginia.\n  Of all the effects I have mentioned, I will say there was only one \nwhich made goosebumps come up on my arm. They were all of concern to \nme, but there was one which really made me stop and think. I went to \nvisit an ROTC unit at the University of Virginia, which combined \nstudents from Navy, Army, and Air Force ROTC programs at UVA, to sit \nwith me and speak about their career path. They spoke about their love \nfor their country, their patriotism and willingness to sacrifice and \nput themselves in harm's way for their country.\n\n  One of them basically said this: I am willing to sign up voluntarily \nfor a career path which will put me in harm's way--because I know it is \na dangerous world. But as I am making a decision about my career, I \nhadn't really factored in the notion, Is my civilian political \nleadership willing to support me? When I watch Congress \nindiscriminately cutting budgets and doing an across-the-board cut to \nthe military of the size sequester suggests, I need to ask myself--I \nwill put myself in harm's ways, face bullets, danger, and the \nlikelihood I could be a wounded warrior and a vet in a bed at Fort \nBelvoir Community Hospital once in my life. Do I want to face the risk \na Congress might impose these types of cuts which are so nonstrategic \nand thereby send a signal to me what we are doing isn't that valuable?\n  This was chilling to me. This is the message we send, whether it be \nthe ship welders who could be ship repairers or go somewhere else or \nbright and talented college students who could be military officers or \ndo something else. When we send a signal from this place, people pay \nattention. If the signal we send is we have a wavering commitment and \nare willing to do nonstrategic across-the-board cuts, it is not only \naffecting today but it could potentially have an effect down the road.\n  There is an answer to this, a solution. What I heard repeatedly on \nthe trail from Virginians of all political parties is fix this, make a \ndeal, find a compromise, listen to the other side. No one said to me \nfix this; fix my problem by taking more money away from someone else. I \ndidn't have the warriors say: Fix our defense cuts by cutting Head \nStart or by cutting other priorities more.\n  They said go find the kind of balanced approach which would involve \ncuts and savings, and we all know how to do them. This would also \ninvolve the kinds of revenues we need to find a balance to this \nproblem.\n  The other good thing is we can fix this. In fact, we tried to fix it. \nThere was a bill on the floor here which replaced the first year of \nthese sequester cuts with a balanced mixture of revenues and \nexpenditures. The bill was on the floor for vote, and it received \nenough to pass. It received more than 50 votes and more than a majority \nof this body. This is a way of saying we do not want there to be these \nnonstrategic sequester cuts. Because of the decision to filibuster, to \nrequire it to reach not a majority but 60 votes, the will of the \nmajority in this body to turn off sequester for the first year and find \na balanced replacement package was thwarted. We have another \nopportunity in this budget.\n  I will say one more thing, and then I will throw it back to the \nSenator with a question. We have before us a sequester alternative in \nthe fiscal year 2014 budget we are debating. The budget includes a path \nof deficit reduction which is balanced and is both expense cuts and \nrevenues. It also does something very particular with respect to \nsequester. It replaces blunt across-the-board nonstrategic cuts with \ntargeted and strategic cuts of a lesser magnitude, because we are \nadding in revenues as well. It also times the cuts so they are not \nstraight across-the-board equal for 10 years but a little more focused \non the back end of the 10-year period to help the economy. Signs \nindicate the stock market, housing market, auto sales, and consumer \nconfidence is picking up.\n  What this budget does with the sequester is it finds savings but \nreduces the deficit of savings. It makes them targeted and strategic, \nrather than blunt and across the board. It times them in a way which is \nmore conducive to economic growth. This, as one of the many features of \nthis budget, is the better approach to sequester than the one we are \ncurrently living under.\n  I wish to ask the Senator a question. After attending the Budget \nCommittee hearings with me and hearing the debate on the floor thus far \nabout the budget, I have to say I have been a little surprised to hear \nsome of my colleagues. They argue: No, we shouldn't replace sequester. \nThe sequester should go forward. The sequester is a good thing.\n  I heard this argued in committee. There was opposition to the notion \nof doing something better than sequester. It was sort of expressed as \nwe said we were going to do the sequester cuts and we need to do them. \nI have heard it said on the floor, even in the course of the debate \nsince yesterday. Under any circumstances, as somebody who has created \nand run businesses, who ran a State government and received fiscal \naccolades for doing it the right way, if we have a reasonable fix, is \nthere any justification for continuing with blunt across-the-board \nsequester cuts which do not take into account the priority of any of \nthe line items and do not take into account the performance data about \nwhether any of those line items are affected? I would like to hear the \nSenator address that question.\n  I know our colleague from Hawaii is also anxious to tell us about \nsequester effects in her State.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent to engage in colloquy with my friend, the \nSenator from Virginia, the Senator from Hawaii, and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. To briefly respond--I don't want to keep returning to the \n``Blazing Saddles'' analogy, other than the fact these cuts were set up \nto be the stupidest way possible. No rational group of folks would \nallow them to come to pass.\n  The only other point I wish to make is with regard to the Senator's \npoint about the ROTC individuals. I think at times this may not have \nbeen part of debate--although there may have been a number of \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who have argued strongly \nagainst sequester and pointed this out as well. We are not just talking \nabout the immediate short-term effect on that furloughed employee or \nthe ship which may not get repaired. As these cuts were set up to be so \nridiculously put forward, the effects of these cuts will actually, in \nmany cases, cost us more money than the savings.\n  If that ROTC member who has taken 3 years of ROTC decides to quit and \nnot become an officer, the money we have invested in his or her \ntraining up to that point is flushed down the toilet.\n  If we do not make the ship repairs that are part of our industrial \nbase and if the workers at those ship repair businesses in Hampton \nRoads and in Hawaii and in New Hampshire and in California and in \nAlabama and in Mississippi leave those careers and those welders go \nelsewhere, the cost of replacing that workforce and retraining them \nbecause we have said, oops, we made a mistake and we come back and fix \nit 2 years from now, will end up costing the taxpayer more than the \ndollars we have saved.\n  If we continue to defer the maintenance and the training of our Armed \nForces so we don't have divisions ready to go into action, the cost to \nget them\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nback up to military readiness will be exponentially higher the longer \nwe wait than doing these cuts in a smarter, more tailored and more \nphased-in fashion.\n  I think the military and everybody I have seen realizes they are \ngoing to have to make the kind of cuts to make sure that everything--\ndomestic discretionary, defense, entitlement reform, and revenues--all \nhave to be part of the mix.\n  Our military does a remarkable job for us, and we owe them not only \nthe kind of platitudes we sometimes say on this floor, but we owe them \nan ability to manage a budget that is reasonable, that is thoughtful, \nthat does not have this kind of arbitrary, across-the-board-regardless-\nof-performance cut. We owe that young man or woman who is in the ROTC \nthe commitment that our Nation will stand by their obligations to their \ntraining and support of them so they can continue to serve and protect \nour Nation.\n  I now want to ask our friend, another new Senator, the Senator from \nHawaii, for her comments. Hawaii is a State that has enormous military \nassets as well as other assets on the frontline of our Nation's shift \nin focus on Asia. She may want to add as well any particular stories \nabout her views on sequester and how our budget takes a more reasoned \nand balanced approach.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I thank the Senator and good morning, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Good morning.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I wish to thank Senator Warner for leading this colloquy, \nand I am glad to join him and my friend Senator Kaine in talking about \nthe effects of sequester and how we need to come up with an alternative \nto the sequester.\n  Senator Warner used the word ``stupid'' to describe sequester, and I \nthink that is apt, because what family, in trying to get a handle on \ntheir budget, would just make an across-the-board cut to everything in \ntheir family's budget. The Senator raised the analogy that no business \nwould do an across-the-board cut, but let's talk about families in our \ncountry. No family would cut across the board their food budget, their \nrent budget. That would not happen. So why are we doing this?\n  As one of the people who testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee said, sequester was the result of political dysfunction. That \nis very true because it was never supposed to happen. As Senator Kaine \nsaid, I am very surprised to listen to our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle talk about sequester--something that was never supposed to \nhappen, and both Republicans and Democrats had agreed this was not \ngoing to happen--now take the position that we are where we are and we \nneed to live by the boundaries of sequester.\n  What sequester does is it interjects huge uncertainty into our \neconomy, huge uncertainty, at a time when we are still digging out from \nthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Senator Warner \nand Senator Kaine have both acknowledged that Virginia is ground zero \non the bad effects of sequester. If Virginia is ground zero, I would \nsay Hawaii is ground 0.1. We have a huge military presence in Hawaii. \nThey are a big part of our economy. In fact, there are some 101,000 \npeople in Hawaii who are directly employed with the military. That is \n16 percent of our workforce. Some 20,000 of them have gotten notices of \nfurloughs, looking toward a reduction in their pay of 20 percent. Talk \nabout the ripple effect of that kind of reduction in their ability to \nbuy products, we can see what the negative ripple effect would be.\n  In Hawaii, as I said, the military is such a big part of our economy. \nStates such as Hawaii, such as Virginia are among the first States to \nexperience the negative effects of sequester--immediate. Thousands of \nletters have been going out to say: Expect to be furloughed, with \n11,000 people possibly losing their jobs directly. These are immediate \nimpacts.\n  The top reason we need to replace the sequester with something \nbalanced, reasonable, fair, and not stupid is that sequester cuts jobs. \nThere will be huge job losses, and economists of all stripes have said \ndon't keep going down this path with these kinds of cuts that will \nseverely hamper economic growth and cost jobs in this country. These \nare senseless cuts.\n  The State of Hawaii is already reeling from the potential impacts of \nsequester which will begin in a couple weeks. We have already gotten \nmany of these notices. But the sequester also represents huge cuts to \neducation, housing assistance, and other programs that are on the \nchopping block. We must listen to our constituents. So many of them, I \nknow, have contacted all of us. There was one letter I received from an \nelderly woman and her husband. She lives on Social Security and on HUD \nhousing grants--HUD vouchers--and she said: Our Social Security checks \nare so small.\n  Yes, while sequester doesn't touch Social Security, it certainly has \na potential impact of cutting their housing vouchers.\n  She said: I don't know where we would go if we lost our HUD housing \nvoucher. We would be homeless. I am so distressed, she wrote to me.\n  Another letter I received was from an Army reservist who was all set \nto go for his training. Now multiply this situation thousands and \nthousands of times across our country. He said due to sequester he will \nno longer be traveling to the TDY location for his training. Yet he \nplanned his calendar based on his going. The letter he got was that his \norders had been canceled for training due to sequester and his billet \nis going unfulfilled to cut costs.\n\n  Failing to provide training to this young man and the thousands and \nthousands of other men and women who are in our Reserves degrades our \nNation's readiness.\n  I received letters from people who work at the Pearl Harbor shipyard, \nwhich is the largest industrial employer in the State of Hawaii, with \nsome 5,000 direct employees, both civilian and military, who got their \nfurlough notices. These are highly skilled people with good-paying \njobs. When they think about a 20-percent reduction in their salaries, \nbelieve me, they are thinking about how to revise their family budgets, \nand that revision is not going to involve across-the-board ``stupid'' \ncuts.\n  These are just some of the examples of how sequester will hurt a \nState such as Hawaii. What should we do to replace sequester? My \ncolleagues have talked about it. The American people understand this \nmeat-ax approach to balancing our budget is the wrong way to go because \nit destroys jobs and it affects many people who are working right now. \nSo the budget put forth by Chairman Murray will reverse this path down \nno man's land, basically. What the Murray budget says is let's provide \na balanced approach. Let's ask a little more from the most fortunate \nand wealthy, including the corporations, while including more smart, \ntargeted cuts to other areas of our budget.\n  Let's remember once again that we have already implemented and put in \nplace $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction. So by following the balanced \napproach that is represented in the Murray budget, we will have reduced \nthe deficit by some $4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  As I said, we need to do this in a responsible, balanced way, and it \nbears repeating--because we are still hearing from our friends on the \nother side that sequester is what we have; let's just live with it--\nthat there is an alternative, friends. The alternative is a fair, \nbalanced, smart way to deal with our budget deficit, to create jobs, \nand to help our families, because our budgets do reflect our values, \nand our values are about supporting our families, creating jobs, moving \nour country forward, and enabling us to continue to dig out from the \nworst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  I thank Senator Warner very much for this opportunity to come \nforward, and I will have a few more things to say perhaps later on \nabout the budget and how Senator Murray's budget reflects the kind of \nvalues we should be putting forth in our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to thank the Senator from Hawaii for the real \nstories of how these sequester cuts are affecting folks in her State of \nHawaii, and, obviously, my friend, the Senator from Virginia, has \nexpressed those challenges as well.\n  Let me be clear. It is not that our budget proposal doesn't make \nsignificant cuts in defense. We still add roughly $250 billion of cuts \nin defense over a 10-year period, but we do it in a smarter, targeted, \nphased-in way.\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n  The last point I wish to make, before I ask my friend, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, to close out, is I want to agree with so many of my \nRepublican colleagues who have come and pointed out this is a \nresponsibility we owe to our children and our grandchildren. We, \ncandidly, owe it to ourselves. This $16.5 trillion in debt goes up $3 \nbillion a day, and it is unsustainable. As Erskine Bowles once said: It \nis the most predictable crisis in our lifetimes if we don't grapple \nwith it. And so we need a growth agenda.\n  Two comments I would simply make in closing: If we look back at \nrecent American history for the period of the highest economic growth, \nthe period that we added the most jobs, the area where America \ncontinued to lead in innovation, it was during the 1990s. We had a Tax \nCode at that point that generated sufficient revenue to meet our needs \nwithout dramatic expansion of government. I think, in retrospect, most \nof us would acknowledge we probably made a mistake when we took $4.5 \ntrillion out of the revenue stream in some of those cuts that were made \nearlier.\n  We have a spending issue, but we also have a revenue issue. What this \nDemocratic plan puts forward doesn't say we have to put all those \nrevenues back. It doesn't say we have to put half those revenues back. \nWhat the Democratic plan says, to get us back on this path to balance, \nto get us back on this path to growth, we have to, roughly, return \nabout one-third of that $4.5 trillion. With what we did on New Year's \nEve and what this budget does, it replaces $1.575 trillion into the \nrevenue stream. It doesn't bring us back to the 1990s rate, but I would \nlove the chance to debate my colleagues on how that is not a reasonable \nassumption.\n  If we have a structural deficit problem on the spending side, we also \nhave a structural deficit problem on the revenue side, and I believe \nthis approach is reasonable and both fiscally prudent and responsible.\n  I would simply close as well with saying that we can't tax and cut \nour way out of this problem. We have to have a growth agenda. Any good \ncompany--any good country--has a business plan. Any business plan for \nany good company--any good country--that is going to compete in the \n21st century has to do at least three things: They have to invest in \ntheir workforce, invest in their infrastructure, and they have to stay \nahead of their competition, which means research and development.\n  I tell my colleagues, there is no way a plan that says America will \ninvest less than 5 percent of its public revenues in its education, \ninfrastructure, and R will keep America the leading economic power in \nthe 21st century. If we want to honor our commitment to our children, \nwe have to leave them not only a nation that is not riddled with debt \nand deficit but also a nation that continues to be the economic leader \nin the world. I believe our plan makes and protects those investments \nin those key components of growth.\n  I hope, over the coming hours, we will go through this debate--I know \nwe will have a spirited period of a lot of amendments--that this budget \nwill pass, and it will then find agreement with our colleagues in the \nHouse.\n  I want to again commend both the chair and the ranking member in that \nat the end of the day, we have to find common agreement to get this \ndone. This issue that hovers over all of our other debates has in many \nways become a metaphor of whether our institutions can function in the \n21st century. So just as the chair and the ranking member found \nagreement through a markup process where both sides were heard and \namendments were offered and debated in a fair and open process, I want \nto thank both the chair and the ranking member for their commitment. \nThey have different ideas about how we get there, but at the end of the \nday we do have to get there in common agreement.\n  Mr. President, I want to give the Senator from Virginia the last word \non this issue. So I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Warner.\n  I do want to pick up on one of the last points he made, which is the \nbalanced way of getting to where we all want to go. We want to have a \ngrowing economy with a lowering unemployment rate. We want to deal with \nour deficit. These are challenging, complex goals that are not easy, \nbut we can get there. Even the action of this body last night in \npassing the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill and fix shows we can \ncooperate together and with the House get there. It is my hope that \nwill inspire us going forward.\n  The question is this: All agree that what has been done thus far in \nthe area of deficit reduction equates to about $2.4 trillion of deficit \nreduction that has been done by the last Congress, including the deal \non the Bush tax cuts that were made at yearend, $2.4 trillion of \ndeficit reduction over the next 10 years. And all in looking at that \ndeficit reduction also agree that $1.85 trillion of the deficit \nreduction was cutting expenses and a little bit more than $600 billion \nof it was revenues that were achieved through the yearend Bush tax cuts \ndeal. So overwhelmingly what has been done thus far has been in \nspending cuts rather than new revenues. It is very important for us to \nknow that. It is very important for folks to realize that Democrats are \nwilling to make hard calls about spending, and we have done it already.\n  But the question before this body and the question before the House \nnow is, going forward, what do we do to achieve additional deficit \nreduction that is consistent with having a growing economy? The \napproaches of the Senate and the House on this could not be more \ndifferent.\n  The House approach basically says all additional deficit reduction \nshould be achieved by cutting spending, by looking at one side of the \nbalance sheet. I do not know of a business, I do not know of a family, \nI do not know of other units of government that, as they are trying to \nwrestle with this question, confine themselves only looking at one side \nof the balance sheet. But that is what the House budget does.\n  I was thinking about this approach and this question about deficits \nnot long ago, and it struck me that when I look at myself in a mirror, \nI always wish I was thinner, but I have never once looked in a mirror \nand wished I was weaker. An all-cuts approach is like looking in a \nmirror and wishing you were weaker because an all-cuts approach makes \nyou weaker. It makes you weaker in defense, it makes you weaker in \neducation, it makes you weaker in infrastructure.\n  By laying people off in jobs, it makes you weaker because your \nunemployment rate is higher. An all-cuts approach is like looking in \nthe mirror and wishing you were weaker.\n  I don't want to be weaker. I don't want this Nation to be weaker. We \nhave to be stronger. Can we make cuts? Sure, we can. We have, and we \nwill make more. But we ought to be focused on being stronger, about \ngrowing the economy and growing jobs.\n  That is why the approach the Senate takes is the right approach; \nbecause by utilizing revenues appropriately, reforming tax expenditures \nto reduce them on the equivalent of about 7 or 8 percent a year, these \nmyriad of tax expenditures in the Tax Code, we are able to find \ninvestments in infrastructure and soften the indiscriminate cuts that \nare leading to the job losses that my friend from Hawaii described.\n  The Senate budget, in achieving additional deficit reduction, is a \nbalanced approach that will make us stronger, not weaker. That is why \nit is my great hope that we will pass this in a significant way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senators from Virginia and \nHawaii for excellent statements and laying out the framework of why it \nis so important that we have a progrowth bill that is balanced, that \ndeals with both spending cuts and revenue, and I really appreciate \ntheir time both in committee and on the Senate floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 3:45 p.m. today there be up to 60 \nminutes of debate, equally divided between Senators Klobuchar and \nCoats, or their designees, for a report on the economic goals and \npolicy under section 305(b) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have enjoyed listening to our \ncolleagues discuss the issues, particularly\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nthe sequester. I know Senator Kaine and I talked about this previously. \nI would just like to make a few points that are so important for every \nMember of this body to understand.\n  Senator Kaine just said additional deficit reduction is needed. He is \nexactly correct. But this budget has no additional deficit reduction.\n  They claim they have a balanced approach. They have used that word \nnow 40-some-odd times, ``balance.'' This budget never balances. It does \nnot balance in 10 years, 15 years, and has no vision that would even \nlead to balance. It remains unsustainable in terms of adding to the \ndebt every single year, resulting in a 1-year interest payment in 2023 \nof $800 billion--well more than the defense budget; surging interest \nfrom around $250 billion now to $800 billion a year--forever, I \nsuppose. And it would go up with the debt rising and with interest \nrates that could rise even more.\n  So we don't have additional deficit reduction in the budget that we \nare being asked to vote on. Senator Kaine said can we make cuts? Yes. \nWell, I would say we can make more cuts, but we don't. Yes, there is \nsome reduction in some programs, but, on net, no deficit reduction in \nthe budget. So it doesn't change the debt course. You can't deny that.\n  What we are saying is, go back to the committee. Write the budget \nlike you want. If you think there ought to be more taxes than I think, \nthat is OK. Bring it up. Let's vote on it. But let's have this budget \ndo what you say, be balanced. They have used this word ``balance''--\nbalance, balance, balance--40 more times. We have been keeping up with \nit. It is so ridiculous. It is utterly unbalanced. It never balances.\n  By their own admission, the deficits in 1 year are never lower than \n$400 billion. So it never balances.\n  A balanced approach. A balanced plan. Why? Are they guilty of \nconfusing the issue? Do they think the American people will hear their \nmessage and think, oh, they have a balanced budget? I suspect that is \nwhat they think. Twice I have observed my Democratic colleagues at the \ncommittee slip and say they have a balanced budget. They have this in \ntheir heads so much, but a balanced plan is what they are really \nsaying.\n  So what is a balanced plan? The way it has been promoted: $1 trillion \nin tax increases, $1 trillion in spending cuts, a net $2 trillion in \ndeficit reduction. Not so. It is not so. The tax increases are offset \nby spending increases.\n  That is just the way it is. You can spin it any way you want to, but \nI want to make that point.\n  One thing I will share about the sequester--and I am so pleased that \nSenator Rubio is here, and I look forward to yielding to him. I truly \nthink this is an unwise mechanism to reduce spending. It should not \nhappen. It should be fixed.\n  I totally agree with my colleagues that this is unfairly and \ndisproportionately falling on the military. I know Senator Rubio has \nmilitary bases in Florida. I have them in Alabama and they have them in \nVirginia, we almost all do. These are patriotic Americans, and these \nfurloughs are in effect 1 day a week, a 20-percent pay cut out of the \nblue. It is not necessary, and there are other things that have \nhappened.\n  So how did it happen? Well, it was proposed by the White House, who \nsaid: OK, if this special committee doesn't reach agreement on the \ndetails of spending cuts, then we will have a sequester across the \nboard. So it originated from the White House. The political theater we \nhave down here is not correct, and we need to be honest about this.\n  The Republicans agreed to it. It was part of the Budget Control Act. \nThat is the legislation. And who signed the legislation in blue ink \nright on the back? The President of the United States, Barack Obama.\n  So he signed it, it is his document, and we agreed to raise the debt \nceiling $2.1 trillion, and we agreed to reduce spending over 10 years \nby $2.1 trillion.\n  Before the ink was dry, the President was proposing to eliminate the \ncuts he agreed to. He has been fighting to eliminate those cuts from \nthe beginning, and they are not really cuts. If they were properly \napplied, it would reduce the growth of spending and not cut spending at \nall.\n  So the committee that was supposed to find other cuts failed. The \nsequester went into effect. And it is an antimilitary provision. It was \ndesigned by Jack Lew, a very liberal member of the President's Cabinet, \nwho was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget at the \ntime.\n  The President, in my opinion, seemed to be quite happy to see these \ncuts fall on the Defense Department. He seemed to be happy to have this \nhappen.\n  Why do I say that? Because he has done nothing to fix it except \ndemand something that he has no right to demand, and that is to violate \nthis agreement to reduce spending and instead raise taxes and spend \nmore. That is not going to happen. Congress is not going to vote to \nviolate the agreement they made with the American people less than 2 \nyears ago. If we give in on that, we might as well quit.\n  Our colleagues say they want to have a balanced approach to this \nbudget, and they are going to raise taxes. Most people who hear that \nthink the taxes would be used to reduce the deficit, but they are not. \nThe taxes are going to be used to fund more spending over the agreement \nwe have had in place now for about 20 months under the Budget Control \nAct. They want to increase spending above these levels, and they want \nto use all the new tax increases they are now proposing to fund it.\n  It does not change the debt course of America, which Mr. Elmendorf, \nthe CBO Director, told us in committee is an unsustainable path that we \nare on even after the Budget Control Act was passed in August 2011. So \nwe need to work on it.\n  I am prepared to offer solutions. The House of Representatives has \ntwice passed legislation that would alter the Budget Control Act so \nthat the cuts don't fall so hard on defense. In fact, they eliminated \nthe additional defense cuts, the second phase of defense cuts, and \nfound cuts elsewhere in the budget and smoothed it out fairly. That is \nwhat should happen, and that is where we need to be.\n  So I would encourage all our citizens, all our Members of Congress, \nall our military leaders by saying if you want to fix the sequester \nthen address your request to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Address your \nrequest to the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military, who has an \nabsolute duty--a responsibility--to ensure that these reductions are \ndone in a fair way.\n  We have voted and fought for flexibility on this side of the aisle, \nand we believe in finding, and will vote for, other reductions in \nspending to prevent this happening the way it is set to occur under \ncurrent law.\n  It seems to me they wanted it to happen this way, so they could come \nto the floor and make a point somehow that we are dramatically and \ndisastrously hammering the budget, when it is not necessary for it to \nbe done this way. That is the way I see it, and I believe we can reach \nagreement on this. I think somehow we will because it is not right the \nway the military--representing one-sixth of all Federal spending--is \ntaking half of the cuts. That is the way it falls right now. It is not \nright and it is too damaging.\n  It is great to see Senator Rubio. I believe he is next up. I yield to \nhim and thank him for his contribution to our discussion.\n  Madam President, I ask that time be counted against the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I thank Senator Sessions for enlightening \nus on this budget as he has been doing all day on the Senate floor.\n  I want to give some perspective about what we are debating. I think \nsometimes those of us who work in this building come to believe that \nWashington, DC, and government is the center of the universe or even \nthe center of peoples' lives, and it is not. All this stuff we are \ntalking about on the Senate floor, not just this day but every day, the \nreason it is relevant is how it impacts the lives of real people all \nover this country. What impact does this have on peoples' lives?\n  Ultimately, I know it is cliche-ish to say this, but it happens to be \nvery true that we are sent here to work for people. We are sent here to \nwork for the people who elected us from the States we come from. So all \nthis stuff we are discussing is relevant to the extent that it impacts \nthe lives of real people in our country and in some respects around the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\n  When you talk about cutting spending, what matters is the spending \nyou are cutting and how it is impacting real people, for better or \nworse. When you talk about raising taxes, those taxes have to be paid \nby somebody. They are not being paid by some anonymous thing. They are \nbeing paid by a person or a business, which is a collection of people. \nThe point is these taxes are being paid.\n  Talk about the debt. The debt is not simply just a moral financial \nobligation. The debt also has to be paid. Someone is going to pay that \ndebt one day. Every penny this government borrows someone is going to \nhave to pay back one day. They are going to have to pay it back through \nhigher taxes. If the debt is too high they are also going to have to \npay it back through less opportunities. That is why this matters and \nwhy it is relevant. It is relevant because we have to view it through \nthe lens of peoples' real lives, the lives of real people in the real \nworld.\n  What do people want out of their lives? It is not that complicated. \nIt is what all of us want. They want a job that pays them enough money \nso they can have a good standard of living, so they can afford to maybe \nbuy a house and have enough time to spend with their families and have \nleisure activities, maybe take a vacation every year or so. People want \nthat. People want to be able to pursue their dreams. Maybe you have a \ngreat idea about a new business you want to start and you want to live \nin a country where if that is what you want to do with your life, it is \nactually possible; you can actually do something that you love for a \nliving and they pay you for it.\n  What everybody wants, no matter where you are in the economic strata, \neveryone wants to make sure their kids are better off than themselves. \nThat is not unique to Americans. People all over the world want their \nkids to be better off than they were.\n  That is what this is about. It is about what role can we play making \nall these things more possible in this country. The fact that this has \nbeen more possible here than anywhere else is what has made us special. \nSo in order to understand what we can do to make that possible we have \nto understand what makes that happen. How does prosperity happen? How \ndoes the kind of prosperity we Americans want for ourselves and our \nfamilies, for our children, how is that possible? That is also not that \ncomplicated. It is largely a function of the private economy, and it is \na cycle that is very well understood.\n  Someone has a good idea for a business, a new business, or growing \ntheir existing business. They somehow get access to money, whether it \nis their own money or money they borrowed or someone invests through \nthem, and they open this business. There is no guarantee that business \nis going to work out, but they are willing to risk it. And the idea \nworks. All of a sudden this business they started all by themselves out \nof the spare bedroom of their home now has five employees--and five \nemployees is not just a number, that is five families who are taking \nhome a paycheck. Those are five providers, mothers or fathers, who are \nbringing home opportunities to their children.\n  This is how prosperity is created. This is how every one of us has \never gotten a job or how our parents got their jobs. It is because he \nor someone else risked it and created a business opportunity that \nprovided them a job. This is how prosperity is created.\n  When you view prosperity this way you come to understand that what we \nneed to do here is to make it easier for that to happen and not harder. \nGovernment does have an important role to play in our society. It does.\n  For example, we believe in a safety net, not as a way of life but to \nhelp those who cannot help themselves. We are a society that is too \nprosperous and, quite frankly, as well as that, we are too humane and \ntoo compassionate to not take care of those who cannot help themselves. \nWe always have and we always will. We also need to have a safety net to \nhelp those who have failed to get back on their feet and try again. But \nthe safety net was never designed to be a way of life.\n  By the same token we need to have security. Government plays an \nimportant role in our security--our national security for sure, but \nalso in combating crime and enforcing contracts and ensuring that the \nwater we drink is clean, the air we breathe is safe. These are \nimportant roles for government to play. But the majority of the things \nthat are going to impact prosperity creation in this country do not \ncome from government. They come from the private sector, and the job of \nour government is to make it easier for that cycle of prosperity I \ndescribed to happen.\n  The job of our government is to create an environment where people \nare encouraged to and it is easier for them to risk the money they have \naccess to in order to start a new business or grow an existing business \nso they can hire more people and create more jobs for others. There are \na lot of things government can do to help create that environment, but \nthere are a few that are being discussed. I want to point to three.\n  The first is predictability. What do I mean by that? What I mean is \nwhen someone decides they are going to open a business, one of the \nthings that encourages them to hire people is they know what tomorrow \nis going to look like. They know what the taxes are going to be, they \nknow what the law is going to be, what the economy is going to look \nlike, so they feel encouraged because they can plan and know \nwhat tomorrow is going to look like.\n\n  Imagine for a moment you are a businessman or businesswoman and you \nare deciding whether to hire five people next year. One of the first \nthings you want to know is, Am I going to have customers to pay their \nsalaries? How much am I going to owe on taxes and insurance? You want \npredictability and that is something that has not happened from \nWashington. There has not been a budget over the last 4 years out of \nthis Chamber, and that creates unpredictability.\n  I am pleased there is a budget to debate; it is an important debate. \nEven though we do not agree on everything, I congratulate those who \nhave prepared this budget on bringing it up for a vote on the Senate \nfloor so we can have this debate, a vibrant debate. But part of the \nproblem we have is this budget that is offered doesn't really address \nthe debt. Why does the debt matter?\n  The debt matters. It matters as a moral obligation for sure. It is \nwrong to hit future Americans and our young people with this kind of \ndebt, but it is having an impact right now. The debt is not something \nthat is hurting us 20 years down the road or 10 years down the road \nalone, it is hurting us today. The problem is when people look at this \neconomy and they look at this debt and they say there is no plan in \nplace to fix it, there is no serious plan in place to deal with it, \nthey are worried about risking their money and creating jobs in \nAmerica.\n  They believe unless this debt is solved, we are going to have a \nfinancial crisis in this country. They believe unless this debt is \nsolved, we are going to have dramatic increases in taxes, which is not \ngoing to make America a good place to do business. So there are jobs \nthat are not being created right now because of the fear over the debt \nand no plan to fix it. This budget does not fix it. This budget does \nnot fix it.\n  The first thing we need from government is to create an environment \nwhere private business can grow and create opportunity, which is \npredictability. This budget does not do that. The second thing is \naffordability. We all understand we have to pay taxes. How are you \ngoing to pay firefighters and police officers? How do we pay the men \nand women who defend our freedoms around the world? How are the lights \non in this building? Of course we have to pay taxes. This is not about \npaying taxes or not paying taxes. This is about the fact that there is \nonly so much money in the world. Every penny the government takes in in \ntaxes is money that is not available to invest in a private business.\n  Every time you take a tax, what you are doing is taking money out of \nthe economy. You have to do that at some point because you need a \ngovernment, but if you do too much of it then there is not enough money \nfor people to spend at your business. If someone is paying more in \ntaxes, that means they have less money to spend where you work, which \nmeans you are going to make less money in tips or in salary or it may \neven cost you your job if the taxes are too high.\n  I tell you, we focus on Federal taxes here, but these are not the \nonly taxes\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\npeople pay. Depending on where you live you are paying local and State \nand now Federal taxes. You add this up and there are people in this \ncountry paying close to half the money they make in taxes. How is that \ngood for growing your economy?\n  So that is a problem.\n  This budget talks about raising taxes. It doesn't say how. That is \none of the things I wanted to address because I am telling you right \nnow, you can raise taxes 100 percent on the richest people in America, \nand you will not solve this debt problem. Some statistics say if you \nraise taxes 100 percent on millionaires it will pay for about 60 days' \nworth of government. What are you going to do for the other 305 or 304 \ndays of the year? That is a problem. What happens when you run out of \nrich people to raise taxes on--or so-called rich people? You have to \nraise taxes on people who are not rich, and you have to raise taxes on \nthe middle class.\n  That is why I am going to offer two amendments to this budget that I \nhope will pass. The first amendment says we are not going to get rid of \nthe mortgage interest deduction to pay for new spending and new \nprograms in government. If you want to talk about the mortgage interest \ndeduction in the context of tax reform--I am not sure that is the best \nidea or bad idea. Let's have that debate. But if you want to talk about \nit in the context of we are going to take that money and use it in the \ncontext of lets grow government, we are going to have a problem because \nthere are middle-class people in this country who already have it hard \nenough as it is. They are working twice as hard, and they are making \nhalf as much. They have paid their mortgage on time every month even \nthough they are upside-down, but because they paid on time, now their \nbank will not finance them and they are stuck and they are upset and \nthey have a right to be.\n  Now on top of that you are going to get rid of that mortgage interest \ndeduction? I am not claiming that is what is being offered. I am just \nsaying if no one is going to offer that, let's prevent that now. I am \noffering an amendment that is going to prevent that.\n  Here is another thing. We should not raise taxes on the middle class \nat all to pay for new government, and I will offer an amendment that \nprohibits that as well. So the second thing we need is affordability. \nNo one is saying we don't need to fund government. Of course we do.\n  By the way, the best way to fund government is to grow your economy. \nIf we could grow this economy at 4 percent a year for this decade, that \nwould generate about $3, $3.5 trillion in new revenue. There is no tax \nincrease in the world that can do that, at least no realistic one.\n  My last point on this is one of the things government can do is help \npeople to help themselves. In the modern era there is nothing more \nimportant in that regard than education. The world has changed. When my \nparents came here in 1956 from Cuba, they did not have a lot of skills. \nMy dad didn't really go to school. My mom didn't either. And they were \nable to achieve a middle-class lifestyle in this country as a bartender \nand a maid. That is almost impossible to do today. That is no one's \nfault; that is just the way the world has changed.\n  Today you need a certain level of skill because the information \ntechnology age has changed everything. The good news is the jobs that \nare being created, these new middle-class jobs have a lot more \nopportunity for better pay. The bad news is we have a lot of people who \ndo not have the skills for those jobs.\n  We have a skills gap in America that needs to be closed, but the one \nI want to focus on is school choice. I think it is wrong that the only \nparents in America who cannot send their kids to the school they want \nare poor parents. I think that is fundamentally wrong. Middle-class \nparents can sacrifice and scrape and some of them--not all of them but \nsome of them--can afford to send their kids to the school of their \nchoice. Rich people can send their kids to any school they want, but \npoor parents in America are stuck.\n  Envision this for a moment. Envision this for a moment. You are a \npoor single mom or single dad. You are living already in a dangerous \nneighborhood in substandard housing, and on top of that you are forced \nby the government to send your children to a school that is failing and \nevery year the politicians tell you they are going to improve these \nschools. They say: Give us a chance to pour more money in these \nschools. We are going to turn them around.\n  I hope they do. But in the meantime, while they are carrying out this \nexperiment your kids are turning 5 and 6 or 7 or 8, and the clock is \nrunning and you can never have those years back. It is wrong. It is \nwrong that parents who do not have access to funds cannot send their \nkids to the school of their choice.\n  One of the things I want to try to do at the Federal level is \nreplicate what we have done in Florida; that is, create an incentive \nfor people to donate their money to private not-for-profit scholarship \norganizations that give scholarships to low-income families so they can \nsend their kids to their parents' choice, not just to the school of the \ngovernment's choice. That is important in terms of helping people \nacquire the skills they need in this new century because if we do not \nclose that skills gap, we are going to have a huge opportunity gap in \nAmerica, one that is already developing.\n  I hope we do not underestimate what is happening out there. We have \nworking class people in America who are starting to wonder if this is \nstill the place where if you work hard you can go as far as your talent \nwill take you. They are starting to wonder if this is still the place \nwhere if you work hard, you can leave your children better off than \nyourselves. You have middle-class families who are starting to wonder \nwho is fighting for them. The people who have made it--big companies, \nbig corporations--have lobbyists all over this building standing up for \nthem. They don't want to take anything away from the people who have \nmade it. They see other people always arguing on behalf of government \nprograms to help people who are struggling. Many of those programs are \nimportant. They don't want to take that away from them either. But who \nis fighting for them? Who is fighting for the people who have done it \nthe right way, who did not take out mortgages they couldn't afford, who \nwill take a job even if it pays half as much and requires them to work \ntwice as long because they do not want to be dependent on government? \nTheir pride will not allow it.\n  Who is fighting for them? And they are worried about the future. What \nabout the people with the big ideas, the ones who are going to start \nthe next American company? They are starting to wonder whether America \nis the place to do it when they hear some people basically describe \nfinancial success as wrong. They start to wonder whether government is \nan obstacle or ally in their hopes of opening their business here. This \nis a fundamental problem for us. This is not an economic debate; this \nis a debate about our identity as a country.\n\n  It is important for us to understand what makes America different \nfrom the rest of the world--and we are different. For those people who \nwere born and raised in this country, as I was, it is easy to take this \nfor granted. We should not. It is not like this everywhere. In most \ncountries, a person can only do what their parents did for a living--\neven today. In most places on Earth, children can only go as far as \ntheir family went--even today. This Chamber is full of people--and I am \nglad to be a part of it--who have gone further than their parents ever \ndid.\n  If people in this Chamber had grown up in the Old World, they would \nnot be here, nor would they be able to run a business. In the Old \nWorld, people were trapped doing what their parents did. What makes us \nspecial and different is that it doesn't matter what our parents do for \na living. It doesn't matter if we are not well connected or famous. We \ncan go as far as our talent or work will take us. If we lose that, we \nwill lose what makes us special and different. That is what we should \nbe fighting about, and in some ways we are.\n  I think we actually do have an agreement here. The agreement is that \nthe only solution to our problem is growing our economy. We cannot tax \nour way out of this problem. We cannot cut our way out of this problem \neither. The only solution to this problem is to grow our way out of \nthis problem, and I think we agree on that.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  I hope the debate we are going to have is, how do we grow our way out \nof this? How do we create growth in the private economy? Do we allow \ngovernment to spend as much as it wants until growth starts to happen? \nThat is what one side is arguing. We have to ask questions, such as, do \nwe embrace the principles of free enterprise and say: Look, government \nhas a role, but it has to be limited. What we have to do is create an \nenvironment for the private economy to be incentivized to grow, and it \nwill happen.\n  I want to have that debate. I want this budget to be that debate.\n  By the way, no one comes to this with clean hands. I will criticize \nmy own party on this. No one can build up $16.5 trillion by themselves. \nThis is a bipartisan debt. We have never seen anything like the last 4 \nyears, I will say that. I have never seen anything like the last 4 \nyears in terms of growing the debt. There are Republicans who are \ncomplicit in this debt issue as well. We should be honest about that. \nWe should also be honest that at times some in my own party have \nfocused so much on the trees of debt that we lost focus on the forest \nof growth.\n  The reason we should care about the debt is because it hurts growing \nour economy, and that is what the debate should be about. It should be \nabout growth. Let's have a debate here about how we can get our economy \ngrowing at least 4 to 4.5 percent a year so we can pull millions of \npeople out of poverty, pay down and stabilize our debt, and get people \nfrom the working class to the middle class and from the middle class \nand beyond. Let's have that debate. Let's argue about what is the best \nway to create growth. Do we create growth through more government or \nmore free enterprise? Let's have that debate.\n  For those on my side of the argument, I hope we can have that debate \nbecause I like our chances. I like what history has to say about it. I \nthink we can prove that the only nations in the history of the world \nthat have ever accomplished the kind of economic exceptionalism and \nmiddle-class prosperity that Americans want and expect and deserve are \nthe countries that have followed the path of limited government, \neffective government, well-run government, and free enterprise. Our \ncountry deserves once and for all to have that debate and stop hiding \nbehind negotiations that it is rich versus poor or the haves versus the \nhave-nots.\n  Let's have a debate about growth. If we grow this economy, we can \nprotect America, and it will make the world a better place as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I yield such time as I may consume from \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to commend the Senator from \nFlorida. I could not agree more with the importance of focusing on \neconomic growth and developing policies that maximize economic growth.\n  I believe we could have a tremendous economic recovery underway right \nnow, but we don't. The main reason we don't is because we have a \ndysfunctional government in Washington that has policies that are \npreventing economic growth.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution our Democratic friends have \noffered offers more of the same failed policies that would only result \nin extending this period of miserable economic growth or a lack \nthereof. I would like to talk about a few aspects of this. I will talk \nabout what they want to do on taxes, but before we get into the \nsubstance of the Democratic budget proposal for taxes, I think a little \nhistorical context is important, and we don't have to go back to \nancient history.\n  In the last few years, what our Democratic friends and this \nadministration have done is repeatedly raise taxes on all Americans, \nincluding middle-income Americans, and they propose much more now. \nLet's go back, for instance, to the ObamaCare middle-income tax \nincreases. I will run through a quick litany of some of the tax \nincreases we have suffered through as a result of ObamaCare, which \nraises taxes on people with health savings accounts and flexibility \nspending accounts. It raises taxes on people with catastrophic medical \nexpenses. It raises taxes on people who purchase medical devices. It \nraises taxes on people who buy health insurance. It raises taxes on \npeople who don't buy health insurance. It raises taxes on employers who \ncannot afford to provide health insurance. It raises taxes on people \nwho have family plans that Washington believes are excessive. Is there \nanyone in America who is not on one or more elements of this list? I \nvery much doubt it. The fact is that ObamaCare was a huge tax increase \nthat added up to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, and it very much included \nall kinds of taxes that will be carried by middle-income Americans.\n  More recently, on January 1 of this year, we had another huge tax \nincrease. That was about $620 billion over the next 10 years. It was \nless than 3 months ago. This raises the top rate from 35 percent to \n42.5 effectively when we include the phasing out of deductions. If we \nadd in the Medicare increases and the total top Federal marginal tax \nrate, it is 44.8 percent.\n  By the way, this is the highest this rate has ever been. Right now, \nthis is the highest this rate has been since Ronald Reagan inherited a \ndisastrous tax code from Jimmy Carter. That was a long time ago. That \ndoesn't include the State and local taxes, which put many Americans at \na top marginal tax rate of over 50 percent. The government is taking \nover half of the income they are earning, and our friends who are \nintroducing this budget are suggesting that all of this is not enough. \nThey are suggesting that we need yet another big tax increase--in fact, \nwe need a giant one, $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years in new \nadditional taxes.\n  I have news for everyone. I don't see how this can possibly be done \nwithout significant tax increases on middle-income Americans. I know \nsome folks in this Chamber like to suggest this can be done by soaking \nthe rich again. We can just go back to soaking rich folks again. I \ndon't see how that can work. I will give an example of why I don't \nthink that can work.\n\n  The President laid out in his budget last year his plan for a whole \nnew round of taxes for wealthy Americans on top of the tax increases \nthat occurred weeks ago. He specified how he would propose doing it. \nThe gist is that he wants to limit the value of deductions and apply \ntaxes to income that is not otherwise taxed at the moment. He will \nlimit the value of all kinds of deductions. He laid this out. It would \nbe all itemized deductions--mortgage interest deductions, charitable \ncontributions, State and local taxes. They want to tax health insurance \nexclusions and employee contributions to 401(k)s and IRA plans, section \n199 manufacturing deductions, tax exempt interest, contributions to \nhealth savings accounts.\n  All of these things would be limited and would especially affect the \nwealthy taxpayers under the President's plan--the last budget we got \nfrom this President. He has chosen not to comply with the rules whereby \nhe should have already produced one for this year. These tax increases \nwere meant to be in that budget above and beyond the tax increase he \ngot on January 1. Guess what. The President's plan for raising taxes on \nthe wealthy is $584 billion. That is a lot of money, but it doesn't get \nus anywhere near the $1.5 trillion this budget resolution calls for. \nThe President has laid out his plan for how he intends to soak the rich \nyet again--we know that much--but we don't know yet how he will raise \nthe other $1 trillion. I can tell everyone where they are going to get \nthat money. It will come from the middle class; that is where the money \nis.\n  What are all of these tax increases for? A lot of it is for \nincreasing spending. The Democratic budget would spend more money than \nthe current CBO budget. I know it doesn't look that way if we look just \nat the top lines. We have to dig deeper. What we discover is that the \nDemocratic budget decides to make a totally different assumption about \nthe American presence in Afghanistan than what CBO does. We are winding \ndown our presence in Afghanistan, but the budget doesn't decide that. \nThat is a separate matter altogether. If we want to compare apples to \napples, we make the same assumptions about ongoing war expenses. When \nwe do that, we discover that this proposal actually increases spending \nat a rate faster than what current law calls for. That is what this \nbudget would do.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  This budget raises taxes enormously, including very much on the \nmiddle-class because I don't see any other way we can get there. It \nalso increases spending.\n  By the way, the only operative year of a budget is the first year. In \nthe first year, the increase is $162 billion over what we are going to \nspend this year. That is a 4.6-percent increase in spending in the year \nin which inflation is running around 2 percent, and that is what this \nplan is.\n  Here is what is most objectionable to me about all of the spending \nand these huge tax increases. This is a big part of the reason we are \nsuffering through the worst economic recovery since the Great \nDepression. There is no coincidence here. If we look in the post-war \nera, in the 3 years following a recession, the economy, on average, has \ngrown by 14.4 percent. That is the average growth over a 3-year period \nafter we have had a recession. What is the growth we have had this \ntime? It is 6.7 percent. It is less than half. This is the worst \nrecovery in our lifetime, and it is no coincidence.\n  We have had huge increases in spending, and what has that given us? \nIt has given us this feeble economic growth, and it has given us an \nunemployment rate hovering around 8 percent. We all know that does not \ninclude the millions of Americans who left the workforce altogether. \nThey have given up looking for work. It doesn't include the many folks \nwho are underemployed. In fact, we have fewer people working in America \ntoday than we did in 2007. And it never takes this long for an economy \nto bounce back and create the jobs that were lost during a recession. \nHowever, it has this time, and it is partly because we are pursuing the \nwrong policies.\n  There is huge government spending, stimulus spending, all kinds of \ngrowth in government, and huge tax increases and the threat of big tax \nincreases. This is a big contributing factor. Higher taxes reduces \neconomic growth not only because of the money it takes directly out of \nthe economy but because of the incentives. It reduces the incentive to \nwork, to save, to invest. Whatever is being taxed, there is less of for \nthe person to enjoy who actually created it. Sure enough, as a result, \nwe get less of that activity. So the more we raise taxes on work, on \nsavings and investment, the less of it we get. The other thing is that \nthere are tax increases that are looming in the future--and that day \nwill come--and people's behavior is affected by it.\n  Huge growth in government spending and the corresponding deficits we \nhave seen have a chilling effect on economic growth itself. People \nunderstand that is eventually going to get paid with either higher \ntaxes or we are going to monetize it and diminish the value of our \ncurrency and have inflation or some combination of those. So all of \nthis government--of which this budget proposes still more--is part of \nthe reason our economic growth is so meager.\n  I have one final point to make on this as it pertains to the budget. \nThe irony is that growth is the best way to solve all of our problems. \nStrong economic growth has a direct benefit for the families who enjoy \nit, who benefit from the jobs that are created, the higher wages they \nearn, the elevated standard of living, the integrity that comes from \nproviding for their families. All of those things are the direct \nbenefits from a stronger economy. There is no better way to deal with \nour budget deficit than stronger economic growth.\n  In fact, the CBO tells us that just one-tenth of 1 percentage point \nof sustained increase in the rate of growth in 10 years results in $280 \nbillion of new revenue. That is not completely linear. However, we are \nso far below the average that if we just add a full percent, we would \nbe talking about literally trillions of dollars in additional revenue \nand smaller deficits. All of that would come from economic growth in \nthe context of people who are back to work and an economy that is \nbooming. That is what we ought to be heading for. Unfortunately, this \nbudget doesn't take us there.\n  I know the Senator from Wisconsin wants to speak, and I will yield \nthe floor in a minute.\n  I want to say a quick word before I do that about one particularly \nimportant amendment we are going to debate beginning around 2 p.m. \ntoday and vote on hopefully soon. This goes to a small subset of the \ntax problems ObamaCare and this budget would create. It is the medical \ndevice tax.\n\n  The medical device tax is one of the more egregious flaws in \nObamaCare, in my view. Part of the reason is it is such a badly \ndesigned tax. This tax is badly designed, in my view, because it \napplies to total sales, so it is even worse than an income tax \nincrease, which would have been a bad idea.\n  This applies a tax to sales, irrespective of whether a company is \nmaking income. So if you are a startup company, if you are a small \ngrowing company or if you are an established company and having hard \ntimes, this is a tax that disregards whether you are operating in the \nblack and says, We are just going to apply this new tax on your total \nsales. That is a very badly designed tax, in my view.\n  It is a particularly bad idea in a sector that has so many young and \ngrowing and startup companies that have so much promise. They are \nmaking medical devices that are improving the quality of our lives, \nsaving lives that without these inventions wouldn't be saved, and we \nare going to slap a new tax on the sales of some of these companies \nthat are just trying to get started and not yet profitable. That is a \nterrible idea. I know in Pennsylvania, the tax has gone into effect. It \nwent into effect on January 1 of this year. It is already costing us \njobs, limiting growth, and preventing new factories from being built in \nPennsylvania to manufacture medical devices. It is also making health \ncare more expensive. We are all consumers of medical devices of various \nkinds. We are talking everything from surgical implements to \nprostheses, to hip replacement to ordinary health care devices.\n  Lastly, I would suggest that the existence of this tax makes it \nharder to raise the capital to launch new firms and, therefore, it is \ngoing to stifle innovation.\n  I know there is bipartisan support to repeal this tax. I am very \npleased about that. I wish to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership \nfor a long time on this. I know Senator Klobuchar has been a great \nleader on this issue as well. Several others, including Senator Casey \nand myself, feel very strongly about this. I am cautiously optimistic \nthat this amendment could pass. I sure hope it does. It would be a big \nimprovement.\n  At this time I am happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before my colleague yields, first I am speaking and \ntaking time off the resolution, but I wish to inquire of my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin as to how long he will be speaking, for the information \nof the body. It was my understanding there had been an informal \ndiscussion about having the majority start speaking on the resolution \nat 12:45. So just for the purposes of colleagues, I wanted to check on \nhow long he thought he would be speaking.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I was allocated 15 to 20 \nminutes. I will try to keep it to 15 minutes to yield at the top of the \nhour.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I ask that my time be used \nagainst our allocation on the resolution.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is absolutely \nright. I supplied the medical industry for over 31 years, and the \nmedical device tax will do great harm to medical innovation.\n  I also wish to commend both the Senators from Florida and \nPennsylvania about their great points on the importance of economic \ngrowth and how important it is that we concentrate all of our efforts \nhere in Washington on economic growth.\n  I truly believe that every Member of this body, people serving in \nCongress, share the same goals, or the same goal: We want a prosperous \nAmerica. We want every American to have the opportunity to build a good \nlife for themselves and their family. But often folks on the other side \nof the aisle accuse Republicans--conservatives--of conducting a war on \nwomen or a war on the middle class. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. I will tell my colleagues what is the truth. It is that with all \nof our deficit spending here in\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nWashington, we are conducting a war on our children. Fortunately, I do \nnot know of a parent or parents who would willingly drive up their own \npersonal debt, who would max out their credit cards with absolutely no \nintention of ever paying those debts off, but fully intending to pass \nthose debts on to their children and grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren. Again, fortunately, I don't know anybody who would do \nthat. Yet, collectively as a Nation, that is exactly what we are doing. \nWe are mortgaging our children's futures.\n  I ask all Americans to please consider what we are doing in terms of \nrobbing future generations of the prosperity and the heritage and the \ntype of opportunity that we should be handing over to them.\n  An awful lot of people don't quite understand the connection between \nour high levels of debt and economic growth. By the way, it is economic \ngrowth that actually strengthens middle-income Americans. But if we \nthink about our own personal situations, if we in our own family budget \nhave driven our debt levels up to the point where creditors are calling \nus all the time, how are we going to grow our own personal economy? In \nother words, how can we increase consumption when all of our extra \ndollars are going to pay off our debt, pay our creditors? We are under \na great deal of pressure. The answer to the question is a person can't \ngrow their personal economy, they can't grow their own personal \nconsumption. That same economic fact applies to a nation as well. That \nis why these high levels of debt are harming economic growth and \nharming the very people all this government spending is purporting to \ntry and help.\n  One way to take a look at this in terms of the harmful effect of all \nof the regulation, all the government debt, is economic growth. The \nfact of the matter is, on average, after 14 quarters, the American \neconomy has grown, after post-World War II recessions, by 19.9 percent. \nUnder Ronald Reagan, our economy grew 20.1 percent in the first 14 \nquarters. Under this President, our economy has grown by only 7.5 \npercent. Again, I would argue an awful lot of that has to do with \nregulations, but an awful lot of it has to do with the fact that we \nhave increased our debt to unsustainable levels. It is scaring \nconsumers. It is scaring business people away from investing in capital \nand growing their businesses.\n\n  As Republicans, as conservatives, we want every American to pay their \nfair share. We actually want a balanced approach to deficit and debt \nreduction. We want more revenue flowing into the Federal Government, \nbut we want to increase revenue the old-fashioned way: by growing our \neconomy.\n  Just a couple of quick little facts. Even with the meager economic \ngrowth we have experienced from 2009 to 2012, revenue has increased to \nthe Federal Government by a total of $344 billion per year. If we \nreturned to an economy such as we had in 2007, when revenue to the \nFederal government was 18.5 percent of our economy--it was pretty close \nto the 50-year average--that would add another $435 billion per year of \nrevenue.\n  The tax deal, the ``punishing success'' tax increase that was part of \nthe fiscal cliff, supposedly will raise $41 billion in the year 2014. \nSo $41 billion versus $435 billion is a tenth as effective. The problem \nwith that ``punishing success'' scheme is it puts at risk the very \ngrowth that is far more effective at raising revenue.\n  So how do we get our fiscal house in order? Well, we actually have to \nput our Nation on a glide path toward a balanced budget. We have to \nreturn that level of certainty. Global creditors have to be able to \nlook at the United States and say, I think they are getting this \nsituation under control. The only way we can do that is by passing a \nbudget in this body that actually shows a glide path to balance.\n  Of course, that is not what the Democratic Senate budget resolution \nwill do. It never balances. As Senator Toomey was speaking about, we \nhave to take a look at that first year. In comparison to the CBO \nestimate, it actually increases spending by $100 billion. It would \nincrease our deficit by $75 billion. That is the primary thing we have \nto take a look at because these budget resolutions are only about as \ngood as the paper they are written on, so we have to look at that first \nyear.\n  The other point I want to make in terms of this budget resolution is \nthe claims in terms of deficit reduction are patently dishonest. The \nclaim to reduce the deficit by $1.85 trillion in comparison to the CBO \nbaseline is not true. The only way we get that is by comparing apples \nto oranges. If we adjust the CBO baseline--for example, the $1 \ntrillion--it counts in more spending, or the $300 billion of Hurricane \nSandy extended spending, or the additional $200 billion of interest. If \nwe compare apples to apples, this budget at most will reduce the \ndeficit by $300 billion to $400 billion. Again, what we have to take a \nlook at is what it does in that first year, which is actually increases \nthe deficit and increases spending.\n  This is basically not an honest budget. So my first amendment that I \nwill be offering is a simple amendment. It would establish a point of \norder subject to a 60-vote waiver or appeal that simply requires a \nbalanced budget in the year 2023. Pretty reasonable. I think the \nAmerican public actually expects us to live within our means far before \nthat date, but this would be a responsible glide path. I think it is an \neminently reasonable amendment, and I certainly hope my colleagues here \nin the Senate will support a very commonsense approach to providing \nsome level of fiscal discipline to our Federal situation.\n  The second amendment I wish to offer has to do with the financial \nsituation of States and local governments. Far too many cities are \nalready going bankrupt. We have a chart here that shows a number of \ncities that have already declared bankruptcy and are going through that \nprocess. I think it is extremely important that we here in Congress put \nStates and local governments on notice that they cannot come to the \nFederal Government looking for a bailout. They need to get their own \nfiscal house in order. We are not picking on anybody, but it is amazing \nwhen we take a look at the unfunded liability that some of these State \nand local governments are facing right now.\n  The city of Chicago, for example, has an unfunded liability per \nhousehold of close to $42,000. I said $42,000 per person. New York City \nis about $39,000, and San Francisco is about $35,000.\n  The point of this amendment is to put State and local governments on \nnotice that the Federal Government will not be here to bail them out. \nThey need to get their own fiscal house in order.\n  The third amendment I intend to offer has to do with recognizing the \ntruth of the situation with our entitlement programs. At the current \nlevel, at the current path, neither Social Security nor Medicare is \nsustainable. So this amendment is also a very simple amendment. It \nestablishes a point of order that requires in any budget resolution \nthat we reform both Social Security and Medicare to create a 75-year \nsolvency. Again, I think that is pretty reasonable. Let me describe why \nI think it is so important. I frequently hear all kinds of people claim \nSocial Security is solvent to the year 2035 or the year 2038. It is a \nmoving target. Let's take a look at the true picture in terms of the \nSocial Security financial balance sheet. This comes right from the \nSocial Security Administration. This is looking ahead to the year 2032, \na mere 20 years' worth of deficits.\n  It is true that Social Security actually was running surpluses for \ndecades. It built up a trust fund of--we will talk about that later--\nabout $2.5 trillion, $2.6 trillion. But in 2010, that situation turned \naround. Now Social Security is paying out more in benefits than it is \ntaking in, in terms of dedicated revenue to the payroll tax. Over the \nnext 20 years, that total cash deficit will equal $5.1 trillion.\n  How could anybody, looking at these facts and figures, possibly claim \nSocial Security is solvent? Well, it is because of the fiction--and it \nis fiction--of the Social Security trust fund. I have a couple of \nquotes here from the Office of Management and Budget. Talking about the \nSocial Security trust fund, they say:\n\n       These balances are available for future benefit payments \n     and other trust fund expenditures, but only in a bookkeeping \n     sense. The holdings of the trust funds are not assets of the \n     government as a whole that can be drawn down in the future to \n     fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury.\n\n  In other words, they are claims against the Federal Government.\n\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n\n       The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does \n     not, by itself, increase the government's ability to pay \n     benefits. Put differently, these trust fund balances are \n     assets of the program agencies and corresponding liabilities \n     of the Treasury.\n\n  In other words, we have assets worth $2.6 trillion, we have \nliabilities of $2.6 trillion, netting to zero.\n  One of the analogies I use to describe the trust fund is very similar \nto this: If a person has $20 and spends it--by the way, this money is \nspent; it is gone--and then that person writes him- or herself a note \nfor $20 and stuffs it in their pocket and says, Hey, I have 20 bucks, \nthey really don't. They have a promissory note they will have to give \nsomebody else to purchase so they can have the real $20 to spend. That \nis basically what we have in the Social Security trust fund. It does \nexist. It is just worth zero.\n\n  But here, ladies and gentlemen of America, as shown in this picture, \nis the Social Security trust fund. It is a file cabinet. It is locked. \nThat is kind of funny because they are actually nonmarketable \nsecurities, but there you go. That is $2.6 trillion worth of value that \nsupposedly makes Social Security solvent to the year 2035. It is a \nfiction. It is false. And until everybody here in Washington starts \ntruthfully describing the extent of our problem with not only Social \nSecurity but also Medicare--I was part of that group of Senators who \nhad the privilege of having dinner with the President a couple weeks \nago. I found it very interesting that President Obama accurately \ndescribed the problem in reforming Medicare. He said the problem is \nthat Americans pay in $1 but they get $3 worth of benefits. He also \nwent on to say we have a problem because most Americans do not \nunderstand that.\n  Well, today I am asking the President, I am asking Members on the \nother side of the aisle to join with Republicans to honestly describe \nthe problem to the American public. You do not solve a problem until \nyou first define it and then secondly admit you have the problem. We \nhave severe problems with Social Security, with Medicare, with other \nmandatory spending, with our budget. Until we come to terms with that, \nuntil we are honest with the American people--stop pulling the wool \nover their eyes--we have no chance whatsoever of solving these very \nsevere problems.\n  So with that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will be speaking off of the time on \nthe resolution for a moment and then deferring to Senator Mikulski in \nyielding time to her, as well as our great colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Klobuchar, and others who wish to speak as we proceed with the \ndebate on this resolution.\n  Let me take a moment and say that today the House has passed their \nbudget called the Ryan Republican budget, and it effectively rolls back \nhealth care for women in this country. Our budget does exactly the \nopposite. We protect and strengthen access to health care for women.\n  Under health care reform, which we strengthen and support in our \nbudget, health insurance plans, as we know, are required to cover \nwomen's preventive care, things such as annual wellness visits, \ndomestic violence screenings, and contraception, without copays, \ncoinsurance, or deductibles. The Republican budget that was passed \ntoday would take away those protections. Under the budget they passed \ntoday, 1.3 million women in Michigan alone could lose their health \ncare.\n  Insurance plans are now--under what we have passed--not allowed to \ndiscriminate against women. That is part of health reform. Being a \nwoman is not a preexisting condition anymore. You cannot charge higher \nrates, you cannot discriminate in other ways against women in the \nmarketplace when they are looking to buy insurance. And it would \nprohibit insurance companies from denying access to health insurance \nfor a variety of things, such as being a domestic violence survivor. \nThe Republican budget in the House would take away those critical \nprotections.\n  Until we passed health reform, as many as 60 percent of the \nindividual insurance plans in this country did not offer basic \nmaternity care, which I think is shocking. I know that whenever I talk \nwith folks about that, they cannot believe that basic prenatal care, \nwhich is so important for babies, for women, was not provided. Now it \nis under our definition of health care.\n  The Ryan Republican budget would mean that 1 million women and \nchildren would not have access to maternal or child health services in \nMichigan alone. It would mean that 6,000 fewer women in Michigan would \nget cancer screenings that could save their lives and that nearly \n16,000 children would not get the vaccinations they need to remain \nhealthy.\n  That is just one area of many reasons why we need to support the \nbudget Senator Murray and our committee have put before this body. This \nis about focusing on women's health, on middle-class growth in terms of \neducation and innovation, and on infrastructure investments to grow our \neconomy. It is important that we are having this debate, and it is \nimportant that the women of the country understand that the budget we \nhave before the Senate, the Democratic budget, places women as a \npriority--their health, the economy for their families, being able to \nbalance their own budgets, and being able to provide futures for their \nchildren.\n  I would now like to yield time off the resolution to our great leader \nfrom Maryland, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, a person who, \nas we know, showed extraordinary leadership in the last few weeks on \nthe floor in a very challenging time, dealing with the current budget, \nwhich we have now successfully passed. She also is our leader as it \nrelates to women's health care and the provisions on women's health \ncare in health reform that are now impacting and saving women's lives.\n  I yield time off the resolution--as much time as she would consume--\nto Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nher kind words and also her leadership. She is part of our Democratic \nleadership team and has been a real champion for jobs that pay a living \nwage, jobs that lead to the middle class. She is an advocate for making \nsure we have an economy that builds from the middle class out. Also, as \nthe chair of the full Committee on Agriculture, she has fashioned \nbipartisan solutions to help our American farmers, particularly the \nfamily farm, and to feed the hungry here and around the world. I salute \nher for her leadership.\n  Mr. President, I come here today to support the budget put forth by \nthe Democrats in their resolution, led by the very able chair, Senator \nPatty Murray. We are showing that we can govern. Yesterday we passed \nthe continuing funding resolution in the Senate. It passed 73 to 26. It \nshowed a bipartisan resolution, a resolve to make sure there is no \ngovernment shutdown, slowdown, slamdown. We now have to look ahead to \nfiscal year 2014.\n  I salute Senator Murray for what she has done through her committee. \nFirst of all, she is dealing with sequester, that Draconian approach \nthat is going to shred government but most of all shred opportunity and \nplace our fragile economy in jeopardy. She has done it in a balanced \nway. At the same time, she has protected seniors, veterans, and our \nmost vulnerable by making sure she has looked out for Medicare and \nMedicaid. Contrasting the Ryan budget, she also showed that she, in our \nbudget, is not going to throw women and children under the bus. I think \nshe has done an outstanding job, and I want to support her.\n  As we look at what we need to do here in the budget, I was appalled, \nfirst of all, to see what the Ryan budget did. Women across America \nhave to balance their family budgets. They know America also has to get \nits fiscal act together. But the entire Ryan budget places the whole \nburden of drawing down our public debt on discretionary spending. It \npreserves tax breaks and tax earmarks and further squeezes those fiscal \npriorities that impact women and children, impact education, impact \nempowerment. I think what we have to offer here offers a far greater \nvision.\n  One of the things I am deeply concerned about is its impact on \nwomen's health care. The Senator from Michigan has spoken about it. We \nworked on\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nmaking sure that--when we were working on the Affordable Care Act, we \nacknowledged the special needs of women. We were appalled in hearings \nthat I had that women were paying more for their health insurance than \nmen of comparable age and health status. We were paying a gender tax.\n  Now, the Affordable Care Act--disparagingly mentioned on the other \nside as ObamaCare; affectionately mentioned here as ObamaCare because \nthe President does--our legislation that we passed in the Affordable \nCare Act eliminated gender discrimination in the insurance industry, \nthat you do not penalize someone because they are a woman.\n  Then we got right rid of the punitive practices in insurance \ncompanies, one of which was to deny families with children with \npreexisting conditions health care. That meant that if you had a child \nwith autism, if you had a child with cerebral palsy, you could not get \nhealth insurance for the rest of your family--punitive, harsh. We got \nrid of that.\n  Then there was the way they treated the women. Simply being a woman, \nas others have said, was a preexisting condition. We were appalled in \nour investigation that showed that in eight States you were denied \nhealth insurance if you were a victim of domestic violence. So you were \nbattered in your own home, and you were battered by your insurance \ncompany. Again, we got rid of those punitive practices.\n  But the Ryan budget gets rid of the Affordable Care Act. So all of \nthose reforms--increasing universal access to the working poor, getting \nrid of the punitive practices of insurance companies, ending gender \ndiscrimination--will be vitiated. It will be canceled like it did not \nhappen.\n  During their campaigns, they said they wanted to repeal and replace. \nWell, Paul Ryan repeals, but he does not replace. And do you know what. \nWe do not need to have it replaced. We need to keep the Affordable Care \nAct in place, moving America in the right direction and helping health \ncare be affordable both to families and to businesses. We cannot allow \nthe Ryan budget to stand.\n  But just being against an idea is not good enough. This is why we \nsupport the Murray budget, because she preserves the Affordable Care \nAct, and she continues to emphasize those reforms we made in quality \nand prevention and integrative services. We know how, through those \nquality initiatives, we can save money and save lives.\n  Others will also speak about Medicare. I cannot believe that we are \ngoing to replace Medicare with a voucher--a voucher and a promise. So \nlet's get rid of, not deal with, the health care needs of the elderly. \nLet's get rid of the financial needs of the Federal Government. So we \nwould rather protect billionaires than protect senior citizens. I think \nwe have our priorities wrong.\n  Others will speak to Medicare. I am going to go to Medicaid. I want \nto speak to Medicaid because of our knowledge about who is on Medicaid. \nMr. President, 1.8 million seniors are in nursing homes. What is \nMedicaid? Medicaid is the only safety net the middle class has when, \nthrough the ravages of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or other chronic, \ndebilitating disease, you must turn to a long-term care facility, that \nyou have a safety net to help pay the bill. In order to qualify, you \nhave to spend down.\n  I was a leader here, 25 years ago, in trying to reform the spend-down \npolicy. Twenty-five years later, we have made no reforms. We have had \nplenty of attacks but no reform.\n  We cannot turn Medicaid into a block grant. It is going to endanger \nreally the ability of sound nursing homes--either by the private sector \nor faith-based--in my own State to look at how are they going to fund \nthis.\n  All we are doing is funding our problems with public debt onto the \nStates. Many people here talk about, oh, we need to go to the \nGovernors. All we are sending to the Governors is more unfunded Federal \nmandates. We cannot do this to Medicaid, and we cannot do this to the \nmiddle class.\n  Instead, we should be investing in research. I say this because my \nfather died of the ravages of Alzheimer's. We had to spend down the \nfamily savings he earned from working over 60 or 70 hours a week in a \nlittle grocery store. This is not only our story, it is the story of \nover 1 million people.\n  What could we do? I felt so sad for my father. I felt worse because \neven though I was a Senator, even though I could get Nobel Prize \nwinners on the phone, even though I was an appropriator, there wasn't \nthe cure, the cognitive stretchout for him.\n  We need to invest in the research. We are on the brink of incredible \nbreakthroughs in neurological science which could either help fund the \ncure for Alzheimer's or do the cognitive stretchout. We need to spend \nmoney to save money. Let's put the money into research and deal with \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lou Gehrig's disease, debilitating things \nwhich break the family's budget and family's heart but also contribute \nto the public debt. We can get there if we make wise and prudent \nchoices. Most of the people in nursing homes are primarily women over \nthe age of 80. What are we going to do? Are we going to abandon them?\n  This budget is unkind to women, but it is also unkind to children in \nterms of the opportunity structure.\n  The Ryan budget caps and freezes Pell grants at $5,645. It requires \nfamilies who make less than $20,000 to qualify for a Pell grant. This \nmeans many people who seek Pell grants are single mothers. There is \nrecent data showing many of our families, 63 percent, are in single-\nparent households. It could be a single mother or a single dad, someone \nwho started out life with hopes and dreams and now has many \nresponsibilities.\n  Many wish to return to higher education, particularly the community \ncolleges which offer gateways to better jobs in the new economy. In my \nown State, this could be an associate degree in nursing, in pharmacy \ntech or in lab tech. This can help keep people in the middle class in \naffordable living. An affordable education will be the gateway into \ncommunity colleges. We should be expanding the Pell grants, not \nshrinking them. It is a new economy, and it is a new family profile.\n  I could go over this line item by line item. I know others will be \ntalking. When we look at women who need health care for themselves, for \ntheir children and their aging parents, the so-called sandwich \ngeneration, the Ryan budget vitiates it, but the Murray budget has a \nway to deal with this.\n  For education and opportunity, for our children, workforce, and \ncommunity colleges, the Ryan budget shrinks opportunity and shrinks the \nability of people rising to the middle class or staying in the middle \nclass.\n  I think the Ryan budget is a bad prescription for America. The way I \nwant to deal with the Ryan budget is replace it with a sensible, \nbalanced approach which looks for the hopes and dreams of the American \npeople and is not protecting lavish subsidies and lavish tax breaks to \nsubsidize corporate jets and other such items.\n  I salute the Senator from Washington State for the great job she \naccomplished. I look forward to further debate.\n  Yesterday, we were able to move the continuing resolution for \nfunding. I could not have done it without the great staff I have.\n\n\n                       Retirement of Charlie Houy\n\n  Mr. President, in a few days the U.S. government will say \ncongratulations and happy retirement to one of our finest public \nservants, Charlie Houy. After more than three decades of federal \nservice Charlie will retire from the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  He has served on the Appropriations Committee for more than 30 years, \nalways following the dictum of his first supervisor, Senator Ted \nStevens, that staff, like children, should be seen and not heard. \nCharlie began his Federal service in 1981 working for the Naval Sea \nSystems Command as a Presidential Management Intern. He was detailed to \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 1983 and worked as a \nmajority professional staff member for Chairmen Ted Stevens, John \nStennis, and Daniel Inouye. Charlie was appointed Democratic clerk of \nthe subcommittee in 1995 by Chairman Inouye and remained in that \nposition through 2010.\n  In 2009, Charlie became the 23rd staff director of the full \nAppropriations Committee under Chairman Inouye's leadership and did an \noutstanding job keeping the trains running to get the committee's work \ndone and maneuvering the committee through numerous budget minefields.\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n  During the transition following Chairman Inouye's sudden passing, \nCharlie expertly brought me up to speed on the short term and long term \nissues I would be facing as the new chairwoman. Just one day after \nbecoming chairwoman, I found myself managing the Sandy Supplemental on \nthe Senate floor. Charlie was on my side, and at my side. His advice \nand during this period were invaluable. It more than made up for the \nfact that he is an avid San Francisco 49ers fan.\n  His spirit of bipartisanship has earned him praise from members on \nboth sides of the aisle and both sides of the Dome. Senate Majority \nLeader Harry Reid described Charlie as a person ``who has a fantastic \nknowledge of what goes on in this country as it relates to money.'' The \nlate Senator Ted Stevens had this to say about Charlie: ``He is a \nconsummate expert on defense issues and is well respected by those at \nthe Department of Defense and his colleagues on the Hill . . . I am \nproud to say he is my friend.'' The late Chairman Daniel Inouye \ndescribed Charlie as ``one of the finest staff members in the whole \nSenate . . .''\n  His accomplishments and expertise earned him a coveted spot on Roll \nCall's Fabulous 50 staffers for his mastery of policy and procedure and \nhis ability to influence agendas and legislation.\n  President Harry Truman once said, ``It's amazing what you can \naccomplish if you don't care who gets the credit.'' This personifies \nCharlie. In a town where most people are clamoring over each other for \nthe spotlight, Charlie has used a quiet humility and a tireless work \nethic to accomplish great things for our country.\n  I would also like to recognize and thank Charlie's wife Sharon and \nhis daughter Cassie. Working in the Senate for more than 30 years, \nthere were many late nights and weekends that required Charlie to miss \nout on family events, crew regattas, and vacations. Thank you for \nlending us your husband and father during those times.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today to express my deepest appreciation \nto Charlie Houy for serving the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \nSenate, and the American people with integrity and intelligence. His \ntireless contributions to our nation have been outstanding. I wish him \nwell as he leaves the U.S. Senate for new adventures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this discussion \nbe taken from the resolution time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me thank all the women Senators who are down here \nspeaking so eloquently about the importance of passing a budget \nresolution which reflects the values and needs of women in this country \nand the men who are important to them.\n  I wish to especially thank our dean of women, Senator Mikulski, who \nhas made this a lifetime passion to ensure the women who come after her \nhave the strength and ability to participate in the economy in any way \nthey wish. I thank her and the other Senators for their leadership.\n  Senator Klobuchar will continue this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I wish to thank Senator Murray for her leadership on \nthis budget. This is not an easy thing. We all know this. She actually \nhas been working on this many years. I am very proud of this budget and \nthe work which has been done here, the balanced approach which has been \ntaken.\n  I wish to thank Senator Mikulski, the Senator from Maryland, our \nfearless leader of the women Senators, who has been there since the \nbeginning and understands these fights in a different way than many of \nus who are new can't imagine. We will need to continue moving forward \nfor the women of this country and can never step backward, which is \nwhere I wish to begin discussing this budget.\n  The budget Senator Murray has proposed is a budget which moves us \nforward. For a long time, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have \nbeen talking about how we need to get $4 trillion in budget reduction \nand deficit reduction over the next 10 years.\n  We have done $2.4 trillion. It is a start. It is not all we need to \ndo, but it is a start. Of that amount, the $2.4 trillion, 70 percent \nwas in cuts. When we look at the proposals which have been made by \nSimpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, the Gang of 6, all the groups which \nhave worked on a very strong bipartisan basis, they have all proposed \nsomething like 2 to 1 on spending cuts to revenue.\n  The proposal which has been made on the House side which passed in \nthe House today isn't even close to that. In fact, when we look at \nCongressman Ryan's budget, there isn't revenue in this budget. He does \ninclude some of the past revenues. Even when you do that, that is a 10-\nto-1 ratio of spending cuts to revenue for this country going forward. \nIt is not the right mix. Yes, we need to balance our budget, but we \nalso need a balance which is budgeted.\n  The last thing we need to do is balance our budget on the backs of \nwomen and children. This is why it is important for people. I will \nreturn later to speak about some of the economic issues in my State and \nwhy it is so important to move forward and have a budget with a \nbalanced mix of spending cuts and revenue. I truly believe we need a \ndeal here. We need to bring this debt down. It is very important to me \nbecause I think it will trigger investment. We need to do it in the \nright way.\n  Today, I am focused on one issue; that is, the effect this budget \nwould have on women and children, the budget proposed in the House \nversus the budget Senator Murray has put together.\n  It is no coincidence the Senator who is leading us through this \nbudget process is the same Senator who joined me last spring when the \nViolence Against Women Act was on the floor. We needed to rally all 17 \nwomen Senators behind us. At the time people thought it was stuck, it \nwas a gridlock and wasn't going anywhere. Then all the women Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, came together.\n  Patty Murray was the leader in this effort. This is why this Senate \nbudget not only maintains but increases critical funding for the \nViolence Against Women and Family Violence Program. This will give law \nenforcement better tools for responding to cases of domestic violence \nand sexual assault, programs which make sure mothers and children have \na safe place to go and programs which help victims get back on their \nfeet again. Even more important, this includes programs which save \nlives.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know firsthand how important the Violence \nAgainst Women Act has been. We were very pleased it was reauthorized on \nsuch a strong bipartisan basis. It is incredibly important, not just \nfor those individual victims but for entire families and entire \ncommunities. Statistics show kids raised in violent homes are 76 times \nmore likely to be perpetrators of these crimes when they grow up.\n  This is why I truly appreciate Senator Murray's work to ensure we \nhave a policy in place, which is something we worked on in the \nJudiciary Committee. I see Senator Hirono from Hawaii. We worked hard \non this, as it is important, but also the funding is in place. We \nconsolidated programs, reduced funding with the Violence Against Women \nAct and did different things in the last Violence Against Women Act to \nmake it more efficient. This is fully funded in this bill, and it is \nvery important for people to know who care about this.\n  As to health care, something which is very important to our kids, the \nHouse budget, as has been noted by Senator Stabenow and others, would \nslash billions of dollars in basic health care services for children, \nincluding prenatal care for expectant moms and vaccinations for kids. \nUnder the House proposal, more than 33,000 women would lose access to \nmaternal and child health care services in Minnesota alone. Meanwhile, \nanother 8,551 children would lose access to lifesaving immunizations. \nThis is only in my State.\n  Sadly, after the devastating flu season we just experienced, with \nmany children dying across this country, how could anyone think it is a \ngood idea to cut funding for vaccination programs? How could that be \none of the proposals in this budget. There are so many loopholes we \ncould close, so many tax subsidies we could eliminate. Why would we cut \nkids' vaccinations? Sadly, this is what happened in the House today.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n  While we are on the subject of health care, I also wish to point out \nthe House budget would cut funding for the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program, meaning hundreds of thousands of women \nwould lose access to mammograms, pap smear tests, cervical cancer \nscreening, which is the tip of the iceberg. By repealing the Affordable \nCare Act, the House budget would threaten preventive care for women \nacross this country. The Ryan budget would eliminate the important \nreforms to improve patient care, already noted by Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Stabenow. It would eliminate the important reforms to improve \npatient care and the delivery system which is included in the health \ncare bill.\n\n  What is interesting to me is Congressman Ryan does acknowledge the \nAffordable Care Act has some very good savings in it because he \nincludes those over $700 billion in savings in his budget.\n  This is great, but then he cuts out all those budgets I spoke about \nwhich were so important to the American people: to not be banned from \nhealth insurance because you have a preexisting condition and to be \nable to keep kids on their parents' insurance until they are 26 years \nold. I am looking forward to that with my own daughter.\n  The third thing I mentioned is closing the doughnut hole for our \nseniors. Those things are all being cut under this budget.\n  We have had this debate too many times already. I wish to be clear; \nthe Senate budget not only protects core funding for preventive \nservices but upholds the Affordable Care Act and its most important \nprovisions for women and children.\n  Let's turn to another front to see how women and children of this \ncountry, particularly children, fare and this is education. On the \neducation front, the Senate budget--while still making $975 billion in \ncuts, $975 billion in spending cuts--still maintains core funding for \nearly education through the Head Start Program. The House budget, when \ncombined with sequestration, would push almost 200,000 low-income \nchildren out of the program in 2014.\n  We all know education is one of our best investments. When we look at \nthe global economy and education growing across this country, we are \ngetting real competition from other countries. The last thing we need \nto do is cut back on education.\n  This is why the Senate proposal includes continued support for \nelementary and secondary schools through programs such as IDEA, the \nladder which provides early intervention in special education services \nto kids with disabilities. Our budget also makes key investments in \nimproving literacy and increasing the emphasis on STEM, science, \ntechnology, engineering, math.\n  This is the future. We want to train our own kids in America, as \nSenator Sanders is well aware, to ensure they have the skills to be \nable to compete on the international stage.\n  What does the House budget do? It slashes close to $1.2 trillion of \ninvestments in education, skills training, science and technology, R, \ntransportation and infrastructure over the next 10 years.\n  Do you know what I think. I think that is being penny wise and pound \nfoolish and not what we should do in the budget for the United States \nof America. I truly believe we have an amazing opportunity right now. \nWe have seen better unemployment numbers than we have seen in 4 years. \nThe housing market is starting to turn around. People are starting to \ngo back to work. It is not nearly where it should be. The last thing we \nneed to do is go backward. The last people who want to see us go \nbackward are the women of America.\n  I was listening as Senator Stabenow spoke about the health care bill, \nthe Affordable Care Act, and during the Finance Committee there was a \ndebate about whether maternity care should be included in the mandatory \nbenefits. One of our colleagues at the time said: I don't understand \nwhy maternity benefits should be included. I never needed them.\n  Without missing a moment, Senator Stabenow looked across the table \nand said: I bet your mother did.\n  There are a lot of mothers around America right now who are looking \nat these budgets because these budgets represent values, the future of \nour kids and the women and men of this country.\n  Let's bring our spending down. Let's get over the $4 trillion figure \nwe are supposed to get out of the debt reduction but do so in a way \nwhich doesn't hurt middle-class families and doesn't hurt the families \nmost vulnerable. I know we can do it. We are a great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I wish to thank \nSenator Mikulski for the tremendous work she did on the continuing \nresolution. I know she worked so hard, and yet she is on the floor \ntoday to talk about how important passing the Murray budget is. And of \ncourse Senator Murray is on the floor also, and I want to thank her for \nher great work.\n  I stand in solidarity with all the men and women, my colleagues, who \nare going to be talking about how important it is to pass the Murray \nbudget, which is a balanced budget that reflects our priorities and our \nvalues. The last few years have been hard for families across the \ncountry. Our economy is still struggling its way out of a great \nrecession, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And we \nhave made progress. For example, the economy has grown and millions of \npeople are back to work. But this progress is not fast enough for too \nmany families in Hawaii and across our Nation.\n  Regrettably, that doesn't seem to concern some of our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives. The budget proposed by the House \nmajority, the Ryan budget, would set our economic recovery back and it \nwould do so on the backs of those who can least afford it. Some of the \nhardest hit will be women and children, the very people who face some \nof the biggest challenges in today's economy. So I want to focus on how \nthe Ryan budget negatively impacts women in our country.\n  Women in Hawaii make 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man for \nthe same job. Monthly food costs in Hawaii are 61 percent higher than \nin the rest of the country. Forty percent of Hawaii households pay more \nthan 40 percent of their monthly income on housing. Hawaii residents \npay some of the highest gasoline prices in the country, which we all \nknow can be a serious hardship on family budgets. Our high cost of \nliving is one of the reasons we have a high percentage of women working \nin two-parent households in Hawaii.\n  Across my State and across our country, women are waking up every \nday, working hard, and making ends meet in any way they can. These \nchallenges I mentioned are being overcome every single day by \ndetermined women. They work hard to improve their lives and to give \ntheir children an even greater shot at success than they had. For many, \nthe support they receive for health care, education, childcare, paying \nfor food and housing, makes all the difference. Unfortunately, the Ryan \nbudget lays out a vision of America where these people, our families, \nare left behind.\n  We are told that budgets reflect our values. I agree. What are the \nvalues exemplified and reflected by a budget, the Ryan budget, that \nmakes deep cuts in supports such as the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program--SNAP--and the Women, Infants and Children--WIC--\nProgram? Combined, SNAP and WIC help put food on the table for over 50 \nmillion--I repeat, 50 million--Americans, primarily women and children. \nThe SNAP cuts in the Ryan budget would put over 180,000 families in \nHawaii at risk of losing the ability to put food on their table.\n  What could be more fundamental than putting food on the table? I \ndon't know anyone who could look these families in the eye and say: \nSorry that you can't afford to feed your children anymore. We have to \nbalance the budget. We need to close the deficit. Sorry. That, to me, \nis unconscionable and runs counter to our core values.\n  The Ryan budget would also deeply cut childcare assistance and Head \nStart, as mentioned by my other colleagues, leaving more than 2 million \nchildren and their families without realistic early childhood or \ndaycare.\n  In addition, the Pell Grant cuts in the Ryan proposal would make \ncollege\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nless affordable for 6 million women students. Add to that the millions \nof male students and you are affecting the future education of our \ncountry.\n  These cuts don't just hurt families now, they force parents to choose \nbetween jobs and caring for children. They prevent kids from accessing \nearly learning opportunities that we know are vital to enabling these \nchildren to succeed in school and in life.\n  The Ryan budget also slashes support for things such as public \ntransit, housing assistance, and community development. Each of these \ninvestments helps make our communities better places to raise a family, \nwhich attracts businesses and creates jobs.\n  Finally, and most egregiously and seriously, in my view, the Ryan \nbudget cuts health care for women of all ages by repealing ObamaCare. \nBy repealing ObamaCare, the Ryan budget takes us back to when being a \nwoman was a preexisting condition, thereby disqualifying her for health \ninsurance or costing her many times more for coverage. If we repeal \nObamaCare, analysts project that insurance companies could charge women \nover $1 billion more in premiums than men are charged for the very same \ncoverage. So by repealing ObamaCare, the Ryan budget discriminates \nagainst women. And since when is discriminating against women a core \nvalue?\n  While ObamaCare requires that insurers cover maternity care, only 12 \npercent of plans on the individual market do so currently. Repealing \nObamaCare would also undermine access to reproductive health and family \nplanning services.\n  Now let's talk about how the Ryan budget would affect seniors. \nSeniors in our country know the Ryan budget will end Medicare as we \nknow it. They know these changes will force millions of women--and, of \ncourse, men--to make do with a voucher for their medical care--a \nvoucher of decreasing value. And since so many women receive lower \nSocial Security benefits than men, while paying higher out-of-pocket \nhealth care costs, losing Medicare coverage could be the difference for \nthem between food, housing, or lifesaving medication. Now is not the \ntime to be making huge cuts to investments in programs that provide the \nvery economic security we should be working to improve.\n  Fortunately, the priorities laid out in Chairman Murray's budget \nwould help to strengthen the economic security so many families are \nseeking. The Senate budget resolution prioritizes creating new jobs, \nexpanding opportunity, and laying out a strong foundation for economic \ngrowth. It builds on the progress we have made over the past few years \ninstead of tearing that progress down.\n  I applaud Chairman Murray for prioritizing the elimination of the \nsequester, which the Congressional Budget Office says could eliminate \n750,000 jobs. I also applaud her foresight in including investments in \nearly childhood education, clean energy, national security, our \nveterans and our seniors, and her bill preserves access to health care, \nopportunities for higher education, and programs such as SNAP and WIC. \nThese supports are vital to keeping our economy moving in the right \ndirection.\n  The Murray plan will help improve American competitiveness, foster \ninnovation, and open more opportunities for small businesses to \nsucceed, and it lays out a blueprint for responsibly paying for these \ninvestments and reducing our deficit in a balanced way. Each and every \none of these priorities helps to improve the economic security of men \nand women and children--families--in our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Murray plan, a \nplan that provides a foundation for growth, instead of a plan that \ntakes a meat-ax approach to the economic security of millions of \nfamilies in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii \nfor joining a number of very strong Democratic women to talk about the \nimportance of our budget for women in this country, and I appreciate \nher strong voice here in the Senate.\n  I yield 30 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from Vermont, \nwho is a great member of our Budget Committee and contributes so much \nthought to all of it. We appreciate all his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for yielding, and \nI want to thank her and her staff for the excellent work they have \ndone. As a member of the Budget Committee, I have enjoyed working with \nthem.\n  Everybody knows our country has an $850 billion deficit and a $16-\nplus trillion national debt. But what has not been discussed as often \nas it should be is how we came into that financial position. How do we \nhave the deficit and how do we have this huge debt?\n  Let us not forget, as we discuss this issue, that in January of 2001, \nwhen President Bill Clinton left office, this country had an annual \nFederal budget surplus of $236 billion. A surplus of $236 billion in \nJanuary 2001. We now have an $850 billion deficit. So what happened?\n  Well, I think many Americans know what happened. When you go to war \nin Afghanistan and Iraq and you don't pay for those wars, you add to \nthe deficit. When you give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nthis country and you don't offset that, you add to the deficit. When \nyou pass a Medicare Part D prescription drug program and you don't pay \nfor that, you add to the deficit.\n  And on top of all of that, we must understand that right now, at 15.8 \npercent of GDP, revenue coming into the Federal Government is the \nlowest it has been in 60 years. The reason for that is we are in the \nmidst of a very serious recession--a recession caused by the greed, \nrecklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street. Not only has that \nled to significant increases in unemployment and businesses going \nunder, once again, it resulted in less tax revenue coming in to this \ngovernment.\n  And by the way, when we talk about Wall Street and the greed and the \nrecklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street, I must say I was \nstunned when the Attorney General of the United States recently \nsuggested it might be difficult to prosecute Wall Street CEOs who \ncommit crimes because of the destabilizing effect that prosecution \nmight have on the financial system of our country and the world. In \nother words, we have a situation now where Wall Street is not only too \nbig to fail, they are too big to jail. The theory is, if you are just a \nregular person and you commit a crime, you go to jail. If you are the \nhead of a Wall Street company, your power is so great, the tentacles of \nthat company are so great, that if you are prosecuted, and there is \ndestabilization in that company, it can have worldwide or national \nimplications. That is an issue we have to think long and hard about. We \nare supposed to be a country of law, and that law should apply to the \nCEOs of Wall Street companies as well as everybody else.\n  The other point I want to make deals, if you will, with a moral \nissue. When you are dealing with a deficit situation--and I just \ndescribed how we got into the deficit situation--and you say we need to \nmake sacrifices, it is absolutely appropriate to ask who is best able \nto make those sacrifices. Right now, as I think most Americans know, \nthe wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well. \nLarge corporations are enjoying record-breaking profits. That is one \ngroup of people. Meanwhile, the middle class of this country is \ndisappearing, and we have 46 million people living in poverty. So \ncommon morality, basic morality, says who should we ask most \nsignificantly to help us with deficit reduction? Do we tell an \nunemployed worker who is struggling to keep his or her family afloat \nthat we are going to balance the budget on their back or do we ask, a \nhuge profitable corporation, that in some cases is paying nothing in \ntaxes, to help us with deficit reduction?\n  It is important for us to do what we do too rarely on the floor of \nthe Senate--take a hard look at what is happening to the American \npeople right now. I am very pleased we are seeing more job creation. \nGood thing. We are seeing somewhat of a recovery in housing. Very good \nthing. But let us understand where the middle class of this country is \ntoday, where the working class of this country is today before we \ndemand that we balance the budget on their backs, as the Ryan budget in \nthe House does.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  Since 1999, the average middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by nearly $5,000 after adjusting for inflation. Median family \nincome today is lower than it was in 1996. Real unemployment is not 7.7 \npercent, it is 14.3 percent if you count those people who have given up \nlooking for work and are working part time. Youth unemployment is even \nhigher. More than 25 percent of young Americans are unemployed. In \nterms of the African-American community, unemployment is off the \ncharts.\n  When we talk about job creation, we all want job creation. However, \nit is important to understand that nearly 60 percent of the new jobs \nthat have been created since 2010 are low-wage jobs paying between \n$7.80 an hour and $13.80 an hour.\n  Jobs, yes. But we want jobs that can take care of families, not just \nlow-wage jobs.\n  Further, when we are talking about the budget, we don't talk about \nthis at all. I know my Republican friends don't talk about it; most of \nmy Democratic friends don't talk about it. It is anathema here to talk \nabout issues of distribution of wealth and income, but I think it is \nimportant before we talk about on whose backs we are going to balance \nthe budget.\n  Today the United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth \nand income of any major country on Earth, and the gap between the very, \nvery wealthy and everyone else is growing wider and wider. Incredibly, \nthe wealthiest 400 individuals in this country today own more wealth \nthan the bottom half of America, 150 million people. I think that is an \nissue we might want to discuss even if it offends some of our wealthy \ncampaign contributors, but I think we should put that on the table.\n  Today one family--the Walton family of Walmart--owns more wealth than \nthe bottom 40 percent of families in this country. And by the way, you \nwill all be delighted to know they got a huge tax break recently.\n  Today the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth. That \nis a stunning number. What is even more stunning is the bottom 60 \npercent owns 2.3 percent of the wealth in this Nation. One percent on \ntop owns 38 percent of the wealth; the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 \npercent. And who do Mr. Ryan and my Republican friends want to balance \nthe budget on? Those 60 percent, the working families who already have \nnothing, who are losing what they have, who are struggling to keep \ntheir heads above water.\n  But it is not just distribution of wealth, it is distribution of \nincome. If you can believe it--this is again a stunning fact which, for \nsome reason, we don't talk about too much here on the floor. A recent \nstudy shows that had all of the new income gained from 2009 to 2011 \ngone to the top 1 percent, 99 percent gained nothing. So who do we \nbalance the budget on? Of course you go after the middle class, go \nafter the working class, go after low-income people. Well, maybe \nsomebody might want to ask that 1 percent to start paying a little bit \nmore in taxes before we cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation, and nutrition.\n  One of the good parts of the Murray budget is that it provides $100 \nbillion in funding to put millions of Americans back to work rebuilding \nour crumbling infrastructure. I would have gone much higher. Because \nwhile deficit reduction is a very serious issue, it is even more \nimportant that we start putting millions of people back to work who are \nin desperate need of employment. The fastest way to do that is to \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure. One hundred billion is a good \nstart. We need more.\n  During the consideration of the budget resolution, I plan on offering \ntwo amendments. The first, amendment No. 264, would create a reserve \nfund to reduce the deficit and create jobs by eliminating offshore tax \nabuse by large profitable corporations. The second, amendment No. 198, \nwould establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect the benefits \nof disabled veterans--and I speak as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--disabled vets and their survivors by not enacting the so-\ncalled chained CPI. I am pleased that this amendment is being \ncosponsored by Senator Harkin and Senator Hirono. Let me take a few \nminutes to describe both of these amendments.\n  At a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high, when the \neffective corporate tax rate is at a 40-year low, when one out of four \nprofitable corporations pays zero in taxes, it is time for large \nprofitable corporations to significantly contribute to deficit \nreduction.\n  The first amendment I will be offering would create a reserve fund to \nreduce the deficit and create jobs by eliminating offshore tax abuse by \nlarge profitable corporations. In 2011, corporate revenue as a \npercentage of GDP was just 1.2 percent. That is lower than any other \nmajor country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, lower than Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, you \nname it. Each and every year, corporations and the wealthy are avoiding \nmore than $100 billion in U.S. taxes by sheltering their income \noffshore. Offshore tax schemes have become so absurd that one five-\nstory building in the Cayman Islands is now the home to more than \n18,000 corporations.\n  When the Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and \nCitigroup needed a taxpayer bailout in 2008--and I did not vote for \nthat bailout--they told us what great Americans they were, how much \nthey love the United States of America, proud to be an American. But \nwhen it comes to paying their taxes, these large Wall Street companies \nare proud to be with the Cayman Islands. So my suggestion to these \ncorporations: Next time you need a bailout, don't come to the taxpayers \nof America. Go to the people of the Cayman Islands and get your bailout \nthere. But so long as you are an American company, how about helping us \nwith deficit reduction and paying some taxes in this country?\n  But it is not just Wall Street. You have pharmaceutical companies \nsuch as Eli Lilly and Pfizer also using offshore tax havens. Apple \nwants all the advantages of being an American company, but it doesn't \nwant to pay American taxes or American wages. It creates the iPad, the \niPhone, the iPod, and iTunes in the United States, manufactures most of \nits products in China, and then ships most of its profits to Ireland, \nLuxembourg, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes.\n  This is a huge issue. By the way, it is not just an American issue. \nIt is an issue facing governments all over the world: Corporations run \nto tax havens, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and elsewhere. We have got to \naddress that issue.\n  I am going to list for the Record 15 large profitable corporations \nthat have used offshore tax havens to avoid paying U.S. income taxes in \nrecent years. At the top of the list, Bank of America. In 2010, Bank of \nAmerica set up more than 200 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands to \navoid paying U.S. taxes. It worked. Not only did Bank of America pay \nnothing in Federal income taxes but it received a rebate from the IRS \nof $1.9 billion that year.\n  Before you cut Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare, do you \nthink maybe we might want to ask Bank of America--which we bailed out, \nby the way--to help us with deficit reduction?\n  General Electric during the last 5 years made $81 billion in profits. \nNot only has General Electric avoided paying Federal income taxes \nduring these years, it received a tax rebate of $3 billion from the \nIRS. GE has at least 14 offshore subsidiaries in Bermuda, Singapore, \nand Luxembourg.\n  Citigroup, Verizon, Honeywell International, JPMorgan Chase, Merck, \nCorning, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Caterpillar, Cisco \nSystems, Dow Chemicals, major profitable corporations using tax havens \nto avoid paying in the United States of America. We have an amendment \nto deal with that issue, and I hope we can have bipartisan support for \nthat amendment.\n  Now I want to talk about my second amendment, and now I speak as \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  This amendment, No. 198, would establish a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund to protect the benefits of disabled veterans and their survivors \nby not enacting the so-called chained CPI. I am pleased this amendment \nis being cosponsored by Senators Harkin and Hirono.\n  The time has come for the Senate to send a very loud and clear \nmessage to\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nthe American people: We will not balance the budget on the backs of \ndisabled veterans who have lost their arms, their legs, and their \neyesight defending our country. We will not balance the budget on the \nbacks of the men and women who have already sacrificed for us in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, nor on the widows who have lost their husbands in Iraq \nand Afghanistan defending our country. And we will not balance the \nbudget on the backs of those who served so valiantly in World War II, \nthe Korean war, the Vietnam war, the gulf war, and other conflicts, by \ncutting Social Security benefits. We will not the adopt the chained \nCPI.\n  The chained CPI is forcefully opposed by every major veterans \norganization in this country. I have talked to many of them, and they \nare outraged after the sacrifices veterans have made that people want \nto balance the budget on their backs. All veterans organizations are in \nopposition to the chained CPI, and that includes of course the American \nLegion, the VFW, the Disabled American Veterans, the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, Gold Star Wives, DAV. You name the \nveterans organization, and they are in opposition.\n  But it is not just the veterans organizations that oppose the chained \nCPI. The chained CPI is opposed by every major senior citizen group in \nthis country--including the AARP, the largest senior group. And I \nunderstand they have been calling Members of the Senate and the House, \nand I hope Members will listen to what the AARP has to say--and the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and the \nAlliance for Retired Americans.\n  The chained CPI is opposed by every major union in this country. I \nhad a press conference not so long ago with Rich Trumka of the AFL-CIO. \nThey are strongly opposed to the chained CPI. The chained CPI is \nopposed by every major disability group in this country. It is opposed \nby the National Organization for Women, because they understand what \nthe chained CPI would mean for women.\n  There are some who believe that lowering costs of living \nadjustments--COLAs--through the adoption of a chained CPI would be just \na minor tweak in benefits. Let's be clear. For millions of disabled \nveterans and seniors living on fixed incomes, the chained CPI is not a \nminor tweak. It is a significant benefit cut that will make it harder \nfor permanently disabled veterans and the elderly to feed their \nfamilies, heat their homes, pay for their prescription drugs, and make \nends meet. This misguided proposal must be vigorously opposed.\n  In one moment or another everybody here has talked about how they \nwant to save Social Security, because they know that back home Social \nSecurity is enormously popular. In poll after poll--whether you are \nDemocrat, Republican, Independent--what people are saying is, Don't cut \nSocial Security. Don't cut benefits for disabled veterans. Now we are \ngoing to give Members on both sides of the aisle the opportunity to act \non what they have been saying for many years.\n  Supporters of the chained CPI want the American people to believe \nthat the COLAs for the disabled vets, senior citizens, and the \nsurviving spouses and children who have lost loved ones in combat are \ntoo generous. For any senior citizen who is listening to this, the \ntheory behind the chained CPI is the benefits that you have been \ngetting are too generous. And whenever I say this in Vermont, people \nstart laughing. They really do. And I have to say, No, they are not \nkidding, they are serious.\n  At a time when some think these benefits are too generous, we should \nunderstand that in 2 out of the last 4 years disabled vets and senior \ncitizens did not receive any COLA at all, zero. So I guess a zero COLA \nis too generous. And this year's COLA of 1.7 percent is one of the \nlowest ever at a time when prescription drug costs for seniors are \ngoing up, health care costs for seniors are going up, heating costs in \ncold weather States such as mine are going up, food costs are going up. \nAnd yet seniors got a 1.7 percent COLA, and there are people who say \nthat is much too generous.\n  Today, more than 3.2 million disabled vets receive disability \ncompensation benefits from the VA and would be negatively impacted by \nthe chained CPI. Are you really ready after all the great speeches we \nhear--speeches of thank you to the veterans who put their lives on the \nline, who gave their lives defending this country--do you really want \nto cut those benefits for those who lost their arms, their legs, their \neyesight? I hope not.\n  Under the chained CPI, a disabled veteran who started receiving VA \ndisability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits cut by more \nthan $1,400 at age 45; $2,300 at age 55; and $3,200 at age 65. For our \nWall Street friends, the people who make millions of dollars a year, \nthat is not a lot of money. But for people who are trying to survive on \n$20,000, $25,000, $15,000 a year, that is a big hit. In my view, if you \nrespect veterans and the sacrifices they have made, if you respect the \n``greatest generation'' and what they have done to make this country \ngreat, you do not balance the budget on their backs.\n  Let me just conclude by saying I have been to Walter Reed, and I have \nseen what war has done to veterans. Many of my colleagues have done the \nsame. In Vermont we paid a very heavy price for the Iraq war. I have \nbeen to too many funerals. I know many of my colleagues have done the \nsame. I just ask that before we support this so-called chained CPI, \nwhich will make devastating cuts on the backs of disabled veterans and \nsenior citizens, we remember the sacrifices those people made.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent to have printed letters in opposition to \nthe chained CPI that I have received from the American Legion, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars and several other veterans \norganizations.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received from the National Commander of \nthe American Legion, Jim Koutz, in opposition to the chained CPI:\n\n       On behalf of the 2.4 million members of The American Legion \n     I voice our opposition to [the chained CPI] because of the \n     harmful effects it will have on veterans' and Social Security \n     benefits . . . Under the chained CPI, which cuts the formula \n     used to determine the COLA for VA benefits, disabled veterans \n     who receive this benefit would have their benefits reduced by \n     thousands of dollars over their remaining lifetimes . . . The \n     American Legion understands the need to restore fiscal \n     discipline, but it should not be done by reneging on this \n     country's promises to its veterans who already have earned \n     these benefits through their service to country . . . For \n     these veterans and their families, reducing the current COLA \n     represents real sacrifice . . . We ask you not to do harm to \n     those who have already sacrificed so much for this great \n     nation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the American Legion letter in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Let me also quote a letter I received from the Executive Director of \nthe Disabled American Veterans--DAV, Barry Jesinoski:\n\n       On behalf of all disabled veterans and their families, we \n     stand with you in firm opposition to the application of the \n     chained CPI to disability and pension payments for veterans, \n     dependents and survivors of veterans. In recent years, it has \n     become apparent that even the current COLA has failed to meet \n     the rising costs faced by disabled veterans, their dependents \n     and survivors. Lowering VA benefit payments using a new \n     formula designed to reduce federal spending at large seems an \n     unconscionable policy and would threaten their financial \n     security and must be rejected. America's heroes deserve \n     better from a grateful and caring nation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the DAV letter in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  Let me also quote from a letter I received in opposition to the \nchained CPI from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, the Blinded Veterans Association, Gold Star Wives, the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, \nand several other veterans' groups, in one letter. They came together \nand here is what this letter says:\n\n       As efforts to address our nation's debt continue, we are \n     writing to express our opposition to changing the formula \n     used to calculate the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) \n     because of the harmful effects it will have on veterans and \n     Social Security benefits. We agree that political leaders \n     need to restore fiscal discipline, but we believe it should \n     be done with great care and without reneging on this \n     country's promises to veterans, including the promises of \n     Social Security and VA disability compensation and pension \n     benefits--all of which are modest in size. Many veterans who \n     rely on these programs live on fixed incomes and very tight \n     budgets. For them, every dollar of hard-earned benefits \n     counts in meeting basic expenses, attaining quality of life, \n     and building\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\n     a better future for themselves and those who depend on them. \n     For many of them, reducing the annual COLA would mean real \n     sacrifice. We ask that you not do that for those who have \n     already sacrificed so much for this great country.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  So here we are. We are in this deficit situation because of wars that \nwere unpaid for, tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, \nMedicare Part D not paid for, and a recession caused by Wall Street. \nNow we have folks who are saying we have a serious deficit problem. I \nagree.\n  The way we are doing it is to make devastating cuts on the backs of \nsome of the most vulnerable people in this country, including disabled \nvets and including people who receive Social Security and disability \nbenefits. I do not think that is the moral thing to do. I do not think \nthat is the economically appropriate thing to do.\n  When you have one out of four major corporations, huge corporations, \nprofitable corporations paying zero in taxes; when the corporate tax \nrate today, the effective corporate tax rate is the lowest it has been \nin decades; when the gap between the very wealthy and everybody else is \ngrowing wider; there are ways to do deficit reduction that are fair.\n  I will do everything I can to make sure that as we go forward with \ndeficit reduction we do it in a way that is fair and not on the backs \nof some of the most vulnerable people in this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 12, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, Speaker Boehner, and \n     Leader Pelosi: As efforts to address our nation's debt \n     continue, we are writing to express our opposition to \n     changing the formula used to calculate the annual cost of \n     living adjustment (COLA) because of the harmful effects it \n     will have on veterans and Social Security benefits.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that adopting the \n     chained consumer price index (CPI) to calculate annual COLAs \n     could save the government $208 billion over ten years by \n     reducing Social Security, disability, and other benefits, and \n     by increasing revenues. More than half of this amount--$112 \n     billion--would come from Social Security cuts, which veterans \n     rely on very heavily for both retirement and disability \n     benefits. Another 11 percent of the savings--$24 billion--\n     would come from VA benefits, civilian pensions, and military \n     retirement pay.\n       We estimate that use of the chained CPI would have a \n     significant effect on benefits that millions of veterans \n     depend on in the following ways:\n       Social Security Retirement Benefits: Social Security is one \n     of our nation's most important programs serving veterans and \n     their dependents and survivors. It currently pays benefits to \n     over 9 million veterans--about 4 in 10. The average \n     retirement benefit of a veteran receiving Social Security was \n     about $15,500 in 2010. Adopting the chained CPI would \n     significantly reduce those benefits, by changing the manner \n     in which COLAs are determined. A veteran with average \n     earnings retiring at age 65 would get nearly a $600 benefit \n     cut at age 75, and a $1,000 cut at age 85. By age 95, when \n     Social Security benefits are probably needed the most, that \n     veteran would face a cut of $1,400--a reduction of 9.2 \n     percent.\n       Not only would a Social Security COLA cut hurt veterans and \n     their families; it is also misguided policy. Social Security \n     is self-financed by the contributions of workers and \n     employers. In effect, it belongs to its contributors. It is \n     separate from the rest of the budget. To use it to reduce the \n     federal deficit, which it did not cause, or effectively to \n     fund other parts of the government or to help maintain tax \n     breaks unrelated to Social Security, is to break the promise \n     of Social Security.\n       VA Disability Compensation Benefits: Veterans are generally \n     eligible for VA disability compensation benefits if they \n     become disabled due to injuries or illnesses sustained \n     during, or as a result of, military service. There were 3.2 \n     million veterans receiving these benefits in 2010. A veteran \n     receiving VA disability compensation due to a service-\n     connected disability rated at 100 percent is currently \n     entitled to receive $33,288 a year. Under the chained CPI, \n     which is a cut in the formula traditionally used to determine \n     the COLA for VA benefits, a disabled veteran who started \n     receiving benefits at age 30 would have their benefits \n     reduced by $1,425 at age 45, $2,341 at age 55 and $3,231 at \n     age 65.\n       VA Pension Benefits: Veterans with low incomes who are \n     either permanently and totally disabled, or age 65 and older, \n     may be eligible for pension benefits if they served during a \n     period of war. More than 310,000 veterans received VA pension \n     benefits in 2010. The current benefit for a veteran is just \n     $12,256 a year. Under the chained CPI, VA pension benefits \n     for veterans aged 65 and older living in poverty would be \n     reduced by $353 at age 75, $696 at age 85 and $1,029 at age \n     95.\n       Social Security and veterans' benefits need to be based on \n     an accurate measure of inflation. The current COLA formula \n     understates the true cost-of-living increases faced by \n     seniors and people with disabilities because it does not take \n     into account their higher share of spending devoted to health \n     care, and that health care prices rise much more rapidly than \n     overall prices. Although veterans who have service-connected \n     disabilities and those receiving pension benefits are \n     eligible for VA health care, they may still be impacted by \n     rising out-of-pocket health care costs. Adopting the chained \n     CPI would make the situation worse.\n       Instead, Social Security and VA benefits should be based on \n     a formula that takes account of these higher health care \n     costs called the CPI-E (Experimental CPI for the Elderly) \n     developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI-E rises \n     at a slightly faster rate than the formula currently used to \n     calculate the COLA, and at a still faster rate than the \n     proposed chained CPI, providing a modestly more generous COLA \n     for seniors and people with disabilities.\n       We agree that political leaders need to restore fiscal \n     discipline, but we believe it should be done with great care \n     and without reneging on this country's promises to veterans, \n     including the promises of Social Security and VA disability \n     compensation and pension benefits--all of which are modest in \n     size. Many veterans who rely on these programs live on fixed \n     incomes and very tight budgets. For them, every dollar of \n     hard-earned benefits counts in meeting basic expenses, \n     attaining quality of life, and building a better future for \n     themselves and those who depend on them.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, Speaker Boehner, and \n     Leader Pelosi: As efforts to address our nation's debt \n     continue, we understand many proposals and policies are being \n     reviewed. One proposal appears to be the changing of the \n     formula used to calculate the annual cost of living \n     adjustment (COLA) that affects Social Security and other \n     beneficiaries, including many veterans. On behalf of the 2.4 \n     million members of The American Legion I voice our opposition \n     to this proposal because of the harmful effects it will have \n     on veterans' and Social Security benefits.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates adopting the \n     chained consumer price index (CPI) to calculate annual COLAs \n     could save the government $208 billion over ten years by \n     reducing payments of Social Security, disability, and other \n     benefits. More than half of this amount--$112 billion--would \n     come from Social Security cuts, which many veterans rely on \n     for both retirement and disability benefits. Another 11 \n     percent of the savings--$24 billion--would come from \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, civilian \n     pensions, and military retired pay. The American Legion \n     opposes the use of the chained CPI because using it would \n     have significant deleterious effects on the benefits millions \n     of veterans depend on in the following ways:\n       Social Security Retirement Benefits: Adopting the chained \n     CPI significantly reduces these benefits by changing the \n     manner in which COLAs are determined. Not only would a Social \n     Security COLA cut hurt veterans, their families, and their \n     survivors; it is misguided public policy. Social Security is \n     financed by the contributions of our members and their \n     employers. In effect, it belongs to its contributors. It is \n     separate from the rest of the budget. To use it to reduce the \n     federal deficit, which it did not cause,\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\n     breaks the promise of Social Security and it could have \n     harmful effects on the recruitment and retention of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       VA Service-connected Disability Compensation: Veterans are \n     eligible for VA service-connected disability compensation if \n     they become disabled due to injuries or illnesses incurred \n     during, or as a result of, military service. Under the \n     chained CPI, which cuts the formula used to determine the \n     COLA for VA benefits, disabled veterans who receive this \n     benefit would have their benefits reduced by thousands of \n     dollars over their remaining life times.\n       VA Pension Benefits: Veterans with low incomes who are \n     permanently and totally disabled, or are age 65 and older, \n     may be eligible for pension benefits if they served during a \n     period of war. Under the chained CPI, VA pension benefits for \n     veterans aged 65 and older living in poverty would be reduced \n     over their remaining life times.\n       Social Security and veterans' benefits do need to be based \n     on an accurate measure of inflation. The current COLA formula \n     already understates the true cost-of-living increases faced \n     by seniors and people with disabilities because it does not \n     take into account their higher share of spending devoted to \n     health care, and health care prices rise more rapidly than \n     overall prices. Even though veterans who have service-\n     connected disabilities and those receiving pension benefits \n     are eligible for VA health care, they will still be impacted \n     by rising out-of-pocket health care costs not covered by the \n     VA. Adopting the chained CPI would make their situations much \n     worse over time.\n       The American Legion understands the need to restore fiscal \n     discipline, but it should not be done by reneging on this \n     country's promises to its veterans who already have earned \n     these benefits through their service to country. For these \n     veterans and their families, reducing the current COLA \n     represents real sacrifice. We ask you not to do harm to those \n     who have already sacrificed so much for this great nation.\n       Thank you for your consideration. And thank you for what \n     you have done on behalf of the nation's servicemembers, \n     veterans, and their families and survivors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             James E. `Jim' Koutz,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          DAV,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2012.\n     Hon. Bernard Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of the DAV, a national \n     veterans service organization with 1.2 million members, all \n     of whom are wartime disabled veterans, I write to express our \n     strongest opposition to any attempts by Congress to replace \n     the current consumer price index (CPI) formula used for \n     calculating the annual Social Security cost-of-living \n     adjustment (COLA) with the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \n     new formula commonly termed the ``chained CPI.'' As you know, \n     the Social Security COLA is applied annually to the rates for \n     VA disability compensation, dependency and indemnity \n     compensation, and pensions for wartime veterans and survivors \n     with limited incomes. Since the chained CPI is specifically \n     intended to lower the annual Social Security COLA, its \n     application would mean systematic reductions for millions of \n     veterans, their dependents and survivors who rely on VA \n     benefit payments.\n       In recent years, it has become apparent that even the \n     current COLA has failed to meet the rising costs faced by \n     disabled veterans, their dependents and survivors. These men \n     and women are not traditional consumers of goods and services \n     in the U.S. economy; they are significantly older and suffer \n     disabilities at higher rates than average citizens across the \n     age range of residents of this country. In general, they are \n     heavy consumers of health care, both within the VA and DOD \n     systems, from Medicare and Medicaid, and from private sector \n     providers. The sickest and most infirm among them are \n     unemployable. They are substantial consumers of prescription \n     medications and other health aids. In many cases, they live \n     on fixed incomes and some must subsist on a single source of \n     income: their monthly government disability or pension \n     payment. The current COLA does not even take into account the \n     rising costs of food or fuel. Lowering VA benefit payments \n     using a new formula designed to reduce federal spending at \n     large seems an unconscionable policy and would threaten their \n     financial security and must be rejected. In addition, we urge \n     you to examine whether there are better, more appropriate \n     indexes that recognize the uniqueness of this population's \n     needs and consumption patterns.\n       Furthermore, these millions of disabled veterans, \n     dependents and survivors suffer the additional indignity of \n     the novel ``rounding down'' policy Congress imposed in 1991 \n     as a ``temporary'' means to lower the federal deficit in \n     fiscal year 1992 by reducing the annual COLA increase to the \n     next-lower dollar. Adding a chained CPI formula to this \n     reduction of benefits would serve to lower their standard of \n     living even more, an ironic reversal of the very purposes of \n     these payments.\n       On behalf of all disabled veterans and their families, we \n     stand with you in firm opposition to the application of the \n     chained CPI to disability and pension payments for veterans, \n     dependents and survivors of veterans. America's heroes \n     deserve better from a grateful and caring nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Barry Jesinoski,\n                                                Executive Director\n                                          Washington Headquarters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will be yielding to Senator Thune, \none of the experienced former members of the Budget Committee. He will \nbe sharing his thoughts. I would say to my colleagues, we have been \nhearing that the Democratic plan is a balanced approach. It is \nbalanced, but it is not a balanced budget. What we need is a balanced \nbudget. That means the amount of money that comes in is the same as the \namount of money that goes out.\n  We can do that and increase spending every single year by 3.4 \npercent. This is very doable. It does not require the slashing of \nspending on every important account that we care about in Washington. \nThat is what we are here for, and the administration, the Cabinet \nSecretaries and so forth, they will make sure the limited amount of \nmoney any government has is wisely spent. Therefore, we are not talking \nabout devastating cuts. We are talking about better management and \nworking with how to grow spending over the next 10 years--growing \nspending over the next 10 years by 3.4 percent, not at 5.4 percent. \nThat balances the budget even under the assumption of 2.5 percent \ninflation. It can be done. That is what the experts tell us, and that \nis the best estimate we have today.\n  The motion to recommit the budget is now on the floor--recommit to \nthe committee, with instructions that they decide what to do to alter \nit so that when it comes back it is balanced, a real balanced budget--\nnot a balanced plan, not a balanced approach, not some balanced \ntheory--but a real balanced budget. Presumably our colleagues think \nbalance is important because they have mentioned the word about 40 \ntimes. We have been counting them since we have been on the floor. I \nthink when we get to that vote we will be asking our colleagues: Do you \nreally want to achieve a balanced budget?\n  Senator Sanders said: We think you do not tax the rich enough. You \nneed to tax the rich more and more--as if taxing and punishing them \nwill fix the problem of growth in this economy that is truly too slow. \nWe are having the slowest recovery in our Nation's history, at least \nsince World War II. So we do not have a good recovery coming on. We \nneed to be talking about that.\n  But I guess my final statement is we do not need a balanced approach, \nwe need a balanced budget. There is a gulf of difference between the \ntwo.\n  The plan before us today raises taxes $1 trillion. They claim it cuts \nspending nearly $1 trillion and that it is a balanced approach: tax \nincreases, spending cuts, and deficit reduction. That is the message \nthat has been coming from the other side. Except it is not accurate. \nThis budget increases taxes by $1.5 trillion. It also increases \nspending. That is what it does.\n  We are concerned about that. The net result is there is no change, it \nseems to me--no change, a good analysis shows, in the debt course we \nare on.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Thune. It is now time to yield to him. I \nyield to Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator be yielding off the \nresolution or off the motion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. It will be yielding off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Blunt, to offer a couple of amendments that have been \nfiled and that I hope we get an opportunity to vote on before this \nprocess concludes. If you look at the base Democratic budget that has \nbeen put before us, it has large tax increases in it; in fact, up to \n$1.5 trillion in new taxes.\n  What we would attempt to do is to ensure that those taxes, higher \ntaxes, do not come by eliminating or capping the Federal tax deduction \nfor charitable giving. We have tens of millions of Americans mired in \npoverty, and government budgets are more constrained than ever before \nand what fills that gap is the charitable giving. It is the generosity \nof people around this country who keep organizations going that are \nproviding these essential and basic functions for many Americans.\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n  In fact, in 2011, Americans gave nearly $300 billion to support \ncharitable causes. This generosity not only helps to feed the hungry \nand clothe the needy, it has a real budgetary impact because this is an \ninstance where the private sector is fulfilling a need that would \notherwise have to be met by government spending.\n  Unfortunately, as we know, the White House has proposed limiting the \nvalue of itemized deductions for those earning above $200,000 for \nsingles, and $250,000 for married couples to 28 percent. Previous \nestimates were that this proposal would reduce charitable donations by \nup to $5.6 billion a year. As the Charitable Giving Coalition has \nrecently stated, that amounts to more than the annual budgets of the \nRed Cross, Goodwill, YMCA, Habitat for Humanity, the Boys and Girls \nClubs, Catholic Charities, and the American Cancer Society combined.\n  But even this impact understates the degree to which charitable \ngiving could be harmed under the White House proposal because we now \nhave a new baseline with a higher top income tax rate. A new study by \nthe American Enterprise Institute estimates that the President's \nitemized limitation under the new tax rates will lower total giving by \nindividuals by more than $9.4 billion per year.\n  We ought to be exploring new options to expand charitable giving \nrather than limiting the charitable donations in order to fund higher \nlevels of government spending. If we are going to explore any changes \nin the charitable deduction or any other tax provisions that we have in \nthe Tax Code today, it ought to be in the context of progrowth revenue-\nneutral tax reform, not as a way to pay for higher spending, which is \nwhat these proposals would do. I hope the vote on this amendment this \ntime around will be just as broadly bipartisan as the one I offered \nback in 2009, where we got 94 votes in support.\n  The second amendment will put the Senate on record in support of \neliminating the destructive Federal estate tax, better known as the \ndeath tax. That amendment I offer with the Senator from Missouri and \nseveral others of my colleagues.\n  I have long believed the Federal estate tax is an unnecessary, \ncounterproductive, and inefficient tax. More important, the death tax \nstrikes many of us as not simply being bad tax policy but a policy that \nruns counter to the very essence of the American free market system. \nThis is not a tax on rich fatcats, as some will claim. We already have \nan income tax, and it is one of the most progressive income taxes in \nthe developed world.\n  The death tax is different. It is a tax on success, a tax on assets \nthat have been accumulated through a lifetime of hard work and \ngenerated from income that was already taxed when it was earned. Many \nof these businesses are ``land rich and cash poor,'' meaning that the \nvalue of the business is in the land and in the business assets. These \nbusinesses do not have substantial liquid assets sitting around to pay \na second layer of tax that is imposed when a loved one passes way. As a \nresult, the death tax often requires that business assets are sold \nsimply to pay the tax.\n  Consider South Dakota, where we have seen farmland prices increased \nby over 50 percent in just the past 5 years. States such as Iowa, \nKansas, Missouri, Minnesota, and North Dakota have seen similar \nincreases.\n  Finally, my amendment will give farmers, ranchers, and family \nbusiness owners peace of mind, and it will do so in a deficit-neutral \nway. When we voted on a sense-of-the-Senate to eliminate the death tax \nin 2002, 11 Senate Democrats supported that, including a number of \nSenators who are still in the Senate today. Much has changed since \n2002, but I believe the death tax was a bad tax law then, and it \nremains so today. I hope to get a strong bipartisan vote on this as \nwell.\n  Before I shift to my colleague from Missouri, I simply want to say, \nas I have said before, that when we look at this budget process and the \nbudget proposal put before us by the Senate Democrats, the question we \nought to ask is, What does this do to promote economic growth? What \ndoes this do to create jobs? More than anything else, what we need in \nthis country is increased economic growth. Increased economic growth \nwill get the people who are unemployed back to work, which will \nincrease the take-home pay of middle-class Americans.\n  We have seen a sluggish economy, chronic high unemployment, and a \nmassive amount of debt over the past 4 years. It is time to chart a \ndifferent course, and the way to do that is to put policies in place \nthat will encourage economic growth. A $1.5 trillion tax increase is \nnot the way to do that, and we certainly do not want to take away the \nincentive people in this country have to continue to give out of the \ngenerosity of their hearts to our charitable organizations all across \nthe country.\n  It is also important that once and for all we get rid of the death \ntax, which is so punitive to people who work so hard and want to pass \nthat on to the next generation of Americans.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from Missouri, who, like me, \nrepresents a lot of farmers, ranchers, and hard-working small \nbusinesspeople for whom the tax issues are important. He will offer \ncomments on the impact of some of these tax policies and the impact \nsome of the budget proposals coming from the Senate Democrats would \nhave on the State of Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am glad to join Senator Thune in \nproposing these two important amendments and also to join him on the \noverall point on which we ought to be focused, which is economic \nopportunity and economic growth.\n  How do we get people onto the pathway of more opportunity for them \nand their families? Private sector job creation should be the No. 1 \ndomestic goal of America today. Frankly, it should be the No. 1 \ndomestic goal of everything we do.\n  When we are dealing with a budget or an appropriations bill that \ndeals with any kind of domestic policy, we ought to be thinking about \nhow this would impact private sector job creation. How does this impact \neconomic growth? How does this impact opportunity? What do we do to \nchange our society for the better and not the other way around?\n  Clearly, I think we all appreciate the fact that Americans are more \ngenerous in giving to religious organizations and charities than \nanybody else in the world. My belief is that there is no country that \ncomes anywhere close in charitable giving. It is not just the top \nearners in America who give money to charitable organizations, \nsometimes it is given by families who have to stretch the dollar to \nmake the contribution they want to make to their church that Sunday or \nto make the contribution they want to make to the Girl Scouts or Boy \nScouts activities or the YMCA or YWCA in their community. Nobody does \nthis the way we do it.\n  I am proud to join Senator Thune as he works on these issues. We have \nworked together for a long time, and Senator Thune has always been a \ncritical advocate for our charities as well as for families who work \nhard and create a small business or a family farm or ranch so they are \nable to pass it along to the next generation.\n  Let me first talk a little bit more about charities. The ability to \nvoluntarily come together and do things is provided in the first \namendment. It is not just an amendment that protects speech and \nreligion, but it protects association, it protects people who make \nthings happen in their community that otherwise would not happen.\n  Americans give like nobody else in the world. Every day our religious \ninstitutions, charities, hospitals, museums, and others come together \nto take private resources and meet a number of community needs which \nare met in the best possible way by people who are doing that through a \ncharitable effort. They help to feed the hungry, care for the sick, \nserve the poor, and contribute to all kinds of educational \ninstitutions.\n  Americans help by undertaking critical research and giving money that \ngoes to either help operate or actually support museums and parks. This \nis a small example of what Americans do because they give to charity, \nwhich is often done better than government bureaucracies; it is \ncheaper, more effective, more reasonable, and we need to do everything \nwe can to continue to do that.\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\n  In 2011 Americans gave nearly $300 billion to charitable causes, and \n75 percent of that giving was done by individuals. Of the 41 million \nAmerican households who itemize on their taxes--where they can \nspecifically see what they did--86 percent of those households take \nadvantage of the charitable contribution as they calculate their taxes.\n  The vast majority of people don't give to charities for tax breaks. I \nwas the president of a southern baptist university for 4 years before I \ncame to Congress. Every university president I know knows a little bit \nabout raising money, and every one of them knows that not every \ncontributor is motivated by the Tax Code, but the Tax Code has an \nimpact on whether they meet their goals. However, some contributors are \nconcerned, and the size of that contribution matters as it relates to \nhow they can leverage, frankly, the Tax Code in a way that makes it \neasier for them to give more to help take care of the things they care \nabout.\n  We want to be sure we are doing what we can as we try to grow the \neconomy, and an awful lot of our economy comes from the private sector. \nAbout 1 out of 10 jobs is in the charitable sector--1 out of 10 jobs is \nin the charitable sector. When we restrict that charitable sector, we \nrestrict people from doing what they would do otherwise.\n  Senator Thune mentioned $9 billion. Now, $9 billion of $300 billion, \ndoes that sound like a lot? It sounds like a lot to the kid who got the \nlast scholarship. It sounds like a lot for the park that doesn't get \nthe new playground equipment because the local Kiwanis club could not \nget to their goal so they could help their community. If we add \nup charitable contributions that anyone here gives to, in all \nlikelihood, collectively it would amount to less than $9 billion. So of \ncourse it makes a difference, and it is a difference in whether or not \nthey get there. The nonprofit sector employs 1 out of 10 U.S. workers \nand provides almost 14 million jobs and paid almost $600 billion in \nwages and benefits. It is about exactly the same in our State.\n\n  This is a part of who we are that we don't want to discourage. There \nis a reason Americans give more generously to charitable causes than \nanybody else in the world. Let's not walk away from that.\n  This amendment will ensure that the limits on charitable giving that \nare in place in the budget of the majority don't go toward just more \ngovernment spending. If we want to have a discussion about how we might \ncut tax rates and encourage the economy, that is one thing, but if the \ndiscussion is to discourage people from giving to charities so there \nwill be more money for government to spend, I just say that is the \nwrong discussion to have.\n  We should not increase government spending at the expense of \nAmerica's churches and charities. And, of course, the death tax, small \nbusinesses, family farms, ranches have all paid taxes on everything \nthey have. Lots of times they pay taxes on everything they have, such \nas the income tax and the annual property tax.\n  Everybody can think of 1 example, if not 100, of the family who works \nside by side. Frankly, by the time parents leave this Earth, it is \nreally hard to determine who created the wealth. Was it Mom and Dad or \nwas it the son or daughter who was standing right there beside them in \nthe grocery store every day or working with them on the family farm or \nranch?\n  In our State of Missouri, we have more than 100,000 individual farms. \nIt is the second highest number of farms in America. We do not have the \nbiggest farms and ranches in America, but we have more of them than any \nother State but for one. Those individuals and families have done what \nthey could to try to create opportunity and a livelihood, and they \nwould like to pass that along. What is wrong with that?\n  Clearly, the point we are at right now with the tax at the time of \ndeath is better than it has been in a while--I suppose not better than \nthe 1 year there was no death tax. For 1 year we had no death tax, and \nthat is the ideal that government should try to achieve again.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Thune in this effort. I hope we will do \nwhat we can to encourage families who have businesses that they can \npass along without having death as a taxable event. There are plenty of \ntaxable events in life without having death as a taxable event.\n  I again thank Senator Thune for his long advocacy of eliminating this \nunfairness in our Tax Code. I have been glad to join him in debate \nafter debate over the years on this issue. Let's not move toward \nthinking we are doing the right thing by doing the wrong thing as it \nrelates to family farms and business.\n  I also want to say as I conclude that I am going to be offering an \namendment on the carbon tax as well. We should not have a carbon tax \nbecause the carbon tax that is anticipated in some of the language of \nthis budget raises utility bills. Who is impacted most by a higher \nutility bill? It is the most vulnerable among us. It is the family who \nis the last family to get the new refrigerator, it is the family who is \nthe last family to get the better insulated windows, it is the family \nwho is the last family to get more insulation in their ceiling. All of \nthe things we do that raise utility bills have a real impact on them \njust like whenever we are doing anything that raises costs, such as \ngasoline prices. The last person or family to get the fuel-efficient \ncar is the one who can least afford to see what happens to their \nutility bill or their gasoline costs. I am opposed to this kind of tax \nbeing passed along to people who have a hard enough time paying their \nutility bill.\n  So whether it is the carbon tax or the death tax or a tax on \ncharitable giving, let's not do the wrong thing for the sake of more \ngovernment spending. Let's do the right thing for jobs and American \nfamilies.\n  I ask through the Chair if Senator Thune has anything he wants to say \nin conclusion on these amendments.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri. He \nhas a great deal of experience. As he said, we worked together on these \nissues for a long time. We both recognize the importance of economic \ngrowth. We see a budget put before us by the Senate Democrats that \ngrows the government and not the economy. We believe the focus should \nbe on growing the economy, not the government. The amendments we \noffered have that thought in mind.\n  There are other colleagues who are here to speak to the basic budget \nproposal the Democrats have put forward and talk about some of the \namendments they intend to offer.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I see we have Senator Vitter of \nLouisiana ready to speak. I ask unanimous consent that their time be \ntaken off the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor on this budget \ndebate and will specifically highlight several amendments that I am \npresenting that will be voted on in the context of the debate. We \naddress several provisions that I think are important as we vote on \nmoving forward with the budget.\n  One issue is a reform idea. It is very simple, but it is very basic, \nand I think it is important in terms of our leading through these \nfiscally tough times; that is, ending automatic pay raises for Members \nof Congress. I am joined in this amendment by Senator McCaskill of \nMissouri, and I thank her for her leadership. There is existing Federal \nlaw that establishes automatic pay raises for Members of Congress. We \ndon't have to put in a bill, we don't have to debate the measure on the \nfloor, much less vote. I think that is offensive to the American \npeople, particularly in tough economic times such as these.\n\n  To Congress's credit, we have passed stopgap legislation to refuse \npay raises since 2009, but we need to go the next legitimate step. We \nneed to end all automatic pay raises and have the courage, if it is \never justified over time with inflation, to put in a proposal, to \ndebate it, to vote on it, not to have automatic pay raises for Members \nof Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  A second amendment would require photographic IDs for voting in \nFederal elections. This is largely provoked by the actions of the Obama \nadministration's Justice Department which has been fighting States that \nare trying to institute photo IDs. That is allowed under Federal law, \nand several States\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nare doing that and doing it properly, including Texas and South \nCarolina, but this Justice Department is trying to shut that down, even \nthough it is allowed by Federal law. Interestingly, that assault on \nStates trying to do their job, trying to do things properly, has been \nmade by the head of the Civil Rights Division at Justice, Thomas Perez, \nwho is now nominated for a Cabinet position--Labor Secretary. This \namendment and this proposal would clarify it by actually requiring \nphoto IDs for voting in Federal elections.\n  We require photo IDs for traveling in airports. We require photo IDs \nfor going into a conference. We require photo IDs for a myriad of \nthings, including visiting the White House. Surely it is a very \nlegitimate, simple requirement that doesn't disenfranchise anyone to \nmake sure the integrity of our election system is preserved. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Third, another amendment I will bring would finally require the US-\nVISIT system to be properly and fully executed and put in place. The \nUS-VISIT system, as the Presiding Officer knows, is an entry and exit \ncontrol system to track foreign nationals who are properly visiting our \ncountry with visas, so it tracks them as they come in and go out, and \nif they don't go out in time, if they overstay their visa, it brings up \na red flag that is sent to law enforcement officials.\n  This is not a small matter because, as we all remember, the 9/11 \nterrorists overstayed their visas. A proper US-VISIT system would have \ntracked that, would have caught them, would have done something about \nit. There has been a crying need since at least 1996. In 1996, Congress \npassed legislation that mandated the executive branch, within 2 years, \nestablish this sort of system. Of course, it wasn't done in time for 9/\n11. After 9/11, the 9/11 Commission specifically went back and \nrecommended that we get on this, that we finish the work, that we fully \nestablish the US-VISIT system. It said:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by \n     the Congress, should complete as quickly as possible a \n     biometric entry/exit screening system.\n\n  Yet, even now, over a decade after 9/11, 12 years after 9/11, we \ndon't have that system fully in place. We need that system, and this \namendment would not just mandate the system but it would say that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security cannot grant legal status to those \nillegally present within the United States until we all comply with \nFederal law relating to the entry and exit data system required under \nthe law originally passed in 1996.\n  In the context of immigration reform, I don't think we should \nconsider granting legal status to those here illegally until we have \nthis US-VISIT system, which is an absolutely essential component of \nenforcement.\n  A fourth amendment I have that we will be voting on over the next few \ndays is in support of the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act. This \namendment would support that act and express the sense of the Senate \nthat Congress should enact it. What does that act do? It provides that \nwhoever knowingly performs an abortion that is sought based on sex or \ngender selection would be guilty of violating the law. So it prohibits \ndiscriminating against the unborn in the form of abortion sex \nselection.\n  A lot of folks don't realize it, but, again, this is not a \ntheoretical issue. This, unfortunately, is an ongoing practice. There \nare at least four studies from universities--not from ultraconservative \nthink tanks; UC-Berkeley is not a conservative think tank, University \nof Connecticut, Columbia University--there are at least four studies \nthat found there is a strong son bias within certain American \ncommunities, a bias toward having sons, not daughters. These studies \nsay that is ``clear evidence of sex-selection, most likely at the \nprenatal stage.''\n  That is sort of academic speak. What does it mean? It means that \nparents are selecting and using abortion to that outcome. It is always \nselection against women, against girl babies, in favor of sons. That is \noutrageous and it is tragic. We need to follow other countries that \nhave prohibited this practice.\n  Other countries--the United Kingdom, India, China--have enacted these \nsorts of bans. The medical community, including the American Congress \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of \nReproductive Medicine, and the President's own Council on Bioethics, \nhave all condemned sex selection abortions.\n  In 2007, the United States even spearheaded a resolution to condemn \nthese sorts of sex selection abortions at the United Nations Commission \non the Status of Women. Yet we are doing nothing about it in this \ncountry. So we should start doing something about this horrible \npractice in this country. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Fifth and finally, I will have an amendment with regard to China, \nIndia, and Russia, and greenhouse gas regulation. The amendment and the \nidea are very simple. It creates a point of order against funding for \ngreenhouse gas regulations until the administration can certify that \nChina, India, and Russia are similarly implementing greenhouse gas \nregulations to reduce their own emissions.\n  There are big disagreements and debates about global warming, climate \nchange, greenhouse gas regulation. I wish to forego all that and put it \nto the side. No matter what one thinks about that--causes and effects, \ntrend lines, or lack of trend lines--one thing is perfectly clear and \nbeyond dispute; that is, whatever the United States does is irrelevant \nif major players globally, such as China and India and Russia, don't do \nthe same. Clearly, our action is irrelevant unless all three of those \ncountries do the same. China has just surpassed the United States as \nthe world's largest producer of CO2. China now produces more \nthan the United States and Canada combined. India is now the world's \nthird largest offender of CO2, and Russia is fourth. So \nunless these three countries adopt some sort of similar regime, our \nactions do zero in terms of the environment. But our actions would do a \nlot in terms of costing us jobs, killing jobs, and suppressing economic \ngrowth.\n  This is a very commonsense regulation. It shouldn't matter what one \nthinks about climate change with regard to how a Senator votes, \nbecause, again, our actions will have zero effect if China, India, and \nRussia are not taking similar action. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Sessions' \nmotion to recommit on a balanced budget. I think it is important that \nwe have a balanced plan before us, as we have talked about a lot today, \nbut that means balancing the budget, just as we ought to do in our \nfamilies and people have to do in their businesses. States all around \nthe country have to do it. Local governments have to do it.\n  Let's stop spending more than we take in. We can do it over time and \nwithout making the kind of severe cuts that were alleged earlier. We \ncan do it by growing the economy and restraining spending. So I am \nhappy to stand in support of that.\n  I stand here because I am worried about where we are headed. Our debt \nnow is about $140,000 per household. Think about that. For all of the \nfolks watching today, on average, $140,000 is what every household in \nAmerica owes on this debt. This is now something that, in my view, can \nput us in a perilous situation. Our economy is already weak and we have \nthis huge debt and deficit, which is something that worries me. I think \nour country is in trouble.\n  The Democrats have a proposal. Their budget is before us now and this \nis what we are talking about. It adds another $7 trillion to that debt. \nIt actually doesn't deal with our budget problems. In fact, it actually \nmakes them worse, which I will talk about soon.\n  Let me for a minute, if I could, talk about where we are. There is a \nlot of discussion on the floor about, Gosh, we need to raise more \nrevenue and how this is not about spending; it is about taxes. \nRepublicans are saying, No, the problem is spending. Let me explain why \nwe are saying that. It is arithmetic. It is math. It is what the \nnumbers show.\n  This is from the Congressional Budget Office. This is the nonpartisan \ngroup\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nhere in Congress that tells us how much we are spending, how much \nrevenue we are bringing in, and then they make a projection. They did \nthis about 3 years ago. They said, Here is where we are heading as a \ncountry. Here is where we are now. Tax revenue is the blue line and \nspending is the red line. By their projections, by 2015, a couple of \nyears from now, we are going to be back up above the historical levels.\n  Historically, taxes have been about 18 percent of the economy, and \nthat is the way economists like to look at it: What is the percentage \nof the economy? Revenue has been about 20 percent. So here is 18 \npercent and here is 20 percent. This has been the average.\n  What they are saying is, actually it gets up to just over 19 percent \nin a couple of years, by 2015, and then stays up above the historical \naverage over the next decade. In fact, what they tell us is that over \nthe next decade we are going to have the second highest amount of \nrevenue that we have had in the history of our country except for one \nother decade.\n  So when we say it is spending, that is the issue. It is because the \nrevenue which, as we know, impacts the economy--the more revenue we \ntake out of the economy the harder it is for the private sector to get \nahead and to create jobs. We are saying, by the projections of this \nnonpartisan group, they are going to be slightly above the average.\n  The problem is spending. What they tell us is that in a few decades--\nhere is 2040--spending is going to get so high that there is no way to \ncatch up to it with taxes. We can't even do it under the income tax \nsystem. It is impossible.\n  Why do we say spending is a problem? Because if we don't deal with \nthis issue, our kids and grandkids are not going to have the economic \nfuture we hope for them. The prosperity of this country will go down \nthe drain because this spending level will make it impossible to create \nprosperity. That is the issue before us today. Yet, again, we have a \nbudget before us that, unfortunately, doesn't address that issue. In \nfact, I would argue that it makes it worse.\n  Some have said, Gosh, we ought to be increasing taxes $1 for every $1 \nof spending reductions. What I would say to that is pretty simple. This \nline here is about 19 percent of the economy. That is the revenue line. \nAnd that is very close to the historical spending line, which is about \n20 percent. So let's take 19 percent as the revenue line. The \nDemocrats, who have talked today on the floor about $1 of revenue for \nevery $1 of spending cuts, what do they mean by that? Well, this is 39 \npercent up here, here is 19 percent. So if we take $1 from each as a \npercent of the GDP, it would go to about this line here. Where is that? \nWell, 19 and 39, it is about 29 percent. What does 29 percent mean? \nThat means we would have a government bigger than we have ever had in \nthe history of this country. Again, the average has been about 20 \npercent in this country. That means we would have to have huge tax \nincreases to get to balance. Nobody on this floor, Democrat or \nRepublican, is talking about tax increases of that magnitude.\n  Why? Because that would be about doubling the taxes in this country. \nSo everybody listening today would be looking at their taxes and \nsaying: My gosh, my taxes just went up by 100 percent. That is what \nthat would mean. It would mean the biggest government in the history of \nour country, so the scope and the size of government would grow.\n  So when you hear ``1 to 1,'' I hope you will just think about it in \nterms of what does this mean based on these projections that have been \ngiven to us by this nonpartisan group. It means a different country. It \nmeans a much bigger government. It means a much bigger burden of \ntaxation. It means we end up not looking like the entrepreneurial, \ninnovative America that has been on the cutting edge and has created \nthe greatest economy on the face of the Earth.\n  That is our concern. That is why we say we have to deal with the \nspending. It is pretty simple. Again, it is really a question of math.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Portman is such a valuable member of the Budget \nCommittee. He served as the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. He knows how this situation works.\n  But that dotted line on the chart, it is just spending, isn't it? It \nis spending as a percentage of the American economy. So in some sense \nthat surging upward line of spending is even worse than at first glance \nit might appear.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. That is true. This chart is as a percent of the GDP. So, \nlook, we all want the economy to grow. Actually, they projected it will \ngrow under the Congressional Budget Office analysis. Even so, that \ngrowth in the economy cannot keep up with this great surge in spending.\n  So other folks have said on the floor over the last 24 hours: Well, \ngosh, let's go back to the Simpson-Bowles 3-to-1 ratio, where you have \n$3 in spending cuts for every $1 of revenue. That is what Erskine \nBowles testified before the supercommittee on, that that was what their \nrevenue was, $1 of revenue for every $3 in spending cuts.\n  That is also not what this budget does, this underlying budget, \nbecause it actually increases taxes dramatically. Even under their own \ncalculus, again, it is 1 to 1. We have looked at it. We think the tax \nincrease is between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion in this budget. So it \nis the biggest tax increase in the history of the country.\n  What does $1 trillion mean--or $1.5 trillion? Well, it means that you \nare going to have to tax a lot of people other than rich people. I \nwould refer you to an economic expert on this, a guy named Gene \nSperling, who is down at the White House, who talks about these \neconomic issues a lot. Here is what Gene Sperling said about raising $1 \ntrillion. He said you cannot do it without hurting middle-class \nfamilies. This is his quote:\n\n       [A] careful look at the math of these types of caps and \n     limits [on tax preferences] shows that, once one takes into \n     account the reality of their impact on the middle-class \n     families and on charitable donation, plausible limits raise \n     only a fraction of the $1 trillion or more some have \n     suggested.\n\n  It is just too much to raise without going to the folks who are \nmaking less than $200,000 a year, less than $100,000, less than \n$50,000. So I would just suggest today that we have a problem in this \ncountry. It is a spending problem. Yes, we want to get the economy \nmoving, and that will create more revenue. But we have to address that \nissue and, unfortunately, the budget before us does not do it.\n  In addition to having these huge tax increases--the biggest in the \nhistory of our country--this budget also has huge spending. The \nspending is actually an increase. When you wipe away the gimmicks that \nare in the budget that they have proposed--and we have talked a lot \nabout OCO. That just means the spending in Afghanistan. They project \nthat all this spending is going to occur that nobody expects is going \nto occur, so because it does not, they say, well, that is a savings. \nThen you are going to be able to spend more to make up for that.\n  Well, we are going to spend some more in Afghanistan. We all \nunderstand that. But we are not going to spend as much as the CBO \nprojects. So those savings are not real, unfortunately. That is in \ntheir budget. That is a gimmick.\n  They also say: Let's do away with this so-called sequester. This is \nthe thing that the Budget Control Act put in place. The Budget Control \nAct said: Let's find these savings of $1.2 trillion in spending. Yet in \nthis budget, they say: No, let's replace that. So you have to add that \nas well because instead of $1.2 trillion, they are saying half of that \nis going to be new taxes. So that is less spending cuts.\n  So when you add all that up, and when you wipe all that away, it \nlooks like the spending increases are about $900 billion over the next \ndecade. So despite all these problems, we are talking about a huge \nspending increase.\n  Now, let's just talk for a second about what the spending increase is \non. Here is the debt chart I have in the Chamber that shows the debt \nclimbing to $24 trillion over the next 10 years, under the Murray \nbudget, under the Democratic budget we are talking about today. But \nwhat is the problem? Well, we are starting to do more to get the \ndiscretionary spending under control. That means the spending that \nCongress appropriates every year.\n  But when you think about the budget as kind of a pie, 62 percent of \nthat\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\nbudget--the biggest piece of that pie--is not spending that Congress \nappropriates every year. Congress does not do it because it is on \nautopilot. That is interest on the debt that you have to spend; and \nthen it is the very important, vital entitlement programs--Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security--but that are not sustainable in their \ncurrent form.\n  By the way, everybody agrees with that. The President talks about it \npublicly. Everybody talks about it privately. But the fact is, these \nprograms are incredibly important. We want to ensure that they can \ncontinue into the future. That is why we need reform--to preserve and \nprotect them. Yet, unbelievably, this budget before us does absolutely \nnothing there. In fact, when you add up the changes on the entitlement \nprograms over the next 10 years--which, again, is the biggest reason \nfor these huge spending increases; in fact, as a percent of GDP, it is \nthe only reason--all of the spending increases are because of those \nentitlement programs and interest on the debt, all of them as a percent \nof the GDP, all of them. Yet this budget does not touch it. In fact, it \nslightly increases spending as compared to the CBO baseline, as \ncompared to what we are going to do anyway that the Congressional \nBudget Office just told us about.\n  That, to me, is the most amazing part of the budget. It is the \nresponsible thing to do. Again, the President has talked about it. \nMembers of both parties acknowledge this. We have to deal with this \nissue. If we do not, we are not going to be able to have these programs \ngoing forward.\n  Under their budget, the disability fund in Social Security--and a lot \nof people rely on disability--runs out of money in 2016.\n\n  Under their budget, the Medicare trust fund itself goes bankrupt in \n2024.\n  Under their budget, Social Security's fund for senior citizens would \ngo bankrupt in 2033, to the point that under law--remember this is just \n20 years from now--a 25-percent benefit cut would be put in place.\n  That is what this budget would lead to. So it is hard for me to take \nit very seriously as a budget. It is, I guess, more of a political \ndocument.\n  The final thing I will say is, if we do this, if we go down this path \nof more spending next year, more spending the next year, huge increases \nin spending and taxes over the next 10 years, we will not only have a \nbudget that is out of control--and, as I said earlier, risk us having a \nmeltdown in terms of our economy because of a potential crisis we could \nhave, like has happened in southern Europe; Greece is a country people \ntalk about--but think about what it does to our economy.\n  This huge overhang of debt and deficits everybody now acknowledges is \nbad for the economy. Some people think it is worse than others think. \nBut if you look at these studies--the Rogoff-Reinhart study has been \ntalked about on the floor. I know that is the one that says, when you \nget to the level we are at now, you lose about 1 million jobs per year.\n  Well, something is happening in our economy, and I think a lot of \nit--the negative part of it--is because of this debt and deficit. We \nare living through the worst economic recovery since the 1940s. All of \nus are discouraged by it, Democrats and Republicans alike. The average \ngrowth rate was less than 1 percent over the last 4 years, and that is \nnot acceptable to any of us. We have to deal with this issue because it \nis the right thing to do for our kids and our grandkids, as we have \ntalked about, the right thing to do for these programs so they are \nviable and their trust funds do not go insolvent, but also for today's \neconomy. If we do not deal with this issue we are not going to have \npeople taking the risk, making the investment.\n  There are companies making money out there. Do you know what they are \ndoing with it? They are keeping it on the sidelines because they are \nafraid of this, because they see this coming. They are worried about \nmaking the investments. That is how we are going to create the jobs.\n  Right now, in the weakest economy we have had in a long time--and the \nworst economic recovery since the 1940s--we are looking at unemployment \nnumbers that are unacceptably high. We are looking at a place such as \nOhio where we have a struggle with manufacturing. We are trying to get \nback on our feet. We are looking for economic growth again. We are not \ngoing to get it unless we deal with this issue.\n  The Heritage Foundation has looked at this budget, and they have done \nan analysis of it in terms of its impact on jobs, on the economy. They \nhave said the budget will result in losing 800,000 jobs in our country. \nIn my State of Ohio, they said we will lose 40,000 jobs. We cannot \nafford to lose 40,000 more jobs.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--which I mentioned \nearlier and is the group in Congress that advises us on the economy--\nhas said this new debt will reduce long-term economic growth and cost \njobs.\n  So, ultimately, this is about a choice. Do we want to expand \ngovernment or do we want to expand the economy? Do we want to create \nthe opportunity to get the private economy moving or do we want to grow \nthe size and scope of government?\n  We have a fundamental choice to make in this Chamber with regard to \nthis budget today. I am hopeful we will be able to amend the budget so \nwe can take out some of the taxes and the spending and the borrowing, \nso that it is better for the economy. Even if we cannot prevail--and if \nthis budget passes over the next couple days here--I still hope, as a \nCongress, working with the President, we can address this issue.\n  Once this budget debate is behind us on the floor, I hope we can sit \ndown as Republicans and Democrats alike, as Americans, acknowledging \nthat if we do not deal with spending, we cannot get this economy back \non track, acknowledging that trying to tax, spend, and borrow your way \nto prosperity does not work. We tried it. We have seen the results.\n  We have also seen the opposite, over time, through the great history \nof this country. The time-honored principles that have made us this \ncutting-edge economy, that have made us the envy of the world, relied \non entrepreneurship, innovation, keeping taxes low, keeping government \nspending under control, and encouraging the private sector to do what \nthey do best, which is, to create jobs. This is why I oppose this \nbudget. This is why I also support a better way, to bring back the jobs \nand get our country back on track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, there has been a complete abdication of \nfiscal responsibility in Congress, particularly in the Senate, for the \nlast 4 years, in that there has been no budget passed in this Senate \nfor that period of time. What better manifestation, what uglier \nmanifestation of that fiscal irresponsibility than the $16.5 trillion \nin debt.\n  Another symptom of that problem is the fact that in addition to the \nSenate not passing a budget for the last 4 years, in 4 out of the last \n5 years, the President of the United States has missed the statutory \ndeadline on submitting his proposed budget to the Senate for \nconsideration and to the Congress.\n  Really, when we are talking about budgeting, the House is going to \npass a budget that limits the rate of growth of Federal spending from \n5.4 percent to 3.4 percent. It limits the rate of growth. Now, most of \nAmerica would not call that a cut. But for some reason that is called a \ncut in Washington. What I would call that is a limitation on the rate \nof growth of Federal spending.\n  It is important we get the President's proposed budget, as required \nby the law. The law requires the President to send his proposed budget \nto the Congress by the first Monday in February. He has not done so, \nand we have been advised that we probably will not even see the \nPresident's proposed budget until our work here is done. I do not know \nwhat the President could do that would render himself any more \nirrelevant to this important process than not contribute his proposed \nbudget on a timely basis, as required by the law.\n  Because the President has not complied with the law, I am going to \noffer an amendment to this budget resolution called the No Budget No \nOMB Pay Act of 2013. OMB, of course, stands for the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the executive branch agency responsible for \npreparing the President's proposed budget.\n  The No Budget No OMB Pay Act would prohibit paying the salaries of\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nthe Office of Management and Budget Director, the Deputy Director, and \nthe Deputy Director for Management for any period of time that the \nPresident is late in meeting the statutory requirement to submit his \nbudget, as I said, by the first Monday in February.\n  I have also filed an amendment to the budget that would allow the \nSenate to express its support for this legislation.\n  It is certainly progress that now, after 4 years, Senator Reid has \nseen fit to bring a budget to the floor. That is his prerogative as the \nmajority leader, something we in the minority have no authority to do. \nBut it represents progress--some small progress--that Senator Reid has \nfinally decided to bring a budget to the floor and that the Senate is \nnow able to amend and debate that budget resolution.\n  As you have heard, the proposed budget that has come from the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Murray's budget, raises taxes by $1.5 trillion and \nincreases spending by 62 percent. What is worse, it actually fails to \nbalance within 10 years, which is the budget window.\n  Equally as unfortunate, for the first time in recent memory, is that \nthe Congress is acting before receiving the President's proposed \nbudget. According to the National Journal, this marks an unprecedented \nbreak of 92 years of tradition in having the President make the first \nmove in the budget process.\n  This is called leadership.\n  Current law requires the President to send his budget by the first \nMonday of February, which I have said. President Obama has ignored this \nrequirement. He has missed the deadline 4 out of 5 years he has been \nPresident of the United States. This year he was required to issue the \nbudget proposal on February 4, but he missed the deadline once again. \nWhile the Senate is acting this week, it has been 45 days since the \nPresident has failed to live up to the legal commitment for the \nPresident to submit his proposed budget. We all know nowhere else in \nAmerica, whether in private life, private business, or in local or \nState government, can you fail to do your job and still be paid--only \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  We know it is important the President and the executive branch live \nup to their responsibilities, just as it is important we do so \nourselves. If the Office of Management and Budget does not do its job \nand produce a budget, its top official should not be paid.\n  Based on legislation we have already passed, both the legislative \nbranch and now, if my budget amendment passes and if Congress embraces \nthis requirement, both executive and legislative branches share \nresponsibility when it comes to the budget. Without us doing our jobs \nand the President doing his job, spending will remain out of control. \nWe all deserve better and the American people deserve better. They \ndeserve the accountability which comes from the President fulfilling \nhis legal responsibilities under the law of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as the Senate continues to debate the \nfirst budget resolution in more than 4 years, I am struck not only by \nthe things we know about the Democrats' budget but also the things we \ndon't know. For example, we know the budget would increase our debt by \nnearly $7 trillion over 10 years and it would continue on an upward \ntrajectory thereafter. What we don't know is how, while amassing all \nthat debt, our Nation will be able to respond to unforeseeable crises \nand emergencies in the future.\n  In addition, we know the budget does next to nothing to address our \nrunaway entitlement spending. What we don't know is how programs such \nas Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security would survive over the long \nterm if this budget were to be followed.\n  Finally, we know this budget includes as much as $1.5 trillion in new \ntaxes. What we don't know is where all that revenue will be coming \nfrom. Last week before the budget was released I came to the floor to \nspeak about the rumors the Democratic budget would include \nreconciliation instructions with regard to taxes. The concern I \nexpressed at that time was the budget would instruct the Finance \nCommittee to close so-called tax loopholes in order to raise revenue \nand this would, in effect, end ongoing bipartisan efforts on tax \nreform. As it turns out, my fears were not unfounded. Specifically this \nbudget instructs the Finance Committee to find nearly $1 trillion in \nnew revenues to pay for additional spending.\n  The deadline under these instructions would be October 1 of this \nyear. That clashes directly with the schedule Chairman Baucus and I \nhave set out for bipartisan tax reform deliberations in the Finance \nCommittee. This budget would instruct the committee to set aside those \nreform efforts and, instead, comb through the Tax Code looking for new \nrevenues. In addition, this budget includes deficit-neutral reserve \nfunds and sequester replacement which total more than $500 billion. \nAccording to the Budget Committee, this new spending would be paid for \nby closing so-called tax loopholes for the wealthy and corporations.\n  In addition to the $1 trillion in reconciliation instructions, this \nbudget includes potential for another half trillion in new taxes. This \nmeans up to $1.5 trillion in fresh taxes from this budget will be used \nto expand our already bloated Federal Government.\n  The budget repeats the common refrain we hear from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle that our Tax Code is so full of so-called \nloopholes which benefit only the wealthy. According to their arguments, \nthese loopholes may be closed at any time to generate untold amounts of \nrevenue without affecting the middle class or our economy.\n  During last week's Budget Committee markup, the chairwoman claimed \nthey could hit their revenue target by ``closing loopholes and cutting \nunfair spending in the Tax Code for those who need it the least.''\n  This statement is simply incorrect. First of all, a loophole is \nsomething created by accident or carelessness which is then exploited. \nWhen my colleagues talk about loopholes, they aren't talking about \nbackdoors created unintentionally or sneaky abuses of the Tax Code, \nthey are talking about tax expenditures, all of which were deliberately \nplaced into the Code for specific reasons. More often than not my \nDemocratic colleagues use the term ``loophole'' to describe items in \nthe Tax Code they don't like. This doesn't make the label any more \nhonest.\n  Earlier this week one of my friends on the other side of the aisle \ntook this rhetoric about loopholes up a notch. He described the Tax \nCode as this treasure trove of special deals and earmarks for the rich \nand well-connected. He went further by saying, We are at the place \nwhere the lobbyists wield the sweet corporate tax deals. He blamed \nRepublicans for this, arguing we were responsible for the existence of \nthese so-called loopholes and earmarks.\n  Admittedly there are some narrow provisions in the Tax Code--too \nmany, if you ask me. There are supporters of these provisions on both \nsides of the aisle. Let's be honest. There aren't any real loopholes in \nthe Tax Code, nor are there any earmarks. There are simply tax \nexpenditures. If you look at a list of the largest tax expenditures, \nyou will find a number of deductions and preferences which \ndisproportionately benefit the middle class, middle-income taxpayers. \nThat being the case, if my colleagues want to raise significant amounts \nof revenue by eliminating tax expenditures, they will have to do so by \nraising taxes on the middle class.\n  Look at this chart. If you look at this chart, you will see the \nrevenue targets in the Democratic budget. First up, there is $975 \nbillion right near the reconciliation instructions to the Finance \nCommittee. Below that are additional revenues included in this budget. \nAs I have mentioned, all told, if you include the specified revenue \ntarget for reconciliation and potential increases elsewhere, the budget \nmay include more than $1.5 trillion in tax increases. Look at this.\n  Next we have a list of all the tax increases Senate Democrats have \nvoted for over the last 2 years, including the elimination of tax \nbreaks for oil and gas companies, increased taxes for carried interest \nand the so-called Buffett rule. All told, these tax hike proposals \ncould raise about $108.3 billion in new revenues. At the bottom we see \nthe difference between that number, the tax increases which Senate \nDemocrats have actually voted for and the potential tax hikes which are \nincluded in the budget.\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\n  As I said, we can give the Democrats credit for having identified \nabout $108 billion in tax increases they support, but that would mean \nthere is as much as $1.4 trillion in unidentified tax increases in this \nbudget.\n  How would they reach their target? The budget doesn't spell it out. \nIt leaves more than enough room to speculate. For example, you might \nsimply think they would adopt the idea from President Obama's past \nbudgets to cap itemized deductions for higher income earners at 28 \npercent.\n  This seems unlikely for two reasons. First, to date very few \nDemocrats in the Senate have come out in favor of that proposal. \nIndeed, it would impact things such as charitable contributions and \npension deferrals which most have been unwilling to change. Second, and \nmore important, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, that \nproposal would generate only about $423 billion in new revenues over 10 \nyears, which would leave my colleagues about $1 trillion short of their \nrevenue goal. Still, I can't help but wonder if the tide has shifted \nwith regard to this proposal.\n  With the Senate budget staking so much on the elimination of so-\ncalled loopholes, it will be interesting to see how many Democrats \nshift positions and endorse the President's proposal, even though it \nwill not yield nearly enough revenue to reach the targets outlined in \nthis budget.\n  Staying in the world of capping itemized deductions, there is also \nthe proposal outlined by CBO in 2011 to cap all itemized deductions for \nall taxpayers at 15 percent. This would effectively raise taxes on \nevery tax filer in every bracket who itemized their deductions. Make no \nmistake. This would be a tax increase on the middle class, meaning it \nwould violate the promises made by President Obama and other Democrats \nto protect the middle class from further tax increases.\n  However, it would also generate enough revenue to be in the \nneighborhood of what the Democrats have outlined in their budget. All \ntold, this proposal would, according to CBO, raise about $1.2 trillion \nin revenue over 10 years. Given the outlandish revenue proposal in the \nbudget, this idea, while punitive and damaging to the middle class, \ncan't be ruled out entirely.\n  I have another chart here which lists the top 10 tax expenditures \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation. These 10 items account \nfor 71 percent of what Democrats have called spending in the Tax Code.\n  What is No. 1 on this list? I will give you a hint. It is not \ncorporate jet depreciation or carried interest. No, it is the tax-free \ntreatment of employer-provided health care. Do you want to do away with \nthat?\n  What is No. 2 on the list? It is the tax-deferred benefit for retired \nsavings plans.\n  How about No. 3? It is the measure which provides relief against \ndouble taxation on investments. I am referring to the reduced rate on \nlong-term capital gains and dividends. This rate went up recently. It \nwas raised by 59 percent in the fiscal cliff bill. Raising it even more \nis a sure-fire recipe for job destruction and even slower economic \ngrowth.\n  No. 4 is the deduction for State and local taxes.\n  No. 5 is the home mortgage interest deduction. Do you want to do away \nwith that?\n  No. 6 is the tax-free treatment of Medicare benefits.\n  So far I don't see a lot of expenditures aimed solely at benefiting \nthe wealthy. No, most of these provisions benefit a significant number \nof middle-income taxpayers or earners.\n  Three of the four next items on the list are refundable, meaning the \nperson filing the return can receive a check even if they owe no income \ntax. This is truly where there is spending in the Tax Code. These \nprovisions exclusively benefit lower and middle-income earners. They \nare not available to those making over $200,000 a year.\n  The point is not simply there are a lot of popular tax expenditures. \nI think people know that already. No, my point is, given the difference \nbetween the revenue target in the Democrats' budget and the tax \nincreases they supported on the record, there is no telling how they \nplan to actually raise their revenue. If they are serious about closing \nso-called loopholes to the tune of over $1 trillion, this list is where \nthe real money is. If we are talking about raising that kind of revenue \nby eliminating tax expenditures, we are necessarily talking about \nprovisions which benefit the middle class. It can't be raised through \neliminating tax breaks for oil companies. It can't be raised by \ninstituting the Buffett rule. It can't be raised even by eliminating \nall itemized deductions for millionaires.\n  I am sure my colleagues will disagree with this assessment. However, \nthe burden is on them to show where I am wrong, and they can't.\n  This is their budget and their revenue target. If they want this \nbudget to be taken seriously, the Democrats should come out and state \nspecifically their plan for raising their $1.5 trillion in additional \nrevenue. You can't simply say: We want the Finance Committee to figure \nout how to raise taxes by another $1 trillion to finance our spending \nspree. That is irresponsible and, as I said, it poisons the well for \nfundamental tax reform. You can't simply say: We want to turn off \nalmost half a trillion dollars of sequestration spending cuts, but we \nwon't say how we will pay for it. This is irresponsible and misleading \nto the American public.\n  Finally, I wish to point out the budget would also mark a significant \nshift in the position held by many Democrats with regard to corporate \ntaxes. The Obama administration has repeatedly expressed support for \napproaching corporate tax reform in a revenue-neutral manner. Prominent \nDemocrats on the Finance Committee have also publicly expressed support \nfor revenue-neutral corporate tax reform in order to make America more \nglobally competitive.\n  However, the Democrats' budget states: Eliminating loopholes and \ncutting unfair spending in the Tax Code for the biggest corporations \nmust be a significant element of a balanced and responsible deficit \nreduction plan.\n  You cannot have it both ways. Revenue-neutral corporate tax reform \nmeans paring back corporate tax expenditures and lowering the corporate \ntax rate. Revenue-neutral corporate tax reform does not mean, and \ncannot mean, eliminating tax expenditures which some Members don't like \nbecause it polls well, and then using some or all of the resulting \nrevenue gain to further expand the government. This is not tax reform \nof any kind, this is a tax hike pure and simple. I would be interested \nto find out whether the Democrats who have publicly expressed support \nfor revenue-neutral tax reform will support this budget.\n  More generally, I wish to know where the Democrats stand on corporate \ntaxes. Do they want to raise them, or do they want to make American \ncompanies more globally competitive? I hope it is the latter. You \ncannot do both.\n  When you look at the tax provisions of the Senate budget, it is clear \nit is nothing more than a political document.\n  I suspect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know they \ncannot hit their revenue targets without impacting the middle class. I \nthink they also know we can't do revenue-neutral corporate tax reform \nand at the same time raise more tax revenue from the corporate sector. \nI think they know that in real-world terms, the tax provisions of this \nbudget are several bridges too far. So in the end, I have to assume \nthere is a political calculation being made.\n  My colleagues apparently believe it makes good political sense to \ntalk about reducing the deficit on the backs of the wealthy and less \npopular corporations rather than making difficult choices on spending.\n  The American people need a real blueprint for our Nation's fiscal \nfuture, not more talking points. Once again, I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to reject this budget.\n  Now I wish to take just a few seconds to talk about one of the budget \namendments I expect will be discussed and considered on the floor. I \nunderstand it is described as an amendment to ``establish a deficit \nneutral reserve fund to allow States to collect sales and use taxes \nalready owed under State law.'' This amendment is intended to be a \nproxy vote for a bill called the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  I greatly appreciate the diligent efforts of the supporters of this \nbill, including Senators Enzi and Alexander.\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\nClearly, a lot of work has gone into this legislation. However, over \nthe last few months, I have been on the floor several times to talk \nabout the importance of restoring regular order in the Senate. The \nMarketplace Fairness Act has been referred to the Finance Committee. \nBoth Chairman Baucus and I have the view that legislation is more \nproperly considered within the context of the committee's current \nbipartisan efforts on tax reform.\n  However one feels regarding this amendment, it is undeniable that the \nMarketplace Fairness Act is controversial and that concerns about and \nsuggestions for the legislation have been raised by many stakeholders. \nI have met with many people on both sides of the Marketplace Fairness \nAct, including people from Utah, and have heard many concerns. I am not \nhere to take a position on the substance of this legislation, only to \nnote that it deserves to be fully debated in committee and I am \nconcerned this amendment might not allow those debates to occur.\n  For this reason, I intend to vote no on this amendment at this time.\n  What I have said is extremely important. It is not partisan. It is \npointing out these doggone problems with this bill, and I hope my \nfriends on the other side will start looking at things such as this. \nBecause we can play politics with these things all day long, but that \ndoesn't make it right and it doesn't make it so we can do what my \nfriends on the other side would like to do, which is raise revenue so \nthey can spend more.\n  It boggles my mind. We have to find some way of living within our \nmeans in this country. If we don't, we are creating a new generation of \ndebtors--our children, our grandchildren, and in many cases--in my \ncase--great-grandchildren as well. It is the debtor generation now. \nEvery one of them owes well over $50,000 personally, and that is going \nto go up exponentially if we don't watch what we are doing.\n  In fact, even if we do watch what we are doing, it is still going to \ngo up. But we have to do everything in our power to give them a future. \nThe debtor generation is all those who are less than 50 years of age \nbut especially our youth. We simply can't barter away their future \nbecause we don't have the guts to stand up and do what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I think we will proceed now to the \nother side. Then there will be back and forth on the Internet Fairness \nAct; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is my understanding there are a \nnumber of Senators who have come to talk on one of the provisions they \nwould like to offer. I think we will start with their side, with \nSenator Enzi to be yielded to from their side.\n  If the Senator wants to yield time to him, I will then yield to a \nDemocrat.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. For the information of my colleagues--and I guess this \nwill not be in concrete--I will recognize Senator Enzi for 10 minutes, \nSenator Alexander for 10 minutes, and Senators Blunt and Ayotte for 5 \nminutes each.\n  Senator Enzi, I know, has worked hard on this legislation, and I \nyield to him.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I note the time will come off the \nresolution on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise with Senators Durbin, Alexander, \nand others to discuss an amendment I am filing to the fiscal year 2014 \nbudget resolution. The amendment establishes the deficit-neutral \nreserve fund that allows States to enforce State and local use tax laws \nand to collect taxes already owed under State law on remote sales.\n  The amendment captures the bipartisan, bicameral--the House and \nSenate--policy my colleagues and I are pursuing in S. 336, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. I did hear my colleague from Utah mention he \nwould like that to go through regular order. This does not preclude \nregular order. This would not be a final determination for the bill, \nbut it would give us some kind of indication of the strength behind \nthis idea.\n  As a former small business owner, I believe it is important to level \nthe playing field for all retailers--in-store, catalogue, and online--\nso an outdated rule for sales tax collection does not adversely impact \nsmall businesses and Main Street retailers. The Supreme Court case \nearlier encouraged Congress to solve this problem. Thousands of local \nbusinesses are forced to do business at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause they have to collect sales tax and use tax and remote sellers \ndo not, which in some States can mean a 5- to 10-percent price \nadvantage. We should not be subsidizing some taxpayers at the expense \nof others.\n  Sales taxes go directly to State and local governments--that would be \ncounties and cities and towns--which bring in needed revenue for \nmaintaining our schools, fixing our roads, and supporting local law \nenforcement. If Congress fails to authorize States to collect tax on \nremote sales and electronic commerce continues to grow, we are \nimplicitly blessing a situation where States can be forced to raise \nother taxes, such as income or property taxes, to offset the growing \nloss of sales tax revenue. Do you want that to happen? I sure don't.\n  Now is the time for Congress to act. Many Americans do not realize \nwhen they buy something online, order something from a catalogue from a \nbusiness outside their own State, they still owe State sales taxes. It \nis just very difficult to comply with that. For over a decade, Congress \nhas been debating how best to allow States to collect sales taxes from \nonline retailers in a way that puts Main Street businesses on a level \nplaying field with online retailers.\n  On February 14, 2013, the bicameral, bipartisan Marketplace Fairness \nAct was introduced to close the 20-year loophole that distorts the \nAmerican marketplace by picking winners and losers, by subsidizing some \nbusinesses at the expense of other businesses, and subsidizing \ntaxpayers at the expense of other taxpayers. All businesses and their \nretail sales and all consumers and their purchases should be treated \nequally.\n  The bill also empowers States to make the decision themselves. If \nthey choose to collect already existing sales taxes on all purchases, \nregardless of whether the sale was online or in-store, they can, but it \ntakes their action. If they want to keep things the way they are, it is \nthe State's choice.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act does not tax Internet use, it does not \ntax Internet services, and it does not raise taxes. It gives States the \nright to collect what is owed by the purchasing individual.\n  I wish to provide some highlights of what the Marketplace Fairness \nAct accomplishes. The bill gives States the right to decide to collect \nor not to collect taxes that are already owed. The legislation would \nsimplify and streamline the country's more than 9,000 diverse sales tax \njurisdictions and provide two options by which States could begin \ncollecting sales taxes from online and catalogue purchases. The bill \nalso carves out small businesses so they are not adversely affected by \nthe new law by exempting businesses with less than $1 million in online \nor out-of-State sales from collection requirements. This small business \nexemption will protect small merchants and give new businesses time to \nget started.\n  Do not let the critics get away with saying this kind of \nsimplification cannot be done. The different tax rates and \njurisdictions are no problem for today's software programs. As a former \nmayor and State legislator, I strongly favor allowing States the \nauthority to require sales and use tax collection from retailers on all \nsales if the State chooses to do so. We need to implement a plan that \nwill allow States to generate revenue using mechanisms already approved \nby their local leaders. We need to allow States the ability to collect \nthe sales taxes they already require. If enacted, it would provide \napproximately $23 billion in fiscal relief for the States for which \nCongress does not have to find an offset. This would give States less \nof an excuse to come knocking on the Federal door for handouts and will \nreduce the problem of federally attached strings.\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is about States rights and it is about \nfairness. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for the Enzi-\nDurbin amendment to support the goals of States rights and a level \nplaying field for all businesses.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a photograph of a store in \nPalatine, IL, called Soccer Plus. Bob Naughtrip opened this store and \nsold sporting equipment in the suburbs of Chicago. He had a pretty good \nbusiness going, but then he ran into something called show-rooming. \nThat consists of people walking into a store and saying: I would like \nto try on a pair of shoes or some equipment. They would find exactly \nwhat they wanted, write down all the information, and then say: Thanks, \nBob, walk out the door and order it on the Internet, paying for it \nwithout paying sales tax on their purchase. So every time Bob tried to \nsell something and collect the sales tax in Illinois--which he was \nrequired to collect--he was at a disadvantage from the people buying \nover the Internet. Is that fair?\n  The Supreme Court said it was up to Congress to decide whether that \nis fair. It is up to Congress to decide whether Internet sales should \nbe subject to State and local sales taxes. That is why we are here. To \nmy way of thinking, this is just a question of fundamental fairness. We \nare not talking about imposing a new tax--not at all. We are talking \nabout existing taxes.\n  In my State of Illinois, incidentally, when I buy something on the \nInternet, I have a legal obligation to pay sales tax on it, but it is \ndone voluntarily. Many times it is not collected when I make the \npurchase. I do it on my State income tax return each year. Most people \ndon't do it at all, so the sales tax is never collected on the Internet \npurchase.\n  The purpose of this bill is to allow States, if they wish--\nvoluntarily--to start having Internet retailers collect sales tax for \nthe sales that are made over the Internet to people living in their \nState. This is voluntary, so the States can decide whether to do it. Is \nthis a new tax? No. In 46 States it is an existing tax. It is now going \nto be collected as opposed to voluntarily adding it to an income tax \nreturn by individuals.\n  So it is not a new tax, and it is certainly not a tax on the Internet \nitself. It is just that happens to be the point of purchase. We have on \nthe floor my friend, Senator Baucus of Montana. He is from one of the \nfour States in our Nation that do not have a sales tax, and they, of \ncourse, are concerned about this issue. Let me make it clear: Anyone \npurchasing an item on the Internet in Montana is not going to have to \npay sales tax if Montana doesn't have a sales tax. The same will be \ntrue for New Hampshire, as well as Delaware and Oregon--the four States \nthat have no sales tax. So we are not imposing a new sales tax on \nMontana or any other State. Those that have the tax will be collecting \nit under our bill.\n  How about the Internet retailers who will be covered by this? We \ncreated an exemption, as Senator Enzi said. The exemption says they \nhave to have $1 million in sales on the Internet before they have to do \nthis--$1 million.\n  How many Internet retailers would that mean? We think about 1,000, \n975 sell more than $1 million worth of goods each year on the Internet. \nSo about 1,000 retailers on the Internet would be collecting the sales \ntax. They would look at my home address and they would assess the tax \nthat is owed.\n  Wait a minute. How will that be assessed when each and every Internet \nretailer has to go through the burden of establishing this technology, \nthese computer programs? No. The burden is on the States to provide the \ncomputer software for the Internet retailers, not at the expense of the \nInternet retailers. So it is a simple process, and it is a fair \nprocess.\n  Bob was a good businessman. He hired a lot of local people. He \ncollected sales tax and paid his property tax, and with that money they \nbuilt this road right out in front of his shop, they provided the \npolice and fire services and things that are part of civilization, \nliving in America. He paid the taxes on this, and he lost his business \nbecause his competitors weren't collecting the taxes.\n  I find it interesting, though. I recently made a purchase on Amazon, \nand they collected the sales tax from me in Illinois--which they can \ndo. Amazon supports our bill, incidentally. They delivered it, and I \nbelieve they used the Postal Service this time, but sometimes they use \nUPS and FedEx. Their trucks and delivery people use the streets of \nChicago and the streets of Springfield. They rely on the basic services \nwe all count on. So even the Internet sales are dependent on some basic \nservices that are going to be provided by a community.\n  I have heard so many speeches on the floor of the Senate about how \nmuch we love and venerate and respect small businesspeople. We are told \nthat if this economy is going to get well and move forward, it is going \nto be driven by small businesses expanding their employment. Well, I \nbelieve that. I have seen it over and over again in Illinois and every \nState I have visited. But if they are going to have a fighting chance \nto compete, there ought to be a level playing field, as Senator Enzi \nsaid. There ought to be a basic fairness here.\n  If Bob's business had to collect sales tax for sales to Illinois \nresidents, why wouldn't those who purchase over the Internet be under \nthe same obligation? That is what this says. It basically establishes \nthat responsibility.\n  Now, of course we have a lot of support for this--support from \nGovernors and mayors and business developers and, of course, small \nbusinesses. So if people want to come to the floor and decide what side \nthey want to be on, I urge them to be on the side of the same small \nbusinesses they have given speeches about over and over again.\n  I believe in these men and women. Many of them have gone into small \nbusiness and taken a lot of risks. They are the backbone of our \ncommunities, there is no question about it. Time and time again, we go \nto them to make sure they are going to build the economy and hire the \npeople whom we need in our local communities. So let's give them a \nfighting chance. The marketplace fairness bill will do that.\n  Senator Enzi was on this bill before me, Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota before me, and when Senator Dorgan retired, I asked if I could \njoin him. But I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership. As \nyou probably heard, Senator Enzi, before he came to the Senate, was a \nsmall businessman himself, and so he knows this firsthand.\n  So let's stand for business and retailers across America and give \nthem a fighting chance. Let them be competitive. Let them continue to \nhire and be good neighbors in our communities. And let's say to the \nInternet retailers: We are glad you are doing well, but play by the \nsame rules and make sure there is a level playing field.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I might ask the Senator from \nMissouri to go ahead of me, if that is agreeable with the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for recognizing me \nto make a few comments.\n  I agree with everything that has been said. I believe this is the \nfair thing to do. I think it is wrong for government to penalize some \nbusinesses over others. I think it is wrong, frankly, to have laws on \nthe books that we know aren't being enforced. To have laws on the books \nthat you know create law violators is the wrong thing to do. And \nfrankly, in almost every State where--as Senator Durbin pointed out, in \nhis State and my State, which is next door to his State, you are \nsupposed to pay this tax. People just don't do it. I think last year in \nMissouri we had about 300 people pay this tax in the entire State. I \nwould bet, more than the collective tax they paid, that more than 300 \npeople bought something over the Internet in the State of Missouri last \nyear. So this is a tax that is on the books, it needs to be collected, \nand we ought to\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nsee what we can do to make that happen.\n  States that don't have a sales tax don't have to collect it. States \nthat don't want to participate don't have to participate. But with all \nof the technology now available, with the $1 million exemption for \nbusinesses that want to sell a few things over the Internet--or maybe \nthey want to sell everything over the Internet, they just don't sell \nvery much--I think the objections that are reasonable to this have been \nmore than met.\n  I saw in a publication just last week on this topic three pretty well \nknown conservatives, one talking about the Internet at its inception \nwhen William F. Buckley said:\n\n       If the advantage of tax-free Internet commerce marginally \n     closes out local industry, reforms are required.\n\n  This was at a time when nobody was buying things over the Internet, \nwhen it was just getting started, when we didn't want to have a unique \ntax for the Internet. But in all of those discussions, I never heard a \nserious discussion that if you are on the Internet, you should avoid \ntaxes that are required to be paid. And William F. Buckley at the time \nwas saying that whenever this becomes a problem, something should be \ndone about it, and that is what this bill would do.\n  One of my former colleagues when I was in the House, now the Governor \nof Indiana, Mike Pence, said:\n\n       I don't think Congress should be in the business of picking \n     winners and losers. Inaction by Congress today results in a \n     system today that does pick winners and losers.\n\n  He is talking about this system.\n  Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said:\n\n       There is no more glaring example of misguided government \n     power that when taxes or regulations affect two similar \n     businesses completely differently. Over time, the company \n     that has to comply with a tax or a regulation will lose \n     market share to its competitor who is carved out from this \n     government interference.\n\n  That is what this is about.\n  I had a news conference on this in St. Louis a year or so ago, and as \nsoon as the camera was turned off, the person interviewing me said: You \nknow, one of my wife's friends has a wedding dress shop, and she sees \npeople come in all the time who are clearly there to try on a wedding \ndress, get the number off the wedding dress, and order it on the \nInternet. And if the only difference in the cost of that wedding \ndress--I guess there are lots of variations but, say, 8 or 10 percent--\nif the only difference is the sales tax, that is not a fair \ncompetition.\n  And the person who went in the store to try on the wedding dress paid \ntheir local property taxes, they helped pay for the police protection, \nthey helped pay for the sidewalk and the parking place, and then \nordered the wedding dress from somebody who had contributed to none of \nthat.\n  So I join my colleagues in saying this is the right thing to do. I \nhope we can get it done. And frankly, if we don't get it done, the \nStates that say this tax needs to be voluntarily paid and know that is \nnot happening should just get that law off the books. Having a law on \nthe books that you know people violate is not the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, I would give back to Mr. Enzi or Mr. Alexander \nwhatever time I haven't used, and I look forward to hearing others talk \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the hour \nfor Senators Klobuchar and Coats now begin at 4:10 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the chair of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think this amendment is not yet ready. \nIt is premature. This is a very complicated question, and I think there \nhas been a lot of easy talk and a little bit of herd instinct here \nthat, gee, because most States are not sales tax States, therefore this \namendment should be adopted.\n  The fact that is this is an extremely complicated question. For \nexample, who is going to enforce this statute? Is the State of \nCalifornia, for example, or the State of Massachusetts going to enforce \nthe noncollection of sales tax in another State? That is revolutionary. \nI cannot think of an instance where this Congress has legislated that a \nState can go into another State and enforce the taxation laws in that \nsecond State or when a State has empowered the State court in one State \nto go to another State and enforce the State taxation in that other \nState. It has not happened. It is not only complicated, but it is \nrevolutionary. We have not done this before--nothing similar.\n  I understand the arguments of those who want to pass this. They make \nsome good points. I have said to Senator Durbin, Senator Enzi, and \nothers that we in the Finance Committee will very seriously take this \nup as soon as we can and will probably in the context of tax reform.\n  Let me repeat. It raises lots of questions that have not been \naddressed with respect to States rights; that is, the degree to which \nauthorities in one State or courts in one State are able to go to \nanother State and enforce State taxation issues.\n  Certainly, we have the full faith and credit clause in the \nConstitution where if someone in California, for example, gets a court \norder or wants to enforce a collection of tax in California, that could \nnot be overturned in another State. That is not this question. This \nquestion is whether courts in other States and citizens in other States \ncan go to another State and force the court in that other State to \nenforce that other State's taxation law. We are not talking about the \ntaxation law in California. We are talking about the other State \ntaxation laws. We have never done that, and I don't think it is wise to \nstart going down that road now.\n  Second, different States have different State taxation laws for \ndifferent reasons. Some States have income taxes. Some don't. Some have \nsales taxes. Some don't. The State of Montana has decided no sales tax, \nbut we will have a significant income tax. Other States say no income \ntax but a significant sales tax. That is their prerogative. That is how \nthey want to run their State.\n\n  What does this do? This basically will have the virtual effect over a \nperiod of time of saying that all States have to have a sales tax--\nforget your income tax--and beyond that, it has to be the same rate. \nThat is what is going to happen here over time if this is enacted into \nlaw. You are telling States they have to have a sales tax even if they \ndon't want to. I don't think we want to do that, to say nothing of all \nthe potential complications revolving around different jurisdictions.\n  I know the authors of this bill say: Computers can take care of it \nall. That is part of the problem. The computers get shut down, they get \nhacked. It is not the panacea a lot of people talk about. This is \nextremely complicated.\n  Sure, we have to have a full, complete hearing on this, and we should \nand we will. The best thing to do right now is to have this amendment \nwithdrawn because otherwise there are going to be a lot of amendments \noffered today, tomorrow, and tonight that are going to show all the \ndefects of this, and they are all going to pass, and that is going to \nseriously undermine and be a poison pill for this bill that is pending \nright now. So the best solution is to withdraw this amendment now. \nLet's not try to solve this here in the Senate budget resolution but, \nrather, it should be in the right forum in the right location, and that \nis the Finance Committee, with big hearings, and we will work all this \nout because there are very legitimate points to be made on both sides.\n  What bothers me is there is a lot of easy talk about how good this \nis, how fair it is, and nobody has thought through all the unintended \nconsequences and all the problems that could arise, and I just started \nto raise a few of them.\n  My friend from Oregon had a good thought. What about Canada? What \nabout direct sellers in Canada just across the border? They sell to the \nUnited States. Do we have jurisdiction over Canada? I don't think so. \nAnd I can see a burgeoning direct sales business and revenue to Canada, \nas my friend from Oregon thought of. There are a lot of others that we \nhaven't\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nthought about because it has not become ripe. It has not become ripe \nbecause we haven't had a direct hearing in a direct forum.\n  So I just say this is not a good idea. I understand the reasons why \nsome advocate it, but I might say this: If we assume Federal dollars--\nbecause someone has to come up with asking Uncle Sam for Federal \ndollars to enforce this question in another State. Do we want that? I \nask, who is the enforcer here? Is it another State? Is it Uncle Sam? I \ndon't know. That has not been thought through.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge that it not be adopted. Otherwise, we are \ngoing to have a ton of amendments that are not going to be appreciated \nby the supporters of this bill. If they pass, it will dramatically \nweaken any momentum they think they are going to have. So discretion is \nthe better part of valor. Let's withdraw this, and let's consider this \ncalmly in the right forum.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nhis comments, since Senator Enzi has probably been considering this \nbill his whole career. He came to the Senate nearly 18 years ago, and \nhe introduced it 14 years ago. So even by Senate standards, it has had \na good deal of calm deliberation.\n  We have also had a hearing in the Finance Committee, where the \ndistinguished chairman is in charge, and we have asked for a markup, \nwhich we haven't had.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You will get one.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the chairman for his commitment to a markup. I \nwonder if I might ask through the Chair when that would come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I can't guarantee a time. Nobody around \nhere can. But I think it is appropriate that this is an issue that \nshould come up in the context of tax reform, which the committee is \npressing very vigorously. We had a meeting today in the Finance \nCommittee on the first of many steps. Regrettably, Senator Enzi was \nunable to make it. It was on tax reform. And that is the appropriate \nforum for this to be brought.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I think this illustrates the problem \nwe are having. How can this be a part of tax reform when it is not part \nof the Tax Code? It has been heard by the Commerce Committee in the \nSenate. It has been heard by the Finance Committee. It has not been \nmarked up. It has been heard by the House Judiciary Committee. Senator \nEnzi has been working on it for 14 years.\n\n  This is a very simple question. It is a matter of States rights, two \nwords. Does a State, any State, have the right to decide whether to \ncollect existing taxes from some of the people who owe the taxes or \nfrom all of the people who owe the taxes?\n  In the State of Tennessee, at the Nashville Boot Company store, I \nwalk in, I try on a pair of boots, then I go order it over the Internet \nso I do not have to pay the sales tax. What the State of Tennessee \nwants to do--the conservative Governor Bill Haslam, the conservative \nLieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey, the Republican legislature, these are \nnot a bunch of big tax people--they want to collect the sales tax from \neverybody who owes it and they would like to require those who sell \ninto Tennessee to do the very same thing they do, what the Nashville \nBoot Company does when I buy from it: They add the sales tax to the \nbill. They collect it and send it to the State. How hard is that to do?\n  My wife gave me an ice cream maker for my birthday last year. I \nordered some ingredients to make chocolate ice cream, over the \nInternet. When I did that they added to my bill the sales tax based on \nmy ZIP Code. It is as easy as looking up the weather on your computer.\n  That is all we are deciding here. We are only deciding whether we in \nthe Congress are going to make State governments in our constitutional \nframework play Mother May I, by coming and pleading with us to allow \nthe State to decide what to do about its own taxes. The State of \nTennessee wishes to reduce its tax rate. It wishes to avoid a State \nincome tax. It doesn't like the idea of treating one taxpayer one way \nand another one another way; and one business one way and another \nbusiness another way. It wants to make that decision for itself.\n  When I was the Governor of Tennessee, nothing made me more unhappy \nthan to look up at Washington and see people of my own political party \ncome up here and think since they had taken an airplane to Washington, \nthey had gotten smarter than I was, suddenly, just by an hour plane \nride, and they were going to tell me what to do.\n  Now we have an honor roll of conservatives, and I will just speak to \nthe conservatives on my side for a while, who said we do not think \nStates ought to be playing Mother May I to the Federal Government on \nthis question. Give State legislatures the power to make these \ndecisions for themselves. That is consistent with the tenth amendment. \nThat is consistent with our constitutional framework. And most of them \nare saying, as ours is in Tennessee: If you give us this power, the \nright to do it, which the Supreme Court has said you clearly have the \nright to do it--you, Congress, are the most qualified to do it. You can \nmake this decision. Give us this power and we will lower our tax rate. \nThat is what our State wants to do.\n  It might use the money another way. They might use it to pay \noutstanding teachers more, to lower the tuition rate. But States have \nthe right to be right, and States have the right to be wrong.\n  There was a Supreme Court case 20 years ago at a time when most \nSenators didn't even know there was an Internet. The Court did say that \nStates could not impose a burden on interstate commerce. But it said \nCongress could write the rules for doing that. Now it is about as easy \nto add the sales tax if you are buying from a catalog or buying over \nthe Internet as it is if you buy from a local store. There is no reason \nfor us to take the position that only we know best about how States \nshould make decisions about their services or their taxes.\n  Some are worried that this might increase taxes. I have said most \nGovernors think they will lower tax rates. But here is the honor roll \nof conservatives who are asking the Congress to reaffirm our commitment \nand understanding of our constitutional system which allows States to \nmake this decision: Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative \nUnion; Governor Bob McDonnell, Virginia; Governor Tom Corbett, \nPennsylvania; Governor Bill Haslam, Tennessee; Governor Chris Christie, \nNew Jersey; Governor Rick Snyder, Michigan; Governor Butch Otter, \nIdaho; Governor Mitch Daniels, Indiana; former Governor Jeb Bush, \nFlorida; former Governor Haley Barbour; the writings of the late \nWilliam F. Buckley, et cetera, et cetera.\n  It is time after 20 years to take this simple 11-page bill that says \nStates have the right to decide for themselves whether to collect an \nexisting tax from some of the people who owe it or from all the people \nwho owe it, by requiring the seller to collect the tax at the time of \nthe sale: same tax, same store. They ought to be able to do that.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks the comments of a number of conservative \nsupporters of the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  In our State of Tennessee this bill is an insurance policy against a \nState income tax. We don't have one. We don't want one.\n  It is also an opportunity for us to treat every taxpayer the same \nway. If you owe the tax, it is collected at the time of sale and you \npay it, you don't avoid it. It is also a chance to treat all of the \nbusinesses that sell into Tennessee the same way. If you are going to \nsell to our 6 million people, we are going to treat you the same way we \ntreat people in the State. We don't want to create an incentive for \npeople to move out of Tennessee in order to sell into Tennessee. We \nwant there to be a level playing field.\n  If Montana businesses do not want to sell in Tennessee, that is their \nprerogative. But if they do, we want to treat them in the same way we \ntreat all the other businesses in Tennessee. Let's make it very clear: \nThis is not a tax on the Internet. We have a Federal law that placed a \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes. Let me repeat that. We have a \nFederal law that is an existing moratorium on taxing the Internet.\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\nThis is a question about whether the State of Idaho, the State of \nWyoming, the State of Tennessee, the State of Massachusetts, or any \nother State, that may say if we are going to have a sales tax then we \nare going to collect it in the same way from all the people who sell to \nthe people in our State. That is infinitely logical. With the advent of \ntechnology it is about as easy to collect it one way as the other. And \nit is fair.\n  I congratulate Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin for their years of \nwork. I appreciate very much the commitment of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee to say there will be a markup. I think it is \nabsolutely wrong to think of it as part of tax reform since it is not \npart of the Tax Code. We might include a milk producers bill in tax \nreform as well by the Chairman's logic. They do not belong in the same \nplace. This bill boils down to two words: It is a States rights bill. \nDo we have a tenth amendment, or the spirit of a tenth amendment, or do \nwe not? Do we trust Governors and legislatures to make decisions, or do \nwe not? Then they can decide whether they want to raise or lower taxes, \nwhether they want to collect taxes from some of the people who owe it \nor from all the people who owe it. That is the issue, these two words: \nStates rights. I think this issue is perfectly appropriate to bring up \nafter 14 years of work by Senator Enzi, after hearing from the Senate \nFinance and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. This \nis an opportunity for us to express our support for this principle of \nStates rights and to give Governors and legislatures across the country \na chance to treat businesses and taxpayers in the same way--stop \npicking winners and stop picking losers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Conservatives Support E-Fairness\n\n       William F.

Senator Enzi and Congressman Womack \n     deserve praise for their efforts to empower states to make \n     their own revenue policy choices and create a fair system of \n     tax collection. The number one threat to the future of \n     American competitiveness isn't other countries--it's our tax \n     law. When it comes to state sales taxes, it is time to \n     address the area where federally mandated prejudice is most \n     egregious--the policy towards Internet sales, the decades-old \n     inequity between online sales and in-person sales as outdated \n     and unfair.''

This price difference functions like a \n     subsidy. It distorts the allocation between the two forms of \n     selling.

It would give states options to decide how \n     they want to deal with this and not have to any longer deal \n     with the federal prohibition on dealing with it.

This has created an unfair price disadvantage for \n     brick-and-mortar businesses, has led to budget shortfalls for \n     states as sales and use taxes go uncollected, and has placed \n     an undue burden on consumers who do not realize they owe the \n     sales/use tax if it is not collected by the seller, leaving \n     them to face penalties and increased scrutiny from state \n     auditors.\n       We support the Marketplace Fairness Act because it would \n     give states the authority to manage their sales tax laws \n     while addressing this issue. Only Congress can grant this \n     authority to the states. S. 336 represents the best thinking \n     of all the stakeholders and provides a pathway forward for \n     states to collect sales and use taxes, simplify their tax \n     statutes, and assist vendors with compliance, while providing \n     for a robust $1 million small business exemption.\n       As the Congress seeks solutions to address the federal \n     budget and the impacts of sequestration, the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act is a proposal that will help states facing their \n     own budget shortfalls without increasing the federal deficit. \n     Congress has an opportunity to enhance states' rights over \n     sales and use tax collection authority and in the process \n     level the playing field for all merchants. Please support the \n     budget amendment on S. 336, the Marketplace Fairness Act, \n     because the time has come to update our local and state tax \n     laws.\n           Respectfully,\n

In the U.S., \n     NRF represents an industry that includes more than 3.6 \n     million establishments and which directly and indirectly \n     accounts for 42 million jobs--one in four U.S. jobs. The \n     total U.S. GDP impact of retail is $2.5 trillion annually, \n     and retail is a daily barometer of the health of the nation's \n     economy.\n       As the retail industry evolves and digital commerce becomes \n     a more prominent portion of total retail sales, it is \n     critical that the tax laws not discriminate between similar \n     businesses based on how their products are distributed. This \n     collection disparity has tilted the competitive landscape \n     against local stores creating a crisis for brick-and-mortar \n     retailers around the country and in your state. The \n     Marketplace Fairness Act addresses the crisis by removing the \n     constitutional limitation on states' authority to collect \n     sales and use taxes from remote sellers. This legislation \n     will level the playing field, while protecting small \n     businesses from complicated laws in other states with a \n     healthy small business exemption.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act is a commonsense piece of \n     legislation necessary to modernize our federal and state \n     understanding of sales tax laws so that they can keep current \n     with real world change in the marketplace. Leveling the \n     playing field for large and small retailers alike will create \n     a business climate where retailers have a better opportunity \n     to grow and create jobs in a truly competitive marketplace. \n     Please support the local retailers in your state by voting \n     for the Enzi amendment in support of S. 336, the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act, to the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2014.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From, Marketplacefairnesscoalition]\n\n                  Erick Erickson is Wrong, Here's Why:\n\n       This morning Erick Erickson published a very misleading \n     post that claims that legislation introduced by Senator Enzi \n     (R-WY) will raise taxes and tax online downloads.\n       The truth is:\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act will not raise anyone's taxes; \n     in fact it could help lower taxes by making state tax codes \n     more efficient and restoring state and local control.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act does not tax the Internet or \n     Internet businesses.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act has nothing to do with \n     iTunes--digital goods are not covered by The Marketplace \n     Fairness Act.\n       At the end of the day, the Marketplace Fairness Act gets \n     the federal government out of the way of state policymaking \n     and restores free market principles by leveling the playing \n     field between local, brick-and-mortar sellers and their out-\n     of-state competition.\n       By the way, it is probably a coincidence that he expresses \n     his sincere concern for eBay sellers. Certainly eBay couldn't \n     be behind Erickson's piece. The good news is that the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act protects small online businesses by \n     exempting the first $1 million in online sales--not total \n     retail sales\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\n     but specifically online sales--so the exemption actually \n     applies to businesses with far more than $1 million in annual \n     sales.\n       One MORE thing Erickson misses is that the tax is already \n     due. As an avid online shopper himself, if he isn't \n     calculating and remitting the use taxes he potentially owes, \n     he could be audited and face fines and penalties. Truth is \n     that every online shopper faces that threat under the current \n     system and that is why a significant majority of online \n     shoppers want the tax collected at the point of purchase.\n       At the end of the day we shouldn't be surprised that \n     Erickson is taking the side of faceless Internet sellers who \n     are desperately trying to protect their competitive \n     advantage--as much as 10% in some places.\n       To quote Ronald Reagan, ``facts are stubborn things.'' \n     Erickson is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own \n     facts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me first thank Senator Enzi and \nSenator Durbin for bringing forward this amendment. I agree with \nSenator Alexander for his comment as it relates to this bill. Let me \ntalk about one of the objectives we want to see in taxes. We talk about \nsimplifying, we talk about fairness. We also talk about what is known \nas the tax gap. That is the gap between the taxes that we have imposed \nthat we should collect and what we really collect. When it comes to \nsales and use tax, it has been estimated that because of the place in \nwhich an individual buys the product there is a $23 billion gap. That \nis $23 billion of taxes that are owed are not collected.\n  This is an urgent problem. In my own State of Maryland it is $300 \nmillion a year. There are people who are paying higher taxes than they \nshould because Maryland has to impose higher rates to make up for that \n$300 million. We all talk about a system where we can spread the base \nand lower the rates. The first way you do it is by collecting the taxes \nthat everyone should pay.\n  This is a good-governance issue, this is a fairness issue, this is an \nissue that is not that terribly complicated. We are not talking about \nany new tax responsibilities. We are not talking about any new taxes. \nWe are talking about getting our local governments, as Senator \nAlexander has said, the ability to collect the taxes that they impose \nin a fair manner. This is a matter of fairness. This is a matter of \ndoing what is right.\n  Let me give one example that was brought to my attention by a \nretailer in Maryland, a person who works in an electronics shop in our \nState, where someone came into that shop recently and was shopping for \na TV monitor, a new TV set. They did all the comparative shopping, \nbrought the expert in from that store, answered all their questions and \ndecided on what television set he was going to buy. He then went on his \nphone and ordered it from an Internet supplier. The price was identical \nat the two locations--identical. But the person bought it on the \nInternet because they did not have to pay the State sales tax. They had \nto pay the State use tax, but they never paid the State use tax. That \nis something we have to end. That is wrong. That is basic fairness.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee points out, how \ndo we collect these taxes? Let me point out we already collect taxes in \nour State from sales that are made outside of our State. We do it when \nthere is that nexus that the Supreme Court has acknowledged, and as has \nbeen pointed out, the retailer you buy it from adds the State sales tax \nby putting in their sales the ZIP Code in which we live and they \ncalculate the sales tax and they remit the sales tax. That is currently \nbeing done. This is not an additional burden.\n  Then I heard how complex it is to figure out what taxes are owed. Let \nme point out two points about that. First, the bill provides that the \nStates adopt the streamlined sales and use tax agreement so we have a \nuniformity as far as how this is applied. But let me tell you, I do not \neven know that is totally necessary because there are computer programs \ntoday that figure this out for the retailer. The retailer knows the \nproducts they are selling and they know how the retail sales taxes \nthroughout the Nation apply to the products they sell. It is a simple \nprogram. This is not a burden to the retailer.\n  Senator Durbin already pointed out if you live in New Hampshire or \nyou live in Montana or you live in a State that may not have a sales \ntax, your citizens are not going to pay a sales tax. It does not \nincrease anyone's sales tax. All we are saying is that when our \ncitizens buy products that are subject to our sales and use tax that \nthey cannot get a competitive advantage by going on the Internet rather \nthan using a retail establishment. What is wrong with that? We are not \ntalking about imposing any taxes on anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me last point out, in an effort to make sure that no \nsmall businesses are disadvantaged, there is a small business sales \nexemption of up to $1 million, so we are not talking about very small \nsales. We are talking about a great deal of revenue.\n  I thank Senator Enzi for his leadership, and Senator Durbin. This is \nlong overdue. We should pass this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire?\n  MS. AYOTTE. I thought I was next. May I check that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe they are yielding time off the Republican \nside.\n  MS. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment I \nheard that is going to be filed, the so-called Marketplace Fairness \nAct. I think we have need to rename this legislative proposal for what \nit is, the Internet Tax Collection Act. I come from a State, New \nHampshire, that does not have a sales tax nor do we have an income \ntax. One of our famous Governors said low taxes are the result of low \nspending, and that is how we do it.\n\n  There has been a lot of talk on the floor today about somehow this \nMarketplace Fairness Act is about States rights. This act, which really \nshould be named the Internet Tax Collection Act, infringes on the \nrights of retailers in New Hampshire and businesses that have thrived \nand grown over something great called the Internet. It forces them to \nbecome tax collectors for the rest of the Nation. In fact, they would \nbe forced to become tax collectors for nearly 10,000 tax jurisdictions \nacross this country should this proposal go forward.\n  I have heard a lot of talk about leveling the so-called playing \nfield. There is nothing level about this playing field. These are cash-\nstrapped States looking for more money and asking Washington to impose \nburdens on other States that have chosen to have a low tax burden, like \nStates such as mine which doesn't have a sales tax. In fact, this is \nanother attempt to turn our businesses into tax collectors. I think it \nis wrong.\n  It is the opposite of States rights. There has been some discussion \nof conservative support for this. There is absolutely nothing \nconservative about this proposal because, again, what this is about is \nofficials in cash-strapped States across the country looking for new \nways to plug their budget holes. They are attempting to make New \nHampshire businesses, and other businesses across this country, use the \nInternet to collect their taxes. This is not just about the State of \nTennessee handling its own taxes, it is making New Hampshire, which has \nno sales tax, collect for the rest of the Nation, and it is wrong.\n  The exemption for small businesses is a red herring. This so-called \nexemption doesn't even match up with what the SBA defines as a small \nbusiness retailer. We know what will happen with the small business \nexemption. When the States don't get the revenue they want, they will \nbe right back here again looking for us to repeal the small business \nexemption, saying: It is not fair that this category of businesses has \nbeen exempt. They will be looking for more and more, and here we are in \nWashington letting them trample on the States that made the decision \nnot to have a sales tax. This bill should not go forward.\n  I want to share some stories from New Hampshire. My constituents have \nwritten to me about this. A company in Franconia, which is in the \nnorthern part of New Hampshire, calls this a job killer. From \nPittsfield, an online coin and stamp dealer says: If policymakers\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\ndecide to impose new sales tax collection burdens on small businesses \nand force them to collect and remit 9,600 tax jurisdictions nationwide, \nthe legal compliance and administrative cost alone would undoubtedly \nmake it harder and, in many cases, impossible to enjoy the \nopportunities and benefits of the Internet marketplace.\n  This is from a business in Amherst:\n\n       Our company is a poster child for small family-run Internet \n     businesses. We have over 80,000 customers nationwide. The \n     burden of collecting and distributing sales tax for this \n     would be prohibitively expensive.\n\n  Finally, another constituent from Boscawen believes this would open \nthe door for States to begin taxing across their borders for many other \ndifferent taxes. Another company from Rindge says:\n\n       This bill is absolutely terrifying. I think I may not be \n     able to survive. I may not be significant to many in \n     Washington, but my little machine shop is the center of my \n     family's livelihood.\n\n  When I hear my colleagues come to the floor and call this a States \nrights issue, what about States such as New Hampshire? Why are we going \nto make this vibrant part of our marketplace, the Internet, a tax \ncollection haven for other States? So businesses in New Hampshire and \nother States are going to collect taxes for Indiana, and this is all \nbecause cash-strapped States are coming here and asking Congress to do \nthis.\n  By the way, for those who believe this is some kind of conservative \nbill, this is not my idea of conservative. The Americans for Tax Reform \nare against this, the Heritage Foundation is against this, the Campaign \nfor Liberty is against this, the National Taxpayer Union is against \nthis, Cato is against this, and the Heartland is against this.\n  This is not about small government. This is about forcing businesses \nin States like mine, with no sales tax, to become the tax collectors \nfor the Nation. It is wrong.\n  This is not about small businesses. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the online tax collection act because that is what this really \nis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. This act will level the playing field for \nsmall business retailers in Minnesota and across the country.\n  I want to thank Senator Enzi for his years of work on this. He had a \nretail shoe store. I thank Senator Durbin, Senator Heitkamp, and \nSenator Alexander for introducing this legislation. This legislation \nwill simply allow States to help their brick-and-mortar retailers, \nincluding the mom-and-pop shops on Main Street, stay competitive in a \nmarketplace where online sales have become a fact of life. The \namendment we offered to the budget resolution today lays the groundwork \nfor passing that legislation. It is a commonsense measure which brings \nour sales tax into the 21st century.\n  In Minnesota, the retail industry includes nearly a half million \nworkers, which is about one in five jobs in our State. Those retailers \nneed to compete on price and service every single day. The current \nsales tax system makes it impossible for them to compete.\n  Senator Cardin spoke about something that is very common around this \ncountry. I have heard the same exact story myself. It is where someone \nwalks into an electronics store and wants to buy a big flat-screen TV, \nand they get the guy who knows everything to come over and point out \nwhat is the best for their needs. The salesman is a very skilled guy. \nHe was hired because he knows what he is doing. He sells the TV, except \nhe doesn't sell it, not for his store. Instead, the customer gets on \ntheir smart phone and buys it online. They buy the same exact model at \nthe same exact price, but because he or she doesn't have to pay the \nsales tax--they are supposed to, by the way, but they don't--they buy \nit online. They end up saving $100 and the brick-and-mortar store, \nwhich pays for employees, sewer, schools, and everything which makes a \nsociety work, loses the sale and cannot compete. It is just not fair. \nIt is just not fair.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. Small businesses have an exemption. \nThe exemption is written in the amendment. People cannot say, well, \njust because they have an exemption, we are going to get rid of the \nexemption in some way. It is an exemption that is a part of the \namendment we are proposing.\n  I am proud to be on this bill. I am proud of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. The Marketplace Fairness Act is common sense, it is \nbipartisan, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Rhode Island, who is a member of the Budget Committee and \nhas worked hard to get us to where we are. I appreciate his input to \nget us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have similar stories to those that \nhave been described on the Senate floor today. Indeed, a former Member \nof this body, who is now the Governor of our State, Governor Chafee, \nwrote to me about a bookstore owner in Middletown, RI. The bookstore \nowner talked about patrons who would browse for books in his store, \nonly to leave without actually making a purchase. He said they would \nmake a list of the books they wanted to buy and then went to get them \nmore cheaply on the Internet.\n  I have been approached by a Rhode Islander who works in a shoe store. \nHe said he has seen people come in and have his employees bring them \nboxes of shoes to try on so they can find the exact size and model shoe \nthey want only to then walk out the door without a purchase. They have \nseen it happen enough that they think what happens is the potential \ncustomer is instead going to an Internet site so they can buy the shoe \nmore cheaply.\n  Now, there are true efficiencies and true benefits to shopping over \nthe Internet. It is very valuable, and it is very sensible. Those are \nreal factors. That is part of progress, and we have no quarrel with \nthat. However, we should not be using discrepancies in taxes to favor \nshoe companies, one over the other, because one sells over the Internet \nand the other sells out of a brick-and-mortar store where people can \nactually come in and try on the shoes.\n  As a result of this loophole, big businesses who do business over the \nInternet have $23 billion to fiddle around with that doesn't go to \nsupport the kind of civic structure of our society--as Senator Franken \ntalked about.\n  The complexities are not that great. There is an existing Streamlined \nSales and Use Tax Agreement that simplifies this immensely. The tax \npayments will very shortly be built into the basic business software. \nThe concern about small businesses is misplaced because we completely \nexempt any business with less than $1 million in annual sales. They \nhave no obligation to comply with this whatsoever.\n  The National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, the National League of Cities, the Retail Industry Leaders \nAssociation, the National Retail Federation, the International Council \nof Shopping Centers, and amazon.com, to their credit, as well as \nAFSCME, support this.\n  I hope we can use the vote on this amendment to show that this is a \npiece of legislation that we are willing to move forward on. Then, of \ncourse, we will have to go through the legislative process of \nauthorization in order to actually pass it into law. The budget \namendment will not pass it into law, but I think it will send an \nimportant signal that will bring everybody to the table and finally get \nus to closure on this important piece of legislation.\n  I will close by thanking Senator Enzi, whom I see on the floor, for \nhis work and his leadership and dedication in trying to get this right \nover 14 years. Before it was as easy as it is now to comply with this, \nhe was working on this. Every year it gets easier. Every year the \nsoftware is able to catch up more. Every year more States join the \nStreamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. He and Senator Durbin have\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\ndone a service to this country with their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Marketplace Fairness Act is about \nleveling the playing field for brick-and-mortar businesses. We have a \nbipartisan and bicameral bill to do just that. So I am pleased to join \nSenators Durbin, Enzi, and many of my colleagues in offering this \nbudget amendment today to add a deficit neutral reserve fund to ensure \nmarketplace fairness by allowing States to enforce their State and \nlocal sales tax laws.\n  This is a big issue in Rhode Island, where businesses have a hard \ntime competing against out-of-State retailers because of outdated rules \nthat require shops on Main Street to collect revenue, but their out-of-\nState online competition does not.\n  When Internet commerce was still in its early stages online companies \nwere basically exempted from collecting State and local sales tax for \nsales to States where they do not have a physical presence despite the \nfact there was an obligation to collect sales tax on those purchases.\n  This puts Main Street businesses at a competitive disadvantage, hurts \nthe ability of Rhode Island to keep jobs in the State, and has strained \nState budgets all across the United States.\n  In 2012, Rhode Island lost out on estimated $70 million in \nuncollected revenue. Revenue that was owed but because of an outdated \nSupreme Court decision went uncollected. It is past time that we fix \nthis loophole.\n  I have talked to a lot of local business owners about this in Rhode \nIsland and many of them say the same thing: Since when is requiring all \ncustomers to pay the same sales tax rate a tax increase?\n  This is a bipartisan proposal. It seeks to keep jobs in our \ncommunities, and bring much-needed revenue to strained State budgets \nall across the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and continued efforts \nto close this long-outstanding loophole.\n  I thank them and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution time \nto my colleague, Senator Wyden of Oregon, who is an outstanding member \nof the Budget Committee. He has been waiting to come and speak. I want \nto thank him as well for his valuable input throughout the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from the Northwest. We \nworked it out so I could talk a little bit about Medicare and taxes as \nwell.\n  Before Senator Enzi leaves, I just want to tell him he is someone who \ngives public service a good name. We have spent a lot of time working \ntogether on a variety of issues, such as tax reform, and particularly \nthis idea of transition rules. I just want to tell the Senator how much \nI appreciate the way he approaches problem solving. I would say to \ncolleagues that what I have not been able to figure out for the 10 \nyears this debate has gone on is how we are going to make this work for \nAmerica's innovators and small businesses. Let me give just a couple \nexamples and be very brief.\n\n  What concerns me most about the bill as it is written today is State \nrevenue collectors, under this legislation, in effect, will be \noutsourcing their jobs to America's small businesses, America's \ninnovators. If the bill passes in its present form, those small \nbusinesses, our innovators, are going to spend their time trying to \nfigure out how to collect all these taxes across the land rather than \ncreating jobs. I don't think that is anything any of us want to do, \nDemocrats or Republicans. That is point No. 1.\n  Second, I wish to talk about the international implications of this \nbill. Senator Murray and I and others, including Senator Baucus, are \nvery close to the border. What concerns me, especially after the legal \nanalysis I received from the Congressional Research Service, is I think \nthe way this bill is going to work, people are going to end up calling \nit the shop Canada bill or maybe the shop Mexico bill or, what is even \nmore ominous, the shop China bill. I wish to describe exactly why that \nis the case using the legal analysis from the Congressional Research \nService.\n  The proposal, of course, requires American businesses to collect \nsales taxes on behalf of 45 State revenue collectors, but it imposes no \nsuch burden on foreign retailers that sell into the United States. So \nan Oregon business would have to collect taxes for New York, but \nChinese firms wouldn't have to collect taxes for any State. Washington \nState businesses would have to collect taxes for Idaho, but Canadian \nfirms are under no such obligation. I ask my colleagues: What is fair \nabout sacking these American small businesses, these entrepreneurs, \nwhich are adding so much value to the new economy, to make it even more \ndifficult for our small businesses to compete with Canadian sellers and \nEuropean sellers and Chinese sellers? This bill as written is going to \nbe a huge boon, for example, for the idea of setting up online \nbusinesses in Canada.\n  Small businesses all across the country, especially those that are \nnear the border, in my view, would have every financial incentive to \nincorporate there. For the life of me, I don't see how that could be \ngood for the American economy or fair to American firms that, for a \nvariety of reasons, are not capable of moving.\n  Senator Alexander was spot on in terms of talking about how we should \nlook to States rights--I am certainly interested in that--but let's not \ndo it so that in a globalized economy, we make it even tougher for \nAmerican innovators to compete.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na legal memorandum that was prepared for me by the Congressional \nResearch Service that describes in great detail the unfairness the so-\ncalled Marketplace Fairness Act would create for American firms in a \nglobal economy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                    July 23, 2012.\n     To: Senator Ron Wyden; Attention: Jayme White\n     From: Steven Maguire, Specialist in Public Finance, 7-7841; \n         Jeanne Grimmett, Legislative Attorney, 7-5046; Erika \n         Lunder, Legislative Attorney, 7-4538\n     Subject: Analysis of Possible Modifications to the \n         Marketplace Fairness Act, S. 1832.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your questions about the \n     ``Marketplace Fairness Act,'' (S. 1832). The Marketplace \n     Fairness Act (MFA) would modify current law to allow state \n     tax authorities to compel out-of-state vendors to collect \n     sales and use taxes. Your office asked CRS to: (1) analyze \n     the impact of expanding the MFA to require foreign sellers to \n     collect and remit sales tax; (2) identify legislative \n     proposals to achieve this and assess if these are consistent \n     with international trade rules; and (3) suggest other taxes \n     that could be collected and remitted if MFA were to become \n     law.\n       Generally, extending state sales and use tax collection \n     authority beyond international borders could be complicated \n     both administratively and legally. Under current law, states \n     may only impose sales and use tax collection responsibilities \n     on out-of-state sellers of goods and services to in-state \n     persons if the seller has a ``physical presence'' in that \n     state. This nexus standard is required by the Commerce Clause \n     of the U.S. Constitution. When no physical presence exists, \n     then the state sales and use taxes would apply to these \n     transactions, though remittance of the tax would fall to the \n     in-state buyer to the extent prescribed by state law. So, \n     when the seller does not have a physical presence in the \n     taxing state, the buyer is typically responsible for \n     remitting the tax to the state.\n       For example, consider a consumer in Virginia who purchases \n     a camera over the Internet or by phone from a retailer based \n     in New York state. The camera retailer does not have an \n     outlet or a physical presence (substantial nexus) in \n     Virginia. The New York retailer is not required to collect \n     New York sales taxes because the transaction does not occur \n     at the retail outlet and the customer is not a resident of \n     New York state. And, the retailer is not required to collect \n     the Virginia sales tax because the retailer has no physical \n     presence in Virginia. The Virginia consumer, however, is \n     required to remit the use tax to the state.\n       Under its authority to regulate commerce, Congress has the \n     power to authorize state action that would otherwise be an \n     unconstitutional burden on interstate or foreign commerce, so \n     long as it is consistent with other provisions in the \n     Constitution. The Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), if enacted, \n     would be an example of Congress exercising that power. Under \n     the MFA, Congress would authorize states to shift the burden \n     for sales and use tax collection from the in-state consumer \n     to the out-of-state seller as long as the state had either \n     adopted the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) \n     or if the state implemented ``minimum simplification \n     requirements.'' If either criteria are met, then the state \n     could impose sales\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n     and use tax collection liability on any remote vendor if the \n     sale was sourced to that state under the sourcing rules in \n     the SSUTA or the act. Neither set of sourcing rules are \n     restricted to physical presence. So, for the states meeting \n     either criteria, the bill would essentially change the nexus \n     standard under the Commerce Clause by removing the \n     requirement that the seller have a physical presence in the \n     taxing state. While the bill would expand the authority of \n     these states to impose sales and use tax collection \n     obligations on remote vendors, it does not provide the states \n     with additional enforcement mechanisms or authority. As \n     discussed below, states could have difficulty in enforcing \n     the law with respect to foreign vendors with little U.S. \n     presence. CRS was not able to find any legislative proposals \n     that would provide such a mechanism. Since no specific piece \n     of legislation has been proposed, the following discussion of \n     possible trade agreement implications is only a general one.\n       Removing the ``physical presence'' requirement does not \n     mean that all remote vendors would be subject to the state \n     collection responsibilities. First and foremost, nexus is \n     also required by the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment. Unlike the Commerce Clause's nexus requirement, \n     Congress may not change the standard required by the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, even if MFA were enacted into \n     law, states could still not impose sales and use tax \n     collection responsibilities on entities that did not have \n     sufficient contact with the state required for due process. \n     Furthermore, it is possible that other domestic laws could \n     also limit the ability of states to impose the collection \n     obligations. For example, state law might contain exceptions \n     or other provisions that limit or remove the liability in \n     some cases.\n       With respect to international law, in general, the United \n     States, or a subdivision thereof, could tax a sale by a non-\n     U.S. merchant to a person in the United States without \n     running afoul of what has been considered to be a consensus \n     view of international law regarding a nation's jurisdiction \n     to prescribe tax laws. As set out in the Restatement (Third) \n     of Foreign Relations Law:\n       A State may exercise jurisdiction to tax a transaction that \n     occurs, originates or terminates in its territory or that has \n     a substantial relation to the state, without regard to the \n     nationality, domicile, residence, or presence of the parties \n     to such a transaction.\n       The Restatement further explains that taxes on transactions \n     that occur, originate or terminate in a state ``include \n     sales, value-added, excise and severance taxes, as well as \n     export taxes and customs duties.'' It further notes that \n     ``states impose sales and excise taxes or customs duties on \n     transactions in or touching the state, regardless of the \n     relationship between the participants and the state,'' but \n     that ``[a]n excise or tariff . . . may be imposed on a person \n     participating in a transaction by reason of that person's \n     relationship to the taxing site even though the transaction \n     occurs outside the state's territory.'' This latter principle \n     would appear to have relevance for Internet or mail order \n     transactions involving non-U.S. vendors, where the sales \n     transaction itself may legally be sited outside the United \n     States but the purchaser is located within this country. \n     Further, under international law, if a state has jurisdiction \n     for prescribing a rule of law, it also has jurisdiction to \n     enforce that rule, be it through judicial or nonjudicial \n     means.\n       At the same time, regardless of its status under \n     international law, a requirement that places the burden of \n     collecting the tax on a non-U.S. vendor with no ties to the \n     United States or a particular U.S. state other than the sales \n     themselves would seemingly pose practical problems with \n     regard to its implementation. It appears difficult to \n     envision a workable mechanism by which the United States \n     could compel such a vendor in a foreign country to collect a \n     U.S. tax. In this regard, punitive trade measures, such as \n     prohibiting the importation of products from foreign \n     companies that fail to collect the tax, would appear to raise \n     issues under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 \n     (GATT 1994). For example, GATT Article XI:1 generally \n     prohibits the imposition of quantitative restrictions on \n     imports from other WTO Member countries and a U.S. measure \n     violating this provision would need to be justified under one \n     of the general exceptions set out at GATT Article XX. It may \n     be that, for practical purposes, implementation of a tax \n     collection requirement imposed on non-U.S. vendors that in \n     fact have no nexus to the U.S. state imposing the tax may \n     call for some sort of reciprocal agreement between the United \n     States and countries in which such vendors are legally \n     constituted. Whether such an agreement is feasible, \n     however, is far from clear and beyond the scope of this \n     memo.\n       Finally, some have noted that U.S. based retailers may \n     respond to the expanded state tax collection authority by \n     shifting operations outside the U.S. to avoid the collection \n     burden. The costs of moving operations and increased shipping \n     costs, however, would seem greater than any benefit conferred \n     by avoiding the collection burden.\n       With regards to your second question, national measures \n     involving the imposition and collection of taxes on Internet \n     and catalog sales of products would implicate international \n     trade obligations involving trade in goods and possibly trade \n     in services. Regarding a tax itself, Article III:2 of the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) \n     prohibits a WTO Member from imposing a sales, excise, or \n     other tax on an imported product in excess of the tax imposed \n     on the like domestic product. In addition, tariffs on \n     products imported into the United States from non-U.S. \n     vendors would be subject to GATT Article II, which prohibits \n     the United States from exceeding the negotiated or ``bound'' \n     rates for particular products contained in the tariff \n     schedule that the United States has submitted to the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) under Article II. Also, as noted \n     above, quantitative restrictions on the importation of \n     products from WTO Member countries are generally prohibited \n     under GATT Article XI: 1. GATT Articles III and XI are \n     generally incorporated into U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) \n     such as the NAFTA. In addition, FTA parties are subject to \n     the tariff rate and tariff reduction commitments made in the \n     FTA regarding goods originating in the territories of the \n     parties.\n       WTO obligations in the General Agreement on Trade in \n     Services (GATS) apply to ``measures by Members affecting \n     trade in services'' and thus, were a U.S. tax collection \n     requirement placed on non-U.S. vendors to qualify as such, \n     the GATS would come into play. For GATS purposes, the measure \n     may be at the federal, state, or local level. According to \n     the WTO Appellate Body, the phrase ``affecting trade in \n     services'' is intended to give the GATS ``a broad reach'' and \n     ``the term `affecting' . . . indicates a broad scope of \n     application.'' Here, the Appellate Body upheld a WTO panel \n     interpretation of the phrase ``measures by Members affecting \n     trade in services'' finding that ``no measures are excluded a \n     priori from the scope of the GATS as defined by its \n     provisions.''\n       ``Trade in services'' would be involved if foreign vendor \n     were considered to be a service provider--likely a provider \n     of retail services--and the Internet or catalog sale fell \n     within one of the modes of providing a service covered by the \n     GATS. Internet or catalog sales may constitute either cross-\n     border provision of a service or the consumption of a service \n     abroad, i.e., the provision of a retailing service from the \n     territory of the vendor into the territory of the U.S. \n     consumer, or the consumption of a retailing service in the \n     territory of the vendor by a U.S. consumer. If the measure \n     were in fact covered by the GATS, the United States would be \n     subject, inter alia, to the GATS most-favored-nation (MFN) \n     obligation, meaning that it would need to accord to the \n     services and service suppliers of any other WTO Member \n     treatment no less favorable than it accords to the like \n     services and service suppliers of any other country.\n       In addition, the United States has made a sectoral \n     commitment under the GATS with respect to retailing services \n     where these two modes of service supply are concerned, thus \n     implicating additional GATS obligations. Thus, to the extent \n     that catalog or Internet sales constitute a retailing \n     service, and the service is provided cross-border or consumed \n     abroad, the United States would be subject to GATS \n     obligations involving market access and national treatment of \n     services and service providers of other WTO Members in the \n     retailing sector. Market access commitments generally involve \n     prohibitions on various types of quantitative restrictions, \n     such as limitations on the total value of service \n     transactions in the sector in the form of a numerical quota. \n     The GATS national treatment obligation requires that, \n     regarding all U.S. measures affecting the supply of services, \n     the United States must accord to services and service \n     suppliers of any other WTO Member treatment no less favorable \n     than that it accords to its own like services and service \n     suppliers. U.S. free trade agreements also contain \n     obligations involving trade in services, including MFN \n     obligations and national treatment obligations that are not \n     premised on specific sectoral commitments.\n       While U.S. trade agreements do not appear to expressly \n     address a situation where a foreign service provider of one \n     agreement party is required by another agreement party to \n     collect sales, excise or similar taxes on sales made by the \n     former in the territory of the latter, the obligations \n     described above would be relevant if a case can be made that \n     the requirement is covered by the GATS or the services \n     chapter of an FTA. Further, were a quantitative restriction \n     placed on retail sales services by a foreign service provider \n     to U.S. consumers as a punitive measure for non-collection of \n     sales taxes, GATS market access commitments may well be \n     implicated. As is the case with the GATT, a measure that \n     violates a GATS obligation may be justified under a GATS \n     general exception if all the requirements of the exception \n     are met.\n       Regarding your third question, the proposed MFA is narrowly \n     focused on sales and use taxes and would not allow for states \n     to use this new authority for the collection of any other \n     taxes:\n       No obligation imposed by virtue of the authority granted by \n     this Act shall be considered in determining whether a seller \n     or any other person has a nexus with any State for any tax \n     purpose other than sales and use taxes.\n       The MFA also expressly provides that:\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as--\n       (1) subjecting a seller or any other person to franchise, \n     income, occupation, or any other type of taxes, other than \n     sales and use taxes,\n       (2) affecting the application of such taxes, or\n       (3) enlarging or reducing State authority to impose such \n     taxes.\n       If you have any questions, please call Steven Maguire on 7-\n     7841, Jeanne Grimmett on 7-5046, or Erika Lunder on 7-4538.\n\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will just wrap up with this. As \ncolleagues look at this--and we are going to have plenty of debate--\nlet's think through the implications of what the administrative water \ntorture is going to be all about for small businesses and why it \ndoesn't make more sense for State tax collectors to do their job, No. \n1; and No. 2, let us not make it harder for American small business to \ncompete in tough global markets. It is plenty tough as it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is encouraging that for the first time \nin 4 years the Senate is considering a budget resolution. The absence \nof a resolution during this time has contributed to a breakdown in the \nlegislative process. As a result, we have operated the Federal \nGovernment without a blueprint for revenues or spending.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution being considered by the Senate \ndoes not reflect a workable effort to get our country back on a \nsustainable path.\n  But rather than setting us on a new path toward a more affordable, \nefficient, and effective Federal Government, the Budget Committee has \nlaid out a plan for higher taxes and more spending. It does not even \npretend to balance the budget. Support of this budget would represent \nsupport for a bigger Federal Government and a weaker economy.\n  I have heard from many of the hard-working citizens in my State who \nare ready for better economic times and more opportunities to improve \ntheir lives. Our priority should be to help strengthen the economy and \nget government spending under control. The Obama administration has \nembraced a course which locks us into higher and higher deficits for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  I am hopeful we can amend this resolution to produce a serious \nproposal that will lead to a more efficient, more effective Federal \nGovernment that better serves hard-working Americans rather than \nincreasing the government's burden upon them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 3 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nMinnesota, and then she will take her 30 minutes as the chairman of the \nJoint Economic Committee following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for her great \nleadership. I also wish to thank Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin on the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. This is a bill and an amendment that needs to \npass. It is incredibly important to small businesses, big businesses, \nand to people across this country who work for retailers.\n  When I travel around my State, I hear from small, locally owned \nretailers about the competitive disadvantage they face against online \nretailers, small businesses such as Creative Kidstuff that sells \neducational and developmental books for kids and Thrifty White \nPharmacy, a full-service, employee-owned drugstore.\n  Right now, States are currently unable to require out-of-State or \nonline-only retailers to collect sales tax and it puts local mom-and-\npop stores at a disadvantage. Not only that, but this tax loophole is \ndraining billions of dollars in lost revenues from State and local \ngovernments--$23 billion last year alone across the country.\n  In effect, this tax loophole subsidizes some taxpayers at the expense \nof others and some businesses over others. That is why we call this the \nMarketplace Fairness Act.\n  I have been committed to a competitive agenda for this country since \nI got to the Senate, and part of that agenda includes not only \nencouraging competition and innovation, but it is also about having an \neven playing field for our businesses. Minnesota alone lost about $394 \nmillion in 2011 from out-of-State sales that are legally due but not \ncollected. This lost revenue translates into over 7 percent of \nMinnesota's general sales tax liability in 2011. That is what we are \ntalking about. This is real money.\n  One of the longstanding principles of tax fairness is that similarly \nsituated taxpayers should be taxed similarly. A bookstore on Grand \nAvenue in St. Paul has to charge a sales tax, while an online retailer \nselling that same book hundreds of miles away does not. A consumer \nbuying a T-shirt in downtown Duluth is taxed differently than his \nfriend who is buying that same T-shirt on the Internet. Someone buying \na TV at Best Buy--hometown company--in Richfield, MN, is taxed \ndifferently than if he buys the same TV online.\n  Our current situation encourages tax avoidance, undermines our tax \nsystem, and ultimately creates a competitive disadvantage for brick-\nand-mortar retailers at a time when we want them to succeed.\n  I am so excited that there is a bipartisan group of Senators \nsupporting this bill. Our momentum is growing. We can see it today on \nthe floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of some \nof the supporters from my State that includes major stores such as \nTarget and Best Buy to the Uffda Shop in Red Wing, MN. I have shopped \nthere and I suggest my colleagues do the same. It also includes Mary's \nMorsels & Catering and Sleepy Eye Floral & Design, to give my \ncolleagues just a sense of the hundreds of companies that support this \nin Minnesota.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Stand With MainStreet.com.]\n\n       Minnesota imposes a sales tax that brick-and-mortar \n     retailers (and their websites) collect at the time of \n     purchase and remit to the state. Today some online-only \n     retailers (including Amazon.com) are exploiting a loophole \n     that allows them to not collect Minnesota sales tax on these \n     same purchases, placing the burden on consumers to self-\n     report and pay that tax directly. However, few do. This gives \n     online sellers a competitive advantage by not collecting the \n     tax and creating the perception that online-only purchases \n     are ``tax free.'' The Minnesota Legislature is considering a \n     proposal to require large online-only retailers to collect \n     sales tax at the time of purchase like brick-and-mortar \n     retailers are already required to do and to bring fairness to \n     the marketplace. Competition among businesses, whether they \n     operate on the Internet or in Minnesota communities, is \n     important. The proposal being considered by the Legislature \n     establishes fairness for a 21st century marketplace and makes \n     sure that all sellers have the same tax collection \n     obligations.\n\n                         E-Fairness Supporters\n\n\n                         Statewide businesses;\n\n       Target; Walmart Home Depot; JCPenny; Best Buy; Creative \n     Kidstuff; Barnes & Noble; Sears; Thrifty White Pharmacy; \n     Walgreens.\n\n\n                            Small businesses\n\n       Hennen's Furniture; Happy Sleeper Furniture; Quality \n     Appliance & TV Center; Roberts Fine Jewelry; Eichorn's \n     Furniture; Brownie Furniture; Jenia's Appliance & TV; \n     Woodwards Books; Puffes Fine Jewelry; Ferrin's Furniture; Red \n     Wing Appliance; Wanshura Jewelers; Johnson-Mertz Appliance; \n     Garon Bros Jewelers; Security Jewelers; First Photo; \n     Bookstore at Fitgers; Ski Hut; Explorations; J Skylark Co.\n       Toys for Keeps; Logan's Furniture; Appliance Village Co. \n     Master Jeweler; Waconia Farm Supply; Factory Direct \n     Furniture; Linsk Flowers; Drury's Furniture; Grand Jete; \n     Schroeder's Appliance Center Kern's Appliances; Bethany Book \n     & Gift; Cycle City; Bob & Frans Factory Direct; Cattale's \n     Books & Gifts; Uff da Shop; Rick's Home Furnishings; Yetzer's \n     Home Furnishing; Vacuum Cleaner Outlet & Services; Valley \n     Bookseller; Bakkum Enterprises, LLC; Mary's Morsels & \n     Catering LLC.\n       Spicer Bike & Sports; Uncle Hugo's Science Fiction; \n     Bookstore/Uncle Edgar's Mystery Bookstore; T & M Athletics; \n     Artistic Floral; Dieknnan's Jewelry; Rhoda's Closet Inc. \n     Hillary's; Pete's Surplus; Christian Book Store; Glenwood \n     Floral & Greenhouses; Kraning Jewelry Inc.; Jenny & Co; The \n     Framing Place and Gallery; Yarn Harbor; Gem Classics Inc.; \n     Teske's Jewerly Inc.; Adventure Cycle and Ski; Bissen's \n     Tavern; J B Off Sale Liquor.\n       Casey's Bar Inc.; Country Rose Floral; Collins Feed & Seed \n     Center; Liquor Mart; A Johnson and Sons Florist; Kalli's \n     Place; That Special Touch Flower Shop; Strom Clothing Co.; \n     Thomas Liquors; Dar's Pub Inc.; Judy's House of Gifts; \n     Suzanne's Jewelry; Big Guys Bar; Beltone Hearing Care Center; \n     Woodwards Books, Yarns, Fabrics; Anderson Memorials Inc.; \n     Eastside Express; Northwedge Greenhouse; Tradewind Products \n     Art II (Framing & Art Supplies).\n       Fleur de lis; Replay MMG; Sleepy Eye Floral and Design; \n     Chapel of Love; Grand Performance; Uncle Louie's Cafe; OFF \n     Sale Liquor; Artistic Treasures; Phillson Award Etc.

Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks by saying \nthis is an opportunity to help our State and local governments, but it \nis a big opportunity to help the employees and workers of this country \nwho work every day, showing those TVs, making sense of things, \nexplaining how things work, going to work every day, putting those \nflowers in the vases. They deserve an equal playing field. This \namendment does it.\n  I am now going to begin my 30 minutes of Joint Economic Committee \ntime. I am the vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee, which is a \njoint committee with the House and I am the Senate chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes, that Senator \nTester be permitted to speak for up to 8 minutes, that Senator Sanders \nbe permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes, that I then again be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes, and that Senator Franken be \npermitted to speak for up to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to first thank Senator Murray \nagain for her leadership on the Budget Committee. Day in and day out, \nmonth in and month out, she has been working on this budget and she has \nachieved, along with the committee, a smart, balanced proposal for \nmeeting our country's fiscal challenges.\n  This is not the first time I have come to the Senate floor to talk \nabout the critical need for a balanced approach and to bring down our \ndebt in a balanced way, but this is the first time in a long time I \nhave actually felt optimistic that we are going to get a budget through \nthe Senate and optimistic that there are a lot of stirrings of \nbipartisanship and compromise. While our budget, as has been pointed \nout and I will point out, is very different than the House budget, I \nthink there are still grains of compromise there. We have seen this \nwillingness in the Senate, with our Republican colleagues, to talk \nabout bringing the debt down, whether it is the Gang of 6 or the Gang \nof 8 or whether it is the work of Simpson-Bowles or the work done with \nthe Rivlin-Domenici group. These are all reasonable proposals. We don't \nagree with everything in them, but they are all reasonable proposals \nand they contain some balance.\n  The other reason I am optimistic is that we have a great opportunity \nhere. I was reminded of this last week when former Republican Senator \nJudd Gregg testified before our Joint Economic Committee. He actually \nparaphrased the Foreign Minister of Australia saying, ``The United \nStates is one debt deal away from leading the entire world out of \neconomic doldrums.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Look at the economic news we have had in just \nthe last month. We know there is so much work to do, that there are too \nmany people unemployed, and there is too much investment that is not \nbeing made. But we also know that we saw the best month for \nunemployment numbers than we have seen in 4 years. We are seeing a \nturnaround in the construction market. We are seeing a turnaround in \nthe housing market. I can tell my colleagues that in my State, we have \nunemployment that is at about 5.6 percent. So we are seeing progress, \nbut we have more to do. The last thing we need to do now is to go \nbackward. We need to go forward, and that is what Senator Murray's \nbudget does in a very balanced way.\n  As I have said many times before, we are talking about balance. I \nbelieve the Senate budget achieves the right equilibrium. It includes \nan equal mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from closing \nloopholes and ending wasteful spending in the Tax Code. Our proposal \nbuilds on the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction we have already \nreceived--I don't think every citizen knows that--$2.4 trillion. Let's \nremember 70 percent of that was spending cuts and the other 30 percent \nwas revenue. That is a balance. It is not exactly the balance we wanted \non our side of the aisle, but if we were to adopt the House budget \nright now, we would be at, if we include the past revenues, 10-to-1 \nspending cuts to revenue. That is not the balance we are seeing in the \nother proposals that have been made by these bipartisan groups.\n  How does our budget do this? The additional debt reduction to the \n$2.4 trillion we have done to get to over $4 trillion in debt \nreduction--first of all, $975 billion in targeted cuts and $975 billion \nin revenue. Again, this will help us to surpass the bipartisan goal of \n$4 trillion and put our debt-to-GDP ratio at about 70 percent.\n  Some of the most important points in the Senate budget include the \nfact that it replaces sequestration--which is just a hammer--with \nsmart, targeted cuts while also making critical investments in areas \nsuch as education, workforce training, and infrastructure.\n  When I get out in our State with our unemployment rate at 5.6 \npercent, I hear time and time again that there are jobs unfilled, that \nwe need to train workers, that we need our high school kids to be going \ninto trades again, to be going into technology, math, and science. This \nbudget accounts for that. It produces savings in Medicare and Medicaid \nby eliminating waste and fraud, promoting efficiency, and emphasizing \ncost alignment. We know a little bit about this in Minnesota, with the \nMayo Clinic and the way we deliver health care in a high-quality, low-\ncost way.\n  One study out of Dartmouth showed that if they simply used in the \nrest of the hospitals across the country the cost-effective ways of the \nMayo Clinic, we could save $50 billion--$50 billion in 5 years with \nchronically ill patients. That gives a sense of what we are talking \nabout when we talk about high-quality, low-cost care.\n  Our budget also recognizes there is a massive amount of spending that \ntakes place through the Tax Code to the tune of over $1 trillion per \nyear in tax expenditures.\n  I come from a State with a thriving renewable energy sector, and 2 \nyears ago we agreed to let the ethanol tax credit expire at the end of \n2011, which saved billions of dollars. In fact, that was $60 billion in \n10 years--$60 billion. I do not understand why the oil industry cannot \nfollow ethanol's lead. I am proud of the work they are doing. I have \nbeen out to Lewiston. I have seen the drilling in North Dakota. It has \nhelped to increase our own domestic oil production and decrease our \ndependency on foreign oil. But I do not believe the oil companies still \nneed $40 billion in 10 years. That is a lot of money we could bring in \nto reduce the debt.\n  We can make other commonsense changes. One I would propose is with \nthe home mortgage deduction, very near and dear to everyone's heart. \nCap it at $500,000 in value of a home. If you buy a million-dollar \nhome, great. Then you get it for up to $500,000 in value of the home. \nThat brings in tens of billions of dollars in debt reduction.\n  All told, the proposal that is coming out of Senator Murray's budget \nreduces the deficit by approximately $2 trillion. If enacted, our debt \nwill continue on a downward path, where our debt-to-GDP ratio will be, \nas I mentioned, about 70 percent. The Congressional Budget Office has \nstated that a debt-to-GDP ratio in that range would also result in a 1-\npercent increase in the size of the economy in that year.\n  We cannot discount the impact that a growing economy can have on \ndeficit\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\nreduction. CBO expects GDP growth to be above 3 percent in 3 of the \nnext 4 years. As the economy grows, we will see more revenue, and we \nwill see lower deficits.\n  Former CBO Director Alice Rivlin, who just testified last week at a \nJoint Economic Committee hearing on the very topic of debts and \ndeficits, said this:\n\n       The really important thing is to keep the debt from growing \n     faster than the economy.\n\n  I could not agree more. Deficit reduction must be paired with \neconomic growth. This is where we need to be, and I am optimistic that \nultimately--while we have many differences that we are going to hear a \nlot about today--ultimately, we are going to come together on something \nthat works for America.\n  Unlike the proposal in the House, I will tell you the Senate budget \npreserves and protects Medicare, ensuring that it is there for our \nseniors today and strong for our children and grandchildren tomorrow.\n  I firmly believe we can make some reforms to our Social Security \nsafety net, and that those reforms--that money--can go right back into \nSocial Security to keep it solvent. On the Medicare front, there are \nmany things we can do without reducing the benefits for our current \nseniors, for the people who deserve that help.\n  Look at what we could do. The VA negotiates prescription drug prices \nand gets much less expensive drug prices for high-quality drugs. Right \nnow, we do not do that with Medicare. By negotiating prescription drug \nprices under Medicare Part D, you could produce $240 billion in savings \nover 10 years right there. Why not leverage the power of America's \nseniors? They have a lot of power.\n  We all agree we need to reduce our debt. But our ultimate goal is not \nsimply a balanced budget; it is a budget that is balanced.\n  Let's look at what goes on with the Ryan budget. Well, the Ryan \nbudget gives millionaires a huge tax cut, drastically lowering their \nincome tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent.\n  Last year, the Joint Economic Committee, on which I serve, estimated \nthat a similar plan introduced would have given millionaires an \nadditional $285,000 in tax breaks, while hitting the average middle-\nclass family with a $1,300 tax hike.\n  He also claims his tax cuts for the wealthy, which would cost about \n$4.5 trillion--and I say that because I believe they would be paid for \nby the middle class--will not add to the deficit. But Ryan refuses to \nname one specific loophole or expenditure that his budget would \neliminate to pay for the tax cuts.\n  Some experts project that such extreme cuts, as we would see in his \nbudget, would cost jobs. I believe that is true. That is why, as we are \nseeing this improvement in stabilization of our economy, we need to do \nthings in a balanced way over the long term. We need to send the clear \nmessage that we are reducing this debt and get to our goal of $4 \ntrillion in debt reduction in 10 years. But we simply cannot do it by \ndoing it on the backs of the middle class who are still struggling in \nthis country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this budget proposal. It is time to \nget it done. I truly see this as a time of opportunities not only in \nthe next 2 days to get the budget done, but also in the next few months \nas we negotiate with our colleagues across the aisle to get a budget \nfor America.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I now yield 8 minutes to Senator Tester of Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota. \nI thank her very much for her comments.\n  I rise to join my colleagues who understand the need to strengthen \nour economy while taking responsible steps to reduce our deficit.\n  Four short years ago we were coming out of the worst economic \nrecession, depression, since the dirty thirties. Today, this country \nneeds a budget that tells Americans we are serious about growing our \neconomy and creating jobs. Strengthening our economy will increase \neconomic opportunities for all Americans and allow small businesses to \nexpand and hire more workers. But a stronger economy will also help us \nreduce our deficit without cutting the investments that lay the \ngroundwork for a better future for our kids and grandkids: investments \nin education, in infrastructure, in our health, investments in our \nveterans.\n  That is why the budget we are debating today is the responsible path \nforward for this Nation. It sets forth our priorities. It reduces our \ndeficit without cutting the legs out from underneath our economy. It \nalso tells Americans that we are not going to sacrifice those critical \ninvestments to strengthen our economy and enable our economy to grow.\n\n  Montanans know what it is like to live within their means. We do not \nspend what we do not have. And our State government is required to have \na balanced budget. That is why Montana is one of the few States that \nsurvived the recession without dropping into the red. I am going to get \ninto that in another area shortly.\n  We cannot tear the Federal Government apart to make up for the \ndecisions that put us here in the first place. Ten years ago, we put \ntwo wars on the credit card at the same time we drastically cut taxes. \nThose choices quickly squandered the budget surplus we had in the \n1990s.\n  Today the Republican plan approved by the House, known as the Ryan \nbudget, uses tricks and gimmicks and smoke and mirrors to balance the \nbudget. It sacrifices the welfare of our seniors, our students, and our \nveterans to get us back to the good old days.\n  It ends Medicare as we know it. It hands seniors a voucher that down \nthe road will grow at half the rate of anticipated medical costs. Under \ntheir plan, for a procedure that a senior can afford today, tomorrow \nthey will get a voucher for a part of what that procedure will cost, \nand they will be told: You make up the rest. And if you don't, too bad.\n  The Ryan plan also freezes Pell grants for students at a time when \neducation costs continue to grow too fast for middle-class families to \nafford. Pell grants, education--a major driver in our economy.\n  It also makes it harder for low-income and unemployed veterans to get \nthe health care they need. The Ryan plan is what I speak of. It cuts \nfunding for women's health care and reduces coverage for preventative \nhealth services, such as cancer screenings--affecting 47 million women \nacross this country. It does this while protecting tax loopholes for \nlarge corporations and failing to invest in roads and bridges. And the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota knows all about bridges that collapse. \nShe had one collapse in Minnesota. Those investments are necessary.\n  If you balance the budget by taking the country apart, what is the \npoint of balancing the budget?\n  Now, there is no doubt we must reduce the deficit, and the Democratic \nplan responsibly cuts our deficit by putting us on a responsible long-\nterm path that gets our fiscal house in order while investing in \ninitiatives that grow our economy. It reduces the deficit by nearly $2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. Now, that is not chump change, and \nthat is on top of the work we have already done over the last few years \nto reduce the deficit by $1.6 trillion. It does this while protecting \nseniors, women's health, middle-class families, and students.\n  Here is the kicker: Only the Democratic plan reforms the Tax Code and \nputs those savings toward deficit reduction. The Republican plan \nspecifically forbids new revenue from tax reform to go to lower the \ndeficit. For a party that claims balancing the budget is its holy \ngrail, it is puzzling that Republicans want to use tax revenue to pay \nfor more tax cuts. This is just one of many radical proposals and \nbudget gimmicks they are proposing.\n  If you are for a balanced budget, then you must be for balanced \ndeficit reduction. Every bipartisan commission that has looked at the \nproblem agrees: to responsibly balance the books, you need to save \nmoney through a comprehensive plan that cuts spending, reforms \nentitlements, and fixes our Tax Code--and uses that savings to pay down \nthe debt.\n  The time for commissions and working groups is past. We should have \nlearned those lessons. We are here now to do the work to get our long-\nterm deal to fix the budget. We will have to\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\ncompromise, and that is the way it should be, because working together \nis what built this country. But only one plan is closer to where we \nneed to be at the end of this debate. The Democratic plan cuts \nspending, keeps in place reforms to our health care system, and \nmandates the tax reform we need.\n  Tax reform will not be easy, but there are a few things that should \nnot be hard to agree on either. I think tax loopholes for big oil and \ngas companies and corporations that ship jobs overseas should be wiped \noff the books.\n  We have two paths we can follow. One path drags this economy into a \nditch by dismantling Medicare and cutting investments in infrastructure \nand our future. The other path takes a balanced approach to put this \ncountry on the road to long lasting economic growth and stability.\n  We have been lurching from one crisis to another for far too long. It \nhas hurt job growth because businesses are holding back. They do not \nknow where the debate in Washington is headed.\n  Offering them more certainty and strengthening this economy is \nsomething we need to do. We need to do it in a responsible way. We need \nto come together around a plan that strengthens our economy in the \nshort term while taking real steps to reduce our deficit in the long \nterm.\n  Senator Murray's plan is a better choice. It meets the needs of the \nAmerican people. It shows them we are willing to lead. That is what we \nwere sent here to do.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TESTER. Perfect. Let me also take 2 minutes to comment on an \namendment that some of my colleagues spoke of that will be filed to \nthis resolution.\n\n  It is an amendment that would not only impose new burdens on small \nbusinesses but would also fundamentally alter the rights of States by \nallowing them to tax entities located outside their borders.\n  Now, I heard a few Senators earlier today advocating for the \nelimination of the current standard that only allows States to tax \nentities with a physical presence in that State.\n  Montana is one of those States that does not pay a sales tax. We do \nnot want a sales tax. It has been on the ballot a number of times. It \nhas been voted down by the people every time. But under the provisions \nthat some in this Chamber are pushing, small businesses in Montana \nwould be forced to do the bidding of the departments of revenue in \nother States by collecting and remitting their sales taxes.\n  Montana's budget is currently operating at a surplus--without a sales \ntax. The idea that other States would balance their budgets on the \nbacks of Montana's hard-working businesses is not only wrong, it is \nflat insulting.\n  This is an unfunded mandate on Montana's small businesses, and it is \na slippery slope of what businesses will do to take their collections \nout of State.\n  Where is it going to go from here? Agricultural products grown and \nraised in Montana and marketed in other States? This is an aberration \nof States rights--rights which so many in this Chamber say they \nsupport. I would urge my colleagues to vote against any measures that \nwould gut these States rights.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Minnesota and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is our agreement at this point?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the Joint Economic Committee has 30 \nminutes on our side, and I do not know on the Republican side. I think \nwe are about halfway or more into it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You are into it?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining in the period of \ntime allotted for Joint Economic Committee remarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator would like to speak for a minute or so, \nif he has something he would like to say.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciated Senator Tester's remarks \nand his belief that Montanans believe they should live within their \nmeans, and he supports a plan to reduce the deficit. But I just want to \nshare with my colleagues that the budget that is before us today is not \nbalanced. It does not reduce the deficit. It taxes a lot more, but its \nspending increases at the same level, and there is no net change in the \nunsustainable debt course we are on.\n  He said it reduces the deficit by $2 trillion. I want you to know \nthat is what the Budget Committee claims for that budget, but it is not \naccurate. It does not reduce the deficit $2 trillion. It does not. It \nkeeps us on the same path.\n  It is not a balanced deficit reduction plan, because it doesn't \nreduce the deficit. It increases taxes and increases spending, if you \ncall that balance. It is not the right kind of plan. I wish we could \nget together on fundamentals of numbers in that budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I think we have made our case here with \nthe $975 billion in spending cuts that are contained in the budget, and \nthe fact that to date we have made $2.4 trillion in debt reduction, and \nof that 70 percent or $1.5 trillion has been spending cuts. What we are \nsimply trying to do with this budget is keep this balanced approach to \nnot set an economy--which was literally on its heels a few years ago--\nback in the same place. We want to do deficit reduction. We want to \ngive our businesses the kind of consistency and incentive to invest, \nbut not do it in a way which Chairman Bernanke has said would cause a \nsharp contraction by doing too much too soon at once on the backs of \nthe middle class and seniors. I am very hopeful in the coming months I \nwill be able to find some kind of compromise and agreement with our \ncolleagues.\n  The American people are tired of the gridlock. They want to see \npeople are willing to work together. I truly believe courage is not \njust standing alone but standing next to someone you don't always agree \nwith for the betterment of this country. Senator Sessions and I have \nworked very well together on Judiciary matters, and I wish to continue \nto do this on the budget.\n  Turning to another matter, I spoke about marketplace fairness, and I \nsupport that amendment to this bill. I also want to talk about the \nmedical device tax repeal. As I mentioned before, one of my major \nfocuses in the Senate has been on an innovation agenda, the idea we \nshould manufacture items in this country, invent things, and export to \nthe world. This is how we are going to get out of the current situation \nwe are in. I believe we can do it.\n  We need to do it by promoting innovation all across this country. My \nState has a long history of innovation, bringing the world everything \nfrom the pacemaker to the Post-it note. We are home to one of the \nworld's leading medical device companies, Medtronic, started by Earl \nBakken in his garage. It is not just the large medical device companies \nand their employees who keep this industry running, the small- and \nmedium-sized companies and their entrepreneurs are incredibly vital as \nwell.\n  In Minnesota we have over 400 medical device companies employing more \nthan 35,000 people across the State. This thriving technology, the \nmedical technology sector, has been one of the keys to our success and \none of the bright spots in America's economy. When you look at the \npotential for exports, as you see a growing middle class in China and \nin India, people are finally going to the hospital. They are beginning \nto receive good health care. We have a great potential here for more \njobs in America as long as we do this correctly.\n  The United States is currently the largest net exporter of medical \ndevices in the world, yielding a trade surplus of roughly $5.4 billion \na year. Medical device companies are also responsible for creating \nmillions of high-paying, highly skilled American jobs, exactly the \nkinds of jobs we want in this country. These are the kinds of jobs \nwhere every parent sends their kid to high school and says, is he or \nshe going to learn something which will create a job? I am looking at \nour pages right now, and I can tell you medical device jobs are one of \nthose kinds of jobs.\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n  In order to ensure our country remains a world leader in medical \ndevice innovation, we need to address the 2.3-percent excise tax on \nmedical devices. As you know, this came out through the Affordable Care \nAct. At the time I opposed that tax. We negotiated and were able to get \nit halved from $40 billion to $20 billion in 10 years. It still isn't \nright because it creates too much of a burden.\n  Medical device manufacturers are not the ones which are going to get \nmultiple new customers, millions of new customers out of the increase \nin coverage in the health care bill. Pharmaceuticals might. They \nnegotiated something. Think about it. A lot of medical devices are used \nby people who are older. They tend to have health care coverage with \nMedicare and other things. This is the issue here is this is not at the \nright rate, this is not the right tax, and it should be repealed. The \ntax is a burden on medical device businesses but, most importantly, it \nis a disincentive for jobs. It stifles innovation, and it makes it more \ndifficult for the next generation of lifesaving devices to make it to \nthe market. I have been fighting to reduce it, repeal it, and to delay \nit since the first day it was introduced. At the end of last year, I \nrallied a record number of Democratic Senators behind the effort. While \nwe couldn't get an agreement included in the fiscal cliff negotiations, \nwe had great traction. I think there were 18 or 19 Democratic Senators \nin strong support.\n  I see Senator Coats from Indiana, as part of the strong support we \nhad on the Republican side for repealing this tax.\n  This is why Senator Hatch and I have filed an amendment to the budget \nresolution to repeal this tax and help give these businesses and their \nemployees the certainty and stability they need to keep researching, \ndeveloping, and inventing the next medical breakthrough. Our amendment \nnow has the support of 28 of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle. I am hoping we can continue to work in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield 2 minutes to my colleague Senator Franken of Minnesota to \nspeak about this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise today to speak about the promise of biomedical \ninnovation in our country, as did Senator Klobuchar. I talk a lot about \nthe importance of biomedical innovation because in my home State of \nMinnesota there are 400 medical device companies, and there are more \nthan 30,000 employees who support our economy while creating high-\nquality jobs. They do it while saving and improving patients' lives.\n  The industry is being punished for its innovation and growth. The \nmedical device tax is cutting into the proceeds which go toward \nresearch and development and workforce training. By taxing companies on \nthe first dollar of sales, they are especially hurting the very small \ncompanies, the startup companies, which may not be in profit yet. This \nis why I am happy to join with Senator Klobuchar, with Senator Hatch, \nin filing this amendment to the budget resolution to allow for the \nrepeal of the medical device tax. This amendment is an important first \nstep toward fully repealing the tax and providing much-needed relief \nfor our innovators and doing it in a fiscally responsible way.\n  Along with Senator Klobuchar, I fought this tax from the beginning. \nThe health care law will insure 30 million new Americans while also \nimproving the health care of every American citizen. While I am proud \nto be a champion of that law, I believe the medical device tax is not \nthe way to pay for it.\n  On this point, I disagree with the Obama administration, as I did \nfrom the beginning. Senator Klobuchar also disagreed from the \nbeginning. We fought against the tax and ultimately we were successful \nin getting it cut in half from what it was when it came out of the \nFinance Committee.\n  As a member of the HELP Committee, I will continue to improve our \nregulatory process. I am very proud I had a part in helping create the \nMedical Device Innovation Consortium, a private-public partnership in \nthis industry which is a first of its kind. Part of this, I believe, is \nthe full repeal of the Medical Device Act. As a first step, I ask my \ncolleagues join those of us who are cosponsors of this critical \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Senator Franken for his strong words in \nsupport of this amendment. I thank him for being a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  May I ask how much remains on the Joint Economic time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I want to thank the Senators who joined me today as we \nwork to advance a smart, balanced approach for meeting our country's \nfiscal challenges. The time is ripe for common ground on a budget plan \nto move the economy forward. While I don't know if we will have that \nbipartisan plan in the next few days, I think we will get a budget \nthrough this Chamber which will pave the way for the kinds of \nbipartisan negotiations we need to have. We need to keep this country \nmoving, and moving in the direction we need.\n  When I go out there and talk to small companies throughout my State, \nthey want us to get something done. They want to have consistency so we \nare not playing green light, red light with the Tax Code; that they \nknow exactly where they stand. I think they all acknowledge everyone is \ngoing to have to sacrifice a little here. I think they acknowledge we \nare going to have to do something which makes a difference and not just \nspeak about it anymore. We have not only the opportunity but the \nresponsibility to find common ground on a deficit reduction plan which \nwill help build a stronger, more resilient framework for economic \nrenewal so families and businesses have the certainty they need.\n  I think we know neither party is going to get everything it wishes, \nbut this doesn't mean we can put our heads in the sand and pretend this \nisn't happening. I truly appreciate my Republican colleagues. When we \nmeet behind closed doors and speak about this, they have a willingness \nto compromise. I think this is what will happen in the future. However, \nour job in the next 2 days is to get a fair budget through a balanced \nbudget.\n  This is what Senator Murray's budget is. I have been part of this, \nand I look forward to working with her and our colleagues in the future \nto show the American people we can stand tall and do what is right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today as the senior Senate \nRepublican of the Joint Economic Committee to discuss one of the most \nfundamental issues this body confronts on a year-to-year basis, or at \nleast should confront on a year-to-year basis, which is passing a \nbudget through which we could operate the rest of the year and measure \nhow we spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars.\n  Unfortunately, we haven't had one of these budgets for 4 years. I am \npleased we finally have arrived at this particular point. I will speak \nabout that in more detail.\n  A few years back when I was serving as Ambassador to Germany, I made \ncalls on the various ministers. They would be equivalent to cabinet \nsecretaries in our country. I would always try to get a little \nbackground information on them before I went to see if we had anything \nin common, or an ice breaker to start the conversation.\n  I was calling on one of the ministers and noticed, reading his \nbackground first, his birth date was the same as mine. It was a \nmilestone birthday. We were both born in 1943. At the time, the date of \nmy seeing him was just a couple of months after we both celebrated our \n60th birthday.\n  To break the ice, I said to him: Mr. Minister, we have something in \ncommon.\n  He said: What is that?\n  I said: We both were born on the same day. Therefore, we both reached \na very important milestone in life.\n  He looked at me seriously and said: And how are you doing with all of \nthis?\n  I said: Well, I am doing fine. I don't feel any different, and I \ndon't think I think any different. It is almost as if the number is \nmeaningless.\n  He looked at me seriously and said: You are in serious major denial. \nThis is a big deal. This is a major milestone.\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\n  Well, ever since he said that, I have been wondering, gosh, is that \nlittle pain in the right shoulder the beginning of more problems and so \nforth?\n  It reminded me of the situation we faced here when others have said \nthe debt problem we have is not a major problem or that we don't have a \nspending problem. It reminded me of the minister who said: You have to \nbe in major denial.\n  Year after year, we are spending a lot more money than we take in, \nand there is no end in sight to that. Mandatory spending alone on \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is projected \nto double in a few years' time. It is estimated each new child born \ntoday will inherit $50,000 or more of debt, which they will need to pay \noff as they grow, go through their education years, and become part of \nour economy. They are going to be saddled with this ever-growing debt.\n  My three latest grandchildren, Grace, Charlie, and Avery, all young, \njust a few years old, are inheriting a very significant amount of debt \nwhich will saddle and stifle their opportunities to participate in the \nAmerican dream and enjoy many of the same opportunities many of my \ngeneration have had.\n  Interest rates were held down by the Fed at historically low levels. \nWe might also be facing our day of reckoning. I had the opportunity to \nspeak with the Fed Chairman some time back. He indicated we are running \nout of tools here at the Fed to address these problems. The people up \nthe street who handle the fiscal issues, not the monetary issues, need \nto stand up and address the problem.\n  I think we all know we can only keep interest rates low for so long. \nIt is important to understand a 1-percent point increase in interest \nrates would add over $1 trillion to the United States debt in a 10-year \nperiod of time. These historically low rates are not going to stay \nhistorically low forever. They are going to rise as investors lose \nconfidence in America's ability to pay off their debts in the future if \nwe keep plunging into the level of debt and deficit spending which has \nbeen taking place here over the last several years. Eventually, we are \ngoing to reach that tipping point, and when we reach that tipping \npoint, investors and consumers lose confidence. When that happens, \ninterest rates rise. When interest rates rise, it impacts our economy \nin a very significant, negative way. All we have to do is look across \nthe Atlantic, in Europe, to see what is happening there to get a \nglimpse of the crisis that can come with not dealing with the ever-\nincreasing debt and not taking the necessary steps over a period of \nsome time to put our country on a fiscal path to health.\n\n  I think most of us here know that we have to make some tough choices \nand that it will require political will in order for us to address \nthis. We have been avoiding this for years, and we are going to face a \ndebt-induced catastrophe if we don't address it and address it soon.\n  So when you are faced with this kind of fiscal mess, what do you do? \nWell, what families and businesses all across America have had to do \nwhen they have faced these types of situations--sit down, create a \nbudget, and put themselves back on a path to balance and prosperity in \norder to avoid the inevitable: a collapse of the family budget or the \nbusiness budget. Our communities and our States have had to do this. We \nsee this happening everywhere except in Washington. It is this body and \nthis administration that have refused to step forward, No. 1, to pass a \nbudget on which to guide our spending and, No. 2, to make the decisions \nnecessary to turn this economy around and begin to put us on a better \npath toward a balanced budget.\n  Why a budget? Well, it helps us identify priorities. Sitting on the \nAppropriations Committee, where agency heads and Secretaries come \nbefore us and present their requests for the future fiscal year in \nwhich we are making decisions, I ask each one of them: Do you have a \nplan B?\n  They say: What do you mean by a plan B?\n  I say: if we continue down this path that is going to ever shrink \ndiscretionary spending--whether it is for cancer or paving roads or \neducation or any other worthy project, there is going to be less money \nif we don't address this spending problem, particularly if we don't \naddress mandatory spending.\n  I ask them: Have you looked at doing what every family has had to do \nand what every business has had to do during these 4 years of tepid \ngrowth, which just seems to linger and linger and linger? We still have \n23 million people out of work. Have you looked at ways in which you can \nmake your spending and the parts of the budget you oversee more \nefficient and more effective? Are there things you can cut? Are there \nprograms you can eliminate that no longer are effective or perhaps \nshouldn't have been there in the first place? Are there things you \nwould like to do but without the resources are not able to do at this \ntime?\n  You know, if a family is faced with lower revenue--dad's salary has \nbeen cut or mom has lost that second income or for whatever reason--and \nthey are having a hard time making payments--education for the \nchildren, mortgage payments, and so forth--the family has to say: You \nknow, we are going to have to look at how we spend money, and we are \ngoing to have to cut back. Maybe we won't be able to go to Disney World \nthis year as we had planned. Maybe we will need to buy a tent and go to \nthe State park or do something less expensive. And if they have kids \nwith a credit card: We are going to have to put limits on that or you \nare going to have to scale back.\n  These are decisions every family has had to make. These are decisions \nevery business owner is faced with and has to deal with, and they are \ndoing that. But this is a decision that hasn't been made here.\n  Well, it has been 4 years--1,400-some days; I think 1,422 days and \ncounting--since this body, the Senate, has passed a budget which would \nallow us to determine what our priorities are or at least give us a \nguidepost as to how we are going to spend money. Four years since this \nbody has presented to the American people, who elected us to come here \nand represent them, a budget and give them the transparency of how we \nare spending their money.\n  Finally, after 1,422 days, after 4 years, we have a budget before us. \nWhile I am pleased that is the case and I am pleased we are here \ndebating that, it is disappointing when we learn what that budget \noffers.\n  One would think, after 4 years--and particularly after the 4 years we \nhave been through and the 23 million people unemployed or underemployed \nand the rate of growth of this economy half of what it normally is--\nthat the budget being presented to us would take some steps toward \naddressing our spending issues and would not incorporate $1 trillion or \nmore of increased taxes, which will simply go to more spending. How \ncould we possibly support a budget--being $16.7 trillion in debt--that \nplunges us further into debt--a staggering increase in debt--and also \ndoesn't reduce spending? That is at least a step but nothing nearly \nappropriate to what we are facing.\n  So this budget grows government. Let's not make any excuses. It grows \ngovernment by increasing spending, and it grows government by a massive \nincrease in taxes just after we have had one a few months ago, not \ncounting the massive increase in taxes that is going to occur beginning \nin 2014 with the implementation of ObamaCare. When we add that up and \nlook at the cost of that, we face a dire circumstance. So one would \nthink a budget being offered to us would not increase debt by 42 \npercent but would address the real problem.\n  I know there has been a dispute about how much of the budget revenue \nis increased taxes. Some say $1.5 trillion. Those who have presented \nthe budget simply say: Oh, no, it is only $1 trillion. Well, whether it \nis $1.5 trillion or only--only--$1 trillion, it is $1 trillion in new \ntaxes on the American people after they just got hit with more than \n$\\1/2\\ trillion 2 months ago and are going to get hit again with \nanother $1 trillion when ObamaCare fully kicks in. I mean, it just \ndefies credibility, and I think the investment community and consumers \nand taxpayers all across America look at this and say: What in the \nworld are you doing?\n  What are the consequences of this? Well, the Heritage Foundation \nindicates that the Senate Democrats' budget would cost over 8 million \njobs nationwide and 225,000 jobs in my own\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nState over the next 10 years. They estimate that the budget would \nreduce economic output by $1.4 trillion and reduce private domestic \ninvestment by $820 billion. We certainly see the trend here, and the \ntrend is a negative consequence not a positive consequence.\n  So I think these statistics emphasize the fact that the entire \nmindset behind this budget seems to be how we can find more revenue to \nfund more government spending rather than how do we grow the economy. \nOur goal ought to be to grow the economy, not grow an already bloated \ngovernment with more taxes to pay for more government spending.\n\n  This budget never balances the budget. We will never reach the point \nour States have had to reach in balancing their budgets. The majority \nof our States have had to pull themselves out of a hole, and they have \ndone so because many are constitutionally mandated by their own State \nconstitutions to balance that budget. Families have had to balance \ntheir budgets, and businesses have had to balance their budgets. Only \nthe Federal Government doesn't seem to balance its budget and this plan \ndoesn't even attempt to get us there.\n  I have been coming to the Senate floor day after day after day this \nyear basically talking about the need for Republicans and Democrats and \nthe President to come together with a bold, credible, and enforceable \nlong-term plan to reduce our debt and put our country back on a path \ntoward growth and prosperity. We need to recognize that it will take \nmore than a quick fix. It is going to take more than this soap opera \ndrama of kicking the can down the road, extending the decisions we have \nto make for yet another few months behind this, behind that, or \nwhatever. It is going to take the will to roll up our sleeves, stop \nwasting our time and instead get to work on a plan that will deliver \nreal results for the American people.\n  To solve this dire situation and reduce dangerously high debt, I \nbelieve we need a plan that includes three major things:\n  We need to reform the way we spend. We need to go through each \nprogram at every agency and department and determine how we can do more \nwith less. My colleague from Oklahoma, Tom Coburn, already has taken \nsteps to triage our Federal Government's spending by identifying \nprograms that are ineffective, unnecessary, and overly duplicative.\n  We need comprehensive tax reform. The Joint Economic Committee has \nheard witnesses from the left, from the right, from the middle, \nnonpartisan, Republican, Democratic, Independents, and there is a \nconsensus: If we don't have comprehensive tax reform together with a \nsensible, credible, long-term, enforceable deficit-reduction plan, we \nwill not pull ourselves out of this mess we are in.\n  The growth element of what we need comes through tax reform. Senator \nWyden and I, in a bipartisan way, have worked for years--he worked \nyears before that with former Senator Judd Gregg--on putting together a \nplan. We are not saying it is the be-all, end-all, but it forms the \nbasis for a simplification of the Tax Code. It is revenue neutral, it \naddresses our lack of competitiveness around the world in terms of our \ncorporate entities and businesses, it fixes rates at reasonable levels, \nand it ought to be the basis for at least the discussion and moving \nforward.\n  If we don't combine our spending discipline with comprehensive tax \nreform, we are not going to have the element that will produce the \ngrowth and revenue that will bring us closer to balance.\n  Finally--I talk about this all the time--let's have the courage to \naddress what we know is driving us into more and more deficit and will \nprevent us, if we don't adjust it, from ever having a rational plan to \nget us out of this situation, and that is mandatory spending.\n  Let me quote from the President's own bipartisan commission. They \nsaid:\n\n       By 2025, revenue will be able to finance only interest \n     payments, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Every \n     other Federal Government activity--from national defense and \n     homeland security to transportation and energy--will have to \n     be paid for with borrowed money.\n\n  That is because our revenues will only pay for these few programs, \nwhich are eating up all of our expenditures. So from cancer research to \neducation, from paving roads to air traffic control to meat inspectors, \nnational defense and homeland security, and everything the government \ndoes that is an essential function for the Federal Government--all will \npaid for with borrowed money.\n  Let me go back to their statement.\n\n       Debt held by the public will outstrip the entire American \n     economy, growing to as much as 185 percent of GDP by 2035. \n     Interest on the debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion by \n     2020.\n\n  That is just 7 years away. Returning to the quote:\n\n       These mandatory payments--which buy absolutely no goods or \n     services--will squeeze out funding for all other priorities.\n\n  So not only will the uncontrollable growth of mandatory spending \nsqueeze out funding for all other programs or priorities in our \ncountry, but it will also jeopardize the safety net we have put in \nplace for retirees who have worked hard and put money aside to become \neligible when they retire for Social Security and Medicare and for \nthose who find themselves in a situation where Medicaid is a necessary \nsafety net.\n  We have always taken pride in being a country that is compassionate. \nWe have been a place where, if you work hard, you can earn a good \nliving, you can raise a family, and in later phases of life you will be \nable to rely on the safety net of health and retirement programs you \nhave invested in. But if we don't act on mandatory spending, if we \ndon't act on Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, we will all but \nensure the demise of these much needed programs for future generations. \nFailing to act and leaving our children and grandchildren with this \nenormous debt burden is immoral.\n  We all know--or we ought to know by now--our current path is \nunsustainable. Academics, economists, and business leaders from all \nsides of the political spectrum repeat the same thing: Unless we make \nthe tough choices we have been avoiding for years, we are going to face \na debt-induced catastrophe and it is only a matter of time and the \nclock is running down.\n  Congress and the President must summon the courage and the political \nwill to do the right thing and take the tough medicine now that will \nheal this economy. What we have been doing for the last 2 years that I \nhave been here is basically looking at a chronic illness and saying: \nTake two Advil; maybe you will feel better in the morning. That doesn't \nwork. We need the bold, the credible, and the enforceable plan that \nwill put us on the path to prosperity, and it must include spending \ndiscipline, comprehensive tax reform, and mandatory spending reform.\n  I am going to be offering up to five amendments to this budget. I \ndon't want to spend a great deal of time on this now. I will, for the \nrecord, mention the five I am going to offer.\n  The first is a mandatory spending budget point of order. This would \nbe a point of order against any legislation that increases the net \nlevel of mandatory spending at any time our gross Federal debt exceeds \n100 percent of the economy or our GDP.\n  Numerous studies have said that when we reach 90 percent, we are at a \ntipping point, and it becomes historically proven that it has a serious \nnegative impact on our economy. I have raised this to 100 percent to \nallow a little room. This point of order will be in place and, if \npassed, can only be overridden with 67 votes. This should force \nCongress to think before we act.\n  Secondly, I am offering an amendment that is called debt transparency \nlegislation. One of my colleagues and a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, Luke Messer, has passed similar legislation in the \nHouse with very significant bipartisan support.\n  It simply requires the Congressional Budget Office to report annually \nan estimate of the cost per taxpayer of the deficit for any year that \nthe President's budget is projected to be in deficit. The American \npeople deserve to know this number, and this amendment would achieve \nthat.\n  I am also offering an amendment to repeal the 3.8-percent tax on \ninvestment income. If we want to stifle the economy more, if we want to \nprevent more growth and slow down this economy, throw in yet another \ntax on the very people who are providing the capital and the \ninvestment.\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n  We just talked about the medical device tax, which I have supported, \nworking along with Democratic cosponsor Senator Klobuchar from \nMinnesota and many others who have joined us. It is an absolutely \nirresponsible tax, simply a way for the administration to pay for the \ncostly health care law that taxes the very industry that is providing \nus revenues, high-paying jobs, and helping our trade balance exported \nquality products. This is crippling, and it is forcing some of these \ncompanies to look overseas because of this egregious surtax on top of \nall the other taxes they pay. So I support the amendment of Senator \nHatch and Senator Klobuchar to repeal that medical device tax.\n  I am also offering an amendment designed to fix our broken and \nconvoluted Tax Code. I see Senator Wyden has come to the floor. Senator \nWyden and Senator Gregg started a heroic project several years ago to \nput together a comprehensive tax reform package. The work and the hours \nspent in pulling this together is amazing. When Senator Gregg left the \nSenate, he called me and he said: This is something I think you ought \nto take a look at. Perhaps you can take my place and work with Senator \nWyden so it can be a bipartisan effort going forward. We have discussed \nthis with our colleagues. It should serve as the basis for tax reform.\n  As I said earlier in my remarks, we cannot address this problem \nwithout spending discipline and comprehensive tax reform combined. All \nthe witnesses who have come before us in the Joint Economic Committee \nhave asserted this and enforced this; that it is the necessary element \nto provide the growth to accompany the spending discipline and, added \nto that, the mandatory entitlement reform.\n  Finally, an EPA amendment--which working with my colleague Senator \nManchin, a Democrat, again, a bipartisan effort--to deal particularly \nwith an EPA rule. I will not go into the details of that.\n  But these will be some of the amendments I will be offering in \nconjunction with my colleagues to hopefully make this budget a better \npiece of legislation.\n  To conclude, it has been 4 years since the Senate has passed a \nbudget. The plan before us, in my opinion, has not been worth the wait. \nIt will not help generate more jobs for the more than 23 million \nAmericans who are either unemployed or underemployed. It will not \nimprove this slow economy. It will not save Medicare and Social \nSecurity from going broke. It will not produce a path to bipartisan \ncomprehensive tax reform. It will not ever balance the budget. It will \nnot help hard-working Americans get back to work and get ahead in this \nlife. We can do better than this.\n  After 4 years of inaction, the American people deserve better than \nthis plan. The American people elected a divided government. It was not \na mandate for either party. It is a challenge, a challenge all of us \nneed to accept.\n  So let us act now. Let us summon the courage to stand and work \ntogether on a truly balanced plan--not one that calls for ever more \nspending and ever higher taxes but one that puts in place real reforms.\n  The first step is passing a credible budget. Sadly, in my opinion, \nthis budget doesn't match the need. Hopefully, we can make the \nadjustments for this to put us on that path to prosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are having this debate in hopes of \nultimately reaching a fair and bipartisan budget deal. We all know that \nis not going to be easy, so the least we can do is get our facts \nstraight. It is kind of disappointing to see that rather than engaging \nin a productive conversation, some of our Republican colleagues prefer \nto launch some pretty inaccurate attacks. I would like to take just a \nmoment to correct some of those inaccuracies so we can focus on the \nurgent task at hand.\n  Some Republicans continue to claim the Senate budget includes a $1.5 \ntrillion tax hike. I talked about this last night, but I wish to make \nit clear again. This is not true. Here are the facts:\n  Of the $975 billion in new revenue from those who can afford it the \nmost, $480 billion is matched with responsible spending cuts to fully \nreplace sequestration, $100 billion goes toward targeted, high-priority \ninfrastructure repairs and job training to help boost our economy and \nput Americans back to work. The rest goes to reduce the deficit. But, \nunfortunately, rather than seriously considering the credible path we \nhave presented in our budget plan, some Republicans have decided to \nplay some games with these numbers and are not telling the truth.\n  Instead of subtracting the sequestration replacement portion and the \ninvestment package from that $975 billion in total revenue, they are \ntrying to say we should add it all together. They are taking one side \nof the ledger, combining that with the other side of the ledger, and \ncoming to a conclusion that makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't make \nsense. You don't have to take my word for it. Fact checkers and \nreporters have called this claim false. They have called it a step too \nfar. The Washington Post fact checker even gave it two Pinnochios.\n  Republicans have also made the argument that this budget actually \nonly includes $300 billion in deficit reduction. That distorts the \nfacts. It is not true, and it is inconsistent actually with what \nRepublicans have claimed in the past.\n  Our budget includes 1.85 in deficit reduction, evenly divided between \nresponsible spending cuts and new revenue. That revenue comes from \nclosing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending from a Tax Code that \nhas been skewed toward the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations. But some Republicans say that because part of what we are \ndoing is replacing sequestration with smarter deficit reduction, that \nthis somehow diminishes the savings.\n  I actually find this kind of interesting because I served on the \nJoint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction when Republicans and \nDemocrats discussed ways to replace sequestration, which was, of \ncourse, well after sequestration had been signed into law. We didn't \nreach an agreement because Republicans refused to include revenue. But \nwe did agree then that deficit reduction to replace sequestration was \ndeficit reduction. In fact, my colleague Senator Toomey put forward a \nplan to replace sequestration--to replace sequestration that he said \nwould have ``reduced our deficit by $1.2 trillion.''\n  I find it odd that some Republicans were willing to count replacing \nsequestration as deficit reduction when they were putting forth plans \nto do it, but they will not treat the Senate budget the same way, \nespecially since bipartisan groups, including Simpson-Bowles and \nDomenici-Rivlin and the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, all \nused the same starting point that the Senate budget does. Like us, \nthese groups knew sequestration was not deficit reduction. It was there \nto trigger deficit reduction that would come from replacing it. That \nwas the whole point.\n  In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that the \nSenate budget uses the appropriate starting point:\n\n       ``Bowles and Simpson received no criticism when they did \n     the same thing for their new budget plan of a few weeks \n     ago.''\n\n  I didn't hear any Republicans complaining then. This just goes to \nshow that, sadly, some of our Republican colleagues appear more \ninterested in politicized attacks than serious consideration of our \nplan. The American people deserve better. They deserve better. They \nwant an honest conversation. That is what we are trying to have with \nthe credible approach we put forward.\n  Finally, I wish to strongly dispute the criticism I have heard that \nDemocrats somehow don't take reducing our deficit and debt seriously. \nDespite what you may have heard, Democrats care deeply, as we both \nknow, about restoring our Nation's fiscal health. We think it would be \nabsolutely wrong to pile up unsustainable debt and hand it to our \nchildren. That is exactly why the Senate budget presents a serious, \ncredible, and sustainable approach to getting our debt and deficits \nunder control.\n  Experts on both sides of the aisle have generally come together \naround a\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nfew principles for a responsible deficit reduction plan. The Senate \nbudget builds on the work of the last 2 years to meet each of those \nbenchmarks.\n  In 2010, the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission recommended finding \nroughly $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. This has now \nbecome the benchmark of other serious bipartisan proposals. The Senate \nbudget builds on the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction that has \nalready been done in the last 2 years since Simpson-Bowles, with an \nadditional $1.85 trillion in new deficit reduction, for a total of \n$4.25 trillion in deficit reduction since the Simpson-Bowles report.\n  What the Senate budget does is it takes us the rest of the way to \nthat $4 trillion goal and actually beyond it. Following the \nrecommendations of Simpson-Bowles and the Senate Gang of 6 plan, the \nSenate budget importantly reduces the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP \nby 2015 and keeps it well below that level for the rest of our 10-year \nwindow in a responsible way. It pushes our debt as a percentage of the \neconomy down, moving it in the right direction, as we have been told is \nan important goal.\n  So our budget reaches these benchmarks the way the American people \nhave consistently said they want it done and the way economists and \nexperts across our political spectrum have recommended--with an equal \nmix of responsible spending cuts across the Federal budget and new \nrevenue raised by closing loopholes and cutting wasteful breaks that, \nby the way, primarily benefit the rich.\n  This budget responsibly cuts spending by $975 billion. As a member of \nthe Budget Committee, the Presiding Officer knows we made some pretty \ntough choices to get there.\n  We think every program, including the ones that we know are \nimportant, needs to be wringing out the waste and trimming fat and \nreducing costs so our taxpayers get that benefit. So $500 billion of \nour deficit reduction comes from responsible savings on the domestic \nspending side, including, by the way, and I remind all, $275 billion in \nhealth care savings that we do in a way that does not harm seniors or \nfamilies.\n  There are no sacred cows. We have put everything on the table. But we \ndo it in a responsible way to preserve and protect and strengthen \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid that the American people support \nas well. Our budget saves $240 billion by carefully and responsibly \nreducing defense spending while giving the Pentagon enough time to plan \nand align the reductions to time with the drawdown of our troops from \noverseas. The remainder of the savings, $242 billion, comes from \nsavings on interest payments due to lower debt.\n  Taking the balanced approach the American people have consistently \ncalled for, our Senate budget matches those responsible spending cuts \nwith $975 billion in new revenue, which is again raised by closing \nloopholes and cutting unfair spending in the Tax Code while locking in \ntax cuts for the middle class and low-income working families so we \nprotect them from paying anymore.\n  There is bipartisan support for reducing the deficit by making the \nTax Code more fair and efficient. During the fiscal cliff negotiations, \nSpeaker Boehner proposed that we reduce the deficit by $800 billion by \nclosing what he called special-interest loopholes and deductions. So \nthe Senate budget takes him up on that. Every bipartisan group that has \ntackled this issue in a serious way recommended a lot more revenue than \nthe $600 billion raised from the wealthiest Americans in the yearend \ndeal.\n  If our budget passes, the total deficit reduction since the Simpson-\nBowles report will consist of 64 percent spending cuts, 14 percent tax \nrate increases on the rich, and 22 percent new revenue from closing \nloopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax Code. That is a \nresponsible approach. It is a balanced and fair approach. It is the one \nendorsed by bipartisan groups and experts and it is one that is \nsupported by the vast majority of the American people.\n  I want to say this again. Here are the facts. Our budget does not \ninclude a $1.5 trillion tax hike. It does raise $975 billion, again \nfrom closing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in our Tax Code. \nIt reduces the deficit by $1.85 trillion when analyzed the same way \nRepublicans have analyzed their own proposals. And Democrats do care \ndeeply about our country. We do want to reduce our debt and deficit, \nwhich is exactly why we have put forward a responsible proposal to put \nour debt and deficit on a downward sustainable path. As we continue \nthis debate over the next day I urge my Republican colleagues to stick \nto the facts. Let's end the misinformation. Let's work together on the \njob the American people want us to focus on and get a comprehensive \nbudget deal and get our country back on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes off the resolution to Senator \nWyden.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \nwill not insist on an answer but I wish to raise something.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator would withhold, because we have two \nSenators waiting to talk. I will be happy to answer that. Can we let \ntwo of them go on our time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You have the time. That will be fine. Thank you.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Wyden and 35 minutes to \nSenator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can ask Senator Wyden to yield, that 35 minutes will \nbe allocated by me among a number of Senators on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when we began the budget debate in Senator \nMurray's committee last week, I said that Senator Murray's challenge \ngave new meaning to the idea of playing a tough hand. Many thought her \ntask was essentially ``Mission Impossible.''\n  The fact is, for all of us who know Senator Murray well, she has \nspent her whole life coming up with solutions to those matters that \npeople said were ``Mission Impossible.'' She spent her whole life \ncoming up with accomplishments that actually solve problems. I commend \nSenator Murray for all of her work on this matter. I think it is very \nclear that when we get the kind of bicameral, bipartisan agreement that \naddresses the major concerns we are debating here on the floor, it is \ngoing to be in no small measure because Senator Murray continued to \nreach out to all sides. I want her to know how much I appreciate that.\n  I think we all understand these are complicated issues. At the same \ntime, the challenge of coming up with a bipartisan agreement here is \nnot rocket science in terms of identifying what the issues are. There \nare two issues here. One of them is taxes and the other is Medicare. \nThe two of them in fact are inextricably linked in many respects, \nbecause I have heard some on the other side of the aisle say I will \nlook at ways to reform taxes if colleagues on the Democratic side will \nlook at ways to protect Medicare and at the same time hold down its \ncosts. We have heard other Senators say the reverse. So these issues \nare inextricably linked.\n  One of the reasons I support this budget this evening is that I think \nthis budget provides significant space for Democrats and Republicans, \nas this process goes forward, to produce bipartisan solutions on those \ntwo issues, the tax question and the Medicare issue, in the days ahead.\n  Let me take a few minutes. Senator Coats talked about our bipartisan \nefforts. I have had a chance for the last 5 years to work with two very \nthoughtful, conservative Republicans--Senator Coats and our former \ncolleague Senator Gregg. Senator Begich and I have been part of a \nbipartisan team that is, in effect, seeking to modernize some of the \nprinciples that a very big group of Democrats and Ronald Reagan agreed \nto in the 1980s, which is to clean out some of these outlandish \nspecial-interest tax breaks.\n  I see my good friend Senator Levin tonight. He is going to outline \njust some of those outlandish tax breaks. We ought to clean them out \nand use a portion of those dollars to hold down the rates and keep \nprogressivity. In the 2 years after Democrats and Republicans did that \nin the 1980s, the country created millions of new jobs. No one can say \nthat every one of them was due to that tax reform effort, but it \ncertainly helped.\n  We had Senator Enzi on the floor earlier this evening. I have been \nworking with him on something that I think has been missed in the tax \nreform debate, and that is Senator Enzi has said\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\nwhen are people going to start talking about the transition rules you \nwould need to actually implement the tax reform plan because today in a \nglobal economy--and Senator Murray and I come from a part of the world \nthat is so trade sensitive--here we have Senator Enzi talking about \nsomething very practical that ought to be very attractive to the most \nprogressive Member of the Senate and the most conservative Member of \nthe Senate. Under the Murray proposal these are the kinds of ideas we \nshould be looking at in the days ahead.\n  Let me now turn, if I might, to the Medicare issue. Again, we all \nunderstand it is right at the heart of this when Senator Murray and \nCongressman Ryan and all those who are going to be in a bipartisan \nconference are negotiating. I continue to believe it is critically \nimportant to protect the Medicare guarantee, something I have battled \nfor since the days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, \nand we can do it in a way that will hold down costs. This is another \narea where Senator Murray has given us a chance to look at some of the \nsolutions that could win support on both sides of the aisle. I will \ntouch on them briefly.\n  For years now we have had advocates on all sides of the political \nspectrum talk about the value of merging Part A, which is the hospital \nportion of Medicare, with Part B, the doctors and outpatients part of \nthe program. Here is a chance to save billions of dollars while also \nhelping vulnerable seniors hold down some of their out-of-pocket \nexpenses. It is there for the doing under the Murray budget. I think we \ncan forge bipartisan support for it.\n  Let me move on now to the question of chronic care. This is where \nmore than 70 percent of Medicare costs go, for those who are suffering \nfrom heart and stroke and cancer and diabetes. The accountable care \norganizations, which are an important part of the Affordable Care Act, \nare clearly going to help with respect to how we look to treat this \npopulation. But it is not going to lift all the boats. There are a lot \nof very effective plans and group practices around the country that are \ngoing to give us the opportunity to put in place integrated, effective \nplans to help the most sick among us. We ought to pursue it. The Murray \nbudget will give us that opportunity.\n  I will close simply by saying there are some very good ideas for \npromoting Medicare quality and holding costs down, which cost very \nlittle, such as the approach Senator Grassley has given me the chance \nto partner with him on, that would open for the first time the Medicare \ndatabase so that we would get a sense of what Medicare was paying \nvarious doctors and providers for various services.\n  I know colleagues are waiting to speak. I will wrap up by saying that \non the biggest challenges of our time, which I think come down to two \nissues, taxes and Medicare, the Murray budget gives us a chance to come \ntogether in a bipartisan way. We are not going to get it all done, \nobviously, this week. But we are going to have a chance to do it and I \nthink in both of these areas, taxes and Medicare, there are Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who can pick up on this budget and find a way \nto help Senator Murray and others who are going to participate in these \ndiscussions get us to the solutions we need that will strengthen our \neconomy and protect our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I commend Senator Murray and the \nBudget Committee for the plan they have presented to us. It represents \nan enormous step forward on an issue of huge significance to American \ntaxpayers. It is a step toward balanced deficit reduction.\n  An important part of balanced deficit reduction is reducing the \ndeficit without severely damaging important protections for and \ninvestments in American families. One way to do that is by ending \nunjustified tax loopholes and ending the damage they have inflicted on \nour budget. Senator Murray's summary of the Foundation For Growth, the \nbudget plan before us, refers to ``the sheer magnitude of the revenue \nlost to off-shore tax abuse, wasteful and inefficient loopholes, and \nother business tax breaks.''\n  Many Senators have focused on this issue over the months and the \nyears. A number of them will, I expect, be joining me on the floor over \nthe next few minutes. For many years as chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations I have focused on the maze of offshore \nschemes and complex gimmicks that are concocted to allow a privileged \nfew to avoid paying the taxes that are rightfully owing.\n  Our subcommittee has, on a bipartisan basis, filled volume after \nvolume with damning detail on how these schemes work and the damage \nthey cause. As Senator Murray and the Budget Committee have pointed out \nin their blueprint, we are at a moment in history when we can remove \nthis blight. The pressures on the Federal budget and the threat to \neconomic growth and prosperity that they represent require action. We \nmust close these loopholes. The relentless arithmetic of our budget \nsituation compels it; fairness and justice demand it.\n  We come to the floor today in support of the revenue provisions in \nthe budget resolution before us. We are going to outline the ways for \nending these tax avoidance schemes, the preposterous contortions that \ntoo many corporations and wealthy individuals employ to avoid paying \ntaxes. We will illustrate the huge loss in Federal revenues, the \nresulting rise in deficits from these contortions, and will show how \nthat loss has contributed to a shift in the tax burden from \ncorporations and the wealthy to middle-class families and small \nbusinesses. This is a shift that has occurred largely without the \nnotice or the approval of the American public. We are going to \ndemonstrate how closing these loopholes is integral to any balanced \ndeficit reduction agreement that is built on the common good.\n\n  The case for additional revenue and for closing tax loopholes as a \nsource of that revenue is overwhelming. Serious deficit reduction \nrequires more revenue, as everybody from the Simpson-Bowles Commission \nto the Domenici-Rivlin task force to the Concord Coalition to Fix the \nDebt, has recognized. They have rightly concluded that without \nadditional revenue, the deficit reduction numbers simply do not add up. \nRepublicans have insisted that the discussion of revenue as part of our \ndeficit-reduction approach is finished.\n  The other day Speaker Boehner claimed, ``The talk about raising \nrevenue is over.'' He is mistaken. Our effort is picking up steam. \nThese Republican protests cannot erase the fact that Federal revenue \nremains significantly below its historic average as a percentage of the \ngross domestic product of our economy, and that revenue is, and under \ncurrent trends will continue to be, below the levels we have needed in \nthe recent past to balance the budget.\n  In particular, the loss of corporate tax revenues is an ongoing cause \nof deficits. At a time when corporations enjoy record profits, the \nhighest in half a century, revenue from corporate income taxes has \nfallen off as a percentage of our taxes collected.\n  In 2006, corporate tax revenue made up about 15 percent of all \nFederal revenue. In 2012, it had fallen to 10 percent. Somebody has to \npick up the slack. In this case it has been average American families. \nWhy is corporate revenue a shrinking share of our Treasury even though \nthe U.S. corporate tax rate, at 35 percent, is one of the highest in \nthe developed world? It is because the top tax rate doesn't tell the \nstory. While our tax rate at the upper limit is 35 percent on \ncorporations, the average U.S. corporate taxpayer's actual tax rate was \njust 12 percent in 2011, which is the lowest in generations.\n  A recent study by two think tanks found that 30 of our largest \ncorporations with combined profits of more $160 billion paid no income \ntax, zero, from 2008 to 2010.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has \noutlined in great detail the black magic that these corporations employ \nto make their tax bills disappear. One major culprit is offshore tax \navoidance. This is hardly a new problem, but it is receiving attention \nlike never before--perhaps because it is simply too big to ignore any \nlonger.\n  This recent edition of The Economist--just a few weeks ago--pointed \nout in its lead story and on its cover that tax haven abuse is now a \n$20 trillion problem for the global economy.\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nThat is $20 trillion, not billion. They also have a special report on \nthis offshore finance. The headline here--and it is an eye-popper, I \nhope--is that ``The Missing $20 Trillion--How To Stop Companies And \nPeople Dodging Tax.''\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been digging into \nthese abuses for years. Last year a subcommittee report outlined how \nthree U.S. companies--Apple, Google, and Microsoft--had used offshore \ngimmicks to avoid taxes on almost $80 billion in profits. Much of this \ntax avoidance stems from manipulation of intellectual property and \nother intangibles. Companies develop valuable knowledge within the \nUnited States, often using tax credits, grants, and other Federal \nsupport. They then transfer that valuable property under various legal \nschemes to offshore subsidiaries at bargain basement prices, thereby \nshifting the profit that this valuable property generates overseas \nwhere it is shielded from taxes.\n  Other offshore schemes involve pretzel-like twisting of tax laws. For \nexample, the subcommittee found that Hewlett-Packard employed such a \ngimmick to bring home money that was held offshore--bring it back to \nthe United States--without paying the required taxes. Here is what the \nlaw requires: When profits are brought back to the United States, the \nprofits are taxed. The IRS allows an exemption for very short-term \nloans from offshore subsidiaries to their domestic parent. Hewlett-\nPackard exploited that exemption by concocting a rotating series of \nalternating loans from a pair of offshore subsidiaries to make billions \nof dollars in what should have been taxable repatriated income appear \nto be short-term loans exempt from taxation. This is a gimmick that is \nso blatant that even some of Hewlett-Packard's accountants questioned \nit.\n  Our subcommittee found that Hewlett-Packard used this offshore cash--\nused it here--shielded it in taxes to help run its U.S. operations \nduring the 2010 fiscal year. To quote from the subcommittee's \ndescription:\n\n       There does not appear to be a gap of a single day during \n     that period where the loaned funds of either BCC or CHCC--\n\n  The two offshore subsidiaries in question--\n\n       were not present in the United States. Moreover, a similar \n     pattern of continuous lending appeared to be occurring for \n     most of the period between 2008 and 2011.\n\n  Now they are talking about short-term loans--which I believe is 30 \ndays or less--but they are supposed to be exempt from taxes when they \nare lent from an offshore subsidiary back to the parent here in the \nUnited States. This has been going on for years without a gap by using \na gimmick that they found in the Tax Code, which is egregious. It is \ntime to act.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I introduced a Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes \nAct not too long ago. Our bill would help address some of these tax \nschemes, and others as well. It is a powerful weapon in our deficit-\nreduction arsenal if we will use it.\n  Today a coalition of more than two dozen national public interest \ngroups, as well as dozens of State and local organizations, released a \nletter urging the Senate to adopt our Cut Loopholes Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 21, 2013.\n       Dear Senator, We write to ask you to join as a cosponsor of \n     the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act (S. 268), introduced by \n     Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). \n     This bill would close a myriad of corporate tax loopholes \n     that serve no public purpose and would raise at least $190 \n     billion over ten years. We urge the Senate leadership to \n     include the provisions of this bill in any budget deal struck \n     this year. The legislation tackles offshore tax loopholes \n     that allow and even encourage many large U.S. companies to \n     shift U.S. jobs and profits to offshore subsidiaries. \n     Corporations that benefit from all of the advantages of doing \n     business here are able to use creative tax planning to avoid \n     paying taxes on income legitimately earned in the United \n     States.\n       As federal revenues from corporations hover at multi-\n     generational lows, cracking down on offshore tax abuses \n     should be at the top of the Congressional ``to do'' list. The \n     Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has estimated \n     the cost to taxpayers of tax-avoidance schemes involving tax \n     havens at $100 billion annually. New estimates put the amount \n     of lost revenue as high as $150 billion: $90 billion from \n     corporate tax avoidance and $40-$70 billion from individual \n     tax evasion. Tax haven abuse is widespread: at least 83 of \n     America's top 100 publicly traded companies have subsidiaries \n     in offshore tax havens, according to the GAO. Some of these \n     subsidiaries are nothing more than P.O. boxes. In fact, \n     18,857 corporate `headquarters' are registered at one modest \n     five-story building in the Cayman Islands.\n       This is also a jobs problem. At a time when far too many \n     Americans are facing unemployment, our tax code is rewarding \n     U.S. corporations for moving and operating abroad rather than \n     in the U.S. It allows corporations to immediately deduct some \n     of their expenses for moving and operating those overseas \n     facilities even though the companies can defer U.S. taxes on \n     the offshore profits indefinitely. The CUT Loopholes Act \n     would promote investments in American jobs by removing some \n     of these incentives.\n       The non-partisan Congressional Research Service recently \n     found that U.S. multinational corporations reported \n     ``profits'' in offshore tax havens that far-exceeded the \n     entire economies of those tax havens. For example, in 2008, \n     U.S. multinational corporations' reported profits in Bermuda \n     and the Cayman Islands exceeded 645% and 545% of those tax \n     havens' GDPs, respectively. After surveying the multinational \n     corporate profits reportedly from tax havens, that report \n     found ``these numbers clearly indicate that the profits in \n     these countries do not appear to derive from economic \n     activities related to productive inputs or markets, but \n     rather reflect income easily transferred to low-tax \n     jurisdictions.''\n       Here is an example of how these loopholes work. A recent \n     investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations found that Microsoft avoided $4.5 billion in \n     federal income taxes over three years by using sophisticated \n     accounting maneuvers to artificially shift its income to tax-\n     friendly Puerto Rico. The company sold certain intellectual \n     property rights to its Puerto Rican subsidiary. Now the \n     parent company pays that subsidiary 47% of the revenue \n     generated from its American sales despite the fact that its \n     products were developed and sold in the U.S.\n       Businesses should compete based on the quality of the \n     products and services they offer, not on the cleverness of \n     their tax attorneys in exploiting loopholes like these. Tax \n     haven abuse by large multinational corporations puts small \n     businesses -- and even large domestic businesses -- at a \n     competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. Along with \n     individual filers, they must shoulder the extra tax burden \n     through higher taxes, a reduction to public services, or a \n     larger share of the federal. A 2012 U.S. PIRG report found \n     that the average extra tax burden shifted to just one \n     ordinary taxpayer due to tax haven abuse adds up to $426 per \n     year. If small businesses were to make up for the revenue \n     lost just from the corporate abuse of tax havens, each small \n     business in America would have to pay $2,116. It is time for \n     Congress and President Obama to correct this imbalance and \n     make sure multinational corporations are contributing their \n     share.\n       Offshore tax loopholes create winners and losers. The \n     winners are multinational corporations, usually in financial \n     services, high tech, and pharmaceutical industries. The \n     losers are those businesses who stay here in the U.S. and \n     those who can't afford to hire expensive tax planners and \n     lobbyists. Those on the losing end of these loopholes include \n     retailers, small businesses, and ordinary taxpayers, who are \n     forced to pick up the tab for tax haven abuse.\n       Due to the substantial loss of revenue, governments at all \n     levels, here and around the world, cut programs and jobs that \n     are critical to economic recovery and growth. We are finally \n     seeing international bodies such as the European Union, the \n     G-20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development and government leaders from U.K. to India taking \n     action. The United States should be leading these efforts, \n     not following and certainly not ignoring the fact that these \n     stateless corporations are not going to act until we \n     eliminate these loopholes for good. Additionally, by closing \n     these corporate tax loopholes we send a message around the \n     globe that corporate tax avoidance is unacceptable whether it \n     be in the developing or developed world.\n       As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit \n     and debates tax reform proposals, members should start with \n     the elimination of these loopholes, which could raise as much \n     as $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next ten years. Policies \n     that would close a number of the most egregious of these \n     offshore tax loopholes are included in the Cut Unjustified \n     Tax Loopholes Act (S. 268). The Levin-Whitehouse bill would \n     end incentives that encourage the offshoring of jobs and \n     profits.\n       Diverse constituencies, including small business, labor, \n     faith, and public interest groups support closing these \n     loopholes. We urge you to stand with taxpayers by joining as \n     a co-sponsor of the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act and \n     urging your leadership to close these loopholes as part of \n     any budget agreement made in the next year.\n           Sincerely,\n       Action Aid USA\n       Alliance for a Just Society\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n       American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n     Organizations (AFL-CIO)\n       American Sustainable Business Council American Friends \n     Service Committee\n       Business for Shared Prosperity\n       Center of Concern\n       Center for Effective Government\n       Citizens for Tax Justice\n       EG Justice\n       Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency \n     Coalition\n       Foreign Policy In Focus\n       Foundry United Methodist Church\n       Friends of the Earth US\n       Global Financial Integrity\n       Jubilee USA Network\n       Main Street Alliance\n       Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns\n       New Rules for Global Finance\n       Presbyterian Church (USA)\n       Public Citizen\n       Service Employees Union International (SEIU)\n       Tax Justice Network USA\n       TransAfrica\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG)\n\n\n                       State/Local Organizations\n\n       Arizona PIRG--AZ\n       Jubilee San Diego--CA\n       California PIRG--CA\n       Nicaragua Center for Community Action (NICCA)--CA\n       Resurrection Lutheran Church--CA\n       Colorado PIRG--CO\n       Connecticut PIRG--CT\n       Pax Christi Catholic University of America--DC\n       Foundry United Methodist Church--DC\n       Florida PIRG--FL\n       Georgia PIRG--GA\n       Georgia Rural Urban Summit--GA\n       Georgia Fair Share--GA\n       9 to 5 Atlanta--GA\n       MoveOn Atlanta--GA\n       Atlanta Jobs with Justice--GA\n       Provincial Council of the Clerics of St. Viator \n     (Viatorians)--IL\n       Illinois Maternal and Child Health Coalition--IL\n       AIDS Foundation of Chicago--IL\n       Autism Society of Illinois--IL\n       Union Church of Hinsdale--IL\n       American Bottom Conservancy Illinois--IL\n       Citizens Against Ruining the Environment--IL\n       Eco-Justice Collaborative--IL\n       Holy Cross International Justice Office--IN\n       Sisters of the Holy Cross Congregation Justice Committee \n     Notre Dame, Indiana--IN\n       Des Moines Chapter--Women's International League for Peace \n     and Freedom (WILPF)--IA\n       Iowa Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church--IA\n       Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement--IA\n       Iowa Move to Amend--IA\n       Green Dubuque--IA\n       Iowa Progressive Action Coalition--IA\n       Iowa Citizen Action Network--IA\n       Iowa Mainstreet Alliance--IA\n       Iowa PIRG--IA\n       Iowa Policy Project--IA\n       Maryland PIRG--MD\n       Maryland United for Peace and Justice--MD\n       Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti--MA\n       Jubilee Justice Task Force of the United Church of Christ--\n     MA\n       Jubilee Massachusetts--MA\n       Massachusetts PIRG--MA\n       Immaculate Heart of Mary Justice, Peace and Sustainability \n     Office--MI\n       Holy Innocents Episcopal Church--MI PIRG in Michigan--MI\n       Missouri PIRG--MO\n       Missourians for Tax Justice sub-committee of the MO \n     Association for Social Welfare--MO\n       Economic Justice Task Force--MO\n       Progress Now Nevada--NV\n       New Hampshire PIRG--NH\n       New Jersey PIRG--NJ\n       NJ Working Families Alliance--NJ\n       NJ State Industrial Union Council--NJ\n       NJ Save Our Schools March--NJ\n       NJ Main Street Alliance--NJ\n       NJ Citizen Action--NJ\n       New Mexico PIRG--NM\n       North Carolina PIRG--NC\n       Jubilee Oregon--OR\n       Oregon PIRG (OSPIRG)--OR\n       Pennsylvania PIRG--PA\n       Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart--PA\n       Small Business Chamber of Commerce--SC\n       Texas PIRG--TX\n       Vermont PIRG--VT\n       Jubilee Northwest--WA\n       Fuse Washington--WA\n       Washington PIRG--WA\n       Hill Connections--WI\n       Madison Teachers Inc--WI\n       Wisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans--WI\n       Citizen Action--WI\n       Wisconsin Community Action Program--WI\n       Wisconsin Education Association Council--WI\n       Wisconsin PIRG--WI.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I see there are a number of my colleagues who have joined \nme here in this effort so I will close with the following comment. Some \nof the people argue that they will consider closing tax loopholes but \nonly if the resulting revenue is used to lower tax rates rather than \nreducing the deficit. This position is unwise for two reasons. First, \nthe budget deficit is a significant problem for our country, and we \nshould address it. Senator Murray's budget wisely takes the view that \nwe need to act to reduce the deficit.\n  Second, the people who elected us overwhelmingly believe that reforms \nto end these tax schemes, which I have outlined, should contribute to \ndeficit reduction. A recent poll shows that more than 80 percent of \nAmericans believe that revenue we recover from closing tax loopholes \nshould be dedicated to reducing the deficit, not to cutting rates.\n  Let's follow the path this budget resolution before us outlines: \nspending cuts, yes, but prudent, carefully considered cuts that \npreserve our most important priorities; Savings from reform of \nentitlement programs, yes, but reforms to keep the faith with seniors \ntoday and in the future. And, yes, revenue, revenue that ends the \nprivileges of an influential few who have for far too long enjoyed \nunjustified tax breaks that boost corporate profits and the bank \naccounts of the wealthy few at the expense of ordinary Americans.\n  Earlier today Senators Whitehouse, McCain, and I--a bipartisan \ngroup--filed an amendment to the budget resolution suggesting the need \nto close tax loopholes. Our amendment makes reference to ending \noffshore tax abuses by large corporations. Our amendment provides that \nat least some of the revenue generated must be used for deficit \nreduction. This bipartisan amendment makes a strong statement on the \nmomentum that is building for balanced, commonsense deficit reduction.\n  There is a group of Senators who have come to the floor with me so we \ncan end these tax schemes and gimmicks. I thank Senator McCain, Senator \nWhitehouse, and I thank my other colleagues who are here today for the \nwork they put into a very vitally important issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe Senator Whitehouse is ready to proceed. \nSenator Whitehouse is my principal cosponsor on this amendment, along \nwith Senator McCain.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator has 24 \nminutes remaining in his name.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is 9 minutes sufficient?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is more than sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin for his \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to be part of his Levin-Whitehouse \ngroup in putting this together. If we boil down the discussions that we \nare having back and forth about the budget, they come to a very simple \nquestion; that is, can we use the money that is in tax avoidance, in \ntax loopholes toward solving our sequester problem, our deficit \nproblem, and our debt problem?\n  The way this has been described so far is that there are spending \ncuts. That is one part of the equation. The other part of the equation \nis tax increases. That has been the way this has been framed. That \noverlooks the third big piece of the problem, which is money that goes \nout the backdoor of the Tax Code without ever coming into the U.S. \nGovernment in revenues. I want to let people who are watching know--\nbecause they probably won't believe it--what a colossal number that is.\n  We get $1.09 trillion in revenue out of the individual Tax Code. We \nget $181 billion in revenue out of the corporate Tax Code. We give away \n$1.02 trillion out the backdoor of the Tax Code for individual \ndeductions and loopholes. We give away $157 billion out the backdoor of \nthe Tax Code in corporate deductions and loopholes. The IRS estimates \nthat there is $385 billion which never even gets into the formula \nbecause of what Chairman Levin was talking about: companies and \nindividuals who hide their revenue and income offshore so it never even \ngets into the tax package. If we add it up, there is actually more \nmoney lost through tax avoidance than there is collected in tax revenue \nin this country.\n  When people talk about only the tax revenue and only spending cuts, \nthey are trying to hide a very big ball. That is the basic difference \nbetween the Democratic proposal and the Republican proposal. We want to \ntake $975\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nbillion, which is only 7 percent of all the money that goes out the \nbackdoor of the Tax Code, and use it toward ending the sequester and \nbalancing the budget. That is our proposal. The Ryan Republican \nproposal is to take 41 percent of that money that goes out the backdoor \nof the Tax Code and use every nickel of it to lower the high-end rates \nfor corporations and for wealthy Americans who pay the highest end \nrates. They don't put a dime from this toward either the sequester or \ndeficit reduction. We cannot have that be the rule.\n  If we take this number, which is an annual number--the minimum is \nright here, $1.02 trillion plus $157 billion. We do our budget over a \n10-year span. These are annual numbers. That means in a 10-budget \nhorizon, we have at least $11.5 trillion going out the backdoor of the \nTax Code. If we allow for moderate growth in the economy, it is not \n$11.5 trillion, it is $14 trillion. If we throw in the nearly $400 \nbillion in offshoring, we are up to nearly $18 trillion--$18 trillion \nthat goes out the back door of the Tax Code.\n\n  By the way, although there are important middle-class deductions in \nthe middle of this, such as the home mortgage deduction, there is an \nawful lot of nonsense and mischief in the tax expenditures that go out \nthe back door of the Tax Code. If we want to know why hedge fund \nbillionaires pay a lower tax rate than their chauffeurs and the \nhospital orderly rolling his cart down Rhode Island hospital hallways \nin the middle of the night, we can look at the mischief in the Tax Code \nfor the carried interest exception. If we want to know why corporate \njets, private jets get favored treatment, look at the accelerated \ndepreciation schedules in the corporate Tax Code. There is a lot of \nmischief and monkeyshines that have been built into the Tax Code by \nlobbyists for the wealthy and lobbyists for powerful corporations over \nthe years.\n  All we want to do--and what this fight is all about--is take $975 \nbillion out of those trillions and trillions of dollars that go out the \nback of the Tax Code and use it to get rid of the sequester and to \nbalance the budget. That is what we want to do. And what the \nRepublicans want to do is take 41 percent of that and use every \ndollar--every dollar--to lower tax rates for the richest people. They \ndon't spend a nickel in all of that toward reducing the deficit or \ntoward ending the sequester.\n  This Tax Code spending--all the earmarks the lobbyists built into the \nTax Code over decades--is the Republican treasure trove. That is their \nAli Baba's cave. That is where all the goodies are, and they don't want \nto spend a nickel of it either getting rid of the sequester or helping \nwith deficit reduction. They want all of the treasure in Ali Baba's \ncave of special tax deals to stay with the big corporations and with \nthe wealthy in the form of lower tax rates. That is the entire debate \nbetween our sides right now.\n  I think Chairman Levin, by putting forward this plan to take this \noffshore hidden revenue and bring it into the discussion and use it to \nhelp solve our sequester, use it to help support our economy, use it to \nhelp reduce our deficit, is a very strong idea, so I am very pleased to \nsupport him. I appreciate his leadership. I am delighted Senator John \nMcCain has joined us on this to make this a bipartisan initiative. They \nshow great leadership together, and I am delighted to join them.\n  With that, with my great appreciation to Chairman Levin, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First let me thank Senator Whitehouse. He has been a \nleader in this effort for a long time. His support here is critical and \nwill really make a difference.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to add my thanks to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the leader in this effort \nto close some of these abusive and unnecessary and wasteful loopholes. \nI also thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator McCain for their leadership \nin this effort, which is about fundamental fairness.\n  Most importantly, let me thank Senator Murray for the hard work, the \ncourage, the strength it has taken to put together a budget that is \nintensely complex, dealing with issues that are hugely challenging, and \ncraft a solution that presents a vision for the future of America that \nis very distinct and different, as well as very preferable to the one \npresented by the House budget. The House insists on a cuts-only \napproach and absolutely refuses to consider new revenue. The solution \ncrafted by Senator Murray and her committee has opted for balance and \ncompromise--two words that unfortunately are too often missing from our \ndeliberative process.\n  Our budget achieves $1.85 trillion in new deficit reduction, with an \neven mix of $975 billion of new revenue and $975 billion in responsible \nspending cuts. That is a real achievement.\n  We are here today to talk about cutting loopholes, tax breaks, \ngiveaways to people who don't need them and corporations that don't \ndeserve them. Their existence undermines the fundamental fairness of \nour Tax Code.\n  The fact that more money goes to tax avoidance than to tax revenue is \na fundamental, searing indictment of our Tax Code, and it is the reason \nthere is resistance to people paying their fair share. Again and again \nand again, what I hear from citizens, from taxpayers, from residents of \nthe State of Connecticut is, I would be willing to pay my fair share as \nlong as others are required to do the same.\n  Fairness is at the core of our Tax Code. It is the reason why \nvoluntary compliance is so important and why it happens--because people \nrely on its fundamental fairness.\n  The offshoring of profits and ending those offshore tax abuses that \nhave been described so eloquently by Senator Levin and Senator \nWhitehouse is absolutely necessary to a sense of fairness in our Tax \nCode. As important as the additional money is the sense of equity it \nwould bring to our Tax Code.\n  Likewise, fair and effective tax enforcement is critical. I know as \nan enforcer of civil laws for 20 years as attorney general it is \nimportant to a sense of fairness in our society, and effective \nenforcement requires resources. It requires tightening rules relating \nto tax shelter promoters; stiffening penalties for the aiders and \nabettors--the ones who enable violations of our tax laws and tax \nevasion; and modernizing Federal tax lien registration. We are fond of \nsaying in this body that the devil is in the details. Here, the devil \nis in nonenforcement of those detailed regulations and rules that \nrequire compliance.\n  Similarly, ending excessive corporate tax deductions or stock options \nand closing some of the loopholes that apply to derivatives are \nfundamental to fairness and to preserving a sense that everybody is \nbearing a fair share of the burden. Those rules that presently permit \nevasion and abuse must be ended. The consequences are huge because they \napply to the vision of the future that each of these rules and budgets \ncontemplate.\n  The wasteful tax loopholes mean losses in revenue, and those, in \nturn, mean we must cut programs as a consequence. In my home State of \nConnecticut alone--just to show some of the consequences of the House \nor Ryan budget--47,000 seniors would pay more for prescription drugs \nnext year, and that means $828 for each of them, on average, more in \nthe cost of drugs in 2014 alone and more than $13,000 over the next \ndecade.\n  The House budget would cut $8.73 billion in funding Connecticut \nreceives for nursing care and other health care services for seniors \nand the disabled, putting at risk tens of thousands of Connecticut \nseniors who rely on Medicaid for their long-term health care needs.\n  I have sponsored the Bring the Jobs Home Act, which many others have \ncosponsored, which would close that loophole for corporations that send \njobs and ship employment overseas. We need to bring those jobs back.\n  The House budget would double down on job-killing cuts to \ninfrastructure and research and economic development programs. The \nEconomic Policy Institute has found that these cuts would cost \nConnecticut over 24,000 jobs in 2014 alone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Our economic recovery is fragile. Job-killing cuts \nmust be stopped.\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\n  I thank Senator Levin for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Senator \nBlumenthal for his tremendous work in this area.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, which I believe is 6 or 7 minutes, \nto Senator Shaheen. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin for the work he \nhas done to look at the tax loopholes that should be closed and to \nbring attention to really the fairness we should have in our Tax Code.\n  I am here to join my colleagues in talking about the importance of \npassing a budget that will address our debt and deficits and protect \nmiddle-class families while investing in our future job growth. I \napplaud Senator Murray for her leadership and the work of the Budget \nCommittee in bringing this document before us.\n  We have made significant progress in the last few years to get the \nAmerican economy growing, and we have taken real action to reduce our \ndeficits, but there is more we can do on both fronts, and the budget \nbefore us addresses both of these urgent priorities in a responsible \nway.\n  No one is questioning the need to address our debt and deficits. The \nquestion is, Can we do this in a responsible way? Can we come together \nin a way that protects our economic recovery?\n  Unfortunately, because of continued political stalemate, we have seen \nthe across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration go into \neffect. Now we need to come together to support a plan to address these \nharmful automatic cuts because they are hurting small businesses. They \nare having an impact on our economic recovery. They are forcing \nfurloughs of public employees--in New Hampshire, people such as our \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard workers and our air traffic controllers. They \nare creating economic uncertainty that is putting our economic recovery \nin jeopardy.\n  I have had the chance to travel around New Hampshire in the last \nmonth or so and talk to companies that are concerned about the impact \nof these automatic cuts. One of those companies I visited is called \nCirtronics, which is a manufacturing company in Milford, NH. The \ncompany employs about 150 people, and it manufactures a diverse array \nof products, from circuit boards, to medical equipment, to defense and \nhomeland security products. Cirtronics doesn't have any direct \ngovernment contracts, but many of its clients do. As a result, the \ncompany is facing a lot of uncertainty under sequestration. According \nto its CEO, Geraldine Ferlins, this uncertainty is getting in the way \nof the company's growth. She said:\n\n       How do you plan without knowing how you will be affected? \n     You hear about how CEOs are hesitant to hire. This is why.\n\n  Another company in Salem, NH, called Micro-Precision Technologies is \na small, family-owned business with about 20 employees that makes \nsemiconductors used in the military, aerospace, medical, and \ncommunications industries. About 80 percent of Micro-Precision's \nbusiness is with the Department of Defense. Sequestration has meant \nthat their orders are down about half for the month of January. They \nhad been planning to hire two new people, but unfortunately they cannot \ndo that because they are so uncertain about what is going to happen.\n  That is why we need a better approach to addressing our budget \nsituation. We need a plan that looks at all areas of our spending--at \nour domestic, at our defense, at our mandatory programs--as well as at \nrevenues through tax reform. That is exactly the approach that was \ntaken by the Budget Committee in passing out the budget resolution that \nis before us this week. That is why I supported it. It replaces the \nharmful cuts under sequestration with a balanced mix of responsible \nspending cuts as well as additional revenues. So instead of across-the-\nboard cuts, the budget makes targeted cuts to several areas. It cuts \nhealth care spending without harming beneficiaries; it reduces defense \nspending cuts, as we wind down our operations in Afghanistan; and it \nresults in reduced interest payments on our debt.\n  The budget also provides a balanced approach by ending, as Senator \nLevin pointed out, the unfair tax breaks for the wealthiest and for big \ncorporations. I certainly applaud Senator Levin and Senator Whitehouse, \nand I was really glad to hear that Senator McCain has joined them in \naddressing these unfair tax breaks.\n  The budget does all this, and yet it still invests in our economy in \na way that allows it to grow. It provides much needed funding for our \naging transportation infrastructure. It creates an infrastructure bank \nthat is a bipartisan idea that allows us to get a greater bang for the \ntaxpayer buck. There is no doubt that we have to do more to fix our \ndebt and deficits, but we need to do it in a smart, responsible way. \nThat is what this budget does.\n  I certainly hope we will be able to come together this week to \nreplace the harmful cuts under sequestration with a comprehensive and \nresponsible plan for addressing our debt and deficit. That is why I \nintend to vote for this budget--because it does exactly that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Murray, has \nquestioned the $1.5 trillion in tax increases that we have contended in \nthis legislation. I think it is there because there are two separate \nreserve funds that would allow taxes to be increased by $500 billion \nwithout legislation and would go through without a supermajority, to be \npassed on a simple vote.\n  But our colleagues say that is not there, so I would offer into the \nRecord, Mr. President, a number of documents that support our view that \nit is $1.5 trillion. Others can agree, disagree about it, as it is \npresently written. I would offer that for the Record and our \nexplanation and why we think that is accurate. I ask unanimous consent \nto have that material printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n An Explanation of the $1.5 Trillion Tax Hike in the Senate Democrats' \n                             FY2014 Budget\n\n       When the Budget Committee minority staff began analyzing \n     Senate Democrats' FY 2014 budget last week, they discovered \n     that the plan called for not $975 billion in tax increases--\n     the amount that the majority claimed--but instead $1.5 \n     trillion in tax hikes.\n       How is this possible? The answer lies in an arcane budget \n     tool known as a ``deficit neutral reserve fund'' (DNRF). \n     Because it is not possible to legislate on a budget \n     resolution, DNRFs were created to facilitate the passage of \n     subsequent legislation. They do this by removing future \n     barriers in the form of budget points of order.\n       To understand how DNRFs work, consider an example: A \n     Senator wants to introduce a piece of legislation to increase \n     funding for border security. Even if that bill's spending is \n     completely offset with new tax revenue, the legislation could \n     still be subject to a budget point of order. (Importantly, if \n     the new spending is offset with spending reductions \n     elsewhere, the bill would not be subject to that point of \n     order.) So if the Senator knows during consideration of a \n     budget resolution that he will be introducing border security \n     legislation at a later time, he can offer a DNRF to preclude \n     the possibility of that point of order being raised when his \n     bill is brought up.\n       Returning to the Senate Democrats' FY 2014 budget, the \n     majority asserts that their plan ``includes budget \n     reconciliation instructions . . . that [instruct] the Senate \n     Finance Committee to report legislation that will reduce the \n     deficit by $975 billion through changes to the tax code \n     alone.'' The budget also calls for an extension of the \n     certain refundable tax credits that were originally included \n     in the 2009 stimulus law (the American Reinvestment and \n     Recovery Act). After accounting for the extension of these \n     tax credits, the summary tables included with the budget \n     reflect a revenue level that is $923 billion higher than the \n     Congressional Budget Office current law baseline.\n       In a separate place in their policy document, Chairman \n     Murray proposes to ``[replace] sequestration using the \n     following equal mix of responsible spending cuts and . . . \n     $480 billion in new revenue . . .'' Finally, the majority \n     also proposes a $100 billion ``jobs and infrastructure'' \n     package that ``is fully paid for by eliminating loopholes and \n     cutting wasteful spending in the tax code . . .'' [see Table \n     1]\n       It was initially assumed that this additional $580 billion \n     was simply a detailed breakdown of a portion of the $975 \n     billion in tax increases called for through reconciliation, \n     but then Budget Committee analysts found two separate deficit \n     neutral reserve funds (Sec. 301 and Sec. 308) that exactly\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\n     match those respective amounts. Recall that the sole purpose \n     of a DNRF is to pave the way for legislation that increases \n     both taxes and spending. If the Murray budget intended for \n     the $580 billion to be a subset of the $975 billion, they \n     would have had no need to include these two DNRFs. In other \n     words, it must be assumed that the $580 billion is in \n     addition to the tax hikes called for in the reconciliation \n     instructions.\n       In total, therefore, the Senate Democrat budget clearly \n     calls for $1.503 trillion (the $923 billion from the tax \n     increases through reconciliation adjusted for the extension \n     of the refundable tax credits plus $580 billion) in tax \n     increases. The budget's authors have protested this \n     calculation, but if they wish to clear up the confusion, \n     surely they would agree to amend their resolution to \n     remove these two DNRFs and remove any possibility that the \n     funds will be used for additional future tax increases.\n\n        Table 1--Proposed Tax Increases in the Democrats' Budget\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Cite in budget\n     Proposed tax increases          10-year total     document* and how\n                                                          implemented\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``Includes $100 billion . . .     $100 billion......

He added: ``If anything I'd argue \n     that even the $1.5 trillion number understates the tax \n     increases allowed by the Murray budget resolution. She's \n     requiring $975 billion in tax increases to reduce future \n     deficits, and allowing for unlimited amounts more to pay for \n     new spending. I find that terrifying.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to say this to my chairman: I am willing \nto concede the point if the chair would agree to amend the two reserve \nfunds so that they cannot be used to advance tax increases, and I would \ncease making that argument and accept the fact that you have already \nalmost $1 trillion in new taxes.\n  So I would ask through the chair, is the Senator willing to amend \nthose two reserve fund languages so they cannot be used to add another \n$500 billion in new taxes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just respond again. As the \nWashington Post said in giving this concoction two Pinocchios, the \nreserve funds the Senator refers to lie within there in order to \nprovide the $975 billion in revenues. So essentially what he is doing \nis double-counting. So I would just say to the Senator through the \nChair that there is no need to have any kind of agreement here. That is \nwhat our budget does. It is clear. It is what every expert has said.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chair, and I assume, then, \nthat she refuses to clarify the ambiguity, the certain option to \nincrease taxes by another $500 billion. That could be eliminated simply \nby making the suggestion I just announced. She is rejecting that. So I \nthink it is legitimate to assume that the intent of this reserve fund \nis to raise taxes another $500 billion.\n  Secondly, with regard to the situation we have been discussing \nconcerning the sequester, I know the Senator said just a few moments \nago that the sequester is not deficit reduction. We can disagree about \nthat, but that was her opinion, apparently. I think it is inaccurate.\n  But my question to the Senator is, does your budget as now presented \non the floor eliminate the spending limits that are in current law \nunder the Budget Control Act and specifically the sequester portion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as I have stated many times out here on \nthe floor--and our budget is very clear--we replace sequestration with \na balanced mix of spending cuts and revenues, exactly as we have \nstated. There is no reason to misconstrue this. That is exactly what \nour budget does.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I wouldn't misconstrue it. So it does eliminate \nthe sequester.\n  So then the next question would be, did you score the allowed \nincrease in spending of $1.2 trillion in your budget as increased \nspending?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is a matter of semantics. We replace \nthe sequestration, very clearly, because it is very damaging to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, your staff indicated that you could not double-\ncount that money, and if you eliminated the $1.2 trillion in sequester \nlimit and allowed $1.2 trillion more to be spent, you would not save \n$1.85 trillion but approximately $700 billion on that decision alone. \nDo you agree with your staff in their analysis?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I assume we are taking this off the \nRepublican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me be very clear: We have put out a \nbudget that is credible. It is clear, and it is a good, solid approach. \nI know we are playing with numbers here in terms of baselines. There is \nno need to do that. We are doing what every single budget has done--\nSimpson-Bowles and everyone else--replacing the sequestration. We are \nclear that we have $975 billion in spending cuts, $975 billion in \nrevenue. We, within the context of that, replace the sequester cuts. We \ntake the $2.4 trillion that has already been done since Simpson-\nBowles--since Simpson-Bowles and we add another $1.85 trillion in \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One more question, then. Do you still stand by the \npromotional material that went with the budget--and in the budget \ndocument itself--that you have reduced the deficit over current law by \n$1.85 trillion or isn't it a fact that eliminating the sequester \nreduces that to approximately $700 billion in savings?\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the baseline, which we are very \nclear in what we are using--we are not hiding the ball, as he is trying \nto do when he is mixing numbers here--we reduce the budget by an \nadditional $1.85 trillion, absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just say that the Associated \nPress disagrees. It is plainly inaccurate. Plainly, I asked that \nquestion, over current law, did they count the sequester increase in \nspending? And the staff admitted in our Budget Committee mark up that \nit did not--that increased spending--and therefore we reduce the \ndeficit savings from $1.85 trillion to about $700 billion. There is \nanother $700 billion in gimmicks, so there is no reduction in the \ndeficit in this budget.\n  The AP reported:\n\n       . . . because Democrats want to restore $1.2 trillion in \n     automatic spending cuts . . .--cuts imposed by [the] failure \n     to strike a . . . budget pact--Murray's blueprint increases \n     spending slightly when compared with current policies.\n\n  The Hill says:\n\n       The Murray budget does not contain net spending cuts with \n     the sequester turned off.\n\n  So I will say this is a serious issue. We need to understand that the \nsequester is law. It is not just a policy, it is in law. It is taking \neffect right now. The deficit reduction proposed by this bill is not \n$1.8 trillion but, in fact, zero.\n  I thank the Chair and would now recognize Senator Barrasso for 10 \nminutes, I believe, and Senator Alexander for 10 minutes. I thank them \nfor their patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, within the last 20 minutes, I have heard \non the floor comments about the sequester. A previous speaker on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle said the sequester was hurting small \nbusiness and said the sequester was causing economic uncertainty. \nAnother Senator on the other side of the aisle made reference to the \nWashington Post.\n  Well, I would draw the attention of this body to the Washington Post \nof this morning, a front page story in the Washington Post of today, \nThursday, March 21: ``Health-care uncertainty weighs down small \nfirms''--not the sequester, uncertainty about the health care law. \n``Requirements under 2010 law sow confusion, fear among businesses.'' \nThat is the problem that is driving the fear and the anxiety and the \nlack of new business starts and the failure to expand business.\n  In this article, there is a small business owner of an air-\nconditioning firm in Richmond. He says:\n\n       In speaking to them, I am convinced--\n  He is talking about other customers, he is talking about other \nbusinesses--\n\n       I am convinced that the primary reason we aren't seeing a \n     robust economic recovery is the uncertainty and costs \n     associated with this health-care law.\n\n  ``Looming health-care changes hold back small businesses.''\n  Another quote from the article:\n\n       It's already hard out there right now. . . . This may be--\n\n  ``This'': the health care law--\n\n       the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n\n  Not the sequester, not made-up confusion by the Democrats, it is the \nhealth care law that is hurting our economy. Even the Federal Reserve, \nin their Beige Book, said so this past month.\n  So I rise today to speak on the fiscal year 2014 budget and the \nchoice we face over whether we are going to grow the economy or just \ngrow government bureaucracy.\n  When I travel home to Wyoming, as I did last weekend and will again \nthis weekend, I hear from hard-working American taxpayers that they do \nnot believe Washington is spending their tax dollars wisely. They think \nWashington has become far too inefficient, ineffective, and \nunaccountable. It is not just the people in Wyoming I am hearing it \nfrom. According to Gallup, Americans across the country estimate that \nthe Federal Government wastes 51 cents of every dollar it spends. More \nthan half of all taxpayer dollars are wasted is what the American \npeople believe. So when people look at the Federal budget--and the \ndebate that we are having today in the Senate--it is no wonder they are \nconcerned. They want to know how this budget is going to affect them \nand their quality of life.\n  Looking at the Democratic budget, I think the American people have \nevery reason to be skeptical and every reason to be concerned. This \nbudget is just more of the same--more taxes, more spending, and more \ndebt--and it never reaches balance, not this year, not 10 years from \nnow, not ever.\n  This budget does far too little to heal our ailing economy and far \ntoo much to expand Washington bureaucracy. The budget the Democrats \nhave put forward would increase taxes by $1 trillion. That is on top of \nthe trillion dollars in tax increases in the President's health care \nlaw. It is also on top of the tax hikes the President demanded in the \nJanuary deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. In contrast, the Republican \nplan from the House Budget Committee will not increase taxes at all.\n  The Democrats' budget will also rack up $7.3 trillion in new debt \nover the next decade. Since President Obama took office 4 years ago, he \nhas added more than $6 trillion to our national debt. For 4 years, he \nhas run budget deficits of over $1 trillion each and every one of those \n4 years. Now Senate Democrats want to throw good money after bad and \nadd another $7 trillion on top of that. The President has simply wasted \ntoo much of the American taxpayers' money. The American people have \nbeen stuck with an enormous bill as well as an anemic economy and \neconomic growth that has been very slow.\n  The American people think more than half of all Washington spending \nis wasted, and the Democrats cannot find a single dollar that they \nthink should be saved. Democrats actually want to increase Washington's \nspending by another $645 billion.\n  This budget would spend $46.4 trillion over the next 10 years. \nApparently, President Obama thinks the only things which need to be cut \nfrom our budget are White House tours.\n  Well, Republicans and the American people know there is a lot more we \ncould be cutting. Taxpayers are demanding Washington finally get \nserious about our budget and stop the political games and political \ngimmicks. It is time for Washington to do what families across the \ncountry have always needed to do, live within their means. Democrats \nstill don't seem to get it. They continue to insist the rules don't \napply to Washington, and they should not be held accountable for their \nspending choices.\n  Like their other failed policies of the past few years, the \nDemocrats' plan is very much a statement of their priorities. It does \nnothing to stop the overregulation which is destroying jobs and \nstrangling our economy. It protects failing government programs from \nreform. It does nothing to preserve and protect Medicare and Social \nSecurity for future generations. It spends more money so Washington \nDemocrats don't need to make a single tough choice. They have made \ntheir priorities clear, but they are the wrong priorities for America.\n  Republicans have offered a plan which starts to rein in Washington's \nspending and getting it back in line with revenue. This is what we \nshould be doing. With a debt of more than $16 trillion, it is why, and \nit is way beyond the time to balance the budget.\n  We need to finally start to ease the burden of that debt on future \ngenerations. We need to reduce our obligations to countries such as \nChina. We need budget reforms which help to grow our economy and create \njobs, or we can go in the opposite direction the Democratic way. The \nDemocratic budget never balances. It never even comes close to \nbalanced.\n  The smallest deficit it ever achieves would be more than $400 billion \nin 2016, and then the deficit begins to climb again. It continues \nWashington's unrestrained borrowing and spending and continues the \ndamage 4 years of failed Democratic priorities have done to our \neconomy. According to one independent analysis, the Democrats' budget \nwould cost America 853,000 jobs. Total economic output would be $1.4 \ntrillion less because of this budget. Private investment would be $82 \nbillion less per year.\n  As bad as this budget is, at least we finally have a Democratic \nbudget to debate. This is the first time in 4 years the Democrats have \neven bothered to offer a budget in the Senate.\n  President Obama has not even submitted a budget. Where is the \nPresident's budget? It was due on February 4. Now the White House says \nthey will\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\nfinally produce a budget maybe sometime in April. This is more than 2 \nmonths late.\n  What we have to work with is an unserious budget plan written by \nSenate Democrats. It is inadequate to the challenges we face as a \ncountry. It is out of touch with what the American people want, and it \nis a slap in the face to the hard-working taxpayers who will need to \npay for it.\n  If President Obama truly believes we can take a balanced approach to \nour budget, he should publicly oppose this wildly unbalanced budget \nwhich harms America. We need a serious budget, one which grows the \neconomy, not government bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about \n11 million low-income children in America, children which all of us \nwould like to help. These are children that I wish would have a chance \nto get a little help getting to the starting line towards realizing the \nAmerican dream. I am talking about the children we help through the \nFederal education program called title I of the elementary and \nsecondary education act.\n  It is the largest of our Federal programs aiding elementary and \nsecondary schools. It provides $14.5 billion a year to local school \ndistricts. The express purpose of it is to help low-income children in \nschools across our country.\n  The problem is that the money is not going to help those children as \nit was intended. It is being diverted for other purposes.\n  As part of our discussion today and tomorrow on the budget, I will be \noffering an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Paul, Senator Rubio, \nSenator Toomey, and Senator McConnell, which will redirect the 14.5 \nbillion Federal dollars we spend on behalf of 11 million children \nliving in poverty.\n  This is the way we would do it: We would simply pin $1,300 in funds \nto each of those children, and let this money follow the child to the \nschool they attend, any accredited school, public or private.\n  In a contentious Washington world this is a problem which seems to \nhave a broad amount of agreement from the left and the right. As I \nsaid, this $14.5 billion, which is appropriated expressly to help these \n11 million children, isn't getting to them. It is ending up in other \nplaces. It is distributed by a complicated Federal formula which is \ngenerally based on the percentage or number of low-income children in a \nparticular school district and the average per-pupil expenditure in the \nState.\n  What happens is the money largely follows the teachers' salaries. The \nchildren in wealthier districts are usually taught by teachers who earn \nhigher salaries. The children in poor districts are usually taught by \nthe teachers who earn lower salaries. A lot of the title I money ends \nup in the schools with more of the wealthier children instead of the \nschools with the poorer children.\n  Marguerite Roza, in a report by the Center for American Progress--\nwhich I think can be fairly described as a progressive think tank, \nexplained:\n  The difference in actual school expenditures are often substantial \nbecause teachers' salaries are based on their experience and credits or \ndegrees earned, and because high-poverty schools have many more less \nexperienced, lower paid teachers and much more turnover than low-\npoverty schools.\n  She offers Baltimore as an example:\n\n       When teachers at one school in a high-poverty neighborhood \n     were paid an average of $37,618, at another school in the \n     same district the average teacher's salary was $57,000.\n\n  Assuming the same average number of teachers per school, say 20, the \ndifference in dollars for the two schools is $387,640. That is a lot of \nmoney per school.\n  Under the Federal formula, this is considered ``comparable'' or fair, \nwhich means the poor school is essentially stuck with newer, less \nexpert teachers. This is a system designed for the bureaucracy and the \nadults, not the students.\n  A different report by the Fordham Foundation, which I would call a \ncenter-right foundation, came to a similar conclusion. It summed up its \nfindings by saying:\n\n       All of these problems have a common root: today, money does \n     not follow children to the schools they attend according to \n     their needs. Instead, money flows on the basis of factors \n     which have little to do with the needs of students, the \n     resources required to educate them successfully, or the \n     educational preferences of their parents.\n\n  We have scholars from the Center for American Progress and Fordham \nFoundation coming to the same conclusion, largely because the title I \nmoney is distributed based on teachers' salaries and because very often \nthe wealthier school districts pay teachers more. We have significantly \nmore title I money in a school with wealthier children than with poor \nchildren, even though the purpose of the $14.5 billion is to help those \nlow-income children move from the back of the line to the front of the \nline.\n\n  This is a lot of money. This is $1,300 per child. If you have a \nschool full of children who bring $1,300 with them pinned on their \njackets, they have a lot of money to help those children. I think most \nof us believe that if we are trying to help children get to the \nstarting line, children who might not have had as much help as other \nchildren, might not have had a book read to them by their parents, \nmight not have eaten lunch that day, and who have other challenges \nassociated with living in poverty, then we want to make sure we are \nspending every single dollar designated toward them for them.\n  Why isn't the right solution simply to say let's take these $1,300 \nper student and let it follow the student to the school they attend? \nThis means almost all the money would go to public schools. We have \n100,000 public schools in the country, but children are usually \nassigned to public schools. Sometimes they may choose a public school. \nThis is a matter of State law. This wouldn't interfere with that at \nall. If the parent chooses instead for their child to go to a nonprofit \nor attend a private school, as long as that school is accredited, the \n$1,300 would follow the child to that school.\n  Some may say that sounds a little different than the way we do it \nnow. It is a little different, but the main difference is the money \nfollows the child. It is not different that we spend public money in \nprivate schools. We already do that with title I money by providing \nservices to children who go to private schools under a formula in the \nFederal law. We have long experience, dating back to World War II, with \npublic money following college students to community colleges, to \nuniversities, and even after World War II to high schools. The GI bill \nfollowed the veteran to the school they wanted to go to, whether it was \nthe University of Tennessee, Notre Dame, Yeshiva, or any other school, \nas long as it was an accredited school.\n  Of course, in our system of education I think we would all agree that \nwe have had the greatest success with higher education, for a variety \nof reasons. I believe one of the reasons for this success is we have \nprovided generous amounts of Federal dollars that follow the student to \nthe accredited college of their choice, public or private. We call \nthose Pell grants. We call those federal loans. More than half of the \ncollege students in the country today go there with some government \nmoney that follows them to the academic institution of their choice.\n  By allowing title I money to do this, we could say the $1,300 \nscholarship is almost a Pell grant for kids. We could say we will \nattach it right to the child. It follows the child to the school. It is \nthe most logical way to do that.\n  Some of my colleagues would like to fix this comparability problem by \nimposing a whole series of mandates on State and local school districts \neven though the Federal Government only supplies about 10 percent of \nall the money spent on local elementary and secondary schools. This \nwould produce a minor revolution in the country, and it would be a \ngross overextension of Federal power to say that just because we \nprovide 10 percent of the money, and we don't give it effectively, we \nare going to make it our job to tell Tennessee, Georgia, New Mexico, or \nany other State how to spend it.\n  The simple and logical way to solve the comparability problem that \nthe left and the right agree on is to let the $14.5 billion follow each \nof the 11 million children living in poverty to the school they attend. \nThen we could make sure that taxpayer dollars are\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\nbeing used in the most effective way to help these children have the \nsingle best opportunity they may have to get a leg up on reaching the \nAmerican dream, which is through a good education in the best possible \nschool.\n  I look forward to introducing an amendment to do this. As the ranking \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I look \nforward to working with Senator Paul, Senator Rubio, Senator Toomey, \nSenator McConnell, and, hopefully, a number of my Democratic colleagues \nto solve the misallocation of title I money.\n  Let's do the simple and logical thing: Let the funds follow low-\nincome children to the school they attend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to raise my voice in this \nimportant dialogue about the budget currently pending before this body.\n  I am thrilled as, first, we are actually having this debate. It has \nbeen 4 long years since we passed a budget. I am deeply disappointed \nthe President's budget is not part of this discussion. He missed his \nfirst Monday in February requirement, and it must not fit into his \nschedule to produce one until the second week of April.\n  Budgets are economic documents, but they are also much more than \nthat. Budgets reflect moral choices we make as a nation. They shape the \nkind of society we will build for the future. Budgets are about setting \npriorities.\n  Republicans realize we have a moral obligation to spend the American \npeople's hard-earned dollars wisely. When those tax dollars are paid \ninto the government, we have an obligation to be careful with them. We \nshould spend them only in areas that we need to cover a \nconstitutionally authorized function of government and not $1 more. \nThat is why we support reforms to fix programs that Washington should \nbe funding, to eliminate programs that it shouldn't be funding and to \nbalance the budget in the process.\n\n  We all know the Federal Government wastes hundreds of billions of \ndollars each year, and the President should work with Congress to \nidentify and remove wasteful areas within the budget. My office has \nbeen focused on a very simple message that seems to make sense to every \nAmerican: Cut this, not that.\n  The Federal Government wastes hundreds of billions of dollars every \nyear, and instead of targeting waste, it is unfortunate the President \nis using fear-mongering tactics to scare Americans into believing cuts \nhave to come first from important priorities--priorities such as first \nresponders, law enforcement, national security, and educators.\n  The President and his allies in Congress want to increase spending \nand raise taxes. Republicans, meanwhile, want to prioritize spending \nand keep taxes low. The President is intentionally making cuts to \ngovernment spending as painful as possible to force more tax increases. \nCut this, not that.\n  This is a debate about priorities. Republicans have identified \ntrillions of dollars in savings that would come from eliminating waste \nand reforming programs rather than cutting important essential \nservices. The President is choosing to cut the most visible items in \norder to build opposition to any further spending reductions.\n  The debate should not be about whether we should cut, but, instead, \nhow we should cut in order to preserve our ability to afford our true \nnational priorities.\n  Here are some examples of the massive waste: $1 million spent taste \ntesting food that would be served on Mars; $4.5 billion in improper \nfood stamp payments used to purchase junk food, fast food, gourmet \ncoffee, guns, and even alcohol; $1.5 billion for free and subsidized \ncell phones billed to the American taxpayer; $230 million spent on \nfirst-class and business-class travel.\n  I say to my colleagues and to the President of the United States, cut \nfood testing on Mars, not teachers; cut free cell phones, not border \nsecurity; cut premium first-class travel, not air traffic controllers; \ncut improper food stamp payments, not first responders.\n  The President's second inaugural address was an advertisement for the \nbiggest, most expensive government our country has ever seen. It was a \npitch for new government solutions, more government programs, and the \npromises of a government-made utopia. Of course, no mention was made \nabout the future cost of the President's vision for the country, no \nmention was made about how we would pay for it, and no mention was made \nof the damage that will occur from our increasing debt and deficits.\n  Americans and Members of this body hear this message and get pulled \ninto a debate over the proper size of government or whether a certain \npolicy represents good government or bad government. We argue for a \nsmaller or more limited government or for one that is more efficient or \nmore affordable. Unfortunately, this is often where we fail to \narticulate a positive vision of what America looks like under the type \nof government we are striving to create. It is time to reframe this \ndebate. It is time for us to focus on the kinds of principles that will \nlead us to the kind of country and the kind of society we want for our \nfuture and for ourselves.\n  Here is the principle I ask Americans and my colleagues in the Senate \nto consider: The opposite of bad government is not necessarily good \ngovernment--at least not just good government. It isn't even \nnecessarily limited government. The opposite of bad government is a \nstrong civil society. A free and strong civil society is built on the \ninnate desire of Americans to contribute freely to the betterment of \nthe community. It is not the product of bureaucratic, centralized \ndecisionmakers handing down rules and regulations for the rest of us to \nfollow. A civil society is the result of the relationships that \nconnect, bind, and strengthen us. It is derived from the condition in \neach of us to do our part to help those around us.\n  Civil society is where free individuals thrive and communities \nflourish. The interconnection of local communities has always been at \nthe heart of our Nation. I am convinced our future success will be \nfound in a return to that connectedness that has driven the American \ndream from the very beginning of our Nation.\n  We see the bonds of civil society when a parent instills values in a \nchild, when a doctor heals a patient, when a teacher stays late to help \na student learn to read, when a neighbor stops to help a neighbor, when \na pastor inspires faith in a troubled soul. These are the keys to \nrestoring our faith in the institutions of civil society and away from \ndependence on an administrative state full of so-called experts. ``We, \nthe people'' does not mean a collective adherence to the agenda of the \nruling class in Washington. It instead means that as Americans we share \ncertain basic values and principles that when viewed as a whole help \nform and secure a more perfect union.\n  Americans' belief in civil society is grounded in bedrock principles \nof freedom, self-reliance, and self-governance. It is manifested in the \nform of historic American institutions, including the family, schools, \nchurches, private groups, and civic organizations. These institutions \nof civil society teach the morals, values, and behaviors that instill \nfaith, confidence, and trust between individuals, communities, and even \ngovernment. The Constitution of this great Nation provides the \nframework that ennobles the vision of the individual while, at the same \ntime, enabling the value of the institutions to create an environment \nwhere people are secure and prosperous and free.\n  It is important to remember that government cannot create a civil \nsociety, but it can kill it. Over the past 80 years, the Federal \nGovernment has expanded well beyond its constitutional limits. History \ndemonstrates that as the power of the Federal Government increases, the \nability to self-govern diminishes to a corresponding degree. As self-\ngovernance decreases, so too does the influence of the institutions of \ncivil society. Soon, the ability to instill faith, competence, and \ntrust among individuals and communities is replaced by the false \npromises of big government.\n  America is extraordinary, not because of who we are but because of \nwhat we do. Despite the current crushing weight of our bloated Federal \nbureaucracy, we can still see the strength of our Nation's fabric \nthrough the intertwining actions of the genuine heroes all around us. \nThey are often described as the daily deeds that everyday citizens \nperform every day, but\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nthey are powerful reminders of the strength of the American spirit and \nthe values we share.\n  We have a moral obligation to future generations to make the peoples' \npriorities our priorities. The budget debate isn't just about dollars, \nit is about sense. It is about common sense. Rather than having a \nbudget battle between Democratic and Republican priorities, we should \nbe having a dialog about American priorities.\n  Republicans recognize that keeping dollars, decisions, priorities \nand, at the end of the day, power in the hands of the people is what \nhas long made America the greatest civilization the world has ever \nknown. Now is the time to return to that model. I encourage my \ncolleagues to keep that very model in mind as we embark on this \ncritical debate. Working together we can, we must, and we will restore \nthe greatness and prosperity of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the recognition, and I ask \nunanimous consent--I was going to ask that Senator Shaheen be allowed \nto follow me. She is on the floor now and so she will.\n  I am pleased to stand and talk about amendment No. 138, sponsored by \nSenator Shaheen of New Hampshire and myself. It is a solution to a \nproblem we have in this country and we have in this body. The problem \nis we have not been able to appropriate; we have not been able to \nbudget. Our debts and deficits have grown, and it has turned into a \nsituation where we do not function as well as we should over the most \nimportant responsibility of government; that is, spending money.\n  For one second I wish to talk about my side. Then I will defer to a \nlady who has been there and done that, because the State of New \nHampshire is a biennial budgeting State.\n  We have a process problem. We budget every year, we spend money every \nyear, but we never do oversight, we never look for cost-benefit \nsavings, and we never look at analysis. This biennial budgeting \namendment does the following things:\n  No. 1, it amends the Budget Act to require the Congress to do a 2-\nyear budget, not a 1-year budget; No. 2, and followed by that, it \nrequires them to do 2-year appropriations bills, not 1-year \nappropriations.\n  The appropriations bills and the budget are passed in the first year \nof a Congress, which means the odd-number year. In the even-number \nyear, it is dedicated to oversight, efficiency, and cost-benefit \nanalysis, something we do far too little of in this body and far too \nlittle of in this country.\n  Wouldn't it be nice to have elections every even-numbered year where \nMembers of Congress were running for office based on the savings they \nare going to find, the efficiency they will create, and the \naccountability they will have in appropriations, rather than talking \nabout how much more bacon they are going to bring home or how much more \nmoney they will spend.\n  This legislation creates a new majority point of order against any \namendment that is not confined and coordinated with the 2-year budget \nprocess and the 2-year appropriations process.\n  I have been in Washington 15 years, and we have gotten into the \nbusiness of when we do appropriations bills, they are omnibus; and when \nwe do budgets, which we haven't done in 3 years, they end up being more \nof an argument over political philosophy than a practical roadmap for \nthe American people.\n  The biennial budgeting process, which has been adopted by 20 of the \n50 States in this country, is a process that will work and will force \nus to do what we know our job is--to appropriate, to budget, and then \nto conduct oversight to make sure the money we are spending is \nefficient.\n  One side note before I yield to Senator Shaheen. The State of Israel, \n3 years ago--4 years ago--was having difficulty with deficits and debt. \nThey went to the World Bank for advice and consultation and they \nrecommended--the World Bank did--that they adopt a biennial budget \nprocess and a biennial appropriations process. In the 3 years since \nthat time, while operating under those principles, they have gone from \ndeficits to surpluses, and they have gone from debt to a lower debt. In \nother words, it has worked in Israel, it worked in a democracy, it \nworks in 20 of our 50 States, and it can work in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Every President since Ronald Reagan has endorsed the biennial budget. \nMembers of the Cabinet of the President who were nominated and have \nbeen confirmed have endorsed a biennial budget. Pete Domenici started \nthis process 15 years ago, and we want to bring it to a conclusion this \nyear. So I urge my colleagues to support and adopt amendment No. 138, \ncreating a biennial budget process and accountability for our \nappropriations.\n  I yield the floor now to the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been \nthere and done this in her State, and she is a great partner with me in \nthis bipartisan amendment for success in this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I wish to thank my colleague from Georgia Senator \nIsakson for his eloquent and thoughtful remarks in support of the \nbiennial budgeting amendment. I am proud to join him as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment and a cosponsor of the legislation we introduced last \nweek, in fact.\n  I am pleased to point out on the floor with us is Senator Angus King, \nmy neighbor from Maine, who is also a sponsor of biennial budget \nlegislation.\n  I appreciate we have the budget resolution before us. I think it is \nan important step toward returning to regular order. But the fact is, \nas my colleague just pointed out, since 1980, we have only had two \nbudget processes that have finished on time, according to schedule. We \nhave had every President since that time, since Ronald Reagan, endorse \na biennial budget. As my colleague said, I have been there and done \nthat. As Governor of New Hampshire, as the Governors of 19 other \nStates, we have biennial budgets. It has worked very well--because as \nthis amendment would do, and as the biennial budget process would do, \nit would give us the chance to spend the first year of the budget cycle \nworking on the budget, looking at programs and preparing for the budget \nand then the second year in oversight, so we can make sure what we are \nspending our money on is effective and is doing what we want it to do. \nIt would give us a more transparent process and would, hopefully, allow \nus to address what has been one of the real challenges we have faced in \nCongress; that is, getting a budget through on time, according to the \nprocess.\n  As my colleague from Georgia pointed out, as we think about \naddressing the debt and deficits facing the country, as we think about \ninvestments we need to make going forward, thinking about how we can \nuse the process in a way that is more effective, that works better, is \nsomething we also ought to be including. We have had a lot of momentum \nthat is built around the biennial budget legislation. In the last \nCongress, we had 37 bipartisan cosponsors. We had the support of then-\nbudget chair Kent Conrad and ranking member Jeff Sessions. So we have \nsome momentum. I think we clearly have an opportunity. I hope we will \ntake advantage of it and that our colleagues will support this effort.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I just to want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire for what she has done in supporting this, \nand I thank my other colleagues who are supporting it. This is an idea \nwhose time has come. I urge every Member of the Senate tonight to vote \nfor this amendment so we can begin a new process and a new day in this \nCongress.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the chairman, and I rise to speak \nbriefly in support of the Senate budget resolution and four amendments \nthat I will be offering. I believe these amendments will improve the \nunderlying budget resolution and they deserve broad support.\n  First, Udall amendment No. 192 addresses the need to increase access \nto care for rural veterans.\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\n  Many of these veterans, including those in New Mexico, travel long \ndistances between their homes and Veterans' Administration medical \ncenters. Many other States have rural veterans who face the same \nchallenges. I am glad to be joined by Senator Moran from Kansas as a \ncosponsor of this bipartisan amendment. Expanding access to health care \nin rural areas helps our veterans get the care they need.\n  The second Udall amendment, No. 311, would ensure that the 113th \nCongress can strengthen and reform the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration. During the past decade NNSA has shown repeated failures \nin managing and planning projects. The result is costly overruns, \ndeferrals, and, in some cases, security lapses. These failures are not \nonly a threat to our national security, they pose threats to the safety \nof the scientists, engineers, and other workers employed at the \nNational Labs.\n  I cosponsored an amendment to the 2013 Defense Authorization Act with \nSenator Kyl to form an advisory panel and to take a look at this to \nmake bipartisan recommendations to improve the governance and structure \nof the NNSA. It is vital that necessary reforms would be completed.\n  The third Udall amendment, to lay the foundation, is for future hard \nrock mining reform in the 113th Congress. I have just filed this \namendment so it does not yet have a number. We should correct a \nlongstanding fiscal loophole and establish a royalty on hard rock \nminerals mined on Federal lands. Since 1872, the Federal Government has \nliterally been giving away our gold, silver, uranium, and other hard \nrock minerals, handing over these public resources for free. A royalty \nis long overdue. It could be used for the reclamation of thousands of \nabandoned hard rock mines across the country, as well as for budget \ndeficit reduction.\n  Oil and gas and coal all pay Federal royalties when extracted from \nFederal land. All other developed nations apply royalties to hard rock \nminerals. This amendment does not prejudge what type of royalty \nCongress might agree on. The mining industry supports one type of \nroyalty. We have worked with Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Murkowski, \nand Majority Leader Reid on the text of this amendment, and I hope it \nis acceptable to a broad range of the Senate.\n  Lastly, I have also filed an amendment to allow for full funding of \nthe Impact Aid Program. This program is one of the oldest Federal \nelementary and secondary education programs, going back 63 years. \nImpact Aid supports school districts that lose local revenues, such as \nproperty taxes, when educating pupils who live on Federal lands, such \nas military bases and Indian reservations. Impact Aid funding has been \nflat for many years, but the costs of education have gone up \nsignificantly, shortchanging many Indian communities.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this amendment by Senator Baucus of \nMontana who faces many of the same issues as we do in New Mexico and \nthroughout the West. Finally, let me thank Chairman Murray for the work \non this budget. She has shown real courage and leadership on this \nbudget and pulled together a very diverse committee.\n  I think this is a budget bill that is good for the middle class, and \nit is going to be a fair and sensible budget. The budget is critically \nimportant to my State of New Mexico. It replaces the devastating \nsequester cuts with a balanced approach that will save thousands of \njobs in my State. At home in New Mexico, sequestration is not just \nanother political issue, it is a bread-and-butter issue for our family \nbudgets: smaller paychecks, lost contracts, real economic harm.\n  Not only does the Senate budget resolution put a stop to the \nsequester, it also helps rebuild our economy with $100 billion for jobs \nand infrastructure investment. It will help spur job creation and \nrebuild the outdated infrastructure on which American businesses \ndepend.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendments and support this \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Ranking Member Murkowski from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. I do appreciate the courtesy. Members are waiting all over \nthe Capitol and maybe a few other places.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside and the following amendments to S. Con. Res. 8 be \ncalled up:\n  Murray No. 433, Hatch No. 297, Stabenow No. 432, Grassley No. 156, \nMikulski No. 431, Ayotte No. 158, Cruz No. 202, Murray No. 439, Crapo \nNo. 222, and Shaheen No. 438; that the time until 8:10 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two managers, or their designees, prior to votes in \nrelation to the Sessions motion and the first four amendments listed; \nthat all after the first vote this evening be 10-minute votes; that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form prior to each \nvote; that no amendments be in order to the motion or any of the \namendments prior to the votes in relation to these items; that \nfollowing votes this evening, the remainder of today's session be for \ndebate only on the concurrent resolution; further, that when the Senate \nconvenes at 9 a.m. on Friday, March 22, the Senate resume consideration \nof S. Con. Res. 8 with the time until 11 a.m. equally divided between \nthe two managers or their designees; that at 11 a.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the remaining amendments listed above; \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote and all \nafter the first vote in this sequence be 10-minute votes; that upon \ndisposition of the last amendment listed, there be 2 hours equally \ndivided between the two managers or their designees remaining on the \nconcurrent resolution; finally, the next amendment in order be an \namendment from the majority side to be followed by a Republican \nalternative to Shaheen No. 438.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in consultation with Senator \nMcConnell today. We believe this is an appropriate way to go forward. I \nappreciate very much the work of the two managers on this legislation. \nThis is noteworthy legislation. Debate at this point has been courteous \nand strong. There are feelings on both sides, and that is what this \nbody is supposed to be.\n  So I am grateful to the two managers of this bill, and I again \nappreciate my friend from Alaska yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take 3 minutes \noff of our side of the 30 minutes to allow the Senator from Alaska to \nproceed, and then we will continue on the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I came to the floor, as Senator Isakson \nfrom Georgia and Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire were speaking about \nthe biennial budget amendment and the effort they have undertaken. I \njust want to acknowledge their leadership on this issue. I think it is \nsmart, I think it is wise, and I think it is something that we as a \nSenate should surely consider. I wanted to just make that brief \ncomment.\n  As the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nI know bipartisan progress on energy is possible in this Congress. \nWhile it may take our committee some time to develop, consider, and \ncomplete legislation within this area, we have a great opportunity to \ntake the first step forward today through the adoption of a number of \nenergy-related amendments that I have offered. I filed three amendments \nthat would help us seize on the historic opportunities within our \nreach. I hope the Senate would agree to adjust the resolution before us \nto reflect their beneficial impact.\n  The first amendment that I have introduced is cosponsored by the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt. It would raise an estimated $3.1 \nbillion--not through taxes but by facilitating new energy production on \nFederal lands and waters that are currently not open to development.\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n  It is worth noting that the $3.1 billion estimate is probably far too \nlow. Almost certainly that number does not account for the substantial \nreceipts that would result from a good plan to boost Federal production \noffshore and onshore in Alaska and across the continental United \nStates. But for this amendment, we relied on the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates for receipts that we already know we can raise. If we \nwere to take action today, we will also generate far greater receipts \nin the years ahead. CBO doesn't assume that production will begin \nwithin its 10-year window, but it has acknowledged that Federal \nreceipts will grow tremendously by several billion dollars a year once \nit does.\n  Some Members might question why this amendment is even necessary at \nall. They know that oil and natural gas production is rising in this \ncountry. After watching a few campaign ads, listening to a few \nspeeches, they might think that everything is fine right now. But that \nis hardly the case. While overall production has in fact risen, the \nentirety of that increase has been from State and private lands. \nProduction on our Federal lands and waters--the only area that the \nFederal Government is responsible for managing--has actually fallen.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, oil production on \nFederal lands is down 6 percent since 2009 while natural gas production \nis down 21 percent. Just as worrisome, the pace of permitting--which is \na key indicator for future production--has also slowed.\n  The Senator from Missouri and I believe it is time to produce more of \nour prolific resources beneath our Federal lands and waters. We need \nthe jobs, we need to reduce our deficits, we need to keep energy prices \ndown, and we need to break our dependence on foreign oil. New \nproduction will help us accomplish all of those crucial goals, and \nthere is no real downside.\n  My second amendment is focused on increasing oil production on \nFederal lands in Alaska. Right now, no production is occurring on those \nlands. That is the case even though we have more than 200 million acres \nof Federal land and close to 40 billion barrels of conventional oil \njust waiting to be produced. The cause, of course, is the Federal \nGovernment continues to deny, delay, and generally up-end anyone who \ntries to bring energy to the market. The consequences are now apparent \nfor all to see.\n  In 1988, Alaska produced more than 2 million barrels of oil per day. \nLast year, they had fallen all the way down to 526,000 barrels per day, \nand it is forecasted to drop even further in the years ahead. In \nAlaska, we are treating this as an emergency, and the Senate should as \nwell. If our production continues to decline, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nsystem could be shut down. Our Nation could lose a substantial share of \nits oil supply. Jobs will be lost, energy prices will rise, our \ndependence on foreign oil will deepen, sapping our economy and progress \nthat we have made.\n  These consequences and others that would manifest must be avoided--\ncan be avoided--and it is within our power to do that. Alaska doesn't \nneed subsidies or loans or grants or tax credits. What we need is \npermission to produce. We need the Federal Government to work with us, \nnot against us. We need access to our National Petroleum Reserve. We \nneed access to that tiny dot of land in the nonwilderness portion of \nthe Coastal Plains. We also need to be able to explore new areas where \nresources have not yet been discovered.\n  My amendment is simple. It would modify the budget resolution to \naccount for substantial receipts--about $2.5 billion--from increased \noil in Alaska. As with the amendment that Senator Blunt and I have \ncosponsored, this estimate is probably too low. We anticipate that \nreceipts would grow tremendously once production begins. We always talk \nabout the need for an ``all of the above'' policy. That would allow for \nit.\n  I have one final amendment that I would speak to briefly, and this is \none that would facilitate the creation of an advanced energy trust \nfund. This was part of my energy 2020 blueprint that I released earlier \nthis year. It is specifically designed to help create an energy policy \nthat pays for itself. It would open new lands that are not currently \navailable for development and devote a share of the receipts to energy \nresearch.\n  This concept has gotten pretty broad support, notably from the think \ntanks, and even more notably from the President himself. But I would be \nremiss if I didn't point out why my plan works and why the President's \ndoes not. While I would raise new receipts from new production, the \nPresident would divert revenues from production that is already \nscheduled to occur.\n  The result of his plan would be either deficit spending or, most \nlikely, tax hikes elsewhere in the budget. Neither of those would be \nacceptable to us, particularly when we know there is a better path \nforward.\n  My amendments offer us an opportunity to create jobs, to make energy \nmore affordable, to reduce our debt, to break our dependence on foreign \noil. That is in the best interests of a coherent energy policy that so \nmany of us are working to develop and certainly in the best interests \nof our Nation's budget. I encourage my colleagues to take a look at \nthese amendments and, should they be brought before us for a vote, to \njoin me in support of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think I can yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 156. \nI am offering this amendment to the majority budget to ensure that tax \nreform is revenue neutral and the money available to do tax reform is \nnot used for spending, as the underlying resolution proposes. I am \npleased to be joined in offering this amendment by a number of my \ncolleagues: Senator Enzi, Leader McConnell, Senator Cornyn, the finance \nranking member Senator Hatch, as well as Senators Burr, Roberts, \nPortman, Isakson, Thune, Coats, and Rubio.\n  In order to ensure tax reform does not become a tax-raising exercise, \nthis amendment eliminates the nearly $1 trillion in new revenue and the \nreconciliation instructions called for in the majority's budget. It \nfurther creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund for progrowth, revenue-\nneutral tax reform.\n  The budget reconciles the Finance Committee to come up with nearly $1 \ntrillion in revenue. I spoke last night how difficult that is to do \nunless you want to tax middle-income Americans. This reconciliation \ninstruction, in addition to raising a lot of money to spend more, \ndashes the hopes that the Finance Committee can take a bipartisan \napproach to tax reform. First, it puts in place an arbitrary deadline \nthat requires the Finance Committee to produce a bill by October 1 of \nthis year. Tax reform will be a long and difficult process. Hopefully \nit will not take 3 years to produce it, as it did in 1986, the last \nmajor tax reform we had, but discussions about tax reform should not be \ncut short to meet an arbitrary deadline. The Finance Committee needs to \nbe allowed to do its work.\n  Second, reconciliation is not a suitable way to produce tax reform \nthat simplifies the Tax Code. This is because it prohibits any changes \nto the Tax Code that score as adding anything to the deficit. This \nrequirement is incompatible with the goal of simplifying the Code, \nmaking it easier to administer. Chairman Baucus has voiced similar \nconcerns, which is why he has concerns about including a reconciliation \ninstruction in the budget.\n  While the budget does not call explicitly for tax reform to be a part \nof the reconciliation process, it has that effect by requiring the \nFinance Committee to come up with nearly $1 trillion in ``savings . . . \nby eliminating loopholes and cutting unfair and inefficient spending in \nthe Tax Code.''\n  If such large amounts of low-hanging fruit exist in the Tax Code, you \nwould have thought that either Chairman Baucus or I, during the period \nof time I was finance chairman, would have gone after some of these \nalong with the billions of dollars of loopholes that we have worked to \nclose already. The truth is that the majority's definition of a \nloophole is so broad as to be void of any real meaning, and their idea \nof spending in the Tax Code is popular deductions widely used by \nmiddle-class Americans such as tax deductions, mortgage interest, \ncharitable giving, State tax deductions, and in order to\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\nraise the revenue they want to, you have to go to those areas. When you \ndo that, you end up taxing middle-class America.\n  Also, referring to these tax increases as savings or as eliminating \nloopholes or spending in the Tax Code does not change the fact that to \nraise nearly $1 trillion, the middle class will see higher tax bills. \nThe budget of course does not only assume nearly a $1 trillion in tax \nincreases, additional reserve funds in the budget assume another $500 \nbillion in tax hikes to pay for more spending.\n  The underlying premise in this budget is that the Federal taxes are \ntoo low to support much-needed Federal spending. The budget resolution \nhas this completely backwards because until we get spending under \ncontrol, we will never be able to raise enough revenue that will \nsuffice to satisfy the spending appetite that some in Congress have.\n  Yesterday I had charts--I have a different one today--that lists the \nlast five times we had a balanced budget. The last five times were the \nyears 1969 and 1998 through the year 2001--5 years in the last 43 \nyears. As you can see, in each of these years, spending as a percent of \nGDP was significantly lower than 20 percent--significantly lower than \n20 percent. This line represents the spending level of these years, \nright here, the years when we balanced the budget. Over the next 10 \nyears as projected by the Congressional Budget Office, under current \nlaw spending will average 22.1 percent of gross national product as CBO \nestimates it under current law. Actually the budget resolution would be \nhigher than that 22 percent.\n  Lower on the chart I have another dotted line which represents \nprojected revenue, right here, about 18.9 percent. That is over the \nnext 10 years. As this chart shows, these revenues are more than enough \nto bring our budget into balance simply if we return to the spending \nlevels of the late 1990s and 2000.\n  The larger gap where spending was and where spending is projected to \nbe is where our problem is. In between here and here is where the \nproblem is. Congress has exhibited an appetite in the last few years to \ngo hog wild on spending compared to the average of the last 50 years of \nabout 20 percent.\n  We all know there is clutter in the Tax Code. There has been a \nproliferation of tax preferences that should be reexamined. However, \nthey should be reexamined in the context of enacting progrowth tax \nreform, not as a means to finance higher government spending. The goal \nof tax reform is to simplify the Tax Code and make it more efficient. \nThe ultimate goal is economic growth, but true tax reform should be \nrevenue neutral. It should not act as a way to increase taxes. Revenue \nraised by eliminating tax preferences should be used to lower marginal \ntax rates because that is where you get economic growth, you encourage \nentrepreneurship, and that is how you create jobs.\n  The assumption in the budget that business and corporate loopholes \nare available for revenue reduction is particularly puzzling. We \ncurrently have the highest tax rate among our major trading partners. \nThe President has even recognized the competitive disadvantage this \nputs us in. That is why he has called for reducing the corporate tax \nrate from 35 percent down to 28 percent. That is the President of the \nUnited States who wants to do that.\n  At a recent hearing before the Budget Committee on tax expenditures, \nthe Democrats' only witness, Professor Edward Kleinbard, similarly \nrecognized the need to use revenue from eliminating business tax \npreferences to lower rates. It was his view that the corporate rate \nshould be reduced to the mid-20s by eliminating corporate tax \nexpenditures.\n  I want to stress this was the opinion of the majority's witness. \nRaising revenues by closing so-called loopholes or reducing tax \nexpenditures is a tax increase. Unless it is used to offset true tax \nreform, it is a tax increase that will support more spending, and that \nis the purpose of it, according to the budget resolution.\n  Tax reform, then, should be revenue neutral and my amendment would \nensure that any reduction in tax preferences is used to lower tax \nrates. In other words, tax reform and not finance more spending.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 15 minutes off my time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Murray and the \nBudget Committee for producing a budget that says loudly and clearly \nthat our No. 1 priority is to fight for a stronger middle class, even \nas we dramatically reduce budgets and stabilize the debt by the end of \nthe decade. I also applaud Senator Murray and the committee for \nproducing a budget resolution that insists on a balanced approach to \ndeficit reduction: both spending cuts and revenue increases--both.\n  I also applaud my colleague Senator Levin for his leadership on using \nhis investigating subcommittee, his Permanent Committee on \nInvestigations, to bring to light over the last few years the number of \nloopholes and the egregious tax spending that we are doing through \nloopholes that allows corporations and others to get by without paying \ntheir fair share of taxes.\n  Senator Carl Levin has long fought to bring fairness to the Tax Code. \nHis investigations have shown that one of the major things we have to \ndo is to close up some of those egregious loopholes.\n  My colleague from Iowa was just talking. He pointed out the years we \nbalanced the budget. I note those are the years when we had a \nDemocratic President, President Clinton. We were working off the 1993 \ndeal that was made to both reduce spending and increase revenues. We \nhad growth in the economy. We had low unemployment. We balanced the \nbudget for 5 years in a row.\n  During that time our revenues averaged about 20 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. Now it is down to less than 18 percent. We also know \nthat demographics, including the tens of millions of baby boomers \nbecoming eligible for Social Security and Medicare, will place vast new \ndemands on our budget. At the same time, we need to make investments in \ninfrastructure, research, and education to prepare our young people and \nour economy for the competitive global economy that is coming. I remind \nmy colleagues that when President George W. Bush's tax cut was passed \nin 2001, it was defended on the grounds that it was only going to take \na small part of the projected surpluses that we were going to have for \nthe next 10 years. That was what was said.\n  As we now know, those surpluses didn't materialize. We had the tax \ncuts, we had two unpaid-for wars that completely wiped out the expected \nsurpluses, and yet we kept those big tax cuts going and that created \nbig deficits. Then the onslaught of the great recession in 2008 pushed \nour deficits even higher.\n  To date, only one-eighth of the revenues lost by the Bush tax cuts \nhave been restored. Yet many of the Republicans keep repeating their \nmantra that we only have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. \nThis is demonstrably not the case.\n  If we go back in time, when I was here, President Reagan pushed \nthrough some tax cuts. To his credit, he realized he went too far. He \nreversed course and supported two income tax increases. In looking back \njust 12 years ago, President George W. Bush's tax cuts also went too \nfar, again, contributing to the largest deficit in our history.\n  One would think we would want to reverse course, but Republicans have \ndogmatically refused to reverse course on increasing revenues. They are \nsticking to their ideological mantra. They say: Don't touch tax breaks \nfor the wealthy and the largest corporations. Instead, cut the programs \nthat undergird the middle class and meet the needs of the most \nvulnerable citizens. They demand that we slash funding for \ninfrastructure, innovation, and education and keep tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  There are abundant opportunities for cutting waste, cutting spending, \nbut it needs to happen on both sides. Yes, we need spending cuts. We \nneed to cut spending by closing tax provisions in the Tax Code that \nhurt our economy. That is where we need to cut some spending--tax \nspending that goes to the wealthiest and goes to large corporations.\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n  I will cite a few examples. Consider the so-called deferral provision \ngoverning taxation of profits earned by companies overseas. Follow \nthis: A U.S. company can deduct the cost of starting a business \noverseas, such as building a facility. They can deduct the cost of \nshipping equipment to that plant even if it comes from America. But the \nTax Code then allows these companies to delay paying taxes on these \nprofits until its profits are brought back home.\n  So on one hand, they get tax breaks for building a plant overseas, \nthey get other tax breaks for shipping the jobs overseas, they get tax \nbreaks for shipping equipment that could be used in America overseas--\nthose are immediate. They get the tax breaks right away, but when that \nplant earns a profit, they are not taxed until and unless they bring \nthose back home. That is totally unfair to U.S. manufacturers who may \nhave a factory in Iowa or New Mexico and pay their full taxes at a full \nand fair rate. The lost revenue is unfair to Americans who play by the \nrules, pay their full taxes, and, yes, Americans who rely on essential \ngovernment services.\n  Here is another one. U.S. companies can sell their patents to their \nown subsidiaries with an overseas postal address in a country with low \ntax rates. The parent company is paid to use the patent, generating \nprofits for the company, but the taxes on those profits are not paid as \nlong as the money is technically in the subsidiary's account even if \nthe money is deposited in a U.S. bank.\n  Consider another tax outrage, and we all know it by the name of \n``carried interest.'' What does that mean? It means that for those \nindividuals who are fortunate enough to make $10 million a year, they \npay income taxes at the rate of 39.6 percent. But if a hedge fund \nmanager makes $10 million managing a hedge fund and never invested a \npenny, they get taxed at 20 percent, not 39.6 percent. Twenty percent \nis the capital gains rate for most of our income. Well, why is that? \nWell, there is no rational reason. That was just put into the Tax Code \nI guess by some great tax lobbyist who was hired by the hedge fund \nindustry.\n  These gimmicks and tax breaks cost the Treasury untold billions of \ndollars. They serve no constructive economic purpose. In fact, they \ngive incentives to corporations to make decisions that harm the U.S. \neconomy and American workers. By ending these abuses, we can generate \nneeded revenue while creating a fairer Tax Code, one that does not \nreward corporations and the wealthy for behaviors that put the rest of \nus at an unfair disadvantage.\n  When I hear someone say, well, we are going to have tax reform, but \nit must be revenue neutral, what I hear is, let's keep all the tax \nloopholes for the wealthy and these large corporations. I say it is \ntime to end that. We need that revenue for education, reinvesting in \nthe infrastructure of our country, biomedical research, and science \nresearch. We need it to make sure that our young people today are able \nto compete in this global economy in the future.\n  Compromise, commonsense, and good-faith negotiations are what we need \ntoday. We do not need someone saying: No, we cannot raise revenues; all \nwe have to do is cut spending. On our side, under the leadership of \nSenator Murray, we have said we will cut spending, but we will also \nraise revenues. We will have a balanced approach.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this budget resolution and to say \nno to all of these amendments that would upset what I think is a very \ngood, solid budget resolution that has been put forward by Senator \nMurray and the committee. Let's put dogma aside. Let's act rationally \nand reasonably, and let's come together for a balanced and responsible \nsolution to our Nation's budget challenges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 297, \nwhich has been brought forward by my colleague, Senator Hatch from \nUtah. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment that establishes a \nreserve fund to repeal the onerous medical device tax. In fact, the \nmedical device tax is nearly a $30 billion new excise tax on medical \ndevices. It took effect on January 1 to pay for the President's new \nhealth care law, and it affects everything from orthodontics to the \nmost complex lifesaving medical devices--just to name a few: joint \nreplacements, knee braces, pacemakers, visual aids for sight-disabled \npeople. It affects things that help people who are ill, such as \nlifesaving devices and technologies that people need, and this tax \nburdens all of them, and it will increase health care costs.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his tremendous leadership on this issue. He \nhas been fighting so hard to repeal this onerous tax since it went into \neffect. I thank Senator Hatch for bringing this important amendment \nforward because the medical device industry in America is a \nmanufacturing success, and I have seen this in my home State of New \nHampshire, where we have nearly 50 medical device companies that employ \nalmost 3,500 Granite Staters. We are very proud of those companies, and \nwe want to keep them in New Hampshire and hopefully grow them. When I \ncampaigned for the Senate, I went to visit many of these companies. \nThey told me about this tax and the impact it will have on their \ncompanies.\n  The medical device technology and medical field in this country is a \ngreat success story. In 2008 the industry employed over 420,000 \nworkers, generated more than $24 billion in payroll, and paid 40 \npercent higher salaries than the national average in terms of a job. \nThese are great-paying jobs. They are high-quality, good-paying, \nsustainable jobs, and this tax is going to make sure we have fewer of \nthose good jobs that Americans want so much right now. With the \nNation's unemployment rate still unacceptably high, we should be doing \neverything we can to create a good climate for American companies so \nthey can strive and make sure we have more economic growth and make \nsure people have good-quality and high-paying jobs.\n\n  If this tax is left in place, the medical device tax will absolutely \nstifle hiring. For example, a 2011 study by the Hudson Institute found \nthat the device tax threatens nearly 43,000 jobs nationwide and will \ncost $3.5 billion in wages. I hear a lot of talk from my colleagues \nabout investing. This is something where this tax is basically going to \nkill good-paying American jobs. It defies common sense. Over 16 percent \nof respondents to a survey last year said they would reduce staff and \nemployees in order to lower costs before the implementation of this \ndevice tax.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, a study found that we could lose \npotentially hundreds of employees due to the cost of this medical \ndevice tax.\n  I had an opportunity to visit one of those companies, Corflex, which \nis located in Manchester. They manufacture orthopedic medical products. \nCorflex has seen steady growth over the years. It is a small thriving \nbusiness in Manchester, NH. When I met with the CEO at Corflex, he \nshowed me their balance sheets. He showed me the balance sheets before \nthe medical device tax went into effect and after the medical device \ntax went into effect. What he showed me is that they went from being a \nprofitable company to a company that would sustain a loss. This is a \ngreat company that was founded by a person in New Hampshire who was an \nentrepreneur and just had a dream. This tax would change a profitable \ncompany into a company that would experience a loss. He said: If this \ntax is not repealed, it will ultimately force companies, like us, to \ncut research and development dollars, pass costs on to consumers, or \neven consider reducing our workforce.\n  Last year I visited Smiths Medical Facility in Keene, which employs \n500 people in New Hampshire. They are doing great work at Smiths \nMedical. The vice president of global operations of technology told me \nthat repealing the medical device excise tax is about improving patient \ncare and investing in more innovation and jobs.\n  The medical device tax has sadly already cost the United States \nthousands of jobs. We need bipartisan action now to repeal this onerous \ntax that is killing jobs in this country. I know there are Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who support the Hatch amendment.\n  For smaller device companies, like many in New Hampshire, this tax \nhits them even harder. In fact, Teleflex--a Pennsylvania-based company \nthat has\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\na manufacturing plant in Jaffrey, NH--does what many larger medical \ndevice companies do: they rely on small companies to do their research \nand development. The vice president of Teleflex said:\n\n       I think the fear is that there is a lot of good that comes \n     out of small medical device companies, and with more costs \n     thrown upon them, it's going to be harder and harder for them \n     to sprout up and make a go of it . . . I think the view in \n     the industry is that this is going to stifle innovation.\n\n  Why is this going to stifle innovation? Because this is a tax that is \nnot a tax on profit, it is a tax on revenue. It is a 2.3-percent tax on \nrevenue. What does that do to startups? What does that do to \ninvestments? Basically what we are saying is, don't start your new \nmedical device company here with your new idea on how to save American \nlives because we are going to tax you whether you make a profit or not. \nThat is why this tax is very onerous on startups. It is essentially a \ntax on innovation.\n  The device tax also stands to increase health costs, and that is why \nI don't understand why it was used to fund the President's new health \ncare law--because we are going to see greater costs. In fact, the CMS \nActuary, Richard Foster, said he anticipates that the excise tax will \ngenerally be passed on to health consumers in the form of higher drug \nand device prices and higher insurance premiums. It will raise national \nhealth costs by a whopping $18.2 billion by the time we reach 2018.\n  Even though it only went into effect a couple of months ago, we are \nalready hearing about the job losses in this country because of the \nmedical device tax. We heard that Stryker Corporation laid off 5 \npercent of its global workforce. Covidien, which makes surgical \ninstruments, recently announced the layoff of 200 American workers. And \nguess where they plan to shift their production. They are shipping it \noffshore to Mexico and Costa Rica. And that is the other impact of this \ntax--encouraging new devices to go elsewhere, to plant their new \ninvestment in other countries instead of here in the United States of \nAmerica. That is another horrible impact of this medical device tax. \nZimmer said it planned to cut jobs and outsource. The CEO of Cook \nMedical, the world's largest privately owned medical device company, \nsaid it will have about $20 million less to develop and improve patient \ncare and access to technology. We heard so many of these stories about \nAmerican companies that are being hurt tremendously by this medical \ndevice tax.\n  So what is this about? This is about repealing this onerous tax. This \nis a tax that taxes innovation, increases health care costs, and also \nis a tax that kills good-paying American jobs.\n  Finally, we want the new medical devices to be developed here in this \ncountry. We don't want them to be developed in Europe because of an \nonerous tax. What we are going to see is that Americans are going to \nhave less access to the very new and best products because it is going \nto become too costly in this country for new companies to develop those \nproducts and for startups and, at the end of the day, it will be sad \nfor Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hatch amendment and, again, I \nthank him for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we have confusion on the time \nlimits. I had reserved 10 minutes; I have 17 on the motion. I think \nthere has been some confusion about it. What is the status of the time?\n  I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 8:10 is divided. Of that \nremaining time, the Senator from Alabama has 8 minutes. There is still \ntime remaining on the motion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Does that include-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. But it \ncannot be used before 8:10.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So that time could be used after 8:10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. After the votes occur.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. After the votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, my colleague Senator Hatch is here. The 8 \nminutes, as I understand, that exist--he wishes to speak. If he spoke, \nwould that count against my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Senator's time to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be delayed until \n8:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Members have been waiting for 2\\1/2\\ \nhours to get to a vote. I know we have had a lot of time to debate. We \nwill have additional time after the votes as well, as the Senator \nknows, tonight and tomorrow morning. I would respectfully ask if we \ncould stay on time because a lot of Members have been waiting for the \nvote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, reclaiming the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote start at 8:12, and I will be happy, and we will make it \nall happen. Senator Hatch can have 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assume that means the time will be divided equally, \nwhich means the Senator from Alabama would only have 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will do my best.\n  I yield to Senator Hatch for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words in support of \namendment 156 offered by Senator Grassley and myself.\n  This amendment would strike the tax reconciliation instructions from \nthe budget and, instead, create a deficit neutral reserve fund for pro-\ngrowth, revenue-neutral tax reform.\n  The American people have had it with our current tax code.\n  It is too complex.\n  It is overly burdensome.\n  And, it is an impediment to economic growth and our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Members from both parties need to work together to reform our tax \ncode to provide greater fairness and simplicity and to ensure that it \nencourages growth.\n  In order to do that, we need to work at finding ways to broaden the \ntax base in order to lower the marginal tax rates.\n  That is how we encourage economic growth.\n  That is how we create jobs.\n  For the first time in many years, there is bipartisan agreement in \nboth the House and Senate on the need to move forward on tax reform.\n  Unfortunately, rather than letting those efforts move forward, the \nbudget before us today would hijack those efforts.\n  Under this budget, the Finance Committee would be instructed to scour \nthe tax code in search of nearly $1 trillion in new revenues in order \nto pay for new spending.\n  It is bad enough that this budget would greatly increase our Nation's \ndebt. And, it is bad enough that it doesn't balance at any point.\n  But, to add massive tax increases on top of that is simply \nunconscionable.\n  As I said this afternoon, more than 70 percent of the revenue loss \ndue to tax expenditures comes from the top 10 tax expenditures, most of \nwhich predominantly benefit the middle class.\n  As Senator Grassley stated last night, the top 20 tax expenditures--\nwhich also greatly benefit the middle class--account for 90 percent of \nthe revenue loss.\n  So, as we can see, we simply cannot generate a significant amount of \nrevenue--certainly not in the magnitude imagined under this budget--\nwithout negatively impacting the middle class.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this attempt to once again raise \ntaxes on the American people.\n  Toward that end, I hope they will support our amendment.\n  I will recap quickly. The Grassley-Hatch amendment assures tax reform \nwill travel on a bipartisan path. It corrects the partisan process in \nthe budget with an elimination of reconciliation. That is all it does, \nand we ought to all support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my \ncolleague, the terrific chair of the Budget Committee, who has worked \nso hard in putting together the budget.\n  I wish to speak for a moment on the amendment I will be offering in a \nfew\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\nmoments that relates to Medicare and protecting Medicare for future \ngenerations by keeping it as an intact insurance plan. There are very \ndifferent visions, as we all know, and this will be an opportunity \ntonight to vote on which vision we support.\n  The House, under the Ryan Republican plan, has eliminated Medicare as \nwe know it and replaced it with a voucher program which only covers \npart of the costs, increasing costs for seniors of around $6,000 per \nperson. They would have to go back into the private insurance market \nand try to find insurance that would work for them.\n  We very clearly say that Medicare is a great American success story. \nWe have created a generation of seniors such as my mom and future \ngenerations who will be able to live longer, healthier lives, play with \ntheir grandchildren and great-grandchildren because of something they \nhave paid into all of their lives called Medicare.\n  When we look at the choices, even the people who invented this whole \nidea passed by the House have said that the proposals ``lack safeguards \nfor beneficiaries and threaten to shift costs to the elderly and \ndisabled and force them to shop for coverage in a confusing insurance \nmarket.''\n  That is what the folks who came up with the Republican idea are \nsaying. Even Chairman Ryan's own description of his plan admits: ``We \nare stopping the open-ended, defined benefit system.''\n  In other words, the Republican plan will end Medicare and end its \nguaranteed benefits--benefits that seniors have paid into throughout \ntheir lives, for the security of knowing they have a health insurance \nplan; they won't have to go out and try to figure out how to find \nprivate insurance and then have a voucher to pay for part of it.\n  To add insult to injury, what is most concerning is the money that is \ntaken away from seniors, the costs that are added, the savings in the \nRepublican budget, don't go to save Medicare, they go to give another \nround of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. One more time we are \nseeing seniors, as we have seen middle-class families, as we have seen \nthe vulnerable in our communities, find themselves sacrificing over and \nover again so the wealthiest among us, the well-connected, can get \nanother special tax deal.\n  My amendment makes it very clear. If Members vote for my amendment, \nthey are voting for Medicare. If Members vote against it, they are \nvoting for the Republican plan that dismantles Medicare as we know it \nand takes the money and turns it around and gives it to another tax cut \nfor the wealthy.\n  The other side of the aisle and those on the other side of the \nbuilding have called the Ryan Republican plan a balanced plan. It is \ncertainly not balanced for seniors. It is anything but balanced for the \nmiddle class. I hope when the opportunity comes we will see a very \nstrong vote in support of my amendment to guarantee Medicare going \nforward for our seniors.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is good to be considering a budget \nagain. It has been 4 years since one has been brought to the floor. It \nis important that we do so because the Nation has never, ever faced a \nmore systemic debt threat to our country.\n  Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson both told us before the Budget \nCommittee that this Nation has never faced a more predictable financial \ncrisis. What they meant was that if we don't change course, we are \ngoing to have a crisis.\n  I would say one of the things that would make our economy grow \nbetter, create jobs, confidence, and productivity gains would be for \nthis Nation to commit itself in a responsible way over a decade of \neffort to balance the budget. We can do that with increasing spending \nevery year by 3.4 percent. It does not even require a net reduction in \nspending each year. It will be hard. It will require us to change some \ncourse because we are on a path now to increase spending 5.4 percent a \nyear, and that is the difference in an unsustainable path and a \nsustainable path.\n  We have the budget of the majority before us, Senator Murray's \nbudget. It is not the kind of budget we should pass. It is the kind of \nbudget--it requires alteration, in my view, and it needs to be placed \non a path to balance. I think my Democratic colleagues implicitly agree \nwith that, because they have been talking about balance all week. We \nstarted keeping a tally on it.\n  Look at this chart. We made this chart not too long ago. We \ndetermined the word ``balance'' had been mentioned by the Democrats 120 \ntimes. We kept on counting and now it is up to 165 times. Maybe that \nindicates they believe a balanced budget is important. They say, \nhowever, that when they say balance they mean we balance deficit-\nreduction spending cuts with deficit-reduction tax increases, and that \ntotals $1.9 trillion in net deficit reduction. Nothing could be farther \nfrom the truth. I hate to say that. It is unbelievable to me that in \nthe Senate we have legislation on the floor that is being counted $1 \ntrillion--really $2 trillion off--and fundamentally, indisputably, that \nis correct.\n  At the Budget Committee hearing last week, I asked a staffer for the \nDemocratic majority:\n\n       Can you honestly say that under this budget you can achieve \n     $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction and eliminate the \n     sequester with only $975 billion in new taxes?\n\n  The answer: ``No.''\n  When I pressed him: Well, what does that mean? He said it would be \n$700 billion. And what he was talking about was $700 billion under \ncurrent law.\n  The way the confusion has occurred is our colleagues are switching \naround in the way they compare spending cuts.\n  This is the true situation: Under current law--that is the Budget \nControl Act and the tax increases we had in January--that is current \nlaw--we are projecting to continue deficits throughout the entire 10-\nyear period and increase interest charges by dramatic amounts, placing \nthis country in a very serious predicament.\n  So what do we say about it? Mr. Elmendorf, the Director of CBO, \ntestified a couple of weeks ago before the Budget Committee and I asked \nhim: Under the current law that we are operating under, including the \nfull cuts in the sequester, including the tax increases in January, \nwere we still on an unsustainable course? He said we were.\n  What I want my colleagues to know with every fiber in my being is: \nPlease know that if you take out the sequester, you increase spending. \nYou do not have $1.9 trillion in deficit reduction. You have only $700 \nbillion. And then if you add other gimmicks in the budget, including \nnot scoring the doc fix, misscoring war costs, and misscoring the \nstimulus spending, we end up with hardly any deficit reduction at all.\n  We raise taxes in this budget almost $1 trillion. We have no deficit \nreduction because we increase spending as much as we increase taxes. \nSo, apparently, my colleagues should know and think about this: A \n``balanced'' plan that has been mentioned 165 times means we raise \ntaxes $1 trillion and we increase spending $1 trillion, and there is no \nnet deficit reduction in the course of this 10-year budget.\n  So we are asking that this budget go back to the committee and give \nthem full authority to produce a balanced budget in any way they wish \nto. They can raise taxes, they can cut spending, but we are saying we \nhave to get off the unsustainable debt course. The choice is to have a \nbalanced budget because it will create confidence, it will create \nbusiness certainty, it will electrify the world, it will help people \nsee that we are on a sound path and not on a dangerous path that could \nlead to fiscal crisis.\n  It is so important for my colleagues to know one more thing, and that \nis experts have told us--Carmen Reinhart with the Reinhart-Rogoff study \nhas told us that when debt reaches 90 percent of the value of our GDP, \ngrowth begins to decline in the country. We are now at 104 percent, and \nthe debt factor is the gross debt of the United States is what they \nused in that study. This is confirmed by the International Monetary \nFund, the European Central Bank, and the Bank for International \nSettlements, all of which have done studies of developed nations with \nhigh debt, and they say it cuts growth. Reinhart and Rogoff says 1 to 2 \npercent. A 1-percent reduction in growth amounts to a million jobs. For \nthe last 3 years, our growth has substantially\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nfallen below what CBO projected. I believe the debt is already pulling \ndown our growth.\n\n  I ask my colleagues one more thing: All of us have traveled our \nStates. We have talked to our constituents. We have answered their \nquestions. They ask: Are you going to do anything about the budget? Are \nyou going to balance the budget? Why aren't you bringing up a budget? \nDon't you, colleagues, say we should have a balanced budget? Don't you \nsay we should be moving toward a balanced budget, at least?\n  Many of you--at least half of our Democratic colleagues--have said \nthey favor a balanced budget constitutional amendment so we have this \ncountry on a right path. You validated your promises back home. You \nshould support moving this bill back to conference and letting the \nchairman write a budget that balances. It would make this economy much \nbetter.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 433, 297, 432, 156, 431, 158, 202, 439, 222, and 438 En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 433\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want all of our Members to understand \nthat the second amendment we will be voting on tonight is the Ryan \nbudget.\n  Now, there seems to be some resistance among my Republican colleagues \nin bringing up the House Republican budget for a vote, and it is pretty \neasy to see why that is. Last year's Republican budget was, in fact, \nsoundly rejected by the American people in the election. Since then, it \ncontinues to be very clear the American people prefer a balanced and \nfair approach that puts our economy and our middle class first--not an \nextreme, irresponsible approach.\n  Unfortunately, House Republicans put forward a budget last week that \ndoubles down on the rejected ideology that the American people spoke \nabout. They have a new talking point about their same old budget. They \nnow claim their budget would eliminate the deficit in 2023. House \nBudget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has even said it does not really \nmatter how their budget eliminates the deficit.\n  Americans across our country who will feel the impact of the choices \nwe make in the coming weeks and months believe that it does matter. So \nwhile some of my Republican colleagues would probably prefer not to \nhear about it, I think that the impact of the House Republican budget \nis a crucial part of this debate, and we owe it to the American people \nto put our opinions on the record.\n  We have come a long way, but there are still far too many Americans \ntoday who are unemployed or underemployed, which is why our Senate \nbudget's first priority is boosting our economic recovery.\n  Speaker Boehner has actually agreed with President Obama that our \ndebt does not present ``an immediate crisis.'' So you might think the \nHouse budget would phase in cuts responsibly so we can protect our \nfragile recovery.\n  Instead, the House Republican budget would do serious damage to job \ncreation and job growth, and it doubles down on the harmful cuts from \nsequestration, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nestimates will lower employment by 750,000 jobs this year alone and \nslow economic growth.\n  The House Republican budget will weaken our economy in the long term \nas well. As any business owner will tell you, in tight times, the last \nthing you want to do is cut investments that help make you stronger. \nWell, that is what the House Republican budget does. It cuts \ninvestments in education, so our students and workers are less prepared \nfor the jobs of the future. It would undermine our ability to upgrade \nour roads and bridges and highways and ports even though our national \ninfrastructure just got a D-plus from the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. And the House budget would greatly reduce our ability to \nsupport research and development, making it so much harder for us to \nmaintain the innovative edge that helps us attract new industries and \nnew businesses to the United States.\n  Americans want to see a budget that puts the middle class first and \nasks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to do their fair \nshare too as we work toward deficit reduction.\n  So our Senate budget locks in tax cuts for the middle class while \nclosing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax Code. Our \nbudget uses that new revenue from the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations for deficit reduction and for investments that support our \neconomy and strengthen our middle class.\n  The House Republican budget, which we will vote on tonight, does the \nopposite. According to the Tax Policy Center, the tax plan in the House \nRepublican budget would cost nearly $5.7 trillion in lost Federal \nrevenue, and the majority of that lost revenue would benefit the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Just like past House Republican budgets, it is once again pretty \nunclear how this budget would pay for all those tax cuts that are \nskewed toward the wealthiest. But the reality is that to achieve the \ngoals that are laid out in their budget, House Republicans will either \nhave to add to the deficit--meaning their budget might not actually \nbalance, as they claim--or they are going to have to raise taxes on the \nmiddle class.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, to keep from \nincreasing the deficit while lowering rates--which they propose to do--\nthe House budget would have to raise taxes by an average of $3,000 on \nfamilies making less than $200,000 a year who have children. But in \ntheir plan, the wealthiest Americans will see a net tax cut averaging \nabout $245,000.\n  There is no reason middle-class families should have to pay for a tax \ncut for the wealthiest Americans. That is bad for our economy. It is \nvery unfair. That kind of unbalanced approach is what made Americans \nreject the House Republican budget in the first place.\n  The same is true of Medicare. We just heard Senator Stabenow talk \neloquently about the importance of Medicare. Well, the House Republican \nbudget would replace the Medicare guarantee with a voucher, capped at \ngrowth levels below projected health care costs, forcing our seniors to \npay more and more out of pocket, and ending Medicare as we know it.\n  That is not a solution that our seniors deserve.\n  AARP said, in their critique of the House Republican budget:\n\n       Removing the Medicare guarantee of affordable health \n     coverage seniors have contributed to through a lifetime of \n     hard work is not the answer.\n\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\n\n  That is not me, that is AARP.\n  The Senate budget offers a much better answer. Let me remind \neveryone, in our budget we uphold the principle--consistent with \nSimpson-Bowles and all other bipartisan deficit reduction proposals--\nthat the most vulnerable families should not be asked to bear the \nburden of deficit reduction.\n  Our budget maintains the safety net that has kept millions of \nfamilies and children above the poverty line during the recession and \nstrongly supports efforts to help our low-income students and others, \nas they try to get back in the job market.\n  House Republicans say their budget balances. Nothing in it sounds \nlike balance to me. I would like to remind my colleagues as this debate \ncontinues that unlike what House Republicans have said about how a \nbudget achieves its goals, how it achieves those goals really matters a \nlot.\n  The American people have rejected this plan, and, understandably, \nsome of my colleagues across the aisle would prefer not to vote on it. \nOur Senate budget offers a credible, serious approach to a fair and \nbipartisan agreement. It puts jobs and the economy first and provides a \ncredible, balanced path forward.\n  We are going to have to make some tough choices in the coming weeks \nand months, and I recognize moving away from the extreme approach in \nthe House Republican budget is going to be a tough choice for many of \nmy Republican colleagues. But I hope, as they consider the effects of \nthe House Republican budget on our economy and on our families \nthroughout the country, and the fact that the House Republican approach \nhas been thoroughly reviewed and rejected by the American people, they \nwill now be willing to come to the table, end the gridlock and \ndysfunction, and discuss a fair, comprehensive budget deal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while I have everyone's attention, today, \nthis evening, and tomorrow, we are going to have a lot of votes. \nEveryone should understand they are not going to have time to spend a \nlot of time with constituents, to make phone calls. When the time is \nup, we are turning it in--Democrats or Republicans. There are no \nexcuses. We have a lot to do and we are determined to get these votes \nin very quickly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 433\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this next amendment is the Ryan budget. \nThe House Republicans have doubled down on failed policies by passing \nthe same budget that was rejected by the American people just a few \nmonths ago. Now Senate Republicans are going to have to decide whether \nthey agree with this approach.\n  This budget would be devastating for the middle class and the \neconomy. It would cause millions of our workers to lose their jobs and \ndismantle programs such as Medicare that seniors and families depend \non. It relies on gimmicks and tricks to eliminate the deficit by an \narbitrary date and does all that while giving the wealthiest Americans \na tax cut.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the House Republican budget does something \nthe Democratic budget does not do--it balances. It actually balances in \n10 years, and it does it not by taxing more but by spending less, \nspending at a slower rate--3.4 percent over that 10-year period.\n  If we look at what the House Republican budget does, it is focused on \ngrowing the economy, not growing the government. What the Democratic \nbudget, before the Senate this evening, does is it grows the \ngovernment, not the economy.\n  In fact, if we look at the analysis that has been done, it is \nsuspected the Democratic budget would cost us 850,000 jobs and reduce \ntake-home pay for middle-class families by $1,500. The House Republican \nbudget takes seriously the challenges that are facing this country, \ntakes the steps necessary to save and protect Medicare for future \ngenerations of Americans, something this budget--the Senate Democratic \nbudget--does not do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this budget, and it is a serious one, \nthat balances the budget in 10 years and puts our economy back in \ngrowing mode and our fiscal house back in order.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

This is \nabout innovation and jobs. The medical device industry is one of our \nbiggest exporters. We have so many opportunities out there with a \ngrowing middle class in China and India to export even more, but we \ncannot have a tax that puts us at a competitive advantage. I think \npeople understand that. This is about manufacturing, high-skilled jobs, \nmillions of jobs in America.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote with Senator Hatch and me to repeal this \ntax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 432, offered by Ms. Stabenow.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield my 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, this is a very simple, straightforward \namendment. A ``yes'' vote supports Medicare as an ongoing insurance \nplan. A ``no'' vote sides with what the House of Representatives has \ndone with the Ryan Republican budget: dismantling Medicare, turning it \ninto a voucher program, adding $6,000 on average in costs to seniors \nand, adding insult to injury, their budget takes the money, doesn't \nstrengthen Medicare but provides another tax cut for the wealthiest \nAmericans, averaging about $245,000 for those at the very top. Please \nvote yes. Let seniors know in this country what they have paid into \ntheir entire lives will be there for them and the great American \nsuccess story of Medicare will remain strong for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to set the record straight. \nAmendment No. 432, which characterizes the House budget plan as a plan \nto turn Medicare into a voucher program, is patently false. This \namendment is not trying to voucherize Medicare. That is not true. I \nthink it is ironic that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nattack the House budget proposal when the Affordable Care Act took $716 \nbillion from the bankrupt Medicare Program to create an unsustainable \nnew entitlement.\n  In no way can the House budget be considered as turning Medicare into \na voucher program, and we reject the characterization of amendment No. \n432. The House budget proposal draws from bipartisan proposals put \nforth by the Breaux-Thomas Medicare Commission, President Bill Clinton, \nand Domenici-Rivlin.\n  We are prepared to take the amendment. We will be happy to take it by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the debate \non amendment No. 156 offered by Mr. Grassley.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this amendment strikes a $975 billion \ntax increase. This amendment in turn sets up a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund that will allow the Finance Committee to reform corporate and \nindividual taxes in a revenue-neutral way.\n  The President got his $612 billion tax increase January 1. We should \nnot raise taxes another $1 trillion with unemployment at 7.7 percent. \nWe should not close loopholes for more spending. We won't grow the \neconomy by raising taxes by $1 trillion as the majority wants to do. We \nwill grow the economy with more efficient progrowth tax reform.\n  My amendment is progrowth, pro-small business, and pro-jobs. The \nDemocrats' budget taxes the middle class to spend more. It is balanced \nand fair because they have finally come to the conclusion they cannot \nraise taxes just on the wealthy; they have to raise it on the middle \nclass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, again, the goal of our budget is to \ntackle our deficit and debt responsibly in a way that works for the \nmiddle class and the economy. That means a balanced mix of responsible \nspending cuts and new revenue from those who can afford it the most.\n  All of the bipartisan groups that have examined our budget situation \nhave acknowledged this reality--Simpson-Bowles, Gang of 6, Domenici-\nRivlin--and recommended more revenue than the roughly $600 billion that \nwe generated in the yearend deal. In fact, Simpson-Bowles and the Gang \nof 6 each recommended well over $2 trillion in new revenue, which is \nseveral times more than the yearend deal. Repealing this budget's \nproposed revenue increase and striking the reconciliation instruction \nwould be wholly irresponsible. We cannot cut our way out of this \nproblem.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  For the information of all Senators, this is the last vote this \nevening. Tomorrow there are votes beginning at 11. I ask again that all \nSenators be here. We are going to move through a lot of amendments \ntomorrow.

Unfortunately, the Democratic \nbudget that has been presented doesn't do that because it actually \nincreases spending and increases taxes.\n  But there is an alternative, and that is to restrain spending in ways \nthat are smart but also get this economy moving so we have more revenue \nand revenue the way we ought to get it, which is through growth. One \nobvious way to do that is through tax reform.\n  We just had a vote on a tax reform proposal. I am offering a couple \nof amendments that I want to talk about tonight. One is with regard to \ntax reform on the business side, where there is an amazing consensus \nnow between Democrats and Republicans, the White House and the Capitol \non how to get this economy moving again by ensuring that our Tax Code \nbecomes more competitive globally--not to cut taxes, not to raise \ntaxes, but in a revenue-neutral way to improve the way we collect taxes \nat the business level to be sure we can create more jobs at a time when \nwe are suffering through the worst recovery we have had since the Great \nDepression.\n  Second, I am going to offer an amendment that ensures that we have \nthe right information from the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, which are the two groups who give us \ninformation here on Capitol Hill, as to what tax reform means because \nwe want to be sure that as we reform our Tax Code, we do it in a way \nthat is progrowth and projobs.\n  Fundamental tax reform should be done across the board, in my view, \nnot just on the business side but also on the individual side. On the \nindividual side, we have a great opportunity to broaden the base of tax \nand lower the rates to make the code again more progrowth. Most \nbusinesses in America pay their taxes through the individual Tax Code \nbecause they are what are called passthrough entities, about 85 percent \nof businesses--they tend to be smaller businesses. That is very \nimportant.\n  But tonight I want to talk about the other part of that, which is the \nbusiness Tax Code that relates to primarily our larger companies and a \nlot of the international companies, so-called C corporations.\n  Back in 1986 we actually reduced the rate on the corporate side from \n46 percent down to 34 percent. That was 1986. It was done in a \nbipartisan way with Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, and the idea at that \ntime was to take our tax rate down to the point that it was \ncompetitive, meaning that it was below the average of our global \ncompetitors.\n  In the intervening 2\\1/2\\ decades, guess what has happened. Every \nsingle country of the developed world--the so-called OECD countries, \nour global trading competitors--every single one of them has reformed \nits tax code. They have lowered their rates, but they have also made \ntheir codes more competitive--every single country except us. So \nAmerica has been on the sidelines while these other countries have \nmoved quickly to improve their tax code. Why? Because they want \ninvestment, they want the jobs, and what has happened is, sure enough, \nthey are more competitive.\n  Capital is now flowing outside of this country. We are losing \nheadquarters. We are in a situation where if there is a foreign \nacquisition to be made, those companies in foreign countries have an \nadvantage because they have a more competitive tax code. Our tax rate,\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nwhich in 1986 was purposely put in place to be just below the average \nof all the developed economies in the world, is now No. 1. It is the \nhighest rate in the world. That is a No. 1 we don't want to have.\n  Japan just lowered their rate last year, putting America as the top \ncorporate tax rate in the world. This means, again, we are losing \npeople, we are losing capital, we are losing headquarters, we cannot \nkeep up.\n  So what is the solution? Well, let's go do what we did back in 1986 \nagain, let's do it quickly, and let's do it on a bipartisan basis \nbecause everybody seems to agree that our current code is not \ncompetitive, that the rate is too high. We have some disagreements on \nhow to correct it, but actually there is a growing consensus about that \nas well.\n  The White House has talked about this. In fact, in a February 2012 \nwhite paper issued by the Treasury Department, they said: Let's lower \nthe rate of corporate taxation by broadening the base, meaning reducing \nor getting rid of a lot of the preferences that have built up in the \nTax Code. By the way, hundreds of them have been built up in the Tax \nCode since 1986. So not only has our rate become high because other \ncountries have lowered theirs, we have added more and more \ncomplications to our Tax Code.\n  It is not just the White House that is talking about this. In front \nof our committee, the Budget Committee, a professor came to talk to \nus--who was the Democrats' witness; this was not the Republican \nwitness--who was gung ho also on doing corporate tax reform. This was \nthe Democrats' witness. This is what he said:\n\n       . . . corporate income tax's statutory rate of 35 percent \n     is today far outside world norms. The rate needs to come \n     down. . . . I therefore conceive of corporate tax reform as a \n     roughly revenue neutral undertaking, in which the corporate \n     tax base will be broadened through closing business tax \n     expenditures and loopholes, and the resulting revenues used \n     to pay down the corporate rate.\n\n  Pay down the corporate rate.\n  In the paper from the Treasury Department in February 2012, they said \nwe should reinvest the savings we get from getting rid of some of these \nloopholes and expenditures and use it, as they said, to invest in \nlowering the rate.\n  So here we have an opportunity as a Congress--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--to do something that is good for jobs. By the way, the \nCongressional Budget Office has looked at this in terms of who \nbenefits. It is not the corporate boardroom that benefits, it is the \nworkers. They have said 70 percent of the benefit of lowering the \ncorporate rate is going to go to workers in the form of higher \nsalaries, better benefits, and more jobs.\n  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has also said if you \nwould like to get this economy moving, probably the best bang for your \nbuck is going to be to do something on the corporate tax code because \nit has gotten so complex and the rate has gotten so high. If you do \nthis, you are also doing something we ought to be doing generally in \nour Tax Code; which is you are not picking winners and losers. Instead \nof the government stepping in and deciding where resources are \nallocated, you have the private sector doing that, market forces doing \nthat, which is going to help grow the economy.\n  So just as President Reagan and Democrats did in 1986, we should cap \nor eliminate inefficient tax preferences and loopholes, and we should \nuse that revenue to reduce both the corporate rate and the individual \nrate, without adding to the deficit.\n  Another amendment of mine takes this same idea, which is tax reform \non the individual-corporate side, and allows us, as legislators, to \nunderstand better what we are doing.\n  Right now, when the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation give us an analysis of taxes, they tell us the \nrevenue is likely to be based on what they call a static score--a \nstatic score. It does not take into account the big macroeconomic \nchanges you are likely to see from people's changed behavior from lower \nrates, for instance.\n  I will give you an example. Back in 2003, the capital gains tax, as \nyou know, was reduced. So what did they say? Well, the Joint Committee \non Taxation and CBO did their analysis, and they said: Well, that \nmeans, because you lowered the rate of taxation, you are going to get \nless revenue, right, because you have less taxes coming in. No. Because \nthey lowered the capital gains tax, there was more economic activity. \nIt turns out we actually got more revenue in. So in 2007 they said \nrevenue was going to go down. In fact, revenues shot up. The same thing \nhappened, by the way, back in 1997, the last time this Congress had a \nunified balanced budget. That was when Bill Clinton was President, and \nhe worked with the Republican Congress to get some of the spending \nunder control, as we talked about earlier. But they also cut the \ncapital gains rate, and, lo and behold, as I recall, about $100 billion \nshowed up on the revenue side that folks did not expect because we \nlowered the capital gains rate. Because of the behavioral change, the \ndynamic scoring, the macroeconomic scoring, showed that was going to \nhappen, but the static score did not.\n  So as we begin to formulate what kind of tax reform we should do on \nthe individual side and on the corporate side, wouldn't it be great if \nwe had access to two kinds of analysis: one, the static score--and that \nwill continue to be the official analysis; nothing changes there--but \nalso why shouldn't we have access to the macroeconomic analysis--not \ndone from the outside, not from groups from the outside that might have \na pretty aggressive dynamic score, but let's just use the macroeconomic \nmodel that the Joint Tax Committee already does. In fact, they are \nrequired to look at it in three different ways. CBO already does. It \ndoes not add more work in the sense that this analysis is already being \ndone; it is just that we are getting the benefit of it.\n  So this second amendment that I hope my Democratic colleagues will \nalso support, as I hope they will the first one, says, quite simply: \nLet's have more information so we can make smarter decisions. Who could \nbe against that?\n  Some have said: Well, we do not believe in dynamic scoring. Fine. If \nyou do not believe in dynamic scoring, let's see what happens. We are \ngoing to have a static score, which will be the official score still--\nthat is what we will have to use around here--and then we will have \nthat dynamic score. Again, we want that so we can formulate a better \ntax proposal but also to know what the impact is going to be. We will \nsee what happens.\n  My belief is that the macroeconomic score is more likely to be \naccurate, as it has been in the past, and over time I would not be \nsurprised if this Congress decides: My gosh, that is more consistent \nwith the behavior changes you are going to see with good tax reform. \nLet's make that part of the official analysis. But that is not what we \nare talking about tonight. The official score would still be the static \nscore.\n\n  I believe this will enable us to be better legislators, and certainly \nit will enable us to have an opportunity, as we look at this budget \ndeficit and these historic debts and the impact it is having on our \nkids, on our grandkids and on today's economy, to come together as \nRepublicans and Democrats and do the two things that everybody knows \nhave to be done: One, restrain spending, specifically to deal with \nthese important but unsustainable entitlement programs--remember this: \nThe Congressional Budget Office has told us in the report just about 2 \nweeks ago that the growth of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, \nincredibly important programs--and that is why we need to save them--\nthat growth will go up by 94 percent over the next 10 years. It nearly \ndoubles. In fact, they have told us that as a percent of the economy, \nwhich is how they look at the spending--as a percent of the economy, \nthe only growth in our spending over the next 10 years is going to be \nfrom these entitlement programs and interest on the debt. Other parts \nof our budget actually, as a percent of the economy, are going to be \nflat or even a little bit below as a percent of the GDP. But what is \ngoing to grow dramatically are these programs.\n  So we know we have to have entitlement reform to save these programs \nso that the trust funds do not go insolvent, which they otherwise will. \nBut we also know as part of that we should do tax reform. Those two \ntogether--entitlement reform, smart reforms to make these programs work \nbetter to ensure they are there for the future,\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\nand then tax reform that is progrowth, that is going to generate \nrevenue, to help us because it will change people's behavior, which \nwill change economic growth, which will, in turn, provide more \nrevenue--revenue, really, the right way--will help us get the debt and \ndeficit under control and at the same time give people the opportunity \nto get back to work, deal with the weakest economic recovery since the \nGreat Depression, help us to get out of the doldrums we are in right \nnow in this economy.\n  The shot in the arm that tax reform can give us--particularly if we \nhave the right information from these organizations on the Hill: the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation--will \nenable us to move this country forward in ways that can be bipartisan, \nin ways that can be consistent with what the administration and the \nCongress are talking about: restraining spending, growing the economy.\n  I thank the Chair for letting me talk about this tonight. I look \nforward to having these amendments offered tomorrow. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will be willing to stand together \nand to say: Yes, we can do this. We can get this economy moving. We are \ngoing to have to change the way we deal with our tax system. We are \ngoing to have to retrain the spending. If we do that, our future can be \nbrighter.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I just want to thank the Senator from Ohio \nfor his usual very clear way of explaining things. I know that comes \nfrom the tremendous background he has had, not just in the House but \nactually putting together a White House budget before. I guess the \nSenator has had access to these different sources of information before \nand knows how they could work if we could get access to them.\n  It is hard for me to believe that somebody would not want more \ninformation. They can analyze themselves whether they think it is \nuseful. But more information is always better. So I thank the Senator \nfor bringing that amendment here, and his other amendment as well. But \nas to that one, it is just incredible to me that anybody could oppose \nit.\n  So I thank the Senator for the thought he put into it and for the \ngreat presentation he did.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I have filed an amendment, No. 233, that \nI would like to visit with my colleagues about this evening.\n  I am pleased we are debating a budget. Budgets have great purposes in \nindividual and business lives, and they are certainly important to us \nas we try to solve the country's fiscal problems.\n\n  A budget is a document that determines how much money we have to \nspend and how we are going to spend it. In determining how we are going \nto spend money, we establish priorities.\n  I want to talk about one of my priorities for the investment of our \ntaxpayer dollars. Kansans and citizens from across the country pay \ntheir taxes. In many ways, they would be pleased by having to pay taxes \nif they knew the money was being well spent. One of the areas where I \nstrongly believe we can prioritize and that money can be well spent is \nin support of the National Institutes of Health.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to lead in the world's \nresearch to solve individuals' problems with their health, with the \ntreatment of disease, in eradicating disease, and treating the people \nof our country and really the people of our world.\n  This amendment I am going to discuss adds $1.4 billion in spending \nfor the National Institutes of Health. Our citizens and our country \nface a significant challenge. There is not a family in our Nation who \nhas not suffered from the consequences of cancer and other horrendous \ndiseases. We have seen tremendous success. America leads the world in \nfinding cures and treatments for those diseases.\n  A problem is, the funding for NIH has remained at a virtual \nstandstill since 2010. In my view, those who come to Congress with the \ndesire to make sure every dime, every nickel is wisely spent, and those \nwho come to Congress with the belief that we need to care for people \nand provide compassion to all, can come together and jointly agree that \nmoney spent on the National Institutes of Health is both. It is a sense \nof providing well-being, comfort, care, and treatment for people who \ndesperately need that, and it is the realization that when we invest in \nresearch, in projects that ultimately cure a disease, we are saving \nmoney. We save money by curing and treating diseases, which then means \nthat the cost of health care is reduced.\n  Long before Congress passed a so-called health care reform bill, I \noutlined to my constituents in Kansas what we could do to save health \ncare costs. One of the points in my plan was to invest in medical \nresearch because money invested today in research saves lives and \nreduces costs.\n  There is also the reality that the United States of America is the \nplace to do research. But we are facing tremendous challenges because \nof the flat line of NIH spending and the lack of real dollars available \nfor medical research. In fact, we have to worry that there is a brain \ndrain, once again, going on in the United States. Other countries are \ninvesting. Other countries with more difficult economic challenges than \nours are increasing their funding for medical research.\n  I have always worried that if we do not compete, if we do not \nmaintain a steady opportunity for research scientists in the United \nStates, we will lose the edge and the economic and health benefits that \ncome from having that edge in a global economy.\n  Our own Director of the NIH, Francis Collins--highly regarded and \nwith tremendous background, intellect--has indicated that we are seeing \nthe potential for a brain drain. This is what he said in February of \nthis year, just last month:\n\n       Since 2003 the NIH budget has basically lost about 20% of \n     its purchasing power by effectively flat budgets that have \n     been eroded by inflation.\n       The consequence of that to grantees who send us their best \n     ideas in hopes of being supported is that their chance of \n     being funded has dropped from about 1 in 3 which is where it \n     has been for most of the last 50 years now down to about 1 in \n     6 . . .\n       Imagine yourself as a young investigator [a scientist] with \n     a great idea, ready to tackle it and to do so in your \n     university setting somewhere [in the United States] knowing \n     that you have only a 1 in or less chance of getting funded, \n     seeing that there seems to be no real clear path forward for \n     achieving stability in the support of biomedical research, \n     wondering whether you can legitimately speak to young people \n     who are wanting to follow in your path about whether this is \n     a path they should choose.\n\n  Dr. Collins says this deeply worries her. At a time we need to \nencourage our children to pursue degrees in education, science, \nresearch and medicine and the absence of continued increase in funding \nfor health research, for biomedical research, we clearly send a message \nthis may not be the career you wish to pursue. At the same time as \nother countries increase their support for biomedical research, we send \na message, even though you decide you want to pursue this career, maybe \nyou should pursue it someplace else. This is a serious problem which \ndesperately needs our attention.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues to support an amendment which \nestablishes a clear understanding of the value of biomedical research, \nboth again that opportunity to increase the longevity of our lives, to \nimprove the quality of our lives, to combat those diseases which are so \ndevastating to so many families in our country, knowing when we do \nthat, not only are we improving individual lives, the well-being of \nfamilies across our Nation, but we are also investing in an opportunity \nto reduce the long-term costs of health care in the United States.\n  This issue is one of great importance to me, and I can't imagine \nthere is a Senator in our Chamber who hasn't experienced the challenges \nof disease and death in their own families. We have seen tremendous \nstrides in turning this around. It is so clear to me we need to make \ncertain those strides continue.\n  I was pleased to have the Senator from Illinois seek me out on the \nSenate floor this evening to suggest there is an opportunity for us to \nwork together. While I have an amendment filed, Senator Durbin and I \nare having a conversation tonight, tomorrow, to see if there is a way \nwe can come together in a joint amendment to fully establish all of us \nare in favor of funding the\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\nNIH, the National Institutes of Health, at a magnitude and a level \nwhich will again restore us to the forefront of medical research around \nthe globe.\n  We will send a message to our students and future scientists America \nis the place medical research should occur and where they should pursue \ntheir careers. Disease can be conquered and lives can be restored. Most \nimportant, there may be hope in the United States. The serious and \ndebilitating diseases, the causes of death so many families face day \nafter day and year after year, can be cured and treated.\n  I look forward to those conversations with my colleagues to find the \nright words to bring us together to demonstrate significant and real \nsupport for funding the National Institutes of Health.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on what almost \nqualifies as a historic event:\n  For the first time in 4 years, the Senate will try to complete a \nbudget resolution.\n  Since 2009--the last year the Senate passed a budget--the government \nhas run deficits in excess of $1 trillion every year. The Democrats' \nbudget resolution that we are currently debating will, in fact, only \nreduce net deficits by $279 billion.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor and around the country for the past \n2 years in favor of a budget that will end excessive spending, provide \na platform for tax reform, and rid ourselves of oppressive debt and \ndeficits. But I am afraid that even after the Senate has completed its \nwork, I will still be advocating for those changes.\n  Senate Democrats have not used their proposed budget resolution to \nmake government better. Their proposal does little in the way of \nreform, and actually grows the government instead of the economy. It is \ndiscouraging to anyone concerned about excessive government debt, and \nit is discouraging to the job seekers who are, unfortunately, so \nabundant right now.\n  What the Democrats have proposed is not a budget at all. It is merely \na spending plan to further stunt economic growth and job creation, \nwhile condoning increasing the deficit and growing the government. I \nbelieve the American people expect a budget that provides a platform \nfor our economy to grow. A budget that increases government spending, \nincreases debt, and further endangers our Medicare and Social Security \nis not what Georgians or people across America want.\n  We have a real opportunity now to correct a lot of missteps. We need \na budget that will reform our Tax Code, grow the economy, reduce \npoverty, and fix our entitlements.\n  Yet here, in the middle of a global economic crisis, we are going to \nvote on a budget that does none of that.\n  Mr. President, tonight the Senate voted on a budget that will balance \nin 10 years the--budget proposed by House budget chairman Paul Ryan. I \ncan't think of better way to show the American people and the world \nthat our government is serious about getting back on track and \nreclaiming our country's financial dominance. Simply put, Mr. \nPresident, even with all the provisions combined, the Murray budget \ndoesn't get us out of debt. The Ryan Budget does.\n  A budget that balances in 10 years should be the starting point for \ndiscussions, and we need to make that budget a reality now to secure \nAmerica's future. Economists, budget experts, and analysts across the \ncountry have come to the conclusion that the debt we have already \naccumulated is having a negative effect on our economy. We have known \nfor a long time--and have been told many times by economists--that when \na country's gross debts reach 90 percent of GDP, its economy will \ncontract substantially.\n  We have seen in places such as Japan and Europe that when debt gets \nout of control, the government's response to control debts must be \ntougher. Unfortunately, as my friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions, \nnoted yesterday, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for \nInternational Settlements, and the European Central Bank have all \nanalyzed our debt and found that we are now at 103 percent of GDP. That \nis a staggering and shocking number. It is a hopeless number.\n  We haven't balanced our budgets in so long that we have ended up \nharming America's economic engine--and the Democrats' proposal doesn't \nfix anything. It merely continues our unsustainable spending.\n  We voted on a spending measure yesterday that lowered our \ndiscretionary spending down to 2008 levels. With some hard work, we can \nkeep our discretionary spending at sustainable levels. However, what we \nhaven't addressed is the continued rise in mandatory spending which has \nincreased substantially since 2008.\n  We simply cannot continue to let mandatory spending go unchecked. \nThis budget's approach to restraint is half-hearted, at best. President \nObama likes to remind us that he is in favor of entitlement reform. I \nwould like to give him the benefit of the doubt about that--but is this \nthe best his party can come up with? We are a nation that believes in \ncaring for the most vulnerable among us, but if we continue to operate \nour programs this way, on a path toward bankruptcy, we will never be \nable to keep our promises.\n  We can no longer allow the American people to suffer by not providing \nthe economic basis for recovery and growth. The equation is simple: A \nbalanced Federal budget that is free of excessive debt leads to a \nhealthy economy and sustainable job creation.\n\n\n                        Community Health Centers\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would like to thank Chairwoman Murray for including \nthe request I made in the budget resolution to provide $2.2 billion in \ndiscretionary funding and $2.2 billion in mandatory funding for \ncommunity health centers in fiscal year 2014.\n  I believe that community health centers are the answer we are looking \nfor to make health care work for everyone, and I am very grateful for \nthe language included in this Budget that recognizes the value of \nhealth centers.\n  As the Senator knows, since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, \nbudget cuts have significantly reduced discretionary funding for the \nCommunity Health Center Program. Current service levels for the \nCommunity Health Center Program have been maintained only by \nredirection of the ACA's mandatory expansion funding--which is not \nauthorized beyond the year 2015.\n  In other words, beginning in fiscal year 2016, the community health \ncenter fund will expire. Unless we find a solution to this problem, \ncommunity health center funding will be reduced by 69 percent. If \nadequate funding is not restored, the result will be dramatic \nreductions in the number of patients community health centers are able \nto serve. I believe that would be a serious mistake.\n  Would the Senator be willing to work with me and other Senators on \nresolving the funding cliff facing health centers in 2016 so we don't \nhave a massive cut facing such a valuable program?\n  Mrs. Murray. I thank the Senator and I couldn't agree with him more \non the value of the Community Health Center Program. I know very well \nabout the value they bring to Washington State, and also to the country \nby controlling health care costs and delivering care to our Nation's \nmost vulnerable people and communities. We have included language that \nrecognizes the importance of adequately funding the Community Health \nCenter Program and I look forward to working with the Senator and other \nSenators to try and find a solution to the community health center \nfunding cliff before it occurs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Chairwoman. The sooner we can work on this \nthe better, as it will really give the program and all the centers \nacross the country the stability and certainty they need to plan for \nthe future.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for raising this very important \nissue. I look forward to working with him to ensure that community \nhealth centers can continue to provide care to our most vulnerable \npopulations today and in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There are a lot of problems with the country and the \nway we manage business. Frankly, President Bush became engaged in a war \nwhich used up so much of his time and effort. President Obama is not \ntrained as a manager. He has never been a manager, Governor or managed \na business. He has too little tough, serious management of the \ntaxpayer's money in this country. It is time for us to get\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nunder control the spending which goes on.\n  In my humble opinion, the American people are tired of sending more \nmoney to Washington just because we run out. We say it is not our \nfault; it is the way things are. We can't have any reduction in \nspending. There are people who are hurt and in pain, hungry, women, \nelderly, singles, and married. They need to have more money. Any change \nin our policy whatsoever means somebody is not getting something they \nare entitled to.\n  The truth is many of our programs serve many good people in need, but \nalmost all those programs have serious management problems which could \nbe run effectively and efficiently, and the program would cost \nsubstantially less without any significant diminishment of the \neffective aid which is rendered by that program. I believe the American \npeople understand this absolutely and fully.\n  As we have done, as an amendment or idea comes forward to confront \nwasteful spending, somebody in this body, particularly in the Senate, \nalways objects. They raise the specter of meanness and unkindness and \nthat sort of thing. In truth, we all ought to identify serious problems \nand fix them.\n  For example, in our energy policy, we have had some of the most \namazing failures and losses of Federal money I can imagine, beyond \nanything which is logical and absolutely should not have happened.\n  Most people have heard of the Solyndra company. They had political \nconnections to the White House and received $528 million in Federal \nloans, went bankrupt and left Uncle Sam holding the bag.\n  There was another company, Abound Solar. It declared bankruptcy after \nreceiving $400 million in Federal loan guarantees. Failing to deliver \non the promises they made, somebody at the Department of Energy, \napparently, was not checking very well. Maybe they were more interested \nin a press release, a big announcement, going to some solar factory and \nsaying how we are going to create jobs, grow the economy and pump \nhundreds of millions of dollars into a program which sank.\n  Beacon Power received $43 million in Federal loan guarantees before \nit shut down.\n  Fisker, an electric car maker, is not making any cars now due to \nproduction problems. It received more than $190 million from the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  A123 Systems, a battery maker, also received substantial Federal \nloans. It is bankrupt.\n  The President emulates the failing energy programs of Europe. His \npolicies were designed to promote an energy theory which is not ready \neconomically. It is one thing to invest in research to try to create a \nnew battery; it is another thing to try to loan hundreds of millions of \ndollars to a company to produce a product which is not competitive and \nnot ready for prime time. This is the mistake we made.\n  Mr. Lomborg, from Europe, who wrote the book ``Cool It'' and is, in \nmy opinion, an expert on these issues, pointed out a number of years \nago in his book the best way to handle this is for the government to \nsubsidize where it can and direct money to try to reach technological \nbreakthroughs, but you should not mandate the people of the United \nStates, or use any kind of program which will not work, cost a lot more \nmoney, and have little benefit on the environment.\n  Back in 2008, President Obama made this statement: ``Will America \nwatch as the clean energy jobs and industry of the future flourish in \ncountries like Spain, Japan, or Germany?''\n  That is what he said. We need to emulate Spain, Japan, and Germany.\n  Spain right now is having to cut back dramatically on its forward-\nleaning green mandates. They went probably further or as far as any \ncountry in Europe. It has been a total disappointment. They are \nreducing their subsidies. Their economy is in shambles, and they are \nnot doing well.\n  The Financial Times in February of this year wrote:\n\n       The Spanish government's latest bid to cut its growing \n     debts to the country's energy sector is expected to slash \n     profits at renewable energy companies as Madrid continues to \n     grapple with a $37 billion deficit built up through years of \n     subsidies.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       Shares in Acciona, Spain's largest wind power operator, \n     have tumbled almost 20 percent, with Analysts expecting \n     Acciona's earnings per share to drop by 40 percent, while \n     Abengoa's EPS are forecast to drop by 12 percent.\n\n  Germany is also cutting back. According to Reuters in January of this \nyear:\n\n       [The German energy company] RWE is delaying investments. \n     SIAG filed for insolvency. REpower Systems is cutting \n     temporary staff. All show how German Chancellor Angela \n     Merkel's $734 billion plan to replace nuclear reactors with \n     renewable sources is stalling.\n\n  Former Secretary of Treasury, under President Obama, Larry Summers \nsaid this: ``Government is a crappy venture capitalist.''\n  This is exactly correct. We have no business trying to pick and throw \nAmerican taxpayers' money into risky ventures. We are not good at it. \nSpain and Germany are not good at it--governments aren't.\n  When it is your money and you are putting up $100 million, then you \nare at a point where you need to be very serious about that investment.\n  These are some points I wanted to make because I think the American \npeople are tired of hearing Washington say send more money.\n  No, we are not going to cut spending in Washington. We can't do that \nin the budget which is on the floor. It does not cut spending, actually \ndoes not reduce the deficit. It increases spending, increases the \ndeficit, and increases taxes by $1 trillion.\n  What did they say in the budget? We are not going to cut spending. \nThere is nothing we can cut. The government is working. Every dollar we \nreceive, every dollar we distribute is absolutely critical and cannot \nbe contained. Send more money. Just send more money and don't complain, \nAmerican people.\n  I think people are getting tired of that. They have a right to be \ntired of that. They should not send another dime until we are on the \nright path.\n  I see my friend Senator Enzi, and I would be pleased to yield the \nfloor.\n  I would note Senator Enzi is the senior member of the Budget \nCommittee and is a successful businessman who has a proven record in \nhis State. He understands these issues, and he is trained as an \naccountant. I am sure when he sees what we do in the budget process \naround here, he must wonder what world we are connected to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I wish to thank the Senator from Alabama for all the work \nhe has done on the budget. He worked on a budget for 2 years previous \nto this which never materialized. I am so pleased he and his staff are \nworking on a budget.\n  I understand his disappointment. I am an accountant, and I hope \nSenator Johnson, who is the other accountant in the Senate, will have \nan opportunity to come to the floor and talk about some of the numbers \nbecause there seems to be some discrepancies in the numbers. He has \ntried to pin those down by asking questions of the staff and, as a \nresult, has come up with some demonstrations that show where the budget \nwe are currently talking about goes.\n\n  I wanted to just briefly share an article I ran across today. It is \ncalled ``Mr. Penny vs. a dragon: Hey kids, it's the national debt!''\n  How are kids across America going to understand the debt? We are \nhaving a lot of problems understanding it in this body. Washington's \nbudget squabbles and financial fights are enough to tangle up anyone's \nhead, so one can only imagine how it might confuse children. So enter \nMr. Penny and the Dragon of Domeville. Let's see, that would be the \ndome? Yes.\n  This children's book by Lucile McConnell seeks to raise awareness of \nfiscal irresponsibility and the national debt for those who are just \nout of diapers. The book's hero, Mr. Penny, is introduced as ``quite an \nindividual and not a follower,'' and begins:\n\n       Once upon a penny, in the Land of Us''--\n\n  That would be U.S.--\n\n       in the little town of Meville, lived a little penny. In \n     fact, a whole lot of little pennies were scattered all over \n     the Land of Us, but our story is about one particular penny: \n     Mr. Penny. He was a singular fellow, quite an individual and \n     not a follower of the crowd.\n\n  The antagonist, a dragon--a black dragon--if this had been a western \nstory, it would be the guy with the\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nblack hat--a dragon designed to represent a bloated Federal Government \nthat will not stop growing and loves to eat currency.\n\n       In fact, he developed a taste for charred bills . . . \n     dollar bills. Within no time, the dragon had devoured $15 \n     trillion--\n\n  You can tell the book is a little old, otherwise it would be $16.6 \ntrillion, which is where we are now--\n\n     and was always looking around for more to consume.\n\n  Eventually, Mr. Penny scores a one-on-one with the dragon and does \nhis level best to convince the dragon just how reckless Federal waste \ncan be.\n\n       I don't think you know what effect you are having on the \n     whole land of Us by eating the money that we send to \n     Domeville. . . . Our schools are closing; our youngsters \n     can't go to college; our oldsters can't get medical help; our \n     businesses are failing because there is no money for loans; \n     our roads and bridges are falling down; our towns and \n     industries are not safe; our citizens do not have jobs; and \n     we are running out of money.\n\n  On the book's Web site, McConnell describes herself as ``a tax/\ncommercial transactions attorney'' practicing in Washington and New \nYork and says--and this is very important--all funds from the book--all \nfunds from the book--will go toward paying down the national debt.\n  In an author's note in the book, McConnell writes:\n\n       Our beloved Country is in trouble . . . big trouble. This \n     is the kind of trouble that cannot be solved unless we all \n     pitch in and come to the aid of our country immediately.\n\n  She adds:\n\n       My hope is that after reading this book, young people are \n     energized about the possibility of what we can accomplish \n     together through cooperation and teamwork.\n\n  So, Madam President, I had an amendment in the committee that would \nhave taken care of some of those charred bills and converted them to \nmetal coins--dollar coins. If we were to do that, it would probably \nsave about $1 billion. That maybe doesn't sound like much around here, \nbut $1 billion would be a good start and would put a little punctuation \nin this book.\n  We are getting to the point where if we don't do something, we will \nnot have money to spend. If interest rates go up--and if people lose \nconfidence in our economy, the interest rates will go up--the only \nthing we will be able to pay is interest. Doesn't that sound like \nsomebody who has used their credit card too much and can't afford to \npay the credit card down? Of course, we are not even worried about \npaying the credit card down. We are not even talking about doing that. \nWe are not even talking about balancing the budget at this point, and \nwe need to do that or maybe we need to pass out copies of ``Mr. Penny \nand the Dragon of Domeville.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we talked about a number of challenges \nour Nation faces and the debt course we are on. The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Mr. Elmendorf, testified just a few weeks \nago before our Budget Committee and declared that we remain on an \nunsustainable financial course even after the Budget Control Act that \nreduced spending and even after the tax increase in January, and that \nthis does not get us out of the danger zone.\n  We have hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits every year, and \nhe is projecting that interest on our debt in the 10th year will rise \nto $800 billion, which is about what the score of the Murray budget \nthat is on the floor today would add to our debt.\n\n       Fundamentally, this budget that is before us today did not \n     change the debt course we are on. It does not have $2 \n     trillion in spending reductions, and it leaves us on the same \n     dangerous course as Mr. Elmendorf said we are on, so we have \n     to get off of it.\n\n  I want to share a few things that drive home the danger we are in. \nNow, we have a strong economy. We have a great entrepreneurial spirit. \nWe have a tremendous infrastructure compared to most places. We have a \nrule of law that helps us tremendously in terms of managerial \nefficiency and contracts and complex documents that can be entered \ninto. If there is a dispute over it, you can go to a Federal or State \ncourt and have a pretty good chance of a fair decision being reached \neven in the most complex matters involving high finance. That is not \ntrue in most places in the world, so it gives us an advantage.\n  We have an educated workforce. We have a lot of people who are \nwilling to work and hustle. So we have some advantages. We have a \nhistory of trade and freedom. But I want to show this chart, because we \nmay not be doing as well as we think we are, and the debt that we are \nfacing may be more serious than a lot of people will acknowledge.\n  This is a chart that shows the debt per person in the Eurozone \ncompared to the United States. It is a stunning chart. Some people have \nexplained it somewhat by saying, well, our economy in the United States \nis bigger than other economies in the world. Therefore, individual \nAmericans normally make more money and, therefore, they can carry more \ndebt. But anybody who sees this chart has to begin to understand and \nworry that the needle of our debt is in the red zone--the danger zone.\n  Look at this. This includes spending for Federal, State, and local \ngovernment. These are 2012 projections of general government \nexpenditures in nominally U.S. dollars--all converted to U.S. dollars \nby the International Monetary Fund. This is not the United States. This \nis the world's economic outlook according to the International Monetary \nFund. This is the way they score our debt compared to the rest of the \nworld in comparable U.S. dollars.\n\n  Look at this: In dollars, Spain's debt per person is $24,000. Spain \nis in serious financial difficulty now. Its debt has caused the \ninterest on their debt to surge. They are paying a large amount. They \nhave tried to bring that under control, but their unemployment is high, \nand the net result has been the economy is stagnating dangerously. It \nis a sad thing.\n  Italy has more, with $26,000; Portugal, $39,000 per person; Greece, \n$42,000 per person; but the debt per person in the United States, \naccording to the International Monetary Fund, is $53,400--higher than \nall those countries.\n  I would say to my colleagues, we are not in a position of safety. I \nwould say to my colleagues that this is a kind of debtload that we need \nnot to underestimate. We might find that this economy is more \nunpredictable than we think.\n  As I said last night, I remember Alan Greenspan being before the \nBudget Committee in 2001 and telling us we had to worry. And the worry \nwas that we had so much money that we would pay down all the debt in \nthe United States and then--he worried--what we would do with the extra \nmoney when we paid the whole debt down. This is the maestro, Alan \nGreenspan.\n  I say that just to indicate that if he misses it that badly, maybe \nMr. Bernanke will miss it. Actually, the Wall Street Journal documented \nthat when Mr. Bernanke was advising Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve \nChairman, about the bank mortgage situation in the mid-2000s--2003, \n2004, 2005--he was advising Mr. Greenspan to keep pouring the low money \nout, keep encouraging banks to lend, lend, lend, and he rejected the \nidea we were in danger. Then, whammo, we had this horrible recession of \n2007.\n  So I would just say this chart shows us that we need to get our house \nin order. The American people know that. They tell me that everywhere I \ngo. So why won't Congress respond?\n  Well, the House has responded. I know my Democratic friends don't \nlike to hear that, but this budget that Paul Ryan produced, while not a \nperfect document, it changes the debt course of America. It balances \nthe budget, and we could do the same thing if we wanted to, and do it \nin a different way. Let's do it a different way, but we should have a \nbalanced budget. And we don't, and there is no plan to get there--not \neven close.\n  One of the things that is happening in America today is the growth in \nour economy is not where it should be. This chart is a vivid indicator \nthat the Congressional Budget Office, our top adviser, has been \nconsistently wrong about its projections in the last several years. \nThis is CBO forecasts 2 years before an event. OK? So in 2008, what was \nCBO projecting the growth rate to be in 2010?\n  They projected it would be 3.1 percent, but it came in at 2.4 \npercent. In 2009, what did they project we would have as growth in \n2011? They projected we would have 4 percent growth in 2011.\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nWe had less than half of that--1.8 percent. That is a huge difference.\n  Now Christina Romer, who served President Obama as his top adviser on \neconomic matters, has estimated that the difference in 1 and 2 percent \ngrowth is 1 million jobs. So what do we have here? We have more than 2 \nmillion less jobs being created in 2011 than were projected by the \nexperts that we relied on in 2009.\n  And look at this. It is even worse in 2012. They projected back in \n2010 that growth in 2012--just 2 years in advance--would be at 4.4 \npercent, and it came in at 2.2 percent. So these 1.8 and 2.2 percent \ngrowth figures are really not growth. That is not a job-creating \nfactor. You need to have more growth than that to create real jobs and \nhiring and wage improvements and raises.\n  So I just would ask my colleagues: What is causing that? What is \ncausing that? Professors Rogoff and Reinhart did the fabulous book, \n``This Time It's Different,'' and they did an empirical actual study of \nthe economies of over 200 years of nations who ran up too much debt.\n  They studied what happened and the ones that had debt crises. What \ndid they conclude? And not based on theory, not some ideal formula \nreached in academic situations, but what actually happened in these \ncountries? What they concluded was that when the gross debt exceeds 90 \npercent of GDP, 90 percent of the size of the economy, then growth \nbegins to slow. They found that the growth was slowed by 1 to 2 \npercent.\n  In 2010, the gross debt of the United States exceeded 90 percent of \nthe economy and CBO's forecast was off. The next year, we were still \nway above 90 percent. In 2012, we were way above 90 percent of GDP. The \ndebt is so high that it impacts economic growth, it would appear to me. \nI think this is a fact not being fully considered by CBO and it is \nimpacting our economy, and it argues against any idea that we have no \nresponsibility to start confronting our debt situation now.\n  In addition to Rogoff and Reinhart--perhaps stimulated by Rogoff and \nReinhart, in the last couple of years, the International Monetary Fund, \nthe European Central Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements \nhave studied these very issues because it is a big deal in Europe. Many \nof the countries in Europe are deeply in debt, their economies are \nstagnating, and they have studied this issue. And what did they \nconclude? They concluded basically the same thing. Every one of those \nstudies shows that when a country reaches a high level of debt--in the \nrange of the 90 percent--they begin to suffer economic growth \nreduction. One of the studies went as low as 60 percent of your GDP in \ndebt begins to slow the economy.\n  They have various factors in how it is done and the studies are \nconstructed in different ways, but the net result is that when our debt \nsituation is applied to each of those three studies, our economy is \nprojected to be suffering as a result of the high debt we have. So I \nwould say those three studies validate the concerns of Rogoff and \nReinhart. Those three studies indicate we are already in America \nsuffering growth loss because of the debt we have.\n  As we wrestle with how to deal with our economy, I would challenge \nall of our Members and challenge commentators in the media to ask tough \nquestions: Can we continue to borrow more, run up more debt, and \nattempt to create a stimulus effect in our economy today? How much can \nwe do that?\n  The Congressional Budget Office early this year concluded in a \nthorough report that if we were to balance the budget and bring our \ndebt down to the level--as Congressman Ryan proposed and as we proposed \nin the committee, and as I proposed in my amendment tonight--and \nbalanced the budget, what would happen? They predict this economy in 10 \nyears would be stronger than it is if we hadn't done that, if we used \ntwo other scenarios that had less reduction and allowed more debt to \naccumulate.\n  Did you hear that? The economy over the long term will be healthier \nin this country, according to our own CBO, if we get our debt under \ncontrol and balance our budget. It is in their report in January of \nthis year. We need to listen to that. The American people know you \ncan't get something for nothing. They know you can't borrow your way \nout of debt. As one of my citizens in Evergreen told me several years \nago at a town meeting, My daddy said you can't borrow your way out of \ndebt. Isn't that true? That is what we have been doing. We are going to \nborrow somehow and create a false high, a sugar high, and that is going \nto fix our problems. It has proven not to be the case.\n  What do we need to do? We need to do the same thing responsible \npeople all over the world do. We need to do the same thing families do, \nthe same thing States do that are well managed--and many are very well \nmanaged--and that counties and cities do; that is, operate within our \nmeans. Let's have a budget that actually balances, and all of the other \nfactors will come into play. Debt as a percentage of GDP and these \narguments about primary debt, and debt as a percentage of the economy, \nthat is not where we need to be.\n  If we balance the budget over a period of time--carefully, so it \ndoesn't do damage to the economy--and do this in the right way, we will \nmake this economy better, and we will have people working who are now \non unemployment. We will have people working and bringing home \npaychecks who are now on food stamps and TANF and other welfare \nprograms. They will have jobs and they will be able to get pay raises \nand they will be able to work longer hours and get some overtime, and \nbe able to pay down the house payment or the car payment. People are \nhurting out there. We have fewer people working today than we did in \n2000. The average wage has declined--not increased--in the last 10 \nyears. This economy is not growing. My Democratic colleagues are \ncorrect about that. People are hurting.\n  So how do you fix it? Do you borrow more so we can spend more? Is the \ngovernment going to lift people out of poverty by giving them more \nchecks that we taxed more and passed out more money? Is that \ncompassion? I don't think so.\n  I have worked with working people. I have worked construction. I grew \nup in the country. I know people who didn't have money and how they can \nlive and take care of their families on modest means, and they were \nindependent, with pride and self-respect. We have an award being given \nin North Carolina to a food stamp office employee who talked people \ninto taking food stamps who said they didn't need them. The award was \ngiven to her for overcoming mountain pride. So is this the status of \nthe American economy today, that we are talking people into not being \nindependent, we encourage them to take benefits from the government \nwhen they say they don't need them? That is what they gave her the \naward for.\n  We have got food stamp promoters in foreign embassies, in the \nconsulate offices all over. They are meeting and promoting new \nresidents to America--legal, presumably--to get on food stamps and \nother benefits programs. But you are not supposed to be admitted to the \nUnited States if you are going to be a charge on the State, so we \nchecked on that. Do you know what we found? That about two-tenths of 1 \npercent--not 1 percent, but two-tenths of 1 percent of the people who \napply to enter the United States are turned down because they might not \nbe financially able to support themselves. One study said at least 36 \npercent of lawful immigrants in our country today are on some sort of \nwelfare benefit program.\n  If they have to have health care to survive and go to the hospital, \nthey need to get it, and we want to help people who are in need. But \ndoesn't anybody follow common sense? Doesn't anybody understand we have \na reasonable law that says, If you are going to come to America, we \nneed to know you are going to be able to take care of yourself? You \nshouldn't be coming to America to get on a benefit program. We are not \nchecking. Nobody is checking. Nobody is worried.\n\n  So what will they do? They will get Uncle Sam to ask the taxpayers to \nsend more money, and we will keep spending more. It is a bottomless \npit, you know. We will just tax the rich. How about that? Because \nshouldn't the rich pay more because somebody immigrated to America and \ntheir income was low? And so we will just give them money.\n  Do you know they did the same thing, the Department of Agriculture,\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nwith people who entered the country? They had a soap opera series of \nvideos, and this is what they did: A lady speaks to another lady and \nshe says something about food stamps. The other lady says, Well, my \nhusband has a good job. I don't need food stamps. That is the first \nscene. The first lady says, Well, you don't understand.\n  After two or three of these videos, the first lady convinces the \nsecond lady that she should ask for these benefits when she said she \ndidn't want them. She was a lady of pride and dignity. She didn't think \nshe had to have this and wasn't asking for it. But our government \novercame her resistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was \npromoting this and paid money to buy these ads: Don't worry, we will \nask the American people to send more money. But we won't ask you to \nsend more, we will ask the rich to send more money.\n  I remember years ago George Wallace used to want to tax the power \ncompany. He always wanted to tax the power companies. I was looking at \nmy electric bill the other day and they list your charges, and one of \nthem is the State tax. So they taxed the power company, and the power \ncompany passes it on to the person who buys the electricity. Give me a \nbreak. A tax on the economy is a tax on the economy. It is a weak \nargument that you can have an unlimited amount of money by taxing the \nrich. At some point it becomes not correct, not fair, and not right if \nthe money is being thrown away on Solyndras and A-123 battery companies \nthat go bankrupt. But nobody worries about it: Send more money.\n  We are having abuses in the SNAP program, and I proposed an amendment \nthat would eliminate an abusive part of the food stamp program a year \nago. In 2001, we spent $20 billion a year on SNAP. Last year, we spent \n$80 billion. It has gone up, from 20 to 80, four times. We identified a \ncategorical eligibility gimmick that was allowing people to get food \nstamps who did not qualify and should not have received them. I said, \nLet's close that loophole. Over 10 years we were projected to spend \n$800 billion on the food stamp program. This would have reduced it by \n11, so we would have been spending $789 billion instead of $800 \nbillion. And do you know what they said? Sessions wants to take food \nout of the mouths of babies. People are going to starve. He is \nuncompassionate. He is unkind. He wants to chop the budget so we can \nhurt people. It was voted down. And we had reports showing that this \nwas an abusive practice that should have been fixed.\n  Now we want to ask the American people, Send more money. We want to \ntax you more. Well, what about the abuse in the food stamp program? \nThere is no abuse. The Department of Agriculture said we have less \nfraud than we have ever had in history. And I used to prosecute that as \na Federal prosecutor. I know there is fraud in there. We established \nwithout any doubt that their claim that they have minimal fraud is only \nin the computer part of the program.\n  Nobody is checking to see if somebody who qualified for any of these \ngovernment programs later gets a job and doesn't meet the \nqualifications. They still are getting benefits all over the country, \nunless they self-report. All kinds of things such as this are going on. \nNo one is checking to see if somebody goes into two food stamp offices, \ntwo other benefit offices of various kinds and asks for them under \ndifferent names at each place and produces some sort of ID. There is \nall kinds of abuse in this system and I hear it all the time.\n  Most people who get food stamps need it, they qualify for it, and \nthey would get it under any kind of reasonable reform that would occur. \nBut to suggest that we aren't wasting money through practices that \nallow unqualified individuals to gain access to multiple programs of \nthis kind is a mistake. It absolutely happens every day.\n  I tried cases to a jury of stores selling food stamps, manipulating \nthe program, dealing with corrupt individuals who brought the food \nstamps in to sell because they had obtained them fraudulently and never \nneeded the food at all. This idea that there is no fraud in this \nprogram is ludicrous. That is what the leaders of the Department of \nAgriculture are saying: We have no problem. It is OK. Just send us more \nmoney. We will keep expanding and growing every year--maybe double the \nthing again, I guess.\n\n  These are the kinds of things that I believe this budget does not \naddress. This budget allows spending to continue at its current rate, \nit allows the debt to continue at its current rate. Spending goes up \nand taxes go up. That is what this budget does. Spending goes up and \ntaxes go up and the deficit is not reduced.\n  I hope that somehow we will come to our senses, go back home, and \ntalk to our constituents. We will listen to them when they plead with \nus to do something about the debt course we are on. They tell us they \nare disgusted with the way things are going in Washington, and we say: \nWe cannot do anything about it. They said there is not a problem. You \ndon't understand the challenge we face. We really have to have more \nmoney. That is what we have to have. We can't get by on the money we \nhave been having. We have to increase the money you give us.\n  Do you know that if we increase spending every year 3.4 percent--and \nthese figures are not disputed--if we increase spending each year 3.4 \npercent, we could balance the budget? The problem is that our spending \nis increasing at 5.4 percent. It is hard to believe that difference \nwould cause as many billion dollars in debt as it does, but it does. \nEach year, we add hundreds of billions of dollars to the debt. In fact, \nthe last 4 years we have averaged adding $1,100 billion to the debt \neach year. As those dollars are added to the debt, we pay interest on \nthem, and interest is surging.\n  We are going to find, according to the CBO, on the course we are on \nand on the course we would stay on if this budget passes, that we would \nnot do anything different than where we are today, which means we would \nbe paying about $800 billion in 1 year in interest. The road bill is \n$40 billion, education is about $100 billion--it is going to crowd out \nspending for every agency in our government. For research and \ndevelopment--we are just going to keep raising taxes now?\n  When we talk about a $650 billion tax increase in January this year \non the rich, that passed. That went through. That will be $65 billion a \nyear in extra revenue. I am saying to you that the Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us that in 10 years from now, we will be paying $800 \nbillion a year in interest. You are not going to tax the rich out of \nthat. It is just not going to happen.\n  We are at a point where the debate today and the last week in the \nBudget Committee has put us in a position to confront the choices we \nhave. Forgive me if I am passionate about this. We have waited 4 years \nto even see a budget brought to the floor when the law of the United \nStates of America says a budget should be brought every year to the \nfloor and every year before the committee and the President is required \nto produce a budget every year. For the first time since the Budget Act \nhas been passed, the President has not produced a budget this year. But \nthe Senate has begun to act, so I guess we are supposed to be happy for \nthat. And I am happy for that, but I think we would be a lot better \noff, the country would be a lot better off--we may be in a better \nposition to reach some sort of compromise on some of the great issues \nhad we been publicly wrestling with these issues for the last 4 years \ninstead of sweeping them under the table.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2141-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Madam President, I rise today to celebrate Women's \nHistory Month. This March, we pay tribute to the generations of women \nin\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nAmerica whose commitment to their community, their State, and their \nNation has proved invaluable to society. I know Kentuckians are proud \nthis March to honor the more than 2.2 million women who live in the \nCommonwealth.\n  Women's History Month began as a national celebration in 1981 thanks \nto an act of Congress, and since 1995 every President has issued an \nannual proclamation designating March as Women's History Month. For \nWomen's History Month 2013, I would like to shine the spotlight on some \nvery admirable women's groups in Kentucky who are working hard to make \nthe Bluegrass State a better place for women to live, grow, and \nprosper--and making history themselves.\n  The Family Scholar House in Louisville is an organization that \nstrives to end the cycle of poverty for many women by giving students \nwho are single parents the support they need to earn a 4-year college \ndegree. By working from poverty to self-sufficiency, these parent-\nstudents are then able to provide their children with a better life. \nThe Family Scholar House is transforming families and communities \nthrough the power of education, and I had the pleasure of meeting with \nsome of this organization's leaders in my Capitol office last week.\n  The Chrysalis House, in Lexington, provides substance-abuse treatment \nprograms for women. Their mission is to support women and their \nfamilies in recovery from alcohol and drugs. In operation for over 34 \nyears, Chrysalis House specializes in treating substance-dependent \nexpecting mothers, allowing them to keep their newborn babies with them \nwhile in treatment. They also counsel the children of these women on \nsubstance abuse prevention. Chrysalis uses a combination of the 12-step \nprogram, long-term living arrangements, and a caring and nurturing \nenvironment to ensure women and their families live fulfilling lives \nfree of abusive substances. I have visited Chrysalis House and seen \nfirsthand how much good they are doing, and I want to especially \nrecognize president Lindy Karns and her husband, Rick Christman, for \ntheir dedicated efforts.\n  The Hope Center, also located in Lexington, is an organization that \naddresses homelessness on multiple fronts. They provide food, shelter, \nand clothing to the homeless; recovery for those who are addicted; \nhealth services for the sick; diagnosis and treatment for the mentally \nill; employment services for those looking for work; housing for those \nwho need it; and childcare and higher education opportunities for \nsingle-parent families. The Hope Center seeks to identify the \nunderlying causes that compel people to seek out their services and \nthen work to address them in fundamental ways.\n  The Isaiah House, located in the town of Willisburg in Washington \nCounty, seeks to provide real hope for those who suffer from addiction. \nThis faith-based program helps men but also has special facilities and \nprograms for women. They exist to help provide women struggling with \ndrug or alcohol addiction the peace and serenity they have been \nsearching for, through counseling that tends to the spiritual, mental, \nand physical needs of the residents.\n  Then we have the Western Kentucky University Sisterhood. Western \nKentucky University, located in Bowling Green, is one of the \nCommonwealth's leading universities, and with women making up 65 \npercent of the school's current students and half of all alumni, the \nWKU Sisterhood is a way for women to make an impact at the university. \nThe WKU Sisterhood is a group of women who donate at least $1,000 each \nand then decide collectively how that money shall be used. Two grant \nrecipients, the groups Women in Transition and Project CLASS, are both \nprograms specifically geared to help women succeed in college.\n  The New Opportunity School for Women, located in the town of Berea, \nwas founded to improve the educational, financial, and personal \ncircumstances of low-income, middle-aged women in the Appalachian \nregion of Kentucky. In the past 23 years, the New Opportunity School \nfor Women has hosted more than 580 women in its 3-week residential \nprogram and provided hundreds more with career and educational outreach \nand counseling.\n  What a marvel it is to consider all of the resources, programs, and \ncharities that have been founded in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, by \nwomen, for women, to empower women to improve their own lives and then, \nin turn, improve their communities. Kentucky is truly blessed to have \nso many people of compassion.\n  This Women's History Month is an entirely appropriate occasion on \nwhich to pay tribute to them and their accomplishments on this floor. I \nknow my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating the \nleaders and supporters of the several groups I have enumerated here, as \nwell as the many others I did not get to mention, for their good works. \nAnd the people of Kentucky thank them as well. History will remember \nthem for their dedication and achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2142-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2142-S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SUSAN SMIT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, today I wish to \nhonor a leader who has tirelessly fought to educate young people in my \nState. After 9 years of dedicated service as superintendent of the \nWagner Community School District, Susan Smit will retire at the end of \nthe school year.\n  Susan Smit's career in education has spanned a period of over 30 \nyears. She embarked on this path in 1970, first as a vocational home \neconomics teacher. Throughout her time in the field of education, she \nhas held many positions: teacher, counselor, principal and \nsuperintendent. Most recently, Susan has spent the last 16 years \nserving in public schools in Indian Country, working to close the \nachievement gap between Native and non-Native students. Students in the \nWagner Community School District face a unique set of challenges, and \nSusan Smit's approach to addressing them has been nothing short of \nvisionary. The nature of the district is rural and low income, with \nover 70 percent of students qualifying for free and reduced meals.\n  As a founder and cochair of the Senate Impact Aid Coalition, I have \nenjoyed working with Susan over the years. In November 2012, Susan was \ninvited to speak to congressional offices about the importance of \ncontinued Federal investments in education. Susan provided testimony to \nmore than 80 congressional staff members and dozens of education \nleaders on the negative effect of education funding cuts and the need \nto maintain funding for critical education programs. During the 2013 \nannual conference for the National Association of Federally Impacted \nSchools, NAFIS, Susan was awarded the Friends of NAFIS award, one of \nthe highest honors the organization bestows upon an educator. The honor \nrecognized Susan for her aptitude for problem-solving and her ability \nto integrate the needs of the Wagner community into school initiatives.\n  As a superintendent, Susan has strived to broaden access to academic \nopportunities for youth by maximizing the use of technology in the \nclassroom. The school district's one-to-one laptop initiative provides \nstudents with a laptop for their 4 years of high school. This program \nhas increased retention and gives students the opportunity to hone \ncomputer skills that will serve them well beyond graduation. Students \napply these skills to further their education through online classes. \nAlthough the school district does not have the resources to offer \ntraditional advanced placement classes, this does not prevent students \nfrom enrolling in these advanced and rigorous courses. Advanced \nplacement classes are offered online though the distance education lab.\n  One of the crowning achievements of Susan's tenure as superintendent \nis the implementation of Jobs for America's Graduates, JAG, Program in \nSouth Dakota. Through leadership development and mentorship, the \nprogram prepares at-risk students for success in college and future \ncareers. Due in part to the program, the school district's graduation \nrate is above the state average, and the high school has been \nrecognized as a distinguished school under the title I program.\n  Susan has been a tireless champion for expanding access to quality \nand affordable early education. As superintendent, Susan spearheaded \nthe creation of a preschool program that is in\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nits sixth year and serves over 100 3- and 4-year-old children each \nyear. Of the children enrolled in the program, 75 percent of the \nchildren are Native American. I am a strong supporter of early \neducation and appreciate Susan's commitment to helping young people get \nthe right start by nurturing their development and providing for their \nwell-being.\n  As superintendent of the Wagner Community School District, Susan Smit \nhas successfully overcome many of the challenges associated with \noperating a rural school district. It is my pleasure to thank her for \nmany years of dedicated service to the youth of South Dakota. I wish \nSusan, her husband Roland, and their family all the best in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO C.L. SWOPES\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, we salute our veterans for their \nselfless commitment and immeasurable sacrifice to protect this nation \nand its ideals so we can continue to be the greatest, freest country \nthe world has ever known. Standing up to tyranny, oppression and \ncruelty around the world, our troops exhibit courage under the most \ndaunting circumstances.\n  Today I want to recognize the service and sacrifice of one of our \nveterans from the ``Greatest Generation'' who exemplified these traits \nduring World War II and who is celebrating a milestone--his 100th \nbirthday, C.L. Swopes.\n  Mr. Swopes spent 25 years in the Navy, originally entering the \nservice to get relief from the hardships of the Great Depression. ``The \nmoney was what I was after,'' he told a local newspaper about his \nreason for enlisting.\n  Serving in the Pacific during WWII, Mr. Swopes experienced first-hand \nthe realities of war on the U.S.S. Hornet during the Doolittle Raid, \nthe Battle of Midway and its sinking at the Battle of Santa Cruz.\n  ``Teaching you how to climb down a rope in practice is one thing, but \nreality is another,'' Mr. Swopes recalled to local media about his \nevacuation from the sinking aircraft carrier.\n  Admittedly a weak swimmer, he spent hours in the water until being \npicked up by a lifeboat.\n  He continued his military career after WWII serving around the world \nand throughout the country before retiring in Millington, Tennessee.\n  During his service, the Desha County native made a family with his \nwife Mary Jane. He impressed upon his children Marva, Paulette, \nLorraine, and Anthony, the importance of education. ``I wished for an \neducation so many days,'' Mr. Swopes said because it would have given \nhim additional opportunities in his career.\n  After his Naval career, Mr. Swopes returned to his native Watson, \nArkansas to take over the family farm.\n  I thank C.L. Swopes for his service and sacrifice as he celebrates \nhis 100th birthday and wish him many more years of happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CANNON STREET ALL-STARS\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, in the heart of Charleston, SC, lies \nCannon Street; it's a modest street spanning just a few city blocks. \nHowever, within its history lies the story of what Dr. Creighton Hale, \nthe former CEO of little league baseball, called ``the most significant \namateur team in baseball history.''\n  In 1955, the area surrounding this street was one of economic blight \nand social unease. In an effort to keep kids out of trouble and teach \nskills that only team sports can provide, the local YMCA organized four \nlittle league teams for the neighborhood kids. The Cannon Street YMCA \nAll-Stars consisted of seventeen players: John Bailey, Charles Bradley, \nVermont Brown, William Godfrey, Vernon Grey, Allen Jackson, Carl \nJohnson, John Mack, Leroy Major, David Middleton, Arthur Peoples, John \nRivers, Norman Robinson, Maurice Singleton, Leroy Carter, George \nGregory, and Augustus Holt. They were coached and founded by: Lee J. \nBennett, Walter Burke, Rufus Dilligard, A.O. Graham, Robert Morrison, \nR.H. Penn, and Benjamin Singleton. The team would advance to the \nCharleston City Little League playoff games but would never be given \nthe opportunity to earn a spot in the Little League World Series. It \nwas not because they were unworthy players or because they could not \nafford to go. The color of their skin stifled the dreams of these \ntwelve-year-old boys.\n  The Charleston playoff games were boycotted in 1955 to preserve \nracial segregation. Because teams again refused to play against them, \nthe Cannon Street All-Stars advanced past the state and regional \nplayoffs. The National Little League invited the All-Stars to the \nLittle League World Series as special guests; they could not compete \nfor the title because technically they hadn't played their way to the \nchampionships. They returned to Charleston, dismayed and disappointed.\n  As children, they embodied the very characteristics that organized \nsports aim to impart--teamwork, courage and respect. As adults they \nhave worked in productive and valuable careers such as architecture, \nlaw enforcement and education. As they have grown older, they are now \nvolunteers in their communities--giving back, yet again. While they \nnever had the opportunity to compete, their story has demonstrated \nwhere we have come from as a nation.\n  Last month members of my staff had the opportunity to meet several of \nthe original Cannon Street Little Leaguers who traveled to Washington, \nDC to be recognized at Nationals Stadium before the Nationals-Phillies \ngame. Their story remains powerful more than 65 years later, and I know \nmy staff will never forget having the opportunity to meet them.\n  Today, the neighborhood that encompasses Cannon Street has developed \ninto an integral part of the Charleston education and science \ncommunity. It is home to a number of colleges and universities and a \nworld-class research hospital. The boys of the Cannon Street Little \nLeague Team are men who through their careers and service to the \ncommunity have become assets to their neighborhoods. In spite of the \nadversity they encountered and the challenges they confronted, these \nyoung people illustrated to the world the absurdity of segregation and \nthe hatred inherent in racism.\n  In the 55 years since they were excluded from competing to earn a \nspot at the Little League World Series in their own right, America has \nmatured. I would like to believe that a handful of twelve-year-olds \ncontributed to our maturity.\n  It is with great admiration that I share their story and my respect \nfor these men with you, my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDlNG OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-5", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n       At 1:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, \n     delivered by Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, \n     announced that the House agree to the amendments of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 933) making appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     and other departments and agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.\n       The message also announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. \n     1928a, and the order of the House of January 3, 2013, the \n     Speaker appoints the following Members on the part of the \n     House of Representatives to the United States Group of the \n     NATO Parliamentary Assembly: Mr. David Scott of Georgia, Mr. \n     Schneider of Illinois, Ms. Frankel of Florida, and Mr. \n     Connolly of Virginia.\n       The message further announced that pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n     4355(a), clause 10 of rule I, and the order of the House of \n     January 3, 2013, the Speaker appoints the following Members \n     on the part of the House of Representatives to the Board of \n     Visitors to the United States Military Academy: Mr. Shimkus \n     of Illinois, Mr. Womack of Arkansas, Mr. Israel of New York, \n     and Ms. Loretta Sanchez of California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/21/senate-section/article/S2143-6", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2143-S2144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 649.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase the \nnumber of permanent faculty in palliative care at accredited allopathic \nand osteopathic medical schools, nursing schools, and other programs, \nto promote education in palliative care and hospice, and to support the \ndevelopment of faculty careers in academic palliative medicine; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical need \nin today's health care workforce for additional training related to \npalliative care. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care \nfocused on relieving the pain, stress and other debilitating symptoms \nof serious illness, such as cancer, cardiac disease, respiratory \ndisease, kidney failure, Alzheimer's, AIDS, ALS, and MS. Its goal is to \nrelieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life for \npatients and their families.\n  Many people mistakenly believe that palliative care is only \nbeneficial when a cure is not possible. Actually, palliative care is \nnot dependent on a life-limiting prognosis and may actually help \nindividuals recover by relieving symptoms such as pain, anxiety or loss \nof appetite while they are undergoing sometimes difficult medical \ntreatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy. Palliative \ncare is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and \nother specialists who work with a patient's other health care providers \nto provide an extra layer of support, including assistance with \ndifficult medical decision-making and coordination of care among \nspecialists. Palliative care is appropriate for people of any age and \nat any stage in an illness, whether that illness is curable, chronic or \nlife-threatening.\n  There is a specific type of palliative care, called hospice, for \npeople for whom a cure is no longer possible and who likely have 6 \nmonths or less to live. Hospice care can be provided at one's home, a \nhospice facility, a hospital or a nursing home. Hospice care is about \ngiving patients control, dignity and comfort so they have the best \npossible quality of life during the time they have. Hospice care also \nprovides support and grief therapy for loved ones whose struggles are \noften cast aside or forgotten during treatment.\n  A growing evidence base has demonstrated that palliative care, \nincluding hospice, improves quality, controls cost and enhances patient \nand family satisfaction for the rapidly expanding population of \nindividuals with serious or life-threatening illness. Palliative care \nmay also prolong the lives of some seriously ill patients.\n  Over the last 10 years, the number of hospital-based palliative care \nprograms has more than doubled due to the increasing number of \nAmericans living with serious, complex and chronic illnesses and the \nrealities of the care responsibilities faced by their families. Studies \nsuggest that in states with more hospital-based palliative care \nprograms, patients are less likely to die in the hospital, are likely \nto spend fewer days in the ICU, have better pain management and higher \nsatisfaction with their health care.\n  As usual, Oregon is ahead of the curve and I'm proud to say that in a \n2011 report ranking states on their citizens' access to hospital-based \npalliative care programs, Oregon was among the seven states who earned \nan ``A'' rating, with 88 percent of Oregon hospitals offering \npalliative care.\n  Unfortunately, many seriously ill patients and their families lack \nthe type of access available to Oregonians. Palliative care is a \nrelatively new medical specialty and more must be done to ensure an \nadequate, well-trained palliative care workforce is available to \nprovide comprehensive symptom management, intensive communication and a \nlevel of care coordination that addresses the episodic and long-term \nnature of serious, chronic illness. I believe that, with Federal \nsupport, we can help address the workforce gap between those currently \npracticing in palliative care and hospice and the number of health care \nprofessionals required to care for this expanding patient population. \nThat is why today I am introducing the ``Palliative Care and Hospice \nEducation and Training Act'' or PCHETA. This authoring legislation \nfocuses on three key areas to grow the palliative care and hospice \nworkforce: education centers to expand interdisciplinary training in \npalliative and hospice care; training of physicians who plan to teach \npalliative medicine and fellowships to encourage re-training for mid-\ncareer physicians; and academic career awards and career incentive \nawards to support physicians and other health care providers who \nprovide palliative and hospice care training.\n  With this legislation, patients and families who are facing serious \nor life-threatening illness will have access to the high-quality \npalliative care and hospice services that can maximize their quality of \nlife. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 645. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreaffirm the United States historic commitment to protecting refugees \nwho are fleeing persecution or torture; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce the \nRefugee Protection Act. The Senate will soon turn to comprehensive \nimmigration reform and the changes to the refugee system contained in \nthis bill are a critical component of fixing our broken immigration \nsystem. As we address the\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nmany complex immigration issues facing our country, we must ensure that \nAmerica upholds its longstanding commitment to refugee protection.\n  The Refugee Protection Act of 2013 reaffirms the commitments we made \nin ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention, and will help to restore the \nUnited States as a global leader on human rights. This legislation \nseeks to repeal the most harsh, inefficient, and unnecessary elements \nof current law, and restore the United States to its rightful role as a \nsafe and welcoming home for those suffering from persecution around the \nworld.\n  During this challenging economic time, it can be tempting to look \ninward rather than to fulfill our global humanitarian commitments. I \nbelieve this bill is needed more now than ever. Millions of refugees \nremain displaced and warehoused in refugee camps in Eastern Africa, \nSoutheast Asia, and other parts of the world. Ongoing political \nstruggles in the Middle East and North Africa are causing dislocation \nof significant populations. We will continue to see genuine refugees \nwho are in dire need of protection. The Refugee Protection Act helps \nensure that America will continue to be a haven for these individuals \nand their families, just as it has been historically.\n  Since passage of the landmark Refugee Act of 1980, more than 2.6 \nmillion refugees and asylum seekers have been granted protection in the \nUnited States. In my home State of Vermont, I have seen how the \nadmission of these refugees and asylum seekers, almost 5,600 in the \nlast 20 years, has revitalized and enriched communities, resulting in \nthe creation of new businesses, safer neighborhoods, and stronger \nschools. We are fortunate to have the Vermont Refugee Resettlement \nProgram, with its decades of experience and award-winning volunteer \nprogram, leading this effort. Over the last 5 years, many of these new \nVermonters have come from Bhutan, Burma, and the Congo. As they become \nsmall business owners, nurses, and soccer coaches, they contribute to \nthe well-being of our communities and their culture enriches my \nhistorically Anglo-Saxon and French-Canadian state.\n  Vermonters have played a tremendous role in welcoming refugees and \nasylum-seekers to their communities. Many have hosted refugee families \nin their homes until suitable housing could be found. Despite this \ngenerous community support, however, Vermont's resettlement program is \nnot without its challenges. We experience many of the same hurdles \nfaced by resettlement efforts and receiving communities across the \nNation. To help address these hurdles, the Refugee Protection Act of \n2013 includes provisions that will help the nationwide resettlement \neffort operate more effectively.\n  In addition to support and improvement of the resettlement program, \nthis bill concerns several areas of domestic asylum adjudication that \nare in need of significant reform. This bill would repeal the one-year \nfiling deadline for asylum seekers, removing an unnecessary barrier to \nprotection. The bill would allow arriving aliens and minors to seek \nasylum first before the Asylum Office, rather than referring those \ncases immediately to immigration court. The Asylum Office is well \ntrained to screen for fraud and is able to handle a slight increase in \nits caseload. Meanwhile, as we have heard from many immigration \nexperts, the immigration courts are overburdened, under-resourced, and \nfacing steady increases in their caseloads.\n  The Refugee Protection Act ensures that persons who were victims of \nterrorism or persecution by terrorist groups will not be doubly \nvictimized with a denial of protection in the United States. Vermont \nImmigration and Asylum Advocates, a legal aid provider and a \ncollaborator in the New England Survivor of Torture and Trauma program, \ncontinues to see cases where persons granted asylum are later blocked \nfrom bringing their families to the United States or from applying for \npermanent residency by overly broad definitions in current law. This \nbill would help such persons prove their cases without taking any \nshortcuts that could harm national security. The bill also gives the \nPresident the authority to designate certain particularly vulnerable \ngroups for expedited consideration. All refugees would still have to \ncomplete security and background checks prior to entry to the United \nStates.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes the need to treat genuine asylum seekers \nas persons in need of protection, not as criminals. It calls for asylum \nseekers who can prove their identities and who pose no threat to the \nUnited States to be released from immigration detention. Vermont \nImmigration and Asylum Advocates, like other legal aid providers across \nthe Nation, struggle to visit detention facilities located at great \ndistance, or to reach clients who have been transferred to far away \nlocations. I appreciate efforts made by the Obama administration to \nparole eligible asylum seekers and to improve the conditions of \ndetention overall, but more must be done. The Refugee Protection Act \nwill improve access to counsel so that asylum seekers with genuine \nclaims can gain legal assistance in presenting their claims. It will \nrequire the Government to codify detention standards to ensure that \nreforms are meaningful and enforceable. These reforms are humane and \nfair, but they will also save taxpayer dollars because of the high \ncosts associated with unnecessary detentions.\n  There is no question that the United States is a leader among nations \nin refugee protection, but we can do better. The refugees we welcome to \nour shores contribute to the fabric of our Nation, and enrich the \ncommunities where they settle. I urge all Senators to support the \nRefugee Protection Act of 2013.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a tax reform that broadens the tax \n     base, reduces tax complexity, includes a consumption-based \n     income tax, and a globally competitive flat tax.\n       (1) Taxes on individuals.--This concurrent resolution shall \n     eliminate all tax brackets and have one standard flat tax \n     rate on adjusted gross income. The individual tax code shall \n     remove all credits and deductions, with exception to the \n     mortgage interest deduction, offsetting these with a \n     substantially higher standard deduction and personal \n     exemption. The standard deduction for joint filers should be \n     equal to or greater than $35,000, $21,690 for head of \n     household, and $17,500 for single filers. The personal \n     exemption amount is $6,800. This proposal eliminates the \n     individual alternative minimum tax (AMT). The tax reform \n     would repeal all tax on savings and investments, including \n     capital gains, qualified and ordinary dividends, estate, \n     gift, and interest saving taxes.\n       (2) Taxes on businesses.--This concurrent resolution shall \n     eliminate all tax brackets and have one standard flat tax on \n     adjusted gross income. The business tax code shall remove all \n     credits and deductions, offsetting these with a lower tax \n     rate and immediate expensing of all business inputs. Such \n     inputs shall be determined by total revenue from the sale of \n     goods and services less purchases of inputs from other firms \n     less wages, salaries, and pensions paid to workers less \n     purchases of plant and equipment.\n       (3) Single system.--The individuals and businesses would be \n     subject to taxation on only those incomes that are produced \n     or derived, as a territorial system in the United States. The \n     aggregate taxes paid should provide the ability to fill out a \n     tax return no larger than a postcard.\n\n                      TITLE VI--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. 601. REGULATORY REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a regulatory reform.\n       (1) Apply regulatory analysis requirements to independent \n     agencies.--It shall be the policy of Congress to pass into \n     law a requirement for independent agencies to abide by the \n     same regulatory analysis requirement as those required by \n     executive branch agencies.\n       (2) Adopt the regulations from the executive in need of \n     scrutiny act (reins).--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     vote on the REINS Act, legislation that would require all \n     regulations that impose a burden greater than $100,000,000 in \n     economic aggregate may not be implemented as law unless \n     Congress gives [their/its] consent by voting on the rule.\n       (3) Sunset all regulations.--It is the policy of Congress \n     that regulations imposed by the Federal Government shall \n     automatically sunset every two years unless repromulgated by \n     Congress.\n       (4) Process reform.--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     implement regulatory process reform by instituting \n     statutorily required regulatory impact analysis for all \n     agencies, require the publication of regulatory impact \n     analysis before the regulation is finalized, and ensure that \n     not only are regulatory impact analysis conducted, but \n     applied to the issued regulation or rulemaking.\n       (5) Incorporation of formal rulemaking for major rules.--It \n     shall be the policy of\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     Congress to apply formal rulemaking procedures to all major \n     regulations or those regulations that exceed $100,000,000 in \n     aggregate economic costs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 264.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHILD INTERSTATE \n                   ABORTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) laws requiring parental notification or consent prior \n     to an abortion, or in the alternative judicial waiver, are in \n     effect in more than half of the States, but these laws are \n     often circumvented by interstate activity in which minors \n     travel or are transported across State lines to avoid laws \n     requiring parental involvement;\n       (2) abortion providers use targeted advertising to minors \n     across State lines, using avoidance of parental notification \n     requirements as a selling point;\n       (3) when an abortion provider performs an abortion on a \n     minor without parental notification, the provider is likely \n     to lack the complete medical history of the minor, and \n     parents of the minor are unaware of the need to watch for \n     complications that may develop after the abortion when the \n     minor is sent back to her State of residence, far from the \n     provider; and\n       (4) parental notification and parental consent laws are \n     supported by overwhelming majorities of the public in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a physician who performs or induces an abortion on a \n     minor who is a resident of a State other than the State in \n     which the abortion is performed should be required by\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n     Federal law to provide, or cause an agent of the physician to \n     provide, at least 24 hours advance notice to a parent of the \n     minor before the abortion is performed;\n       (2) such a Federal requirement for interstate parental \n     notification should not apply if --\n       (A) the minor declares in a signed written statement that \n     she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse \n     by a parent, and, before an abortion is performed on the \n     minor, the physician notifies the authorities specified to \n     receive reports of child abuse or neglect by the law of the \n     State in which the minor resides of the known or suspected \n     abuse or neglect;\n       (B) the abortion is necessary to save the life of a minor \n     whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical \n     injury, or physical illness, including a life endangering \n     physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy \n     itself, provided that the attending physician or an agent of \n     the physician notifies a parent of the minor in writing that \n     an abortion was performed on the minor and of the \n     circumstances of the abortion within 24 hours;\n       (C) the abortion is performed or induced in a State that \n     has in force a law requiring parental involvement in the \n     abortion decision of a minor and the physician complies with \n     the requirements of that law;\n       (D) the physician is presented with documentation that \n     shows with a reasonable degree of certainty that a court in \n     the State of residence of the minor has authorized that the \n     minor be allowed to procure an abortion; or\n       (E) the minor is physically accompanied by a person who \n     presents the physician or an agent of the physician with \n     documentation showing with a reasonable degree of certainty \n     that he or she is in fact a parent of that minor;\n       (3) a parent who suffers harm by a violation of the \n     interstate notification requirement should be entitled to \n     obtain appropriate relief in a civil action, unless that \n     parent has committed an act of incest with the minor;\n       (4) whoever has committed an act of incest with a minor and \n     knowingly transports the minor across a State line with the \n     intent that the minor obtain an abortion should be subject to \n     imprisonment of up to 1 year for such transportation, in \n     addition to any other penalties; and\n       (5) Congress should enact S. 369, the Child Interstate \n     Abortion Notification Act (CIANA), to accomplish these \n     purposes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 293.

Res. 8, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2014, revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2013, \nand setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2015 through 2023; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5__. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SEX-SELECTION \n                   ABORTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Women are a vital part of American society and culture \n     and possess the same fundamental human rights and civil \n     rights as men.\n       (2) United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of \n     males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits \n     sex discrimination in various contexts, including the \n     provision of employment, education, housing, health insurance \n     coverage, and athletics.\n       (3) Sex is an immutable characteristic ascertainable at the \n     earliest stages of human development through existing medical \n     technology and procedures commonly in use, including \n     maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, \n     chorionic villus sampling or ``CVS'', and obstetric \n     ultrasound. In addition to medically assisted sex \n     determination, a growing sex determination niche industry has \n     developed and is marketing low-cost commercial products, \n     widely advertised and available, that aid in the sex \n     determination of an unborn child without the aid of medical \n     professionals. Experts have demonstrated that the sex-\n     selection industry is on the rise and predict that it will \n     continue to be a growing trend in the United States. Sex \n     determination is always a necessary step to the procurement \n     of a sex-selection abortion.\n       (4) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion undertaken \n     for purposes of eliminating an unborn child based on the sex \n     or gender of the child. Sex-selection abortion is barbaric, \n     and described by scholars and civil rights advocates as an \n     act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predicated on sex \n     discrimination. Sex-selection abortions are typically late-\n     term abortions performed in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of \n     pregnancy, after the unborn child has developed sufficiently \n     to feel pain. Substantial medical evidence proves that an \n     unborn child can experience pain at 20 weeks after \n     conception, and perhaps substantially earlier. By definition, \n     sex-selection abortions do not implicate the health of the \n     mother of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures \n     motivated by sex or gender bias.\n       (5) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions \n     performed in the United States and worldwide are \n     overwhelmingly female. The selective abortion of females is \n     female infanticide, the intentional killing of unborn \n     females, due to the preference for male offspring or ``son \n     preference''. Son preference is reinforced by the low value \n     associated, by some segments of the world community, with \n     female offspring. Those segments tend to regard female \n     offspring as financial burdens to a family over their \n     lifetime due to their perceived inability to earn or provide \n     financially for the family unit as can a male. In addition, \n     due to social and legal convention, female offspring are less \n     likely to carry on the family name. ``Son preference'' is one \n     of the most evident manifestations of sex or gender \n     discrimination in any society, undermining female equality, \n     and fueling the elimination of females' right to exist in \n     instances of sex-selection abortion.\n       (6) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by \n     United States law or the laws of 47 States. Sex-selection \n     abortions are performed in the United States. In a March 2008 \n     report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy \n     of Sciences, Columbia University economists Douglas Almond \n     and Lena Edlund examined the sex ratio of United States-born \n     children and found ``evidence of sex selection, most likely \n     at the prenatal stage''. The data revealed obvious ``son \n     preference'' in the form of unnatural sex-ratio imbalances \n     within certain segments of the United States population, \n     primarily those segments tracing their ethnic or cultural \n     origins to countries where sex-selection abortion is \n     prevalent. The evidence strongly suggests that some Americans \n     are exercising sex-selection abortion practices within the \n     United States consistent with discriminatory practices common \n     to their country of origin, or the country to which they \n     trace their ancestry. While sex-selection abortions are more \n     common outside the United States, the evidence reveals that \n     female feticide is also occurring in the United States.\n       (7) The American public supports a prohibition of sex-\n     selection abortion. In a March 2006 Zogby International poll, \n     86 percent of Americans agreed that sex-selection abortion \n     should be illegal, yet only 3 States proscribe sex-selection \n     abortion.\n       (8) Despite the failure of the United States to proscribe \n     sex-selection abortion, the United States Congress has \n     expressed repeatedly, through Congressional resolution, \n     strong condemnation of policies promoting sex-selection \n     abortion in the ``Communist Government of China''. Likewise, \n     at the 2007 United Nation's Annual Meeting of the Commission \n     on the Status of Women, 51st Session, the United States \n     delegation spearheaded a resolution calling on countries to \n     condemn sex-selective abortion, a policy directly \n     contradictory to the permissiveness of current United States \n     law, which places no restriction on the practice of sex-\n     selection abortion. The United Nations Commission on the \n     Status of Women has urged governments of all nations ``to \n     take necessary measures to prevent . . . prenatal sex \n     selection''.\n       (9) A 1990 report by Harvard University economist Amartya \n     Sen, estimated that more than 100 million women were \n     ``demographically missing'' from the world as early as 1990 \n     due to sexist practices, including sex-selection abortion. \n     Many experts believe sex-selection abortion is the primary \n     cause. Current estimates of women missing from the world \n     range in the hundreds of millions.\n       (10) Countries with longstanding experience with sex-\n     selection abortion such as the Republic of India, the United \n     Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China, have enacted \n     restrictions on sex-selection, and have steadily continued to \n     strengthen prohibitions and penalties. The United States, by \n     contrast,\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n     has no law in place to restrict sex-selection abortion, \n     establishing the United States as affording less protection \n     from sex-based feticide than the Republic of India or the \n     People's Republic of China, whose recent practices of sex-\n     selection abortion were vehemently and repeatedly condemned \n     by United States congressional resolutions and by the United \n     States Ambassador to the Commission on the Status of Women. \n     Public statements from within the medical community reveal \n     that citizens of other countries come to the United States \n     for sex-selection procedures that would be criminal in their \n     country of origin. Because the United States permits abortion \n     on the basis of sex, the United States may effectively \n     function as a ``safe haven'' for those who seek to have \n     American physicians do what would otherwise be criminal in \n     their home countries--a sex-selection abortion, most likely \n     late-term.\n       (11) The American medical community opposes sex-selection. \n     The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     commonly known as ``ACOG'', stated in its 2007 Ethics \n     Committee Opinion, Number 360, that sex-selection is \n     inappropriate because it ``ultimately supports sexist \n     practices''. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine \n     (commonly known as ``ASRM'') 2004 Ethics Committee Opinion on \n     sex-selection notes that central to the controversy of sex-\n     selection is the potential for ``inherent gender \n     discrimination, . . . the risk of psychological harm to sex-\n     selected offspring (i.e., by placing on them expectations \n     that are too high), . . . and reinforcement of gender bias in \n     society as a whole''. Embryo sex-selection, ASRM notes, \n     remains ``vulnerable to the judgment that no matter what its \n     basis, [the method] identifies gender as a reason to value \n     one person over another, and it supports socially constructed \n     stereotypes of what gender means''. In doing so, it not only \n     ``reinforces possibilities of unfair discrimination, but may \n     trivialize human reproduction by making it depend on the \n     selection of nonessential features of offspring''. The ASRM \n     ethics opinion continues, ``ongoing problems with the status \n     of women in the United States make it necessary to take \n     account of concerns for the impact of sex-selection on goals \n     of gender equality''. The American Association of Pro-Life \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization with \n     hundreds of members--many of whom are former abortionists--\n     makes the following declaration: ``Sex selection abortions \n     are more graphic examples of the damage that abortion \n     inflicts on women. In addition to increasing premature labor \n     in subsequent pregnancies, increasing suicide and major \n     depression, and increasing the risk of breast cancer in teens \n     who abort their first pregnancy and delay childbearing, sex \n     selection abortions are often targeted at fetuses simply \n     because the fetus is female. As physicians who care for both \n     the mother and her unborn child, the American Association of \n     Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists vigorously opposes \n     aborting fetuses because of their gender.''. The President's \n     Council on Bioethics published a Working Paper stating the \n     council's belief that society's respect for reproductive \n     freedom does not prohibit the regulation or prohibition of \n     ``sex control'', defined as the use of various medical \n     technologies to choose the sex of one's child. The \n     publication expresses concern that ``sex control might lead \n     to . . . dehumanization and a new eugenics''.\n       (12) Sex-selection abortion results in an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance. An unnatural sex-ratio imbalance is \n     undesirable, due to the inability of the numerically \n     predominant sex to find mates. Experts worldwide document \n     that a significant sex-ratio imbalance in which males \n     numerically predominate can be a cause of increased violence \n     and militancy within a society. Likewise, an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance gives rise to the commoditization of humans \n     in the form of human trafficking, and a consequent increase \n     in kidnapping and other violent crime.\n       (13) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing \n     the representation of women in the American population, and \n     therefore, the American electorate.\n       (14) Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex discrimination \n     and has no place in a civilized society.\n       (15) The history of the United States includes examples of \n     sex discrimination. The people of the United States \n     ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by \n     enacting a constitutional amendment correcting elements of \n     such discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex \n     discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have \n     suffrage guaranteed by the 19th amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States. The elimination of discriminatory \n     practices has been and is among the highest priorities and \n     greatest achievements of American history.\n       (16) Implicitly approving the discriminatory practice of \n     sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will \n     reinforce these inherently discriminatory practices, and \n     evidence a failure to protect a segment of certain unborn \n     americans because those unborn are of a sex that is \n     disfavored. Sex-selection abortions trivialize the value of \n     the unborn on the basis of sex, reinforcing sex \n     discrimination, and coarsening society to the humanity of all \n     vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly \n     difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a \n     compelling interest in acting--indeed it must act--to \n     prohibit sex-selection abortion.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress has power to prohibit sex selection abortions \n     under the Commerce Clause; section 5 of the 14th amendment, \n     including the power to enforce the prohibition on Government \n     action denying equal protection of the laws; and section 8 of \n     article I; and\n       (2) Congress should enact S. 138, the Prenatal \n     Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA), to amend chapter 13 of title \n     18, United States Code, to provide that whoever knowingly \n     performs an abortion knowing that such abortion is sought \n     based on the sex or gender of the child; uses force or the \n     threat of force to intentionally injure or intimidate any \n     person for the purpose of coercing a sex-selection abortion; \n     solicits or accepts funds for the performance of a sex-\n     selection abortion; or transports a woman into the United \n     States or across a State line for the purpose of obtaining a \n     sex-selection abortion; or who attempts to do any of these \n     things, may be fine or imprisoned up to five years under this \n     title; and to allow for civil action by a woman on whom such \n     an abortion was performed; provided, however, that nothing in \n     such Act shall be construed to require that a healthcare \n     provider has an affirmative duty to inquire as to the \n     motivation for the abortion, absent the healthcare provider \n     having knowledge or information that the abortion is being \n     sought based on the sex or gender of the child.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 333.

DIRECT SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Means-tested Direct Spending.--\n       (1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of \n     growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year \n     period preceding fiscal year 2014 is 6.7 percent.\n       (2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average \n     rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-\n     year period beginning with fiscal year 2014 is 6.2 percent \n     under current law.\n       (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent \n     resolution for means-tested direct spending:\n       (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic \n     president reformed welfare by limiting the duration of \n     benefits, giving States more control over the program, and \n     helping recipients find work. In the five years following \n     passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare caseloads fell, \n     and workers' wages increased. This budget applies the lessons \n     of welfare reform to both the Supplemental Nutrition \n     Assistance Program and Medicaid.\n       (B) For Medicaid, this budget converts the Federal share of \n     Medicaid spending into a flexible State allotment tailored to \n     meet each State's needs, indexed for inflation and population \n     growth. Such a reform would end the misguided one-size-fits-\n     all approach that has tied the hands of State governments. \n     Instead, each State would have the freedom and flexibility to \n     tailor a Medicaid program that fits the needs of its unique \n     population. Moreover, this budget repeals the Medicaid \n     expansions in the President's health care law, relieving \n     State governments of its crippling one-size-fits-all \n     enrollment mandates.\n       (C) For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, this \n     budget converts the program into a flexible State allotment \n     tailored to meet each State's needs, increases in the \n     Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan index and \n     beneficiary growth. Such a reform would provide incentives \n     for States to ensure dollars will go towards those who need \n     them most. Additionally, it requires that more stringent work \n     requirements and time limits apply under the program.\n       (b) Nonmeans-tested Direct Spending.--\n       (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate \n     of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year \n     period preceding fiscal year 2014 is 5.9 percent.\n       (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated \n     average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during \n     the 10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2014 is 5.3 \n     percent under current law.\n       (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent \n     resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:\n       (A) For Medicare, this budget advances policies to put \n     seniors, not the Federal Government, in control of their \n     health care decisions. Those in or near retirement will see \n     no changes, while future retirees would be given a choice of \n     private plans competing alongside the traditional fee-for-\n     service Medicare program. Medicare would provide a premium-\n     support payment either to pay for or offset the premium of \n     the plan chosen by the senior, depending on the plan's cost. \n     The Medicare premium-support payment would be adjusted so \n     that the sick would receive higher payments if their \n     conditions worsened; lower-income seniors would receive \n     additional assistance to help cover out-of-pocket costs; and \n     wealthier seniors would assume responsibility for a greater \n     share of their premiums. Putting seniors in charge of how \n     their health care dollars are spent will force providers to \n     compete against each other on price and quality. This market \n     competition will act as a real check on widespread waste and \n     skyrocketing health care costs.\n       (B) In keeping with a recommendation from the National \n     Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, this budget \n     calls for Federal employees--including Members of Congress \n     and congressional staff--to make greater contributions toward \n     their own retirement.\n\n                      TITLE VI--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT\n\n     SEC. 601. LIMITATION ON ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) The Veterans Health Care Budget and Reform Transparency \n     Act of 2009 provides advance appropriations for the following \n     veteran medical care accounts: Medical Services, Medical \n     Support and Compliance, and Medical Facilities.\n       (2) The President has yet to submit a budget request as \n     required under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code, including the request for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, for fiscal year 2014, hence the request\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\n     for veteran medical care advance appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2015 is unavailable as of the writing of this concurrent \n     resolution.\n       (3) This concurrent resolution reflects the most up-to-date \n     estimate on veterans' health care needs included in the \n     President's fiscal year 2013 request for fiscal year 2015.\n       (b) In General.--In the House, except as provided for in \n     subsection (c), any bill or joint resolution, or amendment \n     thereto or conference report thereon, making a general \n     appropriation or continuing appropriation may not provide for \n     advance appropriations.\n       (c) Exceptions.--An advance appropriation may be provided \n     for programs, projects, activities, or accounts referred to \n     in subsection (d)(1) or identified in the report to accompany \n     this concurrent resolution or the joint explanatory statement \n     of managers to accompany this concurrent resolution under the \n     heading ``Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations''.\n       (d) Limitations.--For fiscal year 2015, the aggregate level \n     of advance appropriations shall not exceed--\n       (1) $55,483,000,000 for the following programs in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs--\n       (A) Medical Services;\n       (B) Medical Support and Compliance; and\n       (C) Medical Facilities accounts of the Veterans Health \n     Administration; and\n       (2) $28,852,000,000 in new budget authority for all \n     programs identified pursuant to subsection (c).\n       (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``advance \n     appropriation'' means any new discretionary budget authority \n     provided in a bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto \n     or conference report thereon, making general appropriations \n     or any new discretionary budget authority provided in a bill \n     or joint resolution making continuing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2015.\n\n     SEC. 602. CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Upon the enactment of any bill or joint resolution \n     providing for a change in budgetary concepts or definitions, \n     the chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust any \n     allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this \n     concurrent resolution accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 603.

APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS \n                   AND AGGREGATES.\n\n       (a) Application.--Any adjustments of the allocations, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels made pursuant to \n     this concurrent resolution shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates included in \n     this concurrent resolution.\n       (c) Budget Compliance.--(1) The consideration of any bill \n     or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference \n     report thereon, for which the chair of the Committee on the \n     Budget makes adjustments or revisions in the allocations, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels of this concurrent \n     resolution shall not be subject to the points of order set \n     forth in clause 10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives or section 604.\n       (2) Section 314(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     shall not apply in the House of Representatives to any bill, \n     joint resolution, or amendment that provides new budget \n     authority for a fiscal year or to any conference report on \n     any such bill or resolution, if--\n       (A) the enactment of that bill or resolution;\n       (B) the adoption and enactment of that amendment; or\n       (C) the enactment of that bill or resolution in the form \n     recommended in that conference report;\n\n     would not cause the appropriate allocation of new budget \n     authority made pursuant to section 302(a) of such Act for \n     that fiscal year to be exceeded or the sum of the limits on \n     the security and non-security category in section 251A of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act as reduced \n     pursuant to such section.\n\n     SEC. 607. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) Costs of Federal housing loans and loan guarantees are \n     treated unequally in the budget. The Congressional Budget \n     Office uses fair-value accounting to measure the costs of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but determines the cost of other \n     Federal housing programs on the basis of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990 (``FCRA'').\n       (2) The fair-value accounting method uses discount rates \n     which incorporate the risk inherent to the type of liability \n     being estimated in addition to Treasury discount rates of the \n     proper maturity length. In contrast, cash-basis accounting \n     solely uses the discount rates of the Treasury, failing to \n     incorporate risks such as prepayment and default risk.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the $635 \n     billion of loans and loan guarantees issued in 2013 alone \n     would generate budgetary savings of $45 billion over their \n     lifetime using FCRA accounting. However, these same loans and \n     loan guarantees would have a lifetime cost of $11 billion \n     under fair-value methodology.\n       (4) The majority of loans and guarantees issued in 2013 \n     would show deficit reduction of $9.1 billion under FCRA \n     methodology, but would increase the deficit by $4.7 billion \n     using fair-value accounting.\n       (b) Fair Value Estimates.--Upon the request of the chair or \n     ranking member of the\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\n     Committee on the Budget, any estimate prepared by the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office for a measure \n     under the terms of title V of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, ``credit reform'', as a supplement to such estimate \n     shall, to the extent practicable, also provide an estimate of \n     the current actual or estimated market values representing \n     the ``fair value'' of assets and liabilities affected by such \n     measure.\n       (c) Fair Value Estimates for Housing Programs.--Whenever \n     the Director of the Congressional Budget Office prepares an \n     estimate pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 of the costs which would be incurred in carrying \n     out any bill or joint resolution and if the Director \n     determines that such bill or joint resolution has a cost \n     related to a housing or residential mortgage program under \n     the FCRA, then the Director shall also provide an estimate of \n     the current actual or estimated market values representing \n     the ``fair value'' of assets and liabilities affected by the \n     provisions of such bill or joint resolution that result in \n     such cost.\n       (d) Enforcement.--If the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office provides an estimate pursuant to subsection (b) \n     or (c), the chair of the Committee on the Budget may use such \n     estimate to determine compliance with the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 and other budgetary enforcement controls.\n\n     SEC. 608.

SEPARATE ALLOCATION FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY \n                   OPERATIONS/GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Allocation.--In the House, there shall be a separate \n     allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for overseas \n     contingency operations/global war on terrorism. For purposes \n     of enforcing such separate allocation under section 302(f) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the ``first fiscal \n     year'' and the ``total of fiscal years'' shall be deemed to \n     refer to fiscal year 2014. Such separate allocation shall be \n     the exclusive allocation for overseas contingency operations/\n     global war on terrorism under section 302(a) of such Act. \n     Section 302(c) of such Act shall not apply to such separate \n     allocation. The Committee on Appropriations may provide \n     suballocations of such separate allocation under section \n     302(b) of such Act. Spending that counts toward the \n     allocation established by this section shall be designated \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (b) Adjustment.--In the House, for purposes of subsection \n     (a) for fiscal year 2014, no adjustment shall be made under \n     section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 if any \n     adjustment would be made under section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of \n     the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985.\n\n     SEC. 610. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The House adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n     Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part \n     of the rules of the House of Representatives, and these rules \n     shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent with other such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the House of Representatives to change those rules at any \n     time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the \n     case of any other rule of the House of Representatives.\n\n                      TITLE VII--POLICY STATEMENTS\n\n     SEC. 701. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB \n                   CREATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) Although the U.S. economy technically emerged from \n     recession roughly four years ago, the recovery has felt more \n     like a malaise than a rebound with the unemployment rate \n     still elevated and real economic growth essentially flat in \n     the final quarter of 2012.\n       (2) The enormous build-up of Government debt in the past \n     four years has worsened the already unsustainable course of \n     Federal finances and is an increasing drag on the U.S. \n     economy.\n       (3) During the recession and early stages of recovery, the \n     Government took a variety of measures to try to boost \n     economic activity. Despite the fact that these stimulus \n     measures added over $1 trillion to the debt, the economy \n     continues to perform at a sub-par trend.\n       (4) Investors and businesses make decisions on a forward-\n     looking basis. They know that today's large debt levels are \n     simply tomorrow's tax hikes, interest rate increases, or \n     inflation - and they act accordingly. It is this debt \n     overhang, and the uncertainty it generates, that is weighing \n     on U.S. growth, investment, and job creation.\n       (5) Economists have found that the key to jump-starting \n     U.S. economic growth and job creation is tangible action to \n     rein in the growth of Government spending with the aim of \n     getting debt under control.\n       (6) Stanford economist John Taylor has concluded that \n     reducing Government spending now would ``reduce the threats \n     of higher taxes, higher interest rates and a fiscal crisis'', \n     and would therefore provide an immediate stimulus to the \n     economy.\n       (7) Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has stated that \n     putting in place a credible plan to reduce future deficits \n     ``would not only enhance economic performance in the long \n     run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to \n     lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and \n     business confidence.''\n       (8) Lowering spending would boost market confidence and \n     lessen uncertainty, leading to a spark in economic expansion, \n     job creation, and higher wages and income.\n       (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--It is the \n     policy of this resolution to promote faster economic growth \n     and job creation. By putting the budget on a sustainable \n     path, this resolution ends the debt-fueled uncertainty \n     holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code put \n     American businesses and workers in a better position to \n     compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This \n     resolution targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that \n     stack the deck in favor of special interests. All of the \n     reforms in this resolution serve as means to the larger end \n     of growing the economy and expanding opportunity for all \n     Americans.\n\n     SEC. 702. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and \n     promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The U.S. tax \n     code fails on all three counts - it is notoriously complex, \n     patently unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code's \n     complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, \n     which leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less \n     job creation.\n       (2) Since 2001 alone, there have been more than 3,250 \n     changes to the code. Many of the major changes over the years \n     have involved carving out special preferences, exclusions, or \n     deductions for various activities or groups. These loopholes \n     add up to more than $1 trillion per year and make the code \n     unfair, inefficient, and very complex.\n       (3) These tax preferences are disproportionately used by \n     upper-income individuals. For instance, the top 1 percent of \n     taxpayers reap about 3 times as much benefit from special tax \n     credits and deductions (excluding refundable credits) than \n     the middle class and 13 times as much benefit than the lowest \n     income quintile.\n       (4) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the \n     code end up narrowing the tax base by as much as 50 percent. \n     A narrow tax base, in turn, requires much higher tax rates to \n     raise a given amount of revenue.\n       (5) The National Taxpayer Advocate reports that taxpayers \n     spent 6.1 billion hours in 2012 complying with tax \n     requirements.\n       (6) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax \n     rates dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which \n     reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic \n     output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher \n     marginal tax rates.\n       (7) Roughly half of U.S. active business income and half of \n     private sector employment are derived from business entities \n     (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole \n     proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, \n     meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the \n     individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate \n     structure rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses \n     in particular tend to choose this form for Federal tax \n     purposes, and the top Federal rate on such small business \n     income reaches 44.6 percent. For these reasons, sound \n     economic policy requires lowering marginal rates on these \n     pass-through entities.\n       (8) The U.S. corporate income tax rate (including Federal, \n     State, and local taxes) sums to just over 39 percent, the \n     highest rate in the industrialized world. The total Federal \n     marginal tax rate on corporate income now reaches 55 percent, \n     when including the shareholder-level tax on dividends and \n     capital gains. Tax rates this high suppress wages and \n     discourage investment and job creation, distort business \n     activity, and put American businesses at a competitive \n     disadvantage with foreign competitors.\n       (9) By deterring potential investment, the U.S. corporate \n     tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The U.S. tax \n     rate differential with other countries also fosters a variety \n     of complicated multinational corporate behaviors intended to \n     avoid the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base \n     offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate \n     revenue.\n       (10) The ``worldwide'' structure of U.S. international \n     taxation essentially taxes earnings of U.S. firms twice, \n     putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage with \n     competitors with more competitive international tax systems.\n       (11) Reforming the U.S. tax code to a more competitive \n     international system would boost the competitiveness of U.S. \n     companies operating abroad and it would also greatly reduce \n     tax avoidance.\n       (12) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through \n     lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors \n     in diminished returns.\n       (13) Revenues have averaged 18 percent of the economy \n     throughout modern American\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\n     history. Revenues rise above this level under current law to \n     19.1 percent of the economy, and - if the spending restraints \n     in this budget are enacted - this level is sufficient to fund \n     Government operations over time.\n       (14) Attempting to raise revenue through tax increases to \n     meet out-of-control spending would sink the economy.\n       (15) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not \n     constitute fundamental tax reform.\n       (16) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate \n     loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the \n     board - not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Tax \n     reform should be revenue-neutral and should not be an excuse \n     to raise taxes on the American people.\n       (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this \n     resolution that Congress should enact legislation during \n     fiscal year 2014 that provides for a comprehensive reform of \n     the U.S. tax code to promote economic growth, create American \n     jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, \n     investors, and workers through revenue-neutral fundamental \n     tax reform, which should be reported by the Committee on Ways \n     and Means to the House not later than December 31, 2013, \n     that--\n       (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American \n     families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and \n     resources necessary to comply with tax laws;\n       (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals, with a \n     goal of achieving a top individual rate of 25 percent and \n     consolidating the current seven individual income tax \n     brackets into two brackets with a first bracket of 10 \n     percent;\n       (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;\n       (4) reduces the corporate tax rate to 25 percent; and\n       (5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system \n     of international taxation.\n\n     SEC. 703. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for \n     their health security.\n       (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended \n     that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed \n     soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of \n     Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in \n     or near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office--\n       (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in \n     2023 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; and\n       (B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the economy \n     and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a rate of 6.2 \n     percent per year, and under the Congressional Budget Office's \n     alternative fiscal scenario, direct spending on Medicare is \n     projected to exceed 7 percent of GDP by 2040 and reach 13 \n     percent of GDP by 2085.\n       (3) The President's health care law created a new Federal \n     agency called the Independent Payment Advisory Board \n     (``IPAB'') empowered with unilateral authority to cut \n     Medicare spending. As a result of that law--\n       (A) IPAB will be tasked with keeping the Medicare per \n     capita growth below a Medicare per capita target growth rate. \n     Prior to 2018, the target growth rate is based on the five-\n     year average of overall inflation and medical inflation. \n     Beginning in 2018, the target growth rate will be the five-\n     year average increase in the nominal Gross Domestic Product \n     (GDP) plus one percentage point;\n       (B) the fifteen unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of \n     IPAB will make decisions that will reduce seniors access to \n     care;\n       (C) the nonpartisan Office of the Medicare Chief Actuary \n     estimates that the provider cuts already contained in the \n     Affordable Care Act will force 15 percent of hospitals, \n     skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies to close \n     in 2019; and\n       (D) additional cuts from the IPAB board will force even \n     more health care providers to close their doors, and the \n     Board should be repealed.\n       (4) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of \n     American seniors without adequate health security and younger \n     generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending \n     levels that cannot be sustained.\n       (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this \n     resolution to protect those in or near retirement from any \n     disruptions to their Medicare benefits and offer future \n     beneficiaries the same health care options available to \n     Members of Congress.\n       (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the \n     Medicare program such that:\n       (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or \n     near retirement.\n       (2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, \n     Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and \n     a selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which \n     recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.\n       (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as \n     an option.\n       (4) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-\n     income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.\n       (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the \n     Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.\n\n     SEC. 704. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with \n     disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since \n     enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the \n     ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes \n     employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.\n       (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly \n     recommended that Social Security's long-term financial \n     challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the \n     financial condition of Social Security becomes more \n     precarious and the threat to seniors and those receiving \n     Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced:\n       (A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be \n     exhausted and program revenues will be unable to pay \n     scheduled benefits.\n       (B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and \n     Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program \n     revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.\n       (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2033, \n     benefits will be cut 25 percent across the board, devastating \n     those currently in or near retirement and those who rely on \n     Social Security the most.\n       (3) The recession and continued low economic growth have \n     exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. \n     The most recent CBO projections find that Social Security \n     will run cash deficits of $1.319 trillion over the next 10 \n     years.\n       (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a \n     larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, \n     reforms should take into consideration the need to protect \n     lower-income Americans' retirement security.\n       (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential \n     income safety net for those with disabilities and their \n     families. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \n     between 1970 and 2012, the number of people receiving \n     disability benefits (both disabled workers and their \n     dependent family members) has increased by over 300 percent \n     from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase is not \n     due strictly to population growth or decreases in health. \n     David Autor and Mark Duggan have found that the increase in \n     individuals on disability does not reflect a decrease in \n     self-reported health. CBO attributes program growth to \n     changes in demographics, changes in the composition of the \n     labor force and compensation, as well as Federal policies.\n       (6) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on \n     the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face \n     benefit cuts of up to 25 percent in 2016, devastating \n     individuals who need assistance the most.\n       (7) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, \n     and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It \n     is critical that bipartisan action be taken to address the \n     looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this \n     resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions \n     by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security \n     remains a critical part of the safety net.\n       (b) Policy Statement on Social Security.--It is the policy \n     of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan \n     basis to make Social Security sustainably solvent. This \n     resolution assumes reform of a current law trigger, such \n     that:\n       (1) If in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report \n     determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social \n     Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of \n     the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in \n     deficit, the Board of Trustees shall, no later than September \n     30 of the same calendar year, submit to the President \n     recommendations for statutory reforms necessary to achieve a \n     positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive annual \n     balance in the 75th-year. Recommendations provided to the \n     President must be agreed upon by both Public Trustees of the \n     Board of Trustees.\n       (2) Not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in \n     which the Board of Trustees submit their recommendations, the \n     President shall promptly submit implementing legislation to \n     both Houses of Congress including his recommendations \n     necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and \n     a positive annual balance in the 75th year. The Majority \n     Leader of the Senate and the Majority Leader of the House \n     shall introduce the President's legislation upon receipt.\n       (3) Within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, \n     the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has \n     been referred shall report the bill which shall be considered \n     by the full House or Senate under expedited procedures.\n       (4) Legislation submitted by the President shall--\n       (A) protect those in or near retirement;\n       (B) preserve the safety net for those who count on Social \n     Security the most, including those with disabilities and \n     survivors;\n       (C) improve fairness for participants;\n       (D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty for, future \n     generations; and\n       (E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance program \n     while addressing the needs of those with disabilities today \n     and improving the determination process.\n\n     SEC. 705. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABILITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, \n     and wage growth.\n       (2) More than 21 million students are enrolled in American \n     colleges and universities.\n       (3) Over the last decade, tuition and fees have been \n     growing at an unsustainable rate.\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\n     Between the 2001-2002 Academic Year and the 2011-2012 \n     Academic Year:\n       (A) Published tuition and fees for in-State students at \n     public four-year colleges and universities increased at an \n     average rate of 5.6 percent per year beyond the rate of \n     general inflation.\n       (B) Published tuition and fees for in-State students at \n     public two-year colleges and universities increased at an \n     average rate of 3.8 percent per year beyond the rate of \n     general inflation.\n       (C) Published tuition and fees for in-State students at \n     private four-year colleges and universities increased at an \n     average rate of 2.6 percent per year beyond the rate of \n     general inflation.\n       (4) Over that same period, Federal financial aid has \n     increased 140 percent beyond the rate of general inflation.\n       (5) This spending has failed to make college more \n     affordable.\n       (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama \n     noted that, ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing \n     tuition; we'll run out of money.''\n       (7) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition \n     with ever-increasing debt. According to the Federal Reserve \n     Bank of New York, student debt nearly tripled between 2004 \n     and 2012, and now stands at nearly $1 trillion. Student debt \n     now has the second largest balance after mortgage debt.\n       (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and too many \n     fail to complete college or end up defaulting on these loans \n     due to their debt burden and a weak economy and job market.\n       (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Pell Grant Program will face a fiscal shortfall \n     beginning in fiscal year 2015 and continuing in each \n     subsequent year in the current budget window.\n       (10) Failing to address these problems will jeopardize \n     access and affordability to higher education for America's \n     young people.\n       (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--It is the \n     policy of this resolution to address the root drivers of \n     tuition inflation, by--\n       (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need;\n       (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to make them \n     more effective;\n       (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level at \n     $5,645 in each year of the budget window; and\n       (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that \n     act to restrict flexibility and innovative teaching, \n     particularly as it relates to non-traditional models such as \n     online coursework and competency-based learning.\n\n     SEC. 706. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE \n                   CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) According to the last available estimate from the \n     Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies were \n     expected to hold $698 billion in unobligated balances at the \n     close of fiscal year 2013.\n       (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending \n     made available by Congress that remains available for \n     expenditure beyond the fiscal year for which they are \n     provided.\n       (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it \n     remains available for obligation indefinitely.\n       (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n     1974 requires the Office of Management and Budget to make \n     funds available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the \n     Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated \n     funds unless approved by an act of Congress.\n       (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review \n     and identify potential savings from unneeded balances of \n     funds.\n       (b) Policy Statement on Deficit Reduction Through the \n     Cancellation of Unobligated Balances.--Congressional \n     committees shall through their oversight activities identify \n     and achieve savings through the cancellation or rescission of \n     unobligated balances that neither abrogate contractual \n     obligations of the Government nor reduce or disrupt Federal \n     commitments under programs such as Social Security, veterans' \n     affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance \n     the national debt.\n       (c) Deficit Reduction.--Congress, with the assistance of \n     the Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, \n     and other appropriate agencies should make it a high priority \n     to review unobligated balances and identify savings for \n     deficit reduction.\n\n     SEC. 707. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF \n                   TAXPAYER DOLLARS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) The House of Representatives cut budgets for Members of \n     Congress, House committees, and leadership offices by 5 \n     percent in 2011 and an additional 6.4 percent in 2012.\n       (2) The House of Representatives achieved savings of $36.5 \n     million over three years by consolidating House operations \n     and renegotiating contracts.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of this resolution that:\n       (1) The House of Representatives must be a model for the \n     responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources and therefore \n     must identify any savings that can be achieved through \n     greater productivity and efficiency gains in the operation \n     and maintenance of House services and resources like \n     printing, conferences, utilities, telecommunications, \n     furniture, grounds maintenance, postage, and rent. This \n     should include a review of policies and procedures for \n     acquisition of goods and services to eliminate any \n     unnecessary spending. The Committee on House Administration \n     should review the policies pertaining to the services \n     provided to Members and committees of the House, and should \n     identify ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the operation \n     of the House gym, barber shop, salon, and the House dining \n     room.\n       (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class \n     airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 708. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE \n                   REDUCTION OF UNNECESSARY AND WASTEFUL SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:\n       (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') is \n     required by law to identify examples of waste, duplication, \n     and overlap in Federal programs, and has so identified dozens \n     of such examples.\n       (2) In testimony before the Committee on Oversight and \n     Government Reform, the Comptroller General has stated that \n     addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in \n     Federal programs ``could potentially save tens of billions of \n     dollars.''\n       (3) In 2011 and 2012, the Government Accountability Office \n     issued reports showing excessive duplication and redundancy \n     in Federal programs including--\n       (A) 209 ``Science, Technology, Engineering, and \n     Mathematics'' (``STEM'') education programs in 13 different \n     Federal agencies at a cost of $3 billion annually;\n       (B) 200 separate Department of Justice crime prevention and \n     victim services grant programs with an annual cost of $3.9 \n     billion in 2010;\n       (C) 20 different Federal entities administer 160 housing \n     programs and other forms of Federal assistance for housing \n     with a total cost of $170 billion in 2010;\n       (D) 17 separate Homeland Security preparedness grant \n     programs that spent $37 billion between fiscal year 2011 and \n     2012;\n       (E) 13 programs, 3 tax benefits, and one loan program to \n     reduce diesel emissions; and\n       (F) 94 different initiatives run by 11 different agencies \n     to encourage ``green building'' in the private sector.\n       (4) The Federal Government spends about $80 billion each \n     year for information technology. GAO has identified broad \n     acquisition failures, waste, and unnecessary duplication in \n     the Government's information technology infrastructure. \n     Experts have estimated that eliminating these problems could \n     save 25 percent - or $20 billion - of the Government's annual \n     information technology budget.\n       (5) Federal agencies reported an estimated $108 billion in \n     improper payments in fiscal year 2012.\n       (6) Under clause 2 of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least \n     one hearing during each 120 day period following its \n     establishment on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in \n     Government programs.\n       (7) According to the Congressional Budget Office, by fiscal \n     year 2014, 42 laws will expire, possibly resulting in $685 \n     billion in unauthorized appropriations. Timely \n     reauthorizations of these laws would ensure assessments of \n     program justification and effectiveness.\n       (8) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of \n     Federal Government programs should result in programmatic \n     changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding \n     levels.\n       (b) Policy Statement on Deficit Reduction Through the \n     Reduction of Unnecessary and Wasteful Spending.--Each \n     authorizing committee annually shall include in its Views and \n     Estimates letter required under section 301(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 recommendations to the \n     Committee on the Budget of programs within the jurisdiction \n     of such committee whose funding should be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n\n     SEC. 709. POLICY STATEMENT ON UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING.\n\n       It is the policy of this resolution that the committees of \n     jurisdiction should review all unauthorized programs funded \n     through annual appropriations to determine if the programs \n     are operating efficiently and effectively. Committees should \n     reauthorize those programs that in the committees' judgment \n     should continue to receive funding.\n\n               TITLE VIII--SENSE OF THE HOUSE PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 801. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD \n                   SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of the House that--\n       (1) additional legislative action is needed to ensure that \n     States have the necessary resources to collect all child \n     support that is owed to families and to allow them to pass \n     100 percent of support on to families without financial \n     penalty; and\n       (2) when 100 percent of child support payments are passed \n     to the child, rather than administrative expenses, program \n     integrity is improved and child support participation \n     increases.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 434.
