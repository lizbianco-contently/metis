I move to proceed to Calendar No. 124, S. 1238, Senator \nReed's student loan bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1238) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     to extend the current reduced interest rate for undergraduate \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 1 year, to modify required \n     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following my remarks and those of my \nRepublican counterpart, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided \nand controlled, with the majority controlling the first half and the \nRepublicans controlling the final half.\n  At 11 a.m. the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider \nthe nomination of Jennifer Dorsey to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Nevada. At noon there will be a rollcall vote on \nconfirmation of the Dorsey nomination. I would add that the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee has asked that we hold that vote open until \n12:30 p.m. today because they are having a confirmation hearing on the \nnew Director of the FBI, Mr. Comey. We will do that, and the vote will \nend at 12:30 p.m. rather than 12:15 p.m. or 12:20 p.m.\n  Following that vote, the Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 \np.m. for our weekly caucus meetings.\n  In America, this great country of ours, a quality education is the \nsurest path to the American dream. When I was a boy, we always looked \nat that American dream as getting a college education, which, from \nwhere I came from, wasn't going to happen very often. Now the American \ndream is more than just getting an associate's degree or a bachelor's \ndegree. It involves many other occupations, all of the things available \nin health care now, such as nursing, nursing assistants, all of the \ntechnicians, the people who do physical therapy--not physical \ntherapists but people who help doctors do what they need to do. We have \nprograms to become a physician's assistant. There are many programs \nthat are important to be able to fulfill that American dream. There are \nall different kinds of programs for computer training separate and \napart from getting a bachelor's degree. Those programs are extremely \nimportant. The reason they are important is we as Americans have \ndecided that with the cost of education skyrocketing as it is, students \nshould get some help, whether they are seeking a degree in engineering \nor getting into a program to begin some computer training to have jobs \nthey want for the rest of their lives.\n  College has never been more expensive and further out of reach for \nAmerican families. That is why it is critical that we keep interest \nrates low on Federal student loans so more promising students can \nrealize their dream of an education.\n  Last month Republicans rejected the Democrats' plan to freeze student \nloan interest rates at current levels for 2 years without adding a \npenny to the deficit. Because of this obstruction, loan rates doubled \non July 1, piling thousands of dollars more on debt that more than 7 \nmillion students owe. Republicans are instead pushing a plan to balance \nthe budget on the backs of struggling students. But if either the \nlegislation passed by House Republicans or the plan proposed by Senate \nRepublicans becomes law, student loan rates will more than double over \nthe\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nnext few years as interest rates increase.\n  Speaker Boehner says that the House has acted and now the ball is in \nthe Senate's court. We talked about that yesterday. What is he talking \nabout--they have acted and now we should act? I guess we could talk \nabout what they didn't do last year on the farm bill. I guess we could \ntalk about what they didn't do last year on post offices. I guess we \ncould talk about what they haven't done this year on the farm bill. We \ncould talk about what they haven't done that is so devastating to small \nbusinesses around America, and that is having people who are online and \ndon't build a single building, rent a single building--they get a \ndifferent rate of return than do those in brick-and-mortar buildings. \nThey do that because they don't have to pay sales tax. We could talk \nabout why the Speaker is refusing to take up something that is \nmeaningful.\n  As I say about this student loan issue--and I just had a meeting that \nended a few minutes ago--if you can explain to me why these proposals \nthe Republicans have are better than just having the rates double, \nplease do that. But they go into all these gyrations about whether it \nis a T-bill, overnight T-bill, or 30 days or 6 months or--all this \ncomplicated stuff, and it is factual. I met with someone from the White \nHouse. I said, OK, tell me what happens in 3 years. The response was, \noh, well, the rates will be above 6.8 percent. That is appalling. If \nsomeone can show me how all these programs they are coming up with are \nbetter than just letting things double, tell me.\n  We have a better proposal. Instead of pushing a plan to balance the \nbudget on the backs of struggling students, I think we should support a \nplan that would be better for students, not worse for students. I \nrepeat, we can't support a plan that would be worse for students than \ndoing nothing at all.\n  They have to take action. The rising price of higher education means \ntoo many young people are deferring higher education. I hear all the \nstories. College education used to be cheaper. Well, because of what \nhas happened here in Washington with the obstruction, we have to help \npeople. There has been less support of higher education from the \nStates. Tuition costs have risen significantly because of this. \nStudents need help. We have to take action. The rising price of higher \neducation means too many young people are deferring higher education, \nand it has saddled many who do get a degree with unsustainable debt--\ndebt that causes them to delay buying their first home, having \nchildren, or starting a business. Americans have more than $1 trillion \nin student loan debt. The average graduate owes more than $25,000. In \nfact, Americans have more student loan debt than credit card debt. They \nsimply can't afford to pile on even more.\n  We are going to continue to fight to keep the student loan rates low \nand hold back the rising price of education. Tomorrow the Senate will \nvote on whether to even begin debate on our plan to keep loan rates low \nfor an additional year.\n  I very much admire the work done by Senator Stabenow, the chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee. She is someone who is very effective in \nconveying a message. She has led the message for Democrats as to why we \nshouldn't let these rates double, and she will continue to do that.\n  As I indicated earlier, we made a proposal to keep rates where they \nare for 2 years. We have made changes to our proposal in an effort to \nmeet Republicans in the middle while protecting students. Our plan \nshortens the extension from 2 years to 1 year, and it doesn't add a \npenny to the debt.\n  I spoke with the chairman of the Finance Committee today. I said: \nMax, explain how we are paying for this. It is so simple. It is \ninherited IRAs, that people would pay after 5 years--they wouldn't get \nthe tax deduction after 5 years. What our program does is it closes \nthis obscure tax loophole that allows a few very wealthy individuals to \navoid paying taxes on inherited retirement accounts. This is why \nSenator Baucus came up with this as a pay-for.\n  So I hope Senate Republicans won't block a second commonsense plan in \ninvesting in our economy by keeping college affordable. We have reduced \nit to 1 year from 2 years. It would be great if we had a long-term \nsolution to this, but we can't do something that hurts students very \nquickly. Some have said: Well, it is going to be for a year or two, and \nthere will be lower interest rates. Yes, but after that it will be \n``Katy, bar the door.'' We all know interest rates are going to go up.\n\n\n                           Dorsey Nomination\n\n  Before the lunch, as I have indicated, we will consider the \nnomination of Jennifer Dorsey to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Nevada. She will be a valuable addition to the Federal \ncourt system. She is a Las Vegas native. Her father was stationed at \nNellis Air Force Base and after Vietnam decided that was where he \nwanted to make his home. He started his family there.\n  Ms. Dorsey graduated from Chaparral High School and graduated cum \nlaude from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She was also the first \nmember of her family to graduate from college. She served as a \ncongressional intern for my friend and former colleague Senator Richard \nBryan. She attended Pepperdine University School of Law, where she was \na member of the Pepperdine Law Review.\n  After graduation she returned to Las Vegas and excelled, first as an \nassociate and now as a partner, at the firm Kemp, Jones & Coulthard, a \nlongtime brave, proud Nevada law firm. She is the first and only female \npartner in that firm. She specialized in civil litigation, complex \ncommercial disputes, appeals, and class actions.\n  I am very impressed with her dedication to the State of Nevada, her \ncommunity, and the legal profession. She will make an outstanding \nFederal judge for Nevada. I look forward to her confirmation.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Standing for Democratic Rights\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Over the years we have seen repeated instances of \nindifference to the rule of law on the part of this administration. It \nis a consistent and worrisome path. The most recent example, of course, \nwas last week's announcement that the President had simply decided not \nto enforce a major piece of his health care law--that is, until after \nthe midterm election. What the President was saying in effect was that \nif he doesn't want to implement the law he has signed, he doesn't have \nto.\n  I agree it is a terrible law. I understand why people harmed by it \nwould want it changed. In fact, I think we ought to repeal it \naltogether and opt instead for real reforms that actually would lower \ncosts. But the fact is--for now, at least--it is the law and it is the \nPresident's constitutional duty to enforce the law. Yet, instead of \nfulfilling this basic duty of his office, the President seems to \nbelieve he gets to decide who is subject to the law. He gets to decide \nwho is subject to the law and who gets a pass. So last week businesses \nhad their ObamaCare sentences delayed. Maybe next week it will be some \nother group, but it is his call. He will decide what the law is. He did \nit with immigration, he did it with welfare work requirements, and he \ndid it with the NLRB when he took it upon himself to tell another \nbranch of government when it was in recess. He is doing it again with \nhis own signature health care law.\n  Imagine that the current occupant of the White House was not \nPresident Obama but a Republican. Imagine that. Pretend that this \nRepublican had come to office promising an era of inclusion and \naccountability, but as the years wore on he simply had grown tired of \nthe democratic process.\n  Imagine that this President, despite securing confirmation for nearly \nevery nominee he submitted, couldn't understand why the elected Senate \ndidn't simply rush them all through even quicker. He couldn't \nunderstand why Senators insisted on fulfilling their constitutional \nobligations to scrutinize each nominee.\n  Visualize for a moment that this President decided to urge Members of \nhis party to break the rules of the Senate so that he could appoint \nwhomever he wanted regardless of checks and balances. Imagine the \noutrage in the media, online, and especially on the other side of the \naisle. They would claim the President was a dictator. They would say he \nwas ripping the Constitution to shreds, basically everything they said \nfor so many years\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nabout President Bush. But, of course, President Obama isn't a \nRepublican, and so Washington Democrats seem just fine with it. In \nfact, it appears they are even ready to help this President--actually \nhelp him--in his partisan power grab.\n\n  I know Washington Democrats are getting a lot of pressure from big \nlabor bosses and from other far-left elements of their base to do this. \nThese folks have told Democrats it is time to pay up, and they do not \nhave much time for things such as the democratic process or the rule of \nlaw. They have raised a ton of money for the Democrats and now they \nwant the special interest treatment they believe is owed to them. That \nis why we see the other side cooking up phony nomination fights. They \nare cooking up a phony nomination fight because they want to go \nnuclear, but they know the facts simply aren't on their side to justify \ndoing so. They know their core argument, that President Obama's \nnominees are being treated less fairly than those of President Bush, is \nessentially at odds with reality. It is a complete fiction. They have \ngotten burned by the fact checkers already. President Obama's nominees \nfor Secretary of Transportation and Energy were unanimously confirmed. \nSecretary of State? Confirmed. Treasury? Confirmed. Interior, Defense, \nCommerce? Check, check, check.\n  Already in this Congress the Senate has approved 27 of President \nObama's lifetime appointments. That compares to just 10 at a comparable \nperiod in President Bush's second term. And, by the way, my party \ncontrolled the Senate at this point in President Bush's second term. He \ngot 10, President Obama has 27. In other words, President Obama has \njust settled back into office and already he has secured nearly three \ntimes--three times--more comparable judicial confirmations.\n  Look, to justify doing something as extreme as the left wants, you \nbetter be prepared to make a rock-solid case, and this is the best they \ncan come up with, that we need to change the rules of the Senate \nbecause big labor bosses say so; that the left should be allowed to \nfundamentally change our democracy because the President is only \ngetting nearly everything he wants--nearly everything he wants--rather \nthan everything he wants at the exact moment he wants it? Let's get \nreal here. This is not how a democracy functions.\n  If this were a Republican President and the shoe were on the other \nfoot, does anyone seriously believe Washington Democrats would be going \nalong with something so utterly preposterous? Of course not. Remember, \nthe current majority leader once said the nuclear option would ``ruin \nour country.'' That was said by the fellow who sits right over here, \nthe current majority leader of the Senate. And a former Senator from \nIllinois named Obama said if the Senate broke the rules to change the \nrules ``the fighting, the bitterness and the gridlock [would] only get \nworse.'' Boy, he was right about that.\n  What I am saying to President Obama and his friends on the far left \nis this: The facts show you are getting treated pretty darn well on \nnominations as it is. But if you would like more confirmed, if, for \ninstance, you want the Senate to confirm your nominees to the NLRB, \nthen don't send us nominees who have already been declared illegal by \nthe courts. We have already said that is not going to happen. You know \nyou can't look Americans in the eye and say you would vote for such a \nthing if you were in the minority so don't expect us to. But if you \nsend us fresh picks, we will happily give them a fair hearing, just as \nwe have been doing all along with all of the rest of the President's \nnominees. Almost all of them have been confirmed. Most have been \nconfirmed almost unanimously, because we in America know that \nmajorities of either party will never get absolutely everything they \nwant. That push and pull is the hallmark of a healthy democracy. And \none day--maybe not in the too-distant future--when our Democratic \nfriends in the majority are invariably returned to the minority, they \nwill thank us for standing up for those democratic rights.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each, with the majority controlling the first half.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today because tomorrow in the \nSenate Chamber we will vote on whether to let student interest rates \ndouble from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. This should not be \ncontroversial. This should have been done before July 1. Now we are \ntrying to retroactively fix this.\n  We have attempted to bring this to the floor and vote on it before on \na number of occasions. We have seen a Republican filibuster blocking us \nfrom doing that. This week I am hopeful we can get the necessary \nbipartisan vote to overcome the filibuster and be able to send a very \nstrong message to students across the country that we understand this \nis a huge issue for them and their families, a huge cost, and that \nraising the rates will only be another barrier to creating opportunity \nfor students in the future and, frankly, having a middle class in this \ncountry.\n  What is happening to the students and the debt involved is very \nserious, and it is stopping many young people from being able to move \nahead and achieve their dreams. At a time when interest rates for \neverything else are at historic lows, why in the world would we double \nthe interest rates for young people or older people going back to \nschool who are trying to get an education and the work skills they \nneed? Why would we allow that when we can get mortgage rates right now \nfrom 3\\1/2\\ to 4 percent or a car loan for about 4 percent? I could go \non and on.\n  Here is the shocking thing. If the rates are doubled--if in fact what \nkicked in on July 1 is allowed to stand--it will mean a huge profit for \nthe Federal Government. That also makes no sense. It will mean some $50 \nbillion for the Federal Government, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. Why should the government profit off the backs of \nstudents who are struggling to get an education so they can get ahead?\n  We have a fundamental disagreement in this body between the majority \nof Democrats and the majority of Republicans on that question. It is a \nfundamental difference about what we should pick as a priority for our \ncountry. Frankly, for nearly 300,000 students in Michigan who will be \nforced to pay an extra $1,000 on their loans this year, it makes no \nsense.\n  I remember growing up in a little town in northern Michigan, working \nhard, getting good grades in my small class of 93 people, being at the \ntop of the class, and wanting to go to college. But my dad became very \nill and we couldn't afford for me to go to school. I was the first one \nto get a college degree in my family. I managed to go to school because \nthe State of Michigan and the Federal Government at that time placed a \nvalue on educating kids like me, who didn't have a lot of money but had \nworked hard and had good grades and thought we ought to have a shot. I \nhad a tuition and fee scholarship, and so I was able to go to college.\n  I put that scholarship together with working on campus and with \nstudent loans and I was able to get a bachelor's degree. I was then \nable to go on and get a master's degree and came out of school having \nto pay off the student loans. But because some folks--who didn't know \nthis redheaded, freckle-faced kid from Clare--decided this was an \nimportant value for America, this was an important value for our State, \nI had a chance to work hard and follow the rules and make it. And who \nwould have thought then I would have the opportunity to be here today?\n  I want that same opportunity for every young person in Michigan and \nevery person going back to school in this country. Fundamentally that \nis what this is about. It is not about numbers. It is not about \nnumbers. It is about whether, when we subsidize all kinds of other \nthings--banks, and even the farmers I fight for, to help them with \ntheir crop insurance, and subsidizing rates for insurance to do things \nbecause it is good for the economy--why in the world would we walk\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\naway from that most basic set of values when it comes to our students?\n  Colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: Let's do something \nwhere we peg a rate. It is like a credit loan teaser rate. Sign up now \nat zero interest or 3 percent, let's put it there, and then over time \nit balloons like crazy and you are stuck. Those are the kinds of \nproposals we have gotten from the other side of the aisle. It sounds \ngood now, but it is horrible later. I know a lot of folks who signed up \nfor variable rate mortgages and balloon mortgages who ended up in the \nsame situation. We are saying: No, we want a fixed rate. We want it low \nand we want to make sure students are placed as a priority.\n  So after all kinds of negotiations, we have said: OK, you don't want \nto continue the rate for 2 years. Let's do this: Let's continue it for \n1 year at the low rate of 3.4 percent, and then let's all get together \nto figure out what to do about helping out with this $1 trillion in \nstudent loan debt right now. That is the student loan debt across this \ncountry. We need to help them figure out how to refinance that lower \nrate and then we can deal with the long-term cost. That is what we are \ntrying to do. It doesn't make sense, when student loan debt in the \ncountry is over $1 trillion, when students are already sacrificing and \nscraping together the money to get an education, to double the rates on \nthose student loans.\n  So when we look at this, we are looking not only at today but over \ntime. In every proposal that has been put forward--and there are a lot \nof folks working, and I know there are conversations going on with \nfolks who want to solve this problem--they all end up with the rates \ngoing up higher than even doubling the rate to 6.8. Why does that make \nany sense? Why would folks propose that? We have a fundamental \ndifference in how we view this issue of the cost of college and whether \nthere is a role for the Federal Government.\n  Do we as a country have a stake in keeping costs as low as possible, \ninterest rates as low as possible? I would argue, yes, we do. And if we \nwant to stop subsidizing things, I can think of a whole long list of \nwhat we could stop subsidizing. We could stop subsidizing the top five \nwealthiest oil companies in the country, which have more profits than \nanyone in the world. We could stop subsidizing them. We could stop the \nloopholes that are taking our jobs overseas. We could stop doing that. \nThere are a lot of things we could stop that would save money. We \nshould not put all this on the backs of students. We should not say \nthat somehow we should make a profit to pay down the debt on the backs \nof students, when in fact there are so many other areas where we should \nbe asking people to chip in a little bit more, not those who are \nalready working hard to get a basic education.\n  We know we have to have a comprehensive approach, but until that work \nis done we should keep interest rates low. We should keep them where \nthey are. And I have great confidence in Chairman Harkin and his \ncommittee, and Senator Jack Reed, who has taken so passionately the \nlead on this. Senator Kay Hagan and Senator Reed are our leaders on the \nbill we will be voting on tomorrow. Senator Warren, and so many \nothers--Senator Boxer I know has spoken out so many times, as has \nSenator Sanders, and on and on, as well as the Presiding Officer. We \nall care passionately about creating a long-term solution for students \nthat keeps costs low so we can keep dreams high and success high in \nachieving those dreams.\n  I wish to thank so many for signing petitions and sharing their \nstories with us. I would urge folks to get involved in the conversation \nby joining us on Twitter, with the hash tag ``don't double my rate.'' \nThere is a lot of conversation going on and information that folks can \nfind out about what we are doing.\n  I want to read two e-mails from constituents of mine. Corey, a \nstudent at Central Michigan University, sent me an e-mail about how \nthis would make it difficult for him to continue his education.\n\n       As one of the taxpayers that you represent, I am asking you \n     to please not allow my student loan rates to be doubled. I am \n     a hard-working and respectful student. I make all of my \n     payments. I go to class and do well. I work hard and am \n     grateful for the chance to get a higher education, but if \n     student loan rates go up I would be left to make a decision \n     whether or not school will be affordable.\n       From the time we first start learning, we are encouraged to \n     attend college and get a good job so that we can be a part of \n     helping this country grow. I am simply asking you to help \n     continue to make this an affordable option for me, and many \n     others like me.\n\n  That story can be replicated all across Michigan and all across the \ncountry: Will young people be able to stay in school? Will they be able \nto come out of school and get the job they want versus aiming for a job \nthat relates to their ability to pay back their student loans?\n  Then an e-mail from Matthew in Royal Oak:\n\n       Students are not asking for a bailout like the one that \n     Wall Street got, just an opportunity to obtain an affordable \n     education so we can compete in the global economy.\n\n  That is what this vote is about tomorrow. The Keep Student Loans \nAffordable Act simply says we are going to tackle this very serious \nissue for families across the country in two steps: keep the interest \nrates low where it is for a year, and then make a commitment to work \ntogether to fix the larger issue of the cost of college going forward.\n  I don't think there is a more important issue for the future of \nmaintaining or recreating a middle class in this country than making \nsure we can allow everyone who wants to go on to college and get the \nskills they need to be successful in tackling and meeting their dreams \nthan to make sure that college is affordable. A big piece of that is \nthe interest rate on the loans that millions of students are taking out \nright now and counting on us to make sure they are affordable.\n  Tomorrow the question will be whether a filibuster continues on this \nissue. I think folks probably scratch their heads. We had a majority of \npeople who voted--all Democrats--before to continue the interest rates \nat the current level of 3.4 percent. Because of the nature of the \nSenate and how things work, if there is an objection we have to go \nthrough this process to be able to overcome what is essentially a \nfilibuster and we have to get 60 votes. So tomorrow we are going to \nhave to get 60 votes, which means we need a handful of Republican \ncolleagues to join with us to make a statement that we should continue \ninterest rates at the low level while we work together in a bipartisan \nway to solve the long-term problem.\n  We have over $1 trillion in this country in student loan debt. It is \nmore than credit card debt. I was surprised to see that. We have to \nhelp families tackle that debt. I would like to see refinancing options \nwhen interest rates are so low, and many of those are much higher \ninterest rates. We need to tackle that. We need to tackle the overall \ncosts of going to college and what is happening for low-income students \nas well as middle-class students.\n  There is a lot to get done, but it has to start by doing no harm. And \nthat is the vote tomorrow: Do no harm. Let's make sure we at least keep \nthe rates low now. We know there is a philosophical difference about \nwhether we should actually help subsidize student loans. I think, of \nall the things we could subsidize, I would start with education.\n  Tomorrow the question is, Do we do no harm? Do we keep the interest \nrate where it is while we work out a long-term solution? Do we make a \nvery strong statement that if we are going to set something as a \npriority for this country, if we are going to outcompete and outeducate \nin a global economy, it has to start with making sure advanced higher \neducation is affordable for everyone who wants to work hard and play by \nthe rules and go to college?\n  That is what the fight is about. That is what the vote is about \ntomorrow. I hope we will have an overwhelming bipartisan vote. If not, \nwe are going to continue to do everything possible to tackle this issue \nbecause I think families across America are counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, over the July 4th recess I had the \nopportunity to talk with a number of young families about the crisis of \nstudent debt. Without exception, this is what they said: Please do not \ndouble the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans from 3.4 to 6.8 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\nPlease make college financing more affordable, not more expensive.\n  This is an issue which not only impacts millions of families, it \nimpacts our entire future as a nation and our economy. Right now, \nworking-class families all over this country are asking themselves a \nvery simple question: Does it make sense for them to go $40,000, \n$50,000, $100,000 in debt in order to get a college education? Many of \nthese young people and families are saying: No, it doesn't make sense.\n  So in a competitive global economy, we are saying to families all \nover this country that we do not want their kids to get a college \neducation. We don't want them to become doctors, nurses, \nbusinesspeople, scientists, and teachers. We don't want them to expand \ntheir intellectual capabilities and make us a competitive nation in \nthis highly competitive global economy.\n  Now, if that makes sense to somebody, it surely does not make sense \nto me. The doubling of student loan interest only makes an existing \ncrisis even worse. According to a report by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Agency, the total student loan debt in the United States now \nexceeds $1.1 trillion, which is nearly triple what it was in 2004. The \naverage loan balance for American graduates has increased by 70 percent \nsince 2004.\n  Average student debt is near $27,000. In Vermont, it is even higher--\nover $28,000.\n  The burden of student loans is making it much harder for young people \nto get mortgages and buy homes. Home ownership rates for young adults \nare among the lowest in decades. Young people are putting off marriage \nand having children partly because of the burden of student debt.\n  Over the last several months I have asked Vermonters--and people, in \nfact, all over the country--to send me their experiences, to tell me \nwhat this crushing debt of student loans means to their lives. We \nreceived over 700 responses from all over America. What I would like to \ndo is very briefly read to you some of the responses I received from \nthe State of Vermont.\n  Emily Decker from Colchester, VT writes:\n\n       Watching the interest eat away my savings every month is \n     hard to swallow. To the point where we are not saving any \n     money because we put anything extra toward my loans so we can \n     pay them back ASAP. This is putting our plans for having a \n     family on hold because we want to have our finances in better \n     order before doing so.\n\n  In other words, Emily writes they are hesitating having kids because \nthey can't afford to do so at the current time.\n  Andrew Craft from Burlington, VT writes:\n\n       I am a 25 year old full-time college student at Champlain \n     College. I am a single mother. I am already $20,000 in debt \n     and I still have one more year to go before I graduate. I am \n     currently at an internship working part-time on top of school \n     and parenting, but I often feel like I am not ever going to \n     be able to ``get ahead'' and ``make it'' in spite of my \n     advantages.\n\n  Allison LaFlamme from Johnson, VT writes:\n\n       I cannot refinance my house, because even though my cars, \n     home, and credit cards are perfect on my credit score our \n     debt to income is too high because of our student loans.\n\n  Melissa Weber from Rutland, VT writes:\n\n       I have found myself struggling to survive independently as \n     a 25 year old with a Master's Degree. Yes I have achieved a \n     degree, of which I am proud, but I have also accumulated an \n     immense amount of debt that will likely haunt me for the \n     majority of my life. As a result of my daunting loan payments \n     I find myself barely surviving on an income that should \n     easily support a small family.\n\n  Evan Champagne from St. Albans, VT writes:\n\n       My wife and I both have $50K-$60K of loan debt each. We \n     both have good jobs, but a large percentage of our income is \n     used to pay back student loans. There are no low interest \n     consolidation options available. If there were, that would \n     also help. The education process should be rewarding and \n     create opportunities. For my wife and I, it did the opposite.\n\n  The American people want us to come together and solve this problem \nnow, not make the situation worse. When we tell people who are \nstruggling with these horrendous debts that the Stafford subsidized \nloan rate is going to double and there are proposals out there that \nmake a bad situation worse, they respond in disbelief. They remember in \n2009 when Wall Street collapsed because of their greed and illegal \nbehavior, we bailed them out. They understand that today we are \nproviding large Wall Street institutions with interest rates of less \nthan 1 percent. They are asking: If you can bail out Wall Street--\npeople whose greed caused the current recession--how come you can't \nprotect working-class and middle-class families and enable their kids \nto get an affordable college education?\n  The Republicans in the House passed a proposal. Unfortunately, it is \na proposal which makes a bad situation worse. Under the House \nRepublicans' proposal, all student loans would have variable interest \nrates, exposing graduates to market conditions. Even though the House \nRepublicans' proposal caps interest rates, the Congressional Research \nService estimates that students who take out the maximum subsidized \nstudent loan amount will pay nearly $6,000 more over the life of that \nloan than they would if rates are kept where they are today.\n  The so-called bipartisan student loan bill being discussed in the \nSenate would also be a terrible deal for students, especially in the \ncoming years. It provides no cap to protect students for the first time \nin the history of the student loan program. If this proposal were to \npass, according to CBO projections of interest rates, by 2018 student \nloan rates will go up significantly.\n  Short term, we have to keep student loan interest rates at 3.4 \npercent. Long term, we need a national solution to make sure college is \naffordable for all Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, last week our Nation celebrated \nAmerica's Independence Day, and the Obama administration took advantage \nof the holiday to slip out a couple of announcements about its health \ncare law. The first one came late one day as the media and most of the \nNation were distracted by their plans for the Fourth of July. The \nadministration finally had to admit to all of America that their health \ncare law is unraveling before their eyes. Several months ago Senator \nBaucus predicted that the law was headed for what he called a train \nwreck, and last week we saw the train go off the rails. What happened \nwas the Treasury Department put out a blog post, written by an \nassistant secretary late in the day on July 2, that said it would \npostpone the implementation of the employer mandate part of the health \ncare law until 2015.\n  This was one of the signature parts of the President's health care \nlaw. Under the law, every employer with more than 50 people working 30 \nhours or more a week was going to have to offer expensive government-\nmandated health insurance. Now we have a 1-year delay of this extremely \nunpopular and damaging Washington mandate. Anytime you see the Obama \nadministration leak news like that late in the day right before a \nholiday with the President out of the country, you can bet it is bad \nnews for him and for them. Presidents do not delay things that are \npopular and that actually people want and like. When you see them try \nto hide it in a blog post, that is another sign. Here is what the New \nYork Times said, front page:\n\n       Crucial mandate delayed a year for health law.\n       Large companies won't need to offer plans until 2015. GOP \n     seizes on shift.\n\n  The Washington Post ran a headline, page 1:\n\n       Health-care rule is delayed a year. A setback for Obama \n     law.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       Health law penalties delayed.\n\n  The Obama administration has tried to hide its bad news, but it \nfailed. It also tried to spin the collapse of one of the law's most \nimportant features as good news. But as we see it here, Washington \nPost, ``A setback for Obama law.''\n  The Treasury Department's blog post claimed it was implementing the \nlaw ``in a careful, thoughtful manner.'' If they were interested in \ncareful and thoughtful, Washington Democrats never would have pushed \nthrough this reckless law in the first place, a law that many of them \nadmit they never even read. Using that much Washington spin when it \ntries to sneak out bad news is another sure-fire sign that\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nthe White House is trying to hide the train wreck. The President and \nhis supporters have been bragging about this part of the law for years. \nNow here they are quietly dropping it for a year and pretending things \nare going well for the law.\n  What does this announcement mean? First of all, this is a clear \nadmission that the President's health care law is unaffordable, \nunworkable, and unpopular. Second, it may be too late. Here is a \nheadline from CNN Money yesterday. They wrote:\n\n       For Fatburger and others, Obamacare delay came too late.\n\n  The article says for many small businesses such as fast-foot \nfranchises, they have already begun adjusting to the law's burdensome \nrequirements. One business owner said the delay won't help his \nemployees. He said:\n\n       All it's doing is causing confusion, anxiety, and the \n     workers are paying the price.\n       The workers are paying the price. Now the mandate's a \n     moving target. It's very, very challenging.\n\n  For a lot of businesses, the adjustments they had to make included \ncutting back workers' hours. Let's look at the latest employment \nnumbers released last Friday. In June, the number of people working \npart time--these are people who actually want to work more--soared by \nover 322,000. There are now 8.2 million Americans working part-time \njobs because their hours were cut back or because they could not find \nfull-time work. Republicans have been warning this would happen because \nof the Democrats' health care law and that is exactly what has been \nhappening for months now. The White House admitted as much when it said \nemployers needed relief from the logistical mess the law created.\n  If the law makes it so bad for businesses that they can't handle it \nin 2014, I will tell you it is still going to be bad for them in 2015. \nIf it is bad for employers, it is going to be bad for men and women on \nthe street, the hard workers of America. When do they get relief? Will \nthe administration now postpone the requirements that every man, woman, \nand child in America has to buy expensive government-mandated \ninsurance? I hope they do. You can bet labor unions and other special \ninterest groups are going to step up their lobbying to postpone the \nparts of the law that hurt them. Even the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nis asking for a waiver from portions of the law.\n  Let me be clear. I think it is a good thing for employers that they \nwill not have to face this job-killing mandate next year, but why \nshould they have to face it at all? Is the Obama administration finally \nseeing the light on what a disaster it will be to implement or is it \nanother gimmick? Well, as Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       They only come around on your side when they want to get \n     their hands on your wallet.\n\n  This 1-year postponement is not a real solution. It is not designed \nto help job creators or taxpayers. It is designed to delay the train \nwreck until after the 2014 elections. This 1-year postponement, in my \nopinion, is a cynical political ploy to try to fool the voters one more \ntime.\n  Don't just take my word for it, because CNBC asked Peter Orszag about \nit the other day. People know he headed President Obama's Office of \nManagement and Budget in the President's first term. He was a big \nproponent and supporter of the law. He told CNBC that White House \nofficials ``by definition,'' he said, thought that delaying the \nemployer mandate would help them politically ``or they wouldn't have \ndone it.''\n  ``By definition,'' therefore, they thought it would help them ``or \nthey wouldn't have done it.''\n  If they didn't expect it to help them politically, ``they wouldn't \nhave done it.'' That is an incredible admission by a member of the \nObama administration, his inside team. Just because the President \nthinks this is good for him politically doesn't mean it is good for \nthe country.\n\n  On Friday, the Obama administration also tried to sneak out another \nadmission that its health care law is not working. Remember, even \nthough employers have another year before their mandate kicks in, all \nthe people still have to buy expensive Washington-approved, Washington-\nmandated insurance and they have to do that by this upcoming January 1. \nTo try to hide some of the costs, taxpayers are going to subsidize the \nhigher premiums some people have to pay.\n  The Wall Street Journal just last Monday:\n\n       Insurance Costs Set For A Jolt. For the healthy, rates \n     could soar under new law.\n       Insurance Costs Set For A Jolt.\n\n  To try to hide some of the cost, taxpayers are going to subsidize the \nhigher premiums some people would have to pay, but the prices are going \nto go up so high subsidies may cover some but not all. If someone \nwanted the subsidy, the government, of course, will have to verify \nthose people deserve the subsidy.\n  Not anymore, because now, under the administration's new policy, \nburied away in 606 pages of regulations, on Friday, they said nobody is \ngoing to check those answers.\n\n       In an editorial yesterday, the Wall Street Journal called \n     these ``ObamaCare's liar subsidies.'' The paper agreed that \n     managing the law's rules and regulations was complicated:\n\n  ``Yet,'' the editors of the Wall Street Journal wrote, ``this is the \nsystem Democrats installed when they passed the law, which is not \nsupposed to be optional due to administrative incompetence.''\n  Administrative incompetence is exactly what this is. It is also a \nrecipe for rampant waste, fraud, and abuse. And it is an abuse in the \ntaxpayer subsidies.\n  I have criticized the complicated process the administration was \nsetting up to verify people's subsidy applications. That is because I \nthink it is a tremendous example of government overreach and because \nWashington bureaucrats at the IRS and other agencies have shown they \ncan't be trusted with that kind of information. The solution now, \napparently, is to scrap the verification system. We should be cutting \nthe cost of insurance. That is what people wanted. That is why we had \nhealth care reform, to get down the cost of care, not driving up the \ncosts, giving subsidies to a select few people and giving Washington \nmore power to watch over the whole system. The American people do not \nneed to put off the wreck until the train goes around one more bend. \nThey want to stop the train wreck from happening at all.\n  The American people want more than a temporary delay of one part of \nthis terrible health care law. They want a permanent repeal of the \nwhole thing. Now that the Obama administration has admitted its law is \ntoo complicated and would have too many negative side effects, it is \ntime for it to set aside the political games and do what is best for \nthe country. It is time to repeal this bad law and replace it with \nhealth care reform that will work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask my \nDemocratic colleagues to take another look at the student loan issue \nthat will be before us tomorrow. We are playing with real lives here. \nThese are about 11 million students who are going to college in the \nfall. They will be taking out 18 million loans for this year. Taxpayers \nwill be loaning them over $100 billion. The only proposal we are going \nto be voting on tomorrow appears to be one that will leave over 7 \nmillion middle-income college students swinging in the wind, paying \nabout twice as much in interest rates as they should be paying.\n  At the same time, we have a proposal that is based upon a \nrecommendation by President Obama that is like legislation already \npassed by the Republican House of Representatives that is supported by \nan Independent and two Democratic Senators and three Republican \nSenators that would lower student loan interest rates on every single \none of the 18 million new loans that would be taken out next year and \ncut nearly in half the interest rates on loans for undergraduate \nstudents, which make up two-thirds of the loans.\n  I ask the question, why would we do a 1-year political fix that only \nhelps students taking 40 percent of the loans, when we have before us a \nbipartisan proposal that is close to the idea of the\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\nPresident and the House that would help every single student, and \nespecially why would we do that when we leave middle-income students \ntwisting in the wind, paying hundreds of millions of dollars more in \ninterest rate than they should be paying over the next 10 years?\n  The student loan issue is becoming like what we call the doc fix, \nwhere Congress, for political reasons, every year rushes around and \nmakes a temporary patch. There is no need to do that here, no need \nwhatsoever.\n  I ask my friends on the Democratic side to look at what the President \nhas proposed and the reasoning behind it. It was in his budget. Look at \nwhat the House of Representatives has done. They actually passed a bill \nthat lowers rates. Then look at the proposal by Senator Manchin, \nSenator Carper, Senator King, Senator Burr, Senator Coburn, and myself \nin the Senate. What our proposal would do is provide a long-term \nsolution: if you are an undergraduate student at the University of \nTennessee, instead of your rate being 6.8 percent, it would be 3.66 \npercent. The Democratic proposal, I repeat, does nothing for over 7 \nmillion middle-income students who are going to be paying 6.8 percent \nwhen they should be paying, if they are undergraduates, 3.66 percent \nunder our proposal. That is nearly half as much. There is no need for \nthat.\n  This is like other political situations, we have some misinformation \ngoing back and forth across the aisle. I hope my colleagues will take a \nlook at the Burr-Manchin proposal. The right thing for us to do is to \nsay to these 10 million students, all of them, every single one of \nthem, that when you go to take out your 18 million loans this year you \nare going to be paying a rate that is fair to taxpayers and fair to \nstudents. It is fair to taxpayers because it will not be costing the \ngovernment any money and it is fair to students because the government \nwill not be making any money. It will not be reducing the deficit on \nthe back of the students. That is the principle upon which we can \nagree--fair to taxpayers, fair to students; doesn't cost the taxpayers, \ndoesn't balance the budget on the backs of students. On that basis we \ncan say to students: Take advantage of these low rates. You can get a \n10-year loan if you are an undergraduate at 3.66 percent. There is no \nneed to pretend we are helping students when the alternative proposal \nonly addresses 40 percent of the students. These are the subsidized \nloans. These are the loans for the low-income students, who already \nget, for the most part, Pell grants, who already have their interest \npaid while they are in school--that is a big subsidy. It is over $50 \nbillion in the next 10 years. We leave the middle-income students over \n7 million of them--over the next 10 years paying hundreds of millions \nof dollars they shouldn't be paying. I don't know why my friends on the \nother side want to leave the middle-income students of America twisting \nin the wind, paying higher interest rates than they should.\n\n  So let's step back and look at the facts. Let's look at the \nPresident's proposal, look at what the House passed, and look at the \nbipartisan Burr-Manchin proposal. I respectfully urge the majority \nleader to allow us to vote on that. I urge my colleagues on the other \nside to coalesce around that idea. Let's say to the students of \nAmerica: As the Senate, we know a good idea when we see one, and the \nBurr-Manchin proposal is such an idea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5537-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5537-S5543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JENNIFER A.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are here today because, unfortunately, \nthe financial burden on our Nation's college students dramatically \nspiked overnight 8 days ago, including for over 100,000 students across \nmy home State of Washington, where 56 percent of college graduates \nleave school with a student loan debt, and the average amount they owe \nis more than $22,000. Just when they are getting started on their \ncareers, instead of buying a house or buying a car or just paying the \nbills, their student loan bills are piling up with interest.\n  Now interest rates for Federal student loans, which have been kept at \na low rate of 3.4 percent, have doubled to 6.8 percent. For these \nstudents and for millions of students across the country, that is a tax \nhike of $1,000. That is not fair to students, and it is certainly not \ngood for our economy. Congress has to act to fix it.\n  This isn't just an abstract issue for me; it is very personal. Pell \ngrants and student loans were what allowed my six brothers and sisters \nand I to go to college after my dad got sick and had to leave his job. \nThey are what made college affordable, and they are what allowed each \none of us to pursue a career and give back to our communities. Because \nour government was there to help my family and help us through hard \ntimes, those seven kids in my family grew up to be a firefighter, a \nlawyer, a computer programmer, a sports writer, a homemaker, a middle \nschool teacher, and a Senator. In my book, that was a good investment \nby our country and our government.\n  My family's story is far from unique. In fact, last week I traveled \naround my home State of Washington listening to student after student \nafter student describe the real-life impact this rate hike would have \non them. Students such as Elizabeth from Vancouver, WA: She is a \nsophomore at the University of Washington. She comes from a family of \nfive children with immigrant parents who work hourly low-wage jobs.\n  She told me growing up, the idea of paying for college was \noverwhelming, but thanks to scholarships and grants and loans she is \nable to pursue her dream of becoming a broadcast journalist. However, \nher part-time work-study position barely covers her bills, and she says \nshe is constantly plagued by stress as she worries about how she is \never going to overcome what she calls her ``debt sentence.''\n  The reality is this is a simple issue. College is already too \nexpensive for students such as Elizabeth, and Congress shouldn't make \nit worse. So I am very proud to join my colleagues in supporting the \nKeep Student Loan Rates Affordable Act to extend the 3.4 percent \ninterest rate, and I urge our friends on the other side of the aisle to \njoin us and pass it.\n  With student loan debt now exceeding $1 trillion, students and their \nfamilies deserve due process and thoughtful consideration of issues \nsuch as financial aid. Students have already contributed billions to \ndeficit reduction, but the problem is the Senate Republican leadership \nhas insisted in all of their proposals that we balance the budget on \nthe backs of struggling students and their families. So far, they have \nrefused to put the interest of students and tomorrow's middle class \nahead of Tax Code spending that benefits the wealthy.\n  What they have introduced is a bill that includes no cap on how high \nstudent loan rates could go--something CBO tells us would mean students \ncould be locked in at rates over 8 percent in just a few short years. \nIn effect, it would be better to do absolutely nothing now than to take \nup and pass the Republican bill.\n  I bet everybody listening knows a family member or a coworker who is \nup to their neck in student debt. It is a weight that keeps them from \nhelping to grow our economy or start a family or take risks with their \ncareers, and it is a weight that is not easily shed.\n  We can't continue to do this to generation after generation of \ncollege students and expect to be able to compete in the 21st-century \neconomy. We have to do everything we can to remove barriers to \neducation, not erect new ones.\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n  The clock has run out. We need to act now because for millions of \nAmericans, affordable college has been the ticket to the middle class, \nand we can't allow it to slip away. We can't allow access to college to \nbecome unattainable for so many of our families.\n  I urge our Republican colleagues to join us in investing in America's \nfuture by reversing this student loan increase and making college more \naffordable for America's middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I stayed to hear the Senator \nfrom Washington speak because I think this highlights the issue. That \nis a terrific political speech, but it bears no resemblance to what is \nactually happening in the student loan debate.\n  The distinguished Senator from Washington talked about rates going \nup. Rates are going up for over 7 million--7 million--middle-income \nstudents in America who are going to be taking out loans this year, and \nthe Democratic proposal does nothing for them. Their proposal does \nnothing for them.\n  All the Democrats are trying to do is a political fix for 1 year for \nstudents taking out 40 percent of the loans who are already the \nbeneficiary of Pell grants, as she so ably expressed, who have their \ninterest paid while they are in college. These students are borrowing \nsubsidized loans. These students may receive a Pell grant of up to \n$5,550. They have their interest paid while they are in college. This \naccounting system used by the Congressional Budget Office is very \ngenerous to students as opposed to taxpayers, because it is done under \nthe Federal Credit Reporting Act, which is more generous to students, \nin this case, than taxpayers.\n  What about the over 7 million middle-income students who are just \nswinging in the wind under the Democratic proposal? It does nothing for \nthem.\n  On the other hand, we have the President of the United States, a \nDemocrat, and we have the House of Representatives, a majority of \nRepublicans, and they fundamentally agree on one idea: Let's have a \npermanent solution. Let's figure out what it costs the taxpayer to \nallow the government to issue loans--the government is lending over \n$100 billion a year--and loan it to the students at no profit--at no \nprofit--so the students can use it--all of them, not 40 percent of \nthem, not just low-income students but middle-income students as well--\nand all of them will have their rates lowered.\n  So what will the effect be? Their proposal would fix at 3.4 percent \nfor 1 year the student loan interest rate on 40 percent of the loans. \nOur bipartisan proposal would fundamentally--as does the President's \nproposal and the proposal passed by the House of Representatives--lower \nthe rate to 3.66 percent for all undergraduates. It would be not just \nfor the students borrowing 40 percent of the loans but for all middle-\nincome students and graduate students as well. Their rates would be \nlower than 6.8 percent.\n  What is good about a short-term political fix that makes middle-\nincome students and graduate students pay hundreds of millions of \ndollars more over the next 10 years? What is good about that? All it \ndoes is provide an opportunity to make a well-rehearsed political \nspeech about student loans.\n  We all want to encourage students to go to college. We are looking \nfor a way to give them some predictability and some certainty so \nstudents don't have to worry, when they graduate from Maryville High \nSchool in Tennessee where I went, that Congress isn't going to do its \njob. All the other side is going to do is stand up and make political \nspeeches that have nothing to do with the issue.\n  In this case, the President has done his job by recommending a long-\nterm solution. The Republican House of Representatives has done its \njob. It passed a long-term solution that lowers rates for everybody. A \ngroup of six Senators are doing our jobs. We have introduced a \nbipartisan proposal that reduces rates for everybody, and it is a long-\nterm solution, while a number of the Democratic Senators are playing \npolitical games. They are ignoring reality. They are going to freeze \nfor 10 years higher interest rates on loans for over 7 million--7 \nmillion--middle-income students across this country who are headed to \ncollege--rates that are nearly twice as high as the bipartisan proposal \nhere, which is fundamentally like the proposal by the President and the \nproposal by the House of Representatives.\n  What is the wisdom in that? I don't see it, and I don't think the \nstudents will see it.\n  As far as balancing the budget on the backs of students, the only \npeople around here who have done that are the Democrats when they \npassed the health care law. They put in that law a takeover of the \nFederal student loan program and, according to the CBO, they had an \namount of savings of $55 billion, and they used part of it to reduce \nthe debt.\n  So the CBO says these are savings because the Democrats took over \nstudent loans and the Democrats said they will use it to reduce the \ndebt, use it for the Pell grant program, and they used it to help pay \nfor the health care law. Every single year for the next several years, \nstudents are being overcharged to help pay for the health care law.\n  So if we want to get into a big political discussion about who is \novercharging students in order to reduce the deficit or pay for the \nhealth care law, we can have that. But that is not what we want to do. \nWe want a result, and we have suggested to the Senate--and I am going \nto say it one more time: Instead of a 40-percent political fix for 1 \nyear, we have suggested a long-term solution for 100 percent of the \nstudents. It reduces their rates. It cuts nearly in half the interest \nrate for every single undergraduate loan--every single one, which is \ntwo-thirds of the loans--and it is based on an idea that was in the \nPresident's budget, that has already been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, and that has been introduced by three on that side of \nthe aisle and three on this side of the aisle.\n  A Senate that is interested in a result instead of political \ngamesmanship would be sitting down and trying to work that out. That is \nwhat we want to do.\n  We can play games, too, I suppose. I can go get my statistics and \ncome back to the floor and say those over on the Democratic side, when \nthey passed the health care bill, did it on the backs of students. When \nthey balanced the budget--which they haven't done--they tried to do it \non the backs of students. And when they found some money for Pell \ngrants, they overcharged the students to whom they were loaning money. \nThat is true. I could do that, and I could say that, but I didn't come \nhere to spend all my time saying that. I came here to get results.\n  So this is not a game for 11 million students across this country. \nThey are trying to figure out how they are going to pay for college. \nJust as the Senator from Washington said, it is not easy to do. They \nexpect us to come here with our backgrounds and say: We are going to do \nthe best we can. Instead of making this similar to what we call the \ndoctors fix, where every year we play a little politics and add a \nlittle money to pay doctors who work with Medicare patients--that is a \nterrible thing to do, but we do it every year--and now we are going to \ntreat student loans in the same way. In a Presidential election year, \neverybody will make a big speech about it. Eleven million students will \nsit around wondering how they are going to pay for college, waiting for \nthe people in Washington to make a decision about that. We should not \nbe doing that.\n  We have great promise here. We have a President making a long-term \nsolution, the House of Representatives of a different party agreeing \nwith him, and six of us on both sides of the aisle proposing a solution \nthat is a permanent solution for 100 percent for the 11 million people \nwho will be borrowing over $100 billion this year.\n  Why would they on the other side of the aisle insist on a solution \nthat forces 7 million mostly middle-income students to pay 6.8 percent \nwhen they could be paying 3.66 percent? Why would you do that? Because \nyou have not thought about it, I think.\n  A lot has been going on. We have had an immigration debate and a \nnumber of other things, so maybe Senators have not taken a look at \nthat. I have. I have had a chance to do that. I have been the president \nof a university. I have been the Education Secretary. I know\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\nsomething about the student loan program. I did not like it when the \nFederal Government took it over. I admire our U.S. Secretary of \nEducation. I do not think he ought to be the banker of the year. I \nthink we have banks to make loans, but that is not the way it is. The \ntaxpayers now make all the government loans--over $100 billion a year.\n  Students are making their plans. They are going to be arriving at \ncolleges in August and September. We have a bipartisan proposal that \nwill lower interest rates for every single student taking out a student \nloan. Yet our friends on the other side want to leave middle-income \nstudents out of it, force them to pay twice as much as they should be \nin interest rates for the next 10 years. That makes no sense. We ought \nnot do that.\n  Tomorrow what we ought to do is pass the Burr-Manchin proposal that \nis supported on both sides of the aisle. To the extent it differs with \nthe President's proposal--which is very slight--and with the proposal \nof the House of Representatives--which is not much--we should then sit \ndown, work something out over the next 3 days, pass it and send it to \nthe President and go on to the next issue. Instead, we have political \nspeeches about how hard it is to go to college. We all know how hard it \nis to go to college. It is difficult to do. We all want to help. But if \nwe have a solution, we ought to adopt it.\n  I could play politics too. I know how. Every one of us in this room \nknows how, otherwise we would not be here. This is not a time for \nplaying politics. This is serious business; 11 million students getting \n18 million loans, $100 billion-plus from the American taxpayers. We \nhave a proposal before us that is fair to the taxpayers--it will not \ncost them any money--it is fair to the students--it does not balance \nthe budget or pay for the health care program or any other thing on the \nstudents' backs--and it gives students, many of whom who have no credit \nrating, no other way to get money, a chance to get several thousand \ndollars a year at one of the lowest possible rates available in the \ncountry. The proposal that is before the Senate that is bipartisan is a \npermanent solution. It says to the student going to the University of \nTennessee or Alaska or Minnesota: If you get a loan this year from the \ngovernment and you are an undergraduate, the interest rate is 3.66 \npercent. Your rate on that loan won't change. If you are a middle-\nincome student, the Democrats' plan says it is 6.8 percent, and they \nsay: Wait. Wait for what? Wait for rates to go up?\n  Why don't we establish this program for students at a time when rates \nare low? That is to their advantage. Let's have a permanent solution at \na time when rates are low. They may go up and, therefore, students may \npay more, but they will pay a lot less than they would in the private \nmarket. They will have a lot more certainty than if we just come around \nand play politics with this every year to try to gain some advantage \nwith this student group or that student group.\n  So we have an opportunity before us. The immigration bill passed \nbefore the recess. It showed a good deal of the ability of people on \nboth sides of the aisle to work together. We did that with the farm \nbill. We did that with the water resources bill. I would submit this is \n100 times easier than any of those bills.\n  When I went home to Tennessee before the Fourth of July recess, I \nsaid to somebody who asked me: We are that far apart and we have the \nPresident and the Republican House and a bipartisan group of Senators \nall in about the same place. This ought to be easy to do.\n  It is still easy to do, but I would implore my Senators to look at \nthe facts--those on the other side of the aisle--and realize I do not \nthink they want to go home and explain why they are leaving over 7 \nmillion middle-income students twisting in the wind, paying twice as \nmuch on interest rates for the next year as the proposal that they are \nabout to vote against tomorrow. I think that will be pretty hard to \nexplain, and I will bet there will be a lot of explaining to do if that \nis the end result.\n  So I pledge--as I have been working with Secretary Duncan, with the \nWhite House, with Democrats and Republicans--to try to get a result \nhere. I think we can still do it in the next few days. I would hope we \ncan have a vote on both proposals tomorrow. My guess would be both \nwould fail at this point, but at least that would show we are seriously \nworking toward a solution, and we can sit down and merge these small \ndifferences that exist between the bipartisan group here, the \nRepublican House, and the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the immigration bill \nwe passed a couple weeks ago. It was a significant achievement. I have \nalready congratulated all of those in the so-called Gang of 8 who put \ntogether the initial draft. It was an example of bipartisanship and \nrecognizing that the other fellow has a point of view--that you respect \nthat--and then you work out your differences. That was an example of \nthe Senate at its finest and what we ought to be doing on every piece \nof legislation around here.\n  The final result: 68 votes to 32 votes. Its prospects we know not \nwhat because of the different approach in the House and the inability \non so many things we have passed here to go to the conference committee \nto iron out the differences between the House and the Senate.\n  So I am very appreciative, and I have given my congratulations to all \nof those who have participated in that immigration bill.\n  There is a huge flaw. It is a huge flaw in not recognizing that when \nwe want to secure the border, as supposedly was done in order to gain \n14 Republican votes to get us to the huge vote of 68 votes for the \nbill, a major amount of money was added for border security. That is \nnot the flaw. Some may question the amount of money. Indeed, there was \n$6.5 billion in the initial Gang of 8 compromise for border security. \nBut when it came with the Corker-Hoeven amendment, there was $46.3 \nbillion more, of which over $44 billion was for border security. That \nis not what is the flaw, although one can argue it.\n  The flaw is that the amendment that was offered by the Senator from \nMississippi and me was not even allowed to be considered, which was to \nincrease not some $50-plus billion for border security--which was the \nland border--but to add a mere $1 billion for maritime security. That \nis the flaw. As a matter of fact, if you want border security, it is a \nfatal flaw. Why? You put up an impenetrable wall--whether it be a \nfence, an electric fence, an electronic fence, whether it be UAVs, more \nBorder Patrol agents--as a matter of fact, in the Corker-Hoeven \namendment, $30 billion of that additional border security was just for \nBorder Patrol agents--all of which is going to make it fairly effective \nin border security of not allowing people to pass, but it is the land \nborder.\n  So what is going to happen? You go right around the land border on \nthe maritime border.\n  It is either going to be on the west coast, on the Pacific, or it is \ngoing to be on the east coast, either the Gulf of Mexico and all the \nGulf States or the Atlantic, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin \nIslands. Because if someone can be smuggled into one of them and \ntherefore get an identity, then they have free access. Puerto Ricans \nare American citizens. They have free access to get to the rest of the \nUnited States.\n  So maritime security becomes paramount. But we could not get people \nhere who wanted to spend over $50 billion on border security, which is \nthe land border, which, in fact, is in the bill--they would not allow a \nRepublican Senator, Mr. Wicker, and me to add $1 billion for maritime \nsecurity.\n  Specifically, under our amendment, it would have addressed just that \npart of border security with regard to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. But if we want an effective border security, we have to then \nget into a whole host of things other than Customs and Border Patrol. \nWe have to get additional\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\nresources for the Coast Guard. We have to consider not only UAVs being \nflown by the Department of Homeland Security, through Customs, et \ncetera, over the maritime border, we have to put more Coast Guard out \nthere.\n  I would suggest a new platform that would be very effective would be \nwhat the Navy is testing right now, which is blimps. It is a very cost-\neffective, long dwell time, that gives enormous coverage at sea by one \nblimp. I have ridden in those blimps.\n  The Navy is testing them. I went with the Navy out of Fernandina \nBeach as they were doing the testing for Mayport Naval Station. It is \nincredible what you can do on the dwell time of a blimp. Of course, the \nfuel used is de minimus. The cost of an entire mission for a blimp, \nsome 24 hours of fuel, is the same as cranking up an F-16 taxing out to \nthe runway. That amount of energy, fuel spent is what would be spent on \na blimp for an entire 24-hour period as it is doing surveillance.\n  So if we are going to be sincere about border effectiveness, then, in \nfact, we are going to have to pay attention to the maritime border as \nwell as the land border. Why are Senator Wicker and I concerned about \nthis? He comes from a Gulf Coast State, Mississippi. I come from the \nState that has the longest coastline of any State save for the State of \nAlaska.\n  My State of Florida has over some 1,500 miles of coast. It is a place \nthat will be a haven for smugglers of people and drugs. If we think we \nare tightening border security by over $50 billion being applied to the \nland border, where are the smugglers going to go? They are going to go \nright around. It is just like water will flow and it will meet the \nplace of least resistance. It will continue to flow. So, too, will the \nsmugglers.\n  I wish to say I am disappointed that people on that side of the aisle \nwould not allow Senator Wicker's and my amendment to be considered in \nthe last minute. It obviously is not controversial. Yet, for whatever \nreason, it was denied. I hope as we proceed on the immigration bill--\nand I hope we are able to proceed if the House will act--I hope in the \nfinal product it will be considered and added so we can truly have a \nsecure border, a maritime border as well as a land border.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon we will be voting on a district \ncourt nominee. I rise in opposition to the nomination of Jennifer \nDorsey. That is for the U.S. district judgeship for the District of \nNevada. Before I outline the basis for my opposition, I wish to inform \nmy fellow Senators and the American public regarding facts on judicial \nnominations.\n  We continue to hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nabout how we are obstructing nominees or treating this President \ndifferently. Those complaints are without foundation. I will quantify \nmy answer to prove my point. There is no crisis in the manner in which \nwe are confirming nominees. This is all part of a larger strategy to \njustify breaking the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the \nSenate.\n  The fact is that after today the Senate will have confirmed 199 lower \ncourt nominees. We have defeated two. That is 199 to 2. Who can \ncomplain about that record? The success rate happens to be 99 percent \nfor the nominees sent by President Obama, considered on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  We have been doing it at a very fast pace as well. During the last \nCongress we confirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd \nCongress. That Congress sat from 1993 through 1994. This year we have \nalready confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term.\n  So far this year we have confirmed 27 judges. If confirmed today, Ms. \nDorsey will be the 28th confirmation this year. Let's compare this with \na similar stage, which would be President Bush's second term, when only \n10 judicial nominees had been confirmed. So we are now at a 28-to-10 \ncomparison, with President Obama clearly ahead of where President Bush \nwas. But somehow we are hearing complaints.\n  As I said, we have already confirmed more nominees this year, 28, \nthan we did during the entirety of the year 2005, the first year of \nPresident Bush's second term, when 21 lower court judges were \nconfirmed. After today only three article III judges remain on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar; two district nominees and one circuit \nnominee.\n  Yet we hear the same old story. Somehow our friends on the other side \nof the aisle, the Senate majority, the Senate Democrats, cite this as \nevidence of obstructionism. Compare that to June 2004, when 30 judicial \nnominations were on the calendar, 10 circuit, 20 district.\n  I do not recall any Senate Democrat complaining about how many \nnominations were piling up on the calendar, nor do I remember protests \nfrom my colleagues on the other side that judicial nominees were moving \ntoo slowly.\n  Some of those nominees had been reported out of committee more than 1 \nyear earlier and most were pending for months. Some of them never did \nget an up-or-down vote. The bottom line is that the Senate is \nprocessing the President's nominees exceptionally fairly. I do not know \nwhy that message cannot get through. It is an excuse to abuse the rules \nof the Senate to change the rules of the Senate.\n  President Obama certainly is being treated more fairly in the \nbeginning of his second term than Senate Democrats treated President \nBush in the first year of his last term in office. It is not clear to \nme how allowing more votes so far this year than President Bush got in \nan entire year amounts to ``unprecedented delays and obstruction.'' Yet \nthat is the complaint we hear over and over and over again from the \nother side.\n  I wanted to set the record straight. It is a sad commentary that I \nhave to spend so much time when figures speak for themselves. But I \nwill set the record straight again before we vote on the nomination of \nMs. Dorsey.\n  I have concerns with this particular nominee. I think all Members are \naware of the press accounts of campaign contributions which were made \nat the time this nomination was under consideration. We have not \nreceived a full explanation of what happened. Nevertheless, I am \nconcerned about the appearances of these contributions and how such \nactions might undermine the public confidence that our citizenry must \nhave in the judicial branch of our government.\n  I also have concerns about Ms. Dorsey's qualifications to be a \nFederal judge. She has no criminal law experience. She has participated \nin only six trials, one as a sole counsel, one as first chair, and four \nas second chair. I am concerned that her lack of experience will be a \nproblem when she gets to the bench.\n  It is not surprising to me that the American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave her a partial ``not \nqualified'' rating. I am also concerned with her understanding of the \nproper role of a judge.\n  While in law school, she wrote a note that praised the Justices who \nwrote Roe v. Wade. She praised them for the willingness to ``forge \nahead to create a just outcome without regard to the usual decisional \nrestraints.'' Then, she said, ``The majority made the just decision and \nthen forced history and stare decisis to fit that decision.''\n  Ms. Dorsey praised judges who made their decision--and I want to use \nher words--``without regard to the usual decisional restraints.'' Those \nwords are not the kind of words judges should be using. That is not the \nkind of judges we want, those who are activist judges who impose their \nown policy preferences rather than in following enacted law or \nprecedent.\n  What do we want? We want judges who will be restrained by precedent \nand by the laws Congress passes. Although Ms. Dorsey said she no longer \nsupports what she once wrote, I am unconvinced she will be able to lay \nher policy preferences aside when they conflict with what the law \ndictates she ought to do.\n  For all the reasons I mentioned above, I cannot support the nominee. \nI have two news articles that describe the campaign contribution issue \nI discussed earlier. I ask unanimous consent that those articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n            [From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, May 3, 2013]\n\n   Donations to Reid-connected PACs Legal, but Don't Seem Quite Right\n\n                         (By Jane Ann Morrison)\n\n       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn't break laws \n     when he asked Las Vegas attorney Will Kemp to donate to the \n     Senate Majority PAC to help elect Democrats in the 2012 \n     cycle.\n       The senator, a lawyer himself, knew Kemp and Robert Eglet \n     had won a huge verdict of $182 million from Teva \n     Pharmaceutical Industries in a case in which large vials of \n     Propofol were partially blamed for a hepatitis outbreak.\n       Kemp wasn't new to donating to Reid. He had been a donor to \n     Friends for Harry Reid in the past 2010 cycle and had given \n     $4,800. According to opensecrets.org, Kemp's largest donation \n     in the past three years was for $8,500 to the Democratic \n     Party of Nevada. And while he leaned Democratic, he also gave \n     to some Republicans.\n       However, ethical questions abound about whether Reid's \n     latest judicial nominee, Jennifer Dorsey, a partner in Jones, \n     Kemp and Coulthard, could have seen--or hoped to see--her \n     chances for an appointment enhanced by a series of \n     contributions from Kemp and his partner, J. Randall Jones.\n       It's the time line and the size of the amounts that are \n     creating that sewage smell.\n       Despite that, Reid said Friday he believed she would be \n     confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n       Check out what happened when:\n       October 2011: Kemp wins his big Teva case, not his first \n     big payday as a longtime trial attorney.\n       Jan. 9, 2012: Kemp donates $8,500 to the Democratic Party \n     of Nevada, generally considered the party designed to elect \n     Reid first and foremost and other Democrats as an \n     afterthought.\n       Sometime in January or February 2012, according to Kemp's \n     statements to political analyst Jon Ralston, Reid asks Kemp \n     and his partners to donate to the Senate Majority PAC. It's \n     unclear whether his donation to the party fell before or \n     after Reid's request. Kemp didn't return a call Friday to \n     clarify the time line.\n       March 31, 2012: Dorsey donates $2,500 to Friends for Harry \n     Reid.

He noted he had \n     known Kemp for decades. ``He's one of the finest trial \n     lawyers in the country, and that's not just hyperbole, that's \n     true.''\n       Reid went on to condemn the Citizens United decision in \n     January 2010, which allows unlimited corporate and labor \n     money in campaigns as independent expenditures. Reid called \n     it one of the four or five worst decisions in the history of \n     the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Reid said he abides by the rules and does not control the \n     Senate Majority PAC. He asked Kemp to donate, but PAC \n     officials dealt with the lawyer after that.\n       By my tally, based on the Open Secrets website, in 2012, \n     Kemp and Jones between them gave $150,000 to the Senate \n     Majority PAC and $28,500 to the Democratic Party of Nevada, \n     and Kemp gave an extra $2,500 to Friends of Reid, for a total \n     of $181,000.\n       In previous years, Kemp and Jones had given but not at that \n     level.\n       In 2010, Kemp gave Reid $4,800; Jones gave him $11,700. \n     Kind of a big jump from $16,500 to Friends for Reid in one \n     cycle to $181,000 to Reid, the Majority PAC and the \n     Democratic Party in the 2012 cycle.\n       That's a lot of Democratic lovin'. Especially for two \n     lawyers who also pony up for Republicans.\n       Reid mentioned the nearly $150 million that Las Vegas Sands \n     Corp. boss Sheldon Adelson had given to elect Republicans in \n     2012 and how a Rhode Island man made a federal judgeship \n     though he and his wife donated $700,000 to Democrats since \n     1993.\n       While $150,000 sounds like a lot to me, Reid said it's all \n     relative because the Senate Majority PAC raised more than $60 \n     million.\n       Reid must be conflicted. He competes successfully at \n     raising money, whether it's for his own campaign, the party \n     or various PACs. Yet he says, ``I think this whole campaign \n     finance thing has gotten way out of hand.''\n       Later he mused, ``It may not corrupt people, but it is \n     corrupting.''\n       Dorsey, 42, said she doesn't talk to reporters. But if she \n     knew her partners were donating all this money at the time \n     she was seeking a judgeship (and how could she not know), she \n     should have stopped it. But then she did donate $2,500 after \n     asking for the job. Maybe she thought it was expected. Or \n     maybe the judicial candidate's judgment about perception \n     isn't so keen.\n       When her partners had never donated in such large sums \n     before, it smacks of old-style payola. It may be legal, but \n     it's not right.\n       However, I suspect the canny Reid is correct, Dorsey will \n     get confirmed. Senators of both parties won't want to see \n     their own donations restricted as they themselves race for \n     the almighty dollar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From www.reviewjournal.com, Apr. 26, 2013]\n\n Judicial Nominee's Law Firm Gives $150,000 to PAC Linked to Harry Reid\n\n            (By Steve Tetreault, Stephens Washington Bureau)\n\n       Washington.--As U.S. Sen. Harry Reid was considering Las \n     Vegas attorney Jennifer Dorsey for a federal judgeship in \n     May, two senior partners at her law firm made $150,000 in \n     contributions to a political action committee associated with \n     the Nevada senator, records show.\n       While apparently legal, the donations were called \n     ``problematic'' by a legal expert, who said they could be \n     perceived as attempting to buy a judicial appointment as \n     Dorsey's confirmation is pending before the Senate.\n       Dorsey also made a personal contribution of $2,500 to \n     Reid's campaign committee in March 2012, shortly after they \n     initially spoke about her interest in becoming a federal \n     judge, according to Senate records. Reid returned that \n     contribution a month later, as he proceeded to check out her \n     credentials and experience as a litigator.\n       In June, Reid agreed to recommend Dorsey to the White House \n     for a post on the U.S. District Court, and she was nominated \n     by President Barack Obama in September.\n       Reid in a statement said Dorsey's ``academic background and \n     courtroom experience speak for themselves. She has great \n     respect from her peers and colleagues in Nevada and I am \n     confident she will serve the bench with distinction.''\n       As Dorsey was being vetted by Reid, senior partners at her \n     firm, Kemp, Jones & Coulthard, made contributions to Senate \n     Majority PAC, a super PAC created by former Reid strategists \n     to elect Democrats to the U.S. Senate. Reid, the Senate \n     majority leader, and other leading Democrats traveled \n     extensively last year to raise money for the PAC, which is \n     co-chaired by a former Reid chief of staff.\n       Founding partner Will Kemp made a $100,000 contribution on \n     May 1, 2012, according to campaign finance records. Founding \n     partner J. Randall Jones made a $50,000 contribution on May \n     14, 2012.\n       Reid declined comment on the firm's contributions to the \n     political action committee. His spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, \n     emphasized that Dorsey's personal contribution to Reid's \n     campaign was returned as the senator weighed her possible \n     nomination and wanted to avoid an appearance of conflict.\n       Dorsey did not respond to requests for comment Thursday and \n     Friday. A secretary at her office said the attorney usually \n     does not comment to reporters.\n       Neither Kemp nor Jones responded to calls or to email \n     queries made through their secretaries on Friday.\n       Lawyers making contributions to politicians and their \n     causes is commonplace. Nor is it unusual for lawyers to want \n     to see friends and legal partners ascend to the prestigious \n     federal bench.\n       It's when the two appear to mix that problems can arise, \n     legal experts said.\n       ``This feels problematic to me,'' said Charles Geyh, John \n     F. Kimberling professor of law who teaches and writes on \n     ethics at the University of Indiana Maurer School of Law. \n     ``There's no denying a perception problem here. Politically \n     it seems like a dangerous thing to undertake.''\n       Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the \n     University of Richmond, cautioned against jumping to \n     conclusions.\n       ``I can't draw a cause-and-effect relationship'' between \n     the partners' donations and Dorsey's nomination, said Tobias, \n     a former professor at the Boyd School of Law at the \n     University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ``I think people could ask \n     whether it appears that they were trying to promote one of \n     their partners. You'd like to have the answers to those \n     questions.''\n       Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., declined to comment on Friday. In \n     recent weeks he has declined comment on Dorsey's nomination, \n     saying he prefers to let the confirmation process move \n     forward before saying how he would vote.\n       This week Heller declined an invitation to appear at \n     Dorsey's confirmation hearing. Although Dorsey was nominated \n     in September, only last month did Heller return the customary \n     ``blue slip'' to the Senate Judiciary Committee, signalling \n     that he did not object to a confirmation hearing.\n       Heller and Reid clashed earlier over Clark County District \n     Judge Elissa Cadish, whom Reid had nominated to a federal \n     judgeship but whom Heller had blocked over a gun rights \n     dispute. Heller allowed Dorsey's nomination to proceed a few \n     weeks after Cadish withdrew her nomination, leading to \n     speculation that he and Reid had struck a deal.\n       Dorsey, who turned 42 on Friday, appeared Wednesday before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearing. \n     The Las Vegas native obtained degrees from UNLV\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\n     and Pepperdine University School of Law. She became a partner \n     at Kemp, Jones and Coulthard in 2004, where she has \n     specialized in complex civil litigation.\n       Dorsey answered questions about her experience and her \n     approach to the law posed by Sens. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, \n     Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Mike Lee, R-Utah. The senators \n     seemed satisfied with her performance, said Tobias, who \n     watched a webcast of the session.\n       Dorsey was introduced to the committee by Reid, who called \n     her a ``fine woman who will be a great addition to the bench \n     in Nevada. She has really a sterling reputation among her \n     peers.''\n       Reid said Dorsey's nomination was in line with his desire \n     to place more women on the federal bench. If confirmed, \n     Dorsey would join District Judges Miranda Du and Gloria \n     Navarro as Reid-backed Nevada federal court appointees.\n       In 1998, Reid backed attorney Johnnie Rawlinson for a \n     District Court judgeship in Nevada, and two years later \n     promoted her confirmation to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Dorsey has received a mixed rating from the American Bar \n     Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, a \n     15-member panel that rates federal judge nominees on \n     integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament, \n     and on a scale of ``well qualified,'' ``qualified'' and ``not \n     qualified.''\n       In Dorsey's case, the ABA said a ``substantial majority'' \n     (10-13 members) rated her ``qualified'' while a minority \n     rated her ``not qualified.''\n       Reid declined this week to comment on the rating, which \n     matched ratings for Du and Navarro when they were under \n     Senate consideration. He had made no secret of his disdain \n     for the ratings, which he said rely too heavily on prior \n     judicial service as opposed to ``real world'' qualifications.\n       In 2010, Reid said the examiners should ``get a new life \n     and start looking at people for how they are qualified and \n     not whether they have judicial experience.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to William M. ``Mo'' Cowan\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about my \nfriend who is leaving the Senate this week, Massachusetts Senator Mo \nCowan. I have to admit that when he first arrived I was excited because \nI was no longer going to be 100th in seniority. That job went to Mo, \nand I would be 99. However, quickly after he was sworn in, I realized \nhe was one of the nicest and smartest Members of this body. During his \nrecent farewell speech, Mo referred to me as the North Dakota sister he \nnever knew he had. I already have six siblings, but I would welcome him \ninto the Heitkamp family any day.\n  In all seriousness, Mo was an excellent addition to this body. After \nthe Boston massacre tragedy, he showed incredible leadership skills. He \nwas a source of guidance and comfort to countless folks from \nMassachusetts in the weeks and months that followed that horrific act \nof terrorism.\n  During his short tenure, Mo has distinguished himself in this body. \nFirst, Mo listens more than he talks. His acute observation skills have \nmade him a trusted adviser to many. Equally important, Mo's \nobservations are without judgment; rather, Mo listens and tries to \nunderstand how he can advance the issue and not judge the speaker's \nmotivations.\n  Mo is a serious thinker, always trying to find a path forward to \nresolve the important issues of our time. I can only imagine the \nimportant and great legislation Mo would have advanced if he had more \ntime here.\n  Although Mo is a serious guy, he also loves to laugh--mostly at his \nown expense. Mo's desk in the Senate was often the gathering site for \nmany freshman Senators because everyone was just a little happier and a \nlittle smarter after spending time with Mo.\n  Mo is also an extraordinarily humble human being--not the false \nmodesty of a seasoned politician but the humility that comes from a \ndeep faith and a lifetime of self-reflection. One should never mistake \nthat humility for a lack of self-confidence. Mo is very surefooted and \nanchored in the one great belief that his job is and always will be to \nmake the world a more just place for his sons and for all the children \nof our country.\n  So beyond the ritual of carving a name in a desk and his recorded \nrollcall votes on important issues like immigration, what will be Mo \nCowan's Senate legacy? History may mark his time here in a footnote, \nbut Mo's impact has been much greater. I cannot speak for others in \nthis body, but because I served with Mo Cowan, I will be a better \nSenator. I will listen more and talk less. I will always remember not \nto judge the motivations of others; instead, seek solutions with \nothers. I will redouble my efforts to make our great country a more \njust place for our children.\n  I will miss you, Senator Mo Cowan. You are a great Senator, but more \nimportantly, you are a wonderful and kind human being. Thank you for \nyour service to our country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Jennifer Dorsey to be a judge on the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Nevada.\n  Jennifer Dorsey has spent her entire legal career at the Las Vegas, \nNV firm of Kemp, Jones & Coulthard, LLP, where she has been partner for \nthe past 9 years. She has diverse experience in civil and criminal \nmatters, trial and appellate work, and State and Federal courts, and \nhas tried more than a dozen trials to verdict. The committee has heard \nfrom Judge Deanell Tacha, who was nominated by President Reagan to the \nTenth Circuit and is now the dean of Pepperdine University School of \nLaw, in support of Jennifer Dorsey. She wrote:\n\n       I am well acquainted with Ms. Dorsey and can say, with full \n     confidence, that she is an outstanding candidate for the \n     federal judiciary who would serve with great distinction . . \n     . She is a distinguished lawyer, a highly respected member of \n     her community, and a true servant of the public good.\n\n  Her qualifications notwithstanding, Jennifer Dorsey has been the \ntarget of a false controversy over political donations made by her law \nfirm colleagues. It is ironic that the same Senate Republicans who have \nfilibustered any attempt to regulate or scrutinize political donations, \nand who objected to my request during the Bush administration to \ninclude political campaign contributions by nominees in the committee \nquestionnaire, are now using donations by a nominee's colleagues to \nsmear the nominee. These donations that the ranking member claimed he \nwas concerned about were not even known to the nominee until they were \nreported in local newspapers. Ms. Dorsey has answered the ranking \nmember's questions on this issue under oath and I consider it settled. \nSenate Republicans did not ask such questions of President Bush's \nnominees, even nominees who themselves made donations to President Bush \nor their home State Republican Senators after they knew that they were \nbeing considered for a judgeship. Perhaps now Senate Republicans think \nwe should look at donations made by nominees' friends and neighbors?\n  This is just one more example of Senate Republicans playing games \nwith President Obama's judicial nominees, rather than actually looking \nat the nominees' records. False controversies about nominees like Paul \nWatford, Patty Schwartz, Andrew Hurwitz, Caitlin Halligan, and Jeffrey \nHelmick over who they represented, or who they clerked for, demean the \nconfirmation process.\n  Jennifer Dorsey is one of the 33 judicial nominees who needed to be \nrenominated this year. Unfortunately, the Senate is not able to \nconsider another district of Nevada nominee, Judge Elissa Cadish, whose \nnomination was withdrawn after the Republican Senator from Nevada \nrefused to return his blue slip on her nomination. The concern with \nJudge Cadish seemed to be that in 2008 she had accurately stated \nexisting Second Amendment jurisprudence. Judge Cadish was originally \nappointed to the Nevada bench by a Republican Governor, and in a 2011 \njudicial performance evaluation, conducted\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nby the Las Vegas Review-Journal, 88 percent of the lawyers who \nresponded said she should be retained on the bench, which was among the \nhighest of all judges evaluated. So I remain disappointed that her \nnomination was withdrawn and that the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate were not permitted to consider it, especially since the vacancy \nto which Judge Cadish was nominated is now a judicial emergency \nvacancy.\n  In addition to the 33 renominations at the start of this year, \nPresident Obama has nominated another 28 individuals to be circuit and \ndistrict judges this year, and has now had more nominees at this point \nin his presidency than his predecessor did at the same point. Senate \nRepublicans are nonetheless criticizing President Obama for making too \nfew nominations while protesting that the fact that many vacancies do \nnot have nominees cannot possibly be the fault of Senate Republicans. \nThese Senators are saying that they have no role in the process. Of \ncourse, only a few years ago, before President Obama had made a single \njudicial nomination, all Senate Republicans sent him a letter \nthreatening to filibuster his nominees if he did not consult Republican \nhome State Senators. They cannot have it both ways.\n  I take very seriously my responsibility to make recommendations when \nwe have vacancies in Vermont, whether the President is a Democrat or a \nRepublican, and other Senators should do the same. After all, if there \nare not enough judges in our home States, it is our own constituents \nwho suffer. It should be only a matter of weeks or months, not years, \nfor Senators to make recommendations. Republican Senators who demanded \nto be consulted on nominations should live up to their \nresponsibilities, and fulfill their constitutional obligation to advise \nthe President on nominations. They should follow the example of \nDemocratic Senators: the administration has received recommendations \nfor all current district vacancies in States represented by two \nDemocratic Senators. When Senate Republicans refuse to make \nrecommendations for nominees, and then delay votes on consensus \nnominees, they are not somehow hurting the President, they are hurting \nthe American people and our justice system.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \ntime be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jennifer A. Dorsey, of Nevada, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Nevada?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I wish to thank the Senator from Utah for graciously \nallowing me to proceed.\n  While the Republicans failed to join us in an effort to avert the \ndoubling of the interest rate on need-based student loans, there is \nstill time to act to make things right for students. On July 1, the \ninterest rate on subsidized Stafford loans doubled from 3.4 percent to \n6.8 percent. Instead of allowing us to take up a vote on an extension \nof the lower rate, the other side continues to push a so-called long-\nterm solution that would saddle students with even more debt in the \nfuture.\n  Students and advocates from across the country have been very clear. \nOn June 21, they wrote to Senate leadership, and in their words: ``A \nbad deal that is permanent for student borrowers is worse than no deal \nat all.''\n  We need time to work together to develop a good deal for students--\none that is comprehensive, one that touches not on just rates but on \nincentives to lower the costs of a college education and on ways in \nwhich students can refinance their existing debt and their future \ndebts. As we all understand, we have reached a point where student debt \nhas exceeded credit card debt. It is the second largest household \ndebt--$1 trillion--and it is saddling this generation and future \ngenerations with burdens they well might not be able to discharge.\n  In the meantime, at this moment, we should take up and pass the Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable Act which I have offered, along with Senator \nHagan and 41 of our colleagues, to ensure that students with the \ngreatest financial need do not see the interest rate on their loans \ndouble. Again, at the heart of our student lending program has been a \nspecial concern to allow young men and women with talent from low and \nmoderate incomes to go to college. That is why we created the \nsubsidized Stafford loan program. That is what we have to keep our \nfocus and emphasis on today. Forty-nine organizations representing \nstudents, educators, colleges and universities, and workers from across \nthe country have asked us to do this. These are the students, the \nuniversities, and the people who have most at stake and they are \ntelling us, again, that a bad deal is worse than no deal at all.\n  We should take a step back and remember why we offer student loans in \nthe first place. When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Higher \nEducation Act into law in 1965, he said: ``And it is a truism education \nis no longer a luxury. Education in this day and age is a necessity.''\n  His words are truer today than they were in 1965. According to \nGeorgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, we will \nfall 5 million\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\nshort of the workers with postsecondary credentials we will need by \n2020. We already know there is going to be a gap between the workers we \nneed with advanced degrees and the jobs available by 2020. Nearly two-\nthirds of new jobs will require a college degree or similar credential. \nSo by saddling this generation with additional costs and thereby \ninhibiting those who may well have the talent but not the resources to \ngo to college, we are going to create an even bigger divergence between \nthe demand for skilled workers and the talent Americans need to develop \nto fill those jobs.\n  President Johnson again referred to the Higher Education Act as a \npromise the Nation was making to its young people for generations to \ncome. The promise was that this Nation was not going to allow financial \nbarriers to keep willing and able young people from a college \neducation. But, today, that promise is at risk.\n  As I have indicated, the job market increasingly demands \npostsecondary education simply to achieve middle-class earnings. At the \nsame time, college is getting more and more expensive. As I said also, \nstudent loan debt is accelerating, second only to mortgage debt for \nAmerican households. This is going to have a huge impact on the overall \neconomy of this country. It is not going to be just individual students \nand families struggling. The Federal Reserve of New York and others \nhave reported that this debt is dragging down our economy especially \nfor young families as they try to establish themselves.\n  The primary tools in the Higher Education Act to help students pay \nfor college are grants, work study, and low-cost loans. The Pell grant, \nwhich I must say we are so proud of because it was authored and \nchampioned by our great Senator Claiborne Pell, is less and less able \nto fund a college education. In the 1970s, it covered a large part of \ntuition and fees for a year in college. Today, the percentage of costs \nit covers is shrinking, even as we try to expand it. As a result, more \nand more students have had to rely on loans, and that is why we have \nseen this huge explosion of debt.\n  Today, instead of aiding students with low-cost loans, the Federal \nGovernment, ironically, is reaping profits from these students. We have \nto change this.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that between now and 2023, \nstudent loans will generate $184 billion in revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. At a time when students are struggling and when they are \nseeing their debt explode, we are making money off of them--not \ninvesting in them but putting them under a huge financial burden.\n  As we seek to solve these complex problems, I think the most sensible \nand the wisest thing to do is to keep the subsidized loan rate at 3.4 \npercent and use the year to engage and successfully complete the \ncomplex task of looking at several different aspects of this problem.\n  However, we are blocked from doing so because our budget rules \nbasically require us to replace the revenue and the other side has been \nunwilling to consider revenue from other sources. We propose to offset \nthe cost by closing a tax loophole. We have to look carefully not only \nat what we will do to make the student loan programs cheaper and more \neffective for students but also how we will pay for it.\n  We also have to recognize that for many years our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have targeted some of these subsidized loans, \nwanting to make them more expensive. From the Contract With America in \nthe 1990s to the Ryan budgets, they have suggested things such as, for \nexample, eliminating the in-school interest subsidy on student loans. \nFor subsidized student loans, we pay the interest while the student is \nin college pursuing their educational goals, and they have suggested \neliminating that. These are some of the reasons why I think we have to \nbe skeptical of proposals that are being advanced in order to provide \nrelief for students.\n  The so-called Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act would add nearly \n$1 billion in additional revenues from student loans to the government \ncoffers. It may be a short-term fix, but it creates a much larger long-\nterm problem: The teaser rates in the first few years mask the uncapped \nrates students would face in the following decades.\n  This chart is very revealing. This demonstrates the undergraduate \nStafford loan interest rates under the so-called Bipartisan Student \nLoan Certainty Act. This green line is the graduate Stafford loan, and \nthis is the PLUS loan for parents. As we can see, they accelerate \ndramatically because of the 10-year Treasury bill rate chosen by \nsupporters of the other proposal and because of the likely increase in \nthat rate. It reaches the point here where interest rates exceed \ncurrent law in 2016. So by 2016, these loans will be much more \nexpensive. This is a classic case of enjoying 2 or 3 years of low \ninterest, but having to be prepared to pay a lot more for education in \nthe future. It is eerily reminiscent of those proposals to refinance \none's house with an adjustable rate uncapped mortgage and get rid of \nthat old-fashioned fixed rate which was so prevalent in the first \ndecade of the 2000s and which caused so much havoc, and still is \ncausing so much havoc.\n  CBO estimates that if we look from 2017 to 2023 alone, students will \npay $37.8 billion more under the so-called Bipartisan Student Loan \nCertainty Act.\n  Students are smart. They can figure it out. But I think there is \nsomething else we have to add to the mix. This chart shows an estimate \nof the rates that was made a few weeks ago on the previous chart. Here \nis the change in the daily yield for the 10-year T-note. This is the \nbenchmark rate. We can see where it begins on May 1 of 2013. It is \ngoing from about 1.6 percent all the way up to about 2.6 percent. This \nrate is rising dramatically. Why? Well, for one reason, the Federal \nReserve has indicated they are going to begin to taper off their \nquantitative easing program. One reason is as we see signs of growth in \nthe economy, interest rates will rise naturally. So what we could find \nis that this chart actually underestimates the potential growth in \ninterest rates and students could end up paying maybe much more.\n  In the Republican proposal, there is no cap on these rates.\n  They talk about the fact that there is a consolidation process, but \nthat consolidation process can only be entered into after a student has \ngone through school, begun repayment, accumulated interest at \nincreasing rates each year, and then, indeed, when a student goes into \nthe consolidation phase, all of the interest is capitalized and the \nloan is stretched out over many years, meaning they end up paying more. \nSo it is not a rate cap at all. Frankly, without a rate cap, I think we \nare exposing students and their families to vast uncertainty. In fact, \nthe only thing that seems to be certain is these rates are going up.\n  We have to approach this problem in a thoughtful way. That is why I \nintroduced the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act with Senator \nDurbin. It is a long-term proposal. It would base student loan interest \nrates on the actual cost of running the student loan programs--not on \narbitrary rate but the actual cost to the government--and it will \nprotect students by capping interest rates on each of the individual \nloan programs. Our proposal would, in effect, pass on the savings to \nstudents that the Federal Government accrues from the low cost of \nborrowing relative to other borrowers, our ability to absorb risk \nrelative to others, and the economies of scale for loan servicing for \nstudents across this country.\n  Additionally, by increasing in this legislation the loan limits on \nsubsidized loans, we will allow students of low and moderate income to \nreceive more help and not require them to borrow unsubsidized loans at \nhigher interest rates and, as a result, I think, help bring down the \nwhole cascading issue of student debt.\n  Finally, our legislation would provide relief to students with \noutstanding loans--that is upwards of $1 trillion nationally--by \nallowing them to refinance to a lower interest rate.\n  These are some of the key elements for a true long-term solution.\n  We also need to address the cost of college, which is going up \nastronomically. The institutions have to have a lot more at stake. They \nhave to be very careful that they are not only selecting well-qualified \nstudents, but also that they are preparing them for the workforce of \nthis century and that they can\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nhave certainty, and the students can have certainty, that the skills \nthey master in college will be rewarded with a job in our economy.\n  Finally, we have to establish a true Federal-State partnership. \nFederal grants and loans can't keep pace with these rising college \ncosts. We have to work with every level of government to try to address \nthese issues.\n  What I would suggest is that we work together. First, we extend the \n3.4-percent interest rate, then, consciously, deliberately, and \nexpeditiously, I hope, move forward to fix these complex issues, \nprotect our students, allow education to be once again the engine that \nmoves the country ahead, and allow every American, regardless of their \nwealth, to get aboard that train and go forward.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes each and that Senator Hatch be permitted \nto speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1270 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I take the floor today to follow up on \nwhat my good friend and colleague Senator Reed from Rhode Island just \nspoke about; that is, the looming interest rate hike on student loans \nthat is confronting us in this country.\n  To recap a little bit, in 2002 the Congress passed a fixed rate. We \nhad variable rates before, but it passed a fixed rate on student loans \nof 6.8 percent. In 2007 it was lowered. That lasted for about 5 years, \nand then it was going to go back up to the fixed rate of 6.8 percent \nlast year. The Congress passed a 1-year extension of that at 3.4 \npercent. It is that 1-year extension which expired on July 1 of this \nyear. So if the Congress does nothing, the interest rates go back up to \n6.8 percent.\n  In the midst of all of this, a lot of ideas have been floating around \nabout what to do on student loans and the interest rates. Well, I think \nwe have to keep in mind that if we go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, \nthat is a doubling. More than 7.2 million college students will be \nrequired to pay an average of $1,000 more in interest per loan if we \nlet it go back to 6.8 percent. Again, that is real money for our \nNation's students.\n  Student loan debt currently exceeds $1 trillion. It is second only to \nmortgage debt in the United States, and it is higher than credit card \ndebt. The average student now graduates with more than $26,000 in \nstudent loan debt. So now is really not the time to make them pay even \nmore.\n  Now, luckily, we again have a window of time to act before the \ndoubling causes any real harm. It doubled on July 1, but we had the \nFourth of July week, so if we were to again extend the 3.4 percent for \nanother year, it would do no harm. It would do no harm to anyone.\n  That is why I am urging my colleagues to support S. 1238, the Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable Act of 2013. This responsible, fully paid for \nlegislation, introduced by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Hagan, \nSenator Franken, myself, and many others, is a viable solution to \nkeeping student loan rates affordable for our middle-class students and \nfamilies struggling to afford college.\n  I might add that this bill is supported by 49 student, youth, \nconsumer, civil rights, and educational organizations across the \ncountry. Here is a letter they sent to Leader Reid and Senator \nMcConnell dated June 28 to support S. 1238. They said:\n\n       We applaud this bill, which creates a workable solution to \n     maintaining current low rates while Congress seeks to \n     reauthorize the Higher Education Act to reach a comprehensive \n     solution to the student loan crisis that is good for \n     students. We expect a vote on S. 1238 on July 10, 2013, \n     allowing the proposal to take effect in time to protect \n     incoming and returning students this fall.\n\n  That is what is happening tomorrow. Tomorrow we will vote on cloture \non this bill--cloture, so that then we can get an up-or-down vote on \nwhether we are going to extend the 3.4-percent interest rates until \nnext July. I will in a moment say why that is so important.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Many of the other proposals being discussed would result in \n     even higher costs to students than if interest rates were \n     simply allowed to double.\n\n  That is, to go to 6.8 percent.\n\n       The bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act put forth by \n     Senators Manchin, Burr, Coburn, Alexander, King and Carper \n     would drive up borrower costs by $1 billion and tie interest \n     rates to the market without a cap to protect students. This \n     proposal would pay down the deficit on the backs of students, \n     trading national debt for student debt. It is unacceptable to \n     use student loans as a vehicle for deficit reduction, \n     especially when the Federal Government is projected to make \n     $51 billion on student loans just this year.\n\n  So that will be the vote tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, along with the list of the \norganizations supporting the 1-year extension, be printed at this point \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 28, 2013.\n     Support S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of \n         2013.\n\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n      Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: We \n     the undersigned student, youth, consumer, civil rights and \n     education organizations urge you to support S. 1238, the Keep \n     Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013, put forth by Senators \n     Jack Reed (D-RI), Kay Hagan (D-NC) and 36 others, which will \n     keep interest rates low for millions of students going to \n     school this fall. If Congress fails to act by July 1, \n     interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford student loans \n     will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, and over 7 \n     million students across the country will see the cost of \n     college increase by $1,000 per student, per loan.\n       Considering the enormity of the student debt problem and \n     the significant number of students and borrowers impacted, it \n     is clear that we need a comprehensive overhaul of federal \n     student loan policy. However, with just 3 days left until the \n     deadline, it is unlikely that Congress can come to an \n     agreement on comprehensive reform that is better for student \n     loan borrowers than if the rate doubled to 6.8 percent.\n       We applaud this bill, which creates a workable solution to \n     maintain current low rates while Congress seeks to \n     reauthorize the Higher Education Act and to reach a \n     comprehensive solution to the student loan crisis that is \n     good for students. We expect a vote on S. 1238 on July 10, \n     2013, allowing the proposal to take effect in time to protect \n     incoming and returning students this fall.\n       Many of the other proposals being discussed would result in \n     even higher costs to students than if interest rates were \n     simply allowed to double. The Bipartisan Student Loan \n     Certainty Act put forth by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), \n     Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Lamar Alexander (R-\n     TN), Angus King (I-ME), and Tom Carper (D-DE), would drive up \n     borrower costs by $1 billion and tie interest rates to the \n     market without a cap to protect students. This proposal would \n     pay down the deficit on the backs of students, trading \n     national debt for student debt. It is unacceptable to use \n     student loans as a vehicle for deficit reduction, especially \n     when the federal government is projected to make $51 billion \n     on student loans this year alone.\n       We continue to advocate for a long-term, comprehensive \n     solution that ensures affordable rates for students. If \n     Congress cannot find an acceptable long-term solution before \n     students are forced to pay even more this fall, it must act \n     to prevent subsidized Stafford loan rates from doubling.\n           Sincerely,\n         All Education Matters; AFL-CIO; Institute for Asian \n           Pacific American Leadership & Advancement, AFL-CIO; \n           American Association of University Professors (AAUP); \n           American Association of University Women (AAUW); \n           American Federation of State, County, and Municipal \n           Employees; American Federation of Teachers; Asian \n           Pacific American Labor Alliance; Center for Responsible \n           Lending; Council for Opportunity in Education; \n           Democracy for America; Demos; Department for \n           Professional Employees, AFL-CIO; Generational Alliance; \n           Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities \n           (HACU); Leadership Conference for Civil and Human \n           Rights; League of United Latin American Citizens \n           (LULAC); Minnesota Public Interest Group (MNPIRG); \n           Minnesota State University Student Association; MoveOn; \n           National Association of State Student Grant and Aid \n           Programs (NASSGAP); National Council for LaRaza (NCLR); \n           National Education Association; National Federation of \n           Federal Employees.\n         National Priorities Project; National Urban League; New \n           Jersey Students\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\n           United; New York Public Interest Research Group \n           (NYPIRG); Oregon Student Association; Our Time; One \n           Wisconsin Now; Progress Now; Roosevelt Institute Campus \n           Network; Sierra Student Coalition; Student Debt Crisis; \n           The Education Trust; The Institute for College Access & \n           Success; The University of California Student \n           Association; UNCF; United Council of UW Students; \n           United States Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG); \n           United States Student Association (USSA); USAction; \n           Vote Mob; Working Families Organization; Rebuild the \n           Dream; Young Democrats of America; Young Invincibles; \n           YP4 Action.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is really the vote tomorrow. Are we going to keep \n3.4 percent or are we going to allow it to double? That is the essence \nof the vote tomorrow.\n  There are a lot of different ideas floating around here about what to \ndo and how to do this, but in just about every single case, every one \nof those bills, if you project out over the next couple of years, will \nraise interest rates higher than 6.8 percent. So, again, that is why \nextending it for 1 year is so important.\n  The proper place to address this issue is in the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act. That expires this year. Our committee will be \nhaving hearings. We have had some already. We are going to have more \nthis fall. We expect to be able to put together a reauthorization bill \nfor early next year. This is where it belongs. This is where the \nstudent loan provision belongs--in the Higher Education Act. Here is \nwhy. College affordability is more than just what your loans are \ncosting you; college affordability also has to do with the tuitions \nbeing charged by colleges. Why are the tuitions what they are? It also \nhas to do with the lack of transparency from one college to another. \nWhat do courses here cost? What do courses there cost?\n  What is built into that cost per course hour, for study hour at this \ncollege compared to this other college?\n  There are a lot of other costs that go into college affordability \nother than just the cost of student loans. So to separate out a student \nloan and treat it as some kind of a separate entity is to kind of \nignore all of the other things that affect the cost of college \neducation. That is why it really needs to be part of a comprehensive \nsolution, including Pell grants. Maybe we want to change some of the \nstructure of Pell grants. Maybe we want to take a look at exactly what \nit is that we as a society want to do in terms of making college more \naffordable. What kind of interest rate base do we want? Do we want a \nrate based on the 91-day T-bill, which we have had in the past, or, as \nothers are proposing now, do we want to go to a 10-year T-note rate? \nWhat does that mean? That has never been fully fleshed out. That only \ncomes out through hearings conducted by the committee. Should it be \nbased on the 3-month Treasury note? There are all kinds of different \nideas floating around, and no one really knows what is the best \nsolution.\n  I pointed out the necessity for a cap on these loans. I think about \nmy own experience when I started college in 1958 when there wasn't such \na program. But in 1959 and after that we had what was called the \nEisenhower loan program, the National Defense Education Act. I went to \na window at Iowa State University and I borrowed money. I borrowed \nmoney at 2 percent. I recently looked up the interest rate during that \nperiod of time, the 10-year Treasury note at that time, in 1959, 4.43 \npercent, 4.12 percent, 3.88, 3.95--all the years I was in college. Yet \nI borrowed money at 2 percent. So our government, our representatives, \ndecided it was worth it for America to subsidize the loans I had, not \ncharging the 10-year Treasury note but actually half of that--almost \nhalf of that. Think about that.\n  Not only did our society, our government, say: We want to have a \nfixed rate of 2 percent no matter what the market rate is, all the time \nI was in college--when I was a sophomore, junior, senior--there were no \ninterest charges. The interest rate clock did not run. Well, then I \nwent in the military for 5 years. During the 5 years I spent in the \nmilitary, there was no interest rate clock. I then got out of the \nmilitary and went to law school. I spent 3 years in law school--no \ninterest rate clock. Then after I got out of law school, I had a 1-year \ngrace period of no interest rate. So add it up--almost 10 to 12 years \nthat I had no interest rate charges. Not until after I was out of law \nschool for 1 year did the interest rate clock start to run. Then I had \nto pay back the loans.\n  That is what our society, our government, our people decided to do \nfor me and for students of our generation in the late fifties and \nsixties and seventies. That is what they decided to do. Now we hear, \nwell, no, now we have to go to a market rate. We have to go to a \nTreasury note of 10 years plus something.\n  I only talk about this to show the contrast between what our country \nwas willing to do for students of my generation and what we are trying \nto do for students of this generation. We are going to sock them with \nhigher interest rates. That is why student debt is so high. That is why \nit exceeds credit card debt in this country--because we got away from \nunderstanding that subsidized rate was an investment in the future of \nour country. It was an investment in getting kids through college and \nnot putting a mountain of debt on their heads so that when they got \nout, they could get married and raise families, start to make money and \nbuy good consumer items such as cars and homes and all kinds of things \nrather than paying back their debts for the next 10 to 20 years. So we \nhave gotten away from that.\n  These are the kinds of things we have to kind of think about as we \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act. What is it that we are willing to \ndo to invest in this new generation of students in terms of getting \nthem an affordable college education?\n  In moving forward, I appreciate the efforts of others who have come \nforward with ideas, but there is still a divide here. Here is the \ndivide. I think those of us in our caucus, in the Democratic caucus, \nhave said we have two key principles we want to uphold: Any deal on \ninterest rates should not reduce the deficit on the backs of students. \nWe should not trade national debt for student debt. No. 2, we need to \nkeep in place an interest rate cap--an interest rate cap--as a key \nconsumer protection to shield students from exorbitant rates in the \nfuture.\n  I have the highest respect for our President. I served with him here; \nhe was on our committee. I only wish that perhaps they had talked to us \na little bit before they came out with their proposal, but President \nObama came out with a proposal on student loans. He was the first \nPresident--not Democratic, but the first President, Democrat or \nRepublican--to propose going from a 91-day T-bill rate to a 10-year \nTreasury note. No other President ever suggested doing that.\n  Secondly, no President since 1958 has advocated removing the cap. \nPresident Obama, in his proposal, proposed removing the cap.\n  I believe it is safe to say our caucus has said no, we are not going \nto do that. We are not going to lift this key consumer protection of \nhaving an interest rate cap. If we are going to go to a 10-year \nTreasury note, then what is it that we do? Do we do it as they did for \nme where they subsidize it below it? Do we add something onto it, and \nhow much do we add onto it?\n  Again, we have, as I said, two key items. Interest rates should not \nreduce the deficit on the backs of students, and we need to keep in \nplace an interest rate cap as a key consumer protection.\n  I might point out, this has happened before. We had an interest rate \ncap in the 1990s when we had a variable rate. The cap was at 8.25 \npercent. Five times in the 1990s interest rates went above that. The \ncap protected students five times.\n  That is why the bill that has been put up by the Republican side, S. \n1241, fails to meet both those principles. Their bill, like the House \nGOP bill and S. 1003, is worse for students over the long term than if \nwe let rates double. S. 1241 would raise nearly $1 trillion by charging \nstudents higher interest rates over 10 years, using net revenue for \ndeficit reduction. This bill lacks an interest rate cap, an essential \nprotection for students, as I said, that has been in place since 1958.\n  According to the CBO projections of the 10-year Treasury note--and \nthat is what we have to live with, the CBO projections--under the \nproposal of S. 1241, which I think Senator Alexander\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\nand others have put forward, graduate students relying on Stafford and \nPLUS loans will see higher interest rates starting in 2016, right here.\n  I saw a card about this that said under this bill the graduate \nstudent loans would be 5.21 percent. That is true here. Then it goes up \nin 2014, 2015, and then in 2016 it goes above the fixed rate of 6.8 \npercent and keeps going up to 8.6 percent from then on.\n  Students understand this. They looked at this and said: Well, gee, \nhere, this is kind of like bait and switch. We get a couple, 3 years \nhere where they are lower, and from then on everything is higher for \nus. We don't want this.\n  By 2018, on the undergraduate loans, subsidized and unsubsidized \nloans, it is at 7.1 percent. It is even more than the 6.8 percent that \nis in permanent law.\n  Again, I repeat, we have always had an interest rate cap. For as long \nas we have had student loans, we have had an interest rate cap. Even \nwhen we had a variable interest rate from 1992 to 2006, as I pointed \nout, five times we bumped up against that cap, so students were \nprotected.\n  I have read in S. 1241 the authors stated there is a cap. Does this \nplan have a cap? It says yes.\n  There is a consolidation cap which we already have in law, by the \nway. We already have a consolidation cap in law. They keep it. But a \nconsolidation cap is not a substitute for an interest rate cap. It is \napples and oranges. One is a repayment mechanism. That is a \nconsolidation cap. The other is a consumer protection called an \ninterest rate cap. A consolidation cap is not a real cap.\n  Look at it this way. Let's say interest rates go to 10 percent, 11 \npercent, 12 percent. It is not unheard of. We have had that in the \nrecent past. A student is in college, and that student takes out loans \nat 10 percent, 11 percent, or 12 percent when they are a freshman, a \nsophomore, junior, or senior. During the time they are in school, \ninterest is accruing on their loan at 10 percent, 11 percent, or 12 \npercent. They can't consolidate until after they graduate. Then they \nsay they can consolidate all of their loans at an interest rate that is \nequal to 8.25 percent or the weighted interest rate of their loans, \nwhichever is lower.\n  I pointed out that under S. 1241, the Republicans' bill, if you took \nout a basic loan under the basic program we have had for 10 years, at \nthe maximum, under present law, you would pay back about $21,000 in \ninterest and payments. Under S. 1241 you would pay back $28,000, $7,000 \nmore. Get this--for the same loan under consolidation you pay back \n$69,000.\n  Consolidation--and that is why a lot of students aren't \nconsolidating, because they know they are going to pay a lot more in \ninterest charges for a longer period of time. Think about a 15-year \nmortgage versus a 30-year mortgage on your house.\n  Maybe a student would say: OK, I will consolidate. My monthly \npayments will be lower, but the total amount I pay back will be three, \nfour, five times more than what it would be if I don't consolidate.\n  Consolidation may be useful to some students as a repayment \nmechanism, but it is not the same as a cap on interest rates.\n  The bottom line is that an interest rate cap is the only way to \nensure all borrowers are shielded from exorbitant rates in the future, \nand consolidation is simply not a substitute.\n\n  Let's take a look at the base rate in S. 1241. That is the 10-year \nTreasury note. I asked my staff to take the provisions of the Alexander \nbill, S. 1241, and let's go back in time. What would students have been \npaying in interest rates? I looked at 1980, 1990, and 2000, every 10 \nyears. Under S. 1241, undergraduate Stafford is 13.31, graduate \nStafford is 14.86, and 15.86 on the PLUS loans. For 1990, undergraduate \nStafford is 10.4, graduate Stafford is 11.9, and PLUS loans are 12.9. \nIn 2000, undergraduate Stafford is 7.88, graduate Stafford is 9.43, and \nPLUS loans are 10.43. All of them are above the 6.8 percent that is \npermanent law right now, permanent in every single case because there \nis no cap. We have seen in the past 10-year Treasury notes as high as \n14 percent.\n  There is no cap, so you take the 10-year Treasury note plus 1.85 \npercent or 2 percent, and you can see where students without a cap are \ngoing to be paying a lot more money. The 10-year Treasury note is \nalready on the rise as the economy gets stronger. We know those \ninterest rates are going up and that is what CBO tells us. Without a \ncap in place, students are highly vulnerable to this.\n  Again, I want to go back to this chart here. This is why \nconsolidation is something students need to think about. This is \n$41,000 in Stafford loans borrowed over 2 years by a graduate student \nenrolling in 2018. Under current law, they would pay back $21,716 in \ninterest payments. Under S. 1241, they would pay more, $28,607.\n  But then they say: Well, you can consolidate. If you consolidate, you \nare going to pay $69,185. Look at the difference.\n  As I say, a consolidation cap is just a way to stretch out your \nrepayments, which means you are going to pay a lot more money over \ntime. I am not certain that is what we wish to do to students over the \nnext 20 to 30 years, burden them with even more debt for over 20 to 30 \nyears.\n  Again, as I have said before, I think S. 1241 is not good for our \nstudents, it is not good for the middle class, and for America's \ncompetitiveness in the future. I think we ought to take the time to do \nit right.\n  People say: Well, gee, we had an extension of this last year until \nthis year and you didn't do anything, so we should not extend it again. \nThere are probably a lot of reasons why Congress didn't do it. Last \nyear was an election year. We were gone a lot of time in the fall for \npeople to campaign for reelection for both the House and the Senate, \nand it was a Presidential election year. Nothing was done, basically, \nfrom October on.\n  Then there was the whole deficit reduction measure that had everybody \ntied up in knots, and the sequester. We were trying to work that out \nthe first of the year, and the budget bill, getting that done. There \nare a lot of reasons why this was not high on the agenda. There was a \nlot of significant legislation going on here, plus, as I said, last \nyear was an election year and a campaign year.\n  What is different about next year is this: The Higher Education Act \nexpires this year. We need to reauthorize it. We need to reauthorize it \nin a timely fashion.\n  As I said, this whole issue of student loans is only one part of it. \nThere are a lot of other parts, such as college accountability. What \nare their graduation rates? What is their charge for per-course study \nhour? How do they figure that amount of money? What are colleges doing \nto keep tuition rates low? What are States doing to support higher \neducation?\n  We have had a number of hearings in our committee already on the \nincreasing cost of college education and what is causing it. There are \na lot of different factors, but the one factor that overrode them all, \nthe one consistent, overriding factor of why college costs are going \nup, Federal costs--why Federal costs of college education are going \nup--is because over the last 20 to 30 years States were reducing their \nsupport for higher education.\n  State legislatures have figured this out. They figured out that if \nour State government doesn't put more money into higher education, \nstudents are going to get Pell grants. They will get these loans. The \nFederal Government will back them up. What has happened is States have \nreduced their support for higher education and shifted it to the \nFederal Government.\n  What should be the States' responsibility in higher education? What \nshould be our partnership with the States in supporting higher \neducation? That is, again, an issue for the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act, and what we are going to do about student loans \nin the future is a part of that.\n  That is why I argued for an extension for 1 year, because we can look \nat it in a comprehensive, systemic way as to what we ought to do about \ncollege affordability. This is why I say the best course of action to \nfollow right now, both for students, for middle-class families, and for \nour country, for getting a better higher education bill that addresses \nall of this--the best thing to do is a 1-year-more extension.\n  As Senator Reed said earlier, there is a loophole in the law that \ndeals with individual retirement accounts. IRAs were meant for \nretirement, but now\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nthere is a loophole in the law that allows millionaires and \nbillionaires to take IRAs and give them to a younger generation, which \nthey then take over a period of years--and a lot of times escape paying \ntaxes for years and maybe even for decades. Everyone agrees it is a \nloophole. It was never intended to be there for IRAs. By closing that \nloophole, we can pay for the 1-year extension at 3.4 percent. It seems \nto me the students need this loophole in IRAs more economic-wise than \nthe top one-tenth of 1 percent in our country. So that is why I think \nwe just need to take a deep breath and quit trying to rush to judgment.\n\n  There has been more bad legislation in my 39 years here that has \nhappened because we wanted to rush to judgment on a deadline rather \nthan taking the time to go through the committee structure, having the \nhearings, working things out on both sides of the aisle through our \ncommittee, and then bringing decent legislation to the floor.\n  Quite frankly, I think we can point to the immigration bill. That is \nwhat was done there. This immigration bill didn't just pop up on the \nfloor. It went through a long process in committee, with hearings and \nwitnesses and debate and amendments.\n  That is what we need to do here. Don't rush to judgment. I am afraid \nif we rush to judgment the losers will be the students and middle-class \nfamilies and, quite frankly, our economy in the future if we move to a \nsystem that is going to cause higher and higher interest rates way out \ninto the future for students just entering college.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to support the cloture vote tomorrow to \ngive us this 1-year extension. Let the committee do its work properly \nand bring a proper bill to the floor that will be open for amendment. \nPeople will be able to amend it at that time. I believe that is the \ndeliberate, thoughtful, and the responsible way to address this issue--\nnot just to vote something out that is separate and apart from \neverything else that adds to the burden of student debt in this \ncountry.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to do the responsible thing and extend \nthe 3.4 percent for 1 year, and we will address this next year in the \nHigher Education Act.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to echo the words of my colleague \nfrom Iowa about the upcoming vote this week, which is so important. We \nknow a lot of what has happened with student loan debt, which now \nexceeds $1 trillion--that is 1,000 billion dollars. It is more than \ncredit card debt in this country. It is more than auto loan debt. It is \nalso second only to mortgage debt of 300 million people of this great \ncountry.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the average student loan debt \nfor a college graduate who borrowed to finance a bachelor's degree this \nyear is nearly $30,000.\n  My wife, who graduated some years ago from Kent State University--the \nfirst of her family to go to college--graduated with just $1,200 in \ndebt. Her father carried a union card, worked at the local utility \ncompany in Ashtabula. Her mother was a home care worker. They had no \nreal money to put into her education or the education of her two \nyounger sisters and younger brother. Yet she graduated with only $1,200 \nin debt, getting a 4-year degree from Kent State University and going \non to a very good career in journalism.\n  For students such as the young man named Amish Patel, who works two \njobs to pay tuition at that same university, Kent State, Stafford loans \nare important. Stafford loans are essential to helping students such as \nAmish achieve their goal of obtaining a college degree.\n  Just 7 days ago, because of inaction by Congress--as we know so well \nfrom the comments of Senator Harkin and others on the floor--the \nStafford interest rate doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.\n  We have a chance to address this private student loan market today \nalso. My legislation, introduced not so long ago, helps those 2.9 \nmillion students across the country with more than $150 billion in \nprivate student loan debt. Overall, student loan debt is $1 trillion. \nMost of that is with the direct lending program--the Stafford loan \nprogram from the Federal Government. But $150 billion, or about 15 \npercent, which burdens about 2.9 million students, is private student \nloan debt. Private loans typically have higher interest rates, \nsometimes topping 15, 16, 17, 18 percent. They are more difficult to \nrefinance, and they offer fewer payment options than those loans \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Recent graduates with private loans, such as Lynsay Spratlen of \nMacedonia, a community in northeast Ohio, are living with their parents \nbecause their heavier debt burden often means they are unable to buy a \nhome, to start a business, to buy a car, or to go on to graduate \nschool. So along with Senator Heitkamp, I am introducing legislation to \nhelp stop the fleecing of college graduates who are stuck under a \nmountain of private student loan debt.\n  Often these banks will not refinance these loans. They are paying \nmuch higher interest rates. Sometimes they are cosigned, other times \nthey are not cosigned, by a family member, by a parent, typically. But \neither way they are a huge burden, and a significantly lower interest \nrate would be available if they could refinance these loans.\n  The legislation authored by Senator Heitkamp and myself--Refinancing \nEducation Funding to Invest for the Future Act--addresses this problem \nby authorizing the Treasury Department to make the private student loan \nmarket more efficient.\n  I want to read a couple of letters. We come to the floor of the \nSenate and talk about statistics, but we don't often enough illustrate \nor recite notes and letters and stories and discussions from people we \nmeet or who write our office or we meet on college campuses or around \nour States.\n  This is a letter from Chad, age 25 from Toledo. He is from the \nUniversity of Toledo:\n\n       I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in electrical \n     engineering at the University of Toledo. I live 15 minutes \n     away from there so I am a commuter living at home. My parents \n     don't have the funds to help me pay for college, so in order \n     to attend I must work full time to cover expenses. The \n     Federal aid I receive helps me cover a good portion of the \n     tuition costs. Increasing the interest rate for my loans \n     would be devastating to me on a financial level. It is hard \n     enough to pay them at the rate they are now; increasing them \n     would only make things a lot worse.\n\n  They are now at 3.4 percent. He wrote this before it had gone up to \n6.8.\n\n       Mr. Brown, if there is anything you can do to prevent this \n     from happening please do so. I am not the only one that will \n     feel the major effects.\n\n  That is why this upcoming vote is so important.\n  Let me share one other letter from Oregon, OH, also near Toledo. It \nis from Mlynek:\n\n       I have been a single mother of twin boys since 1989. They \n     were born October 1, 1986. I co-signed on loans for both of \n     them so they could further their education in the field they \n     love ``music.'' Jason Mlynek went to Ball State University \n     for 2 years and then transferred to Carnegie Mellon \n     University for his BA and obtained his Master's Degree in \n     arts management. Jason is working in New York City for \n     Distinguished Concerts International, but due to the loans he \n     incurred and the cost of living barely has enough to buy \n     food. He is paying $1,300 a month on his loans.\n       Shawn Mlynek received his BA from Carnegie-Mellon and then \n     went to the University of Miami 1 year and then transferred \n     back to the University of Cincinnati Music Conservatory and \n     received his Master's Degree in vocal performance. He works \n     as a singing waiter and has voice students but is in the same \n     situation. His income for 2012 was under $20,000, but he is \n     paying over $900 a month on his loans.\n       I work full time, have been at the same company 19 years, \n     make $35,000 a year, have good credit, own by own home . . . \n     and wanted to refinance. I was told I have too much \n     outstanding debt due on the loans I cosigned for my children. \n     Too much debt to ratio so I cannot refinance to lower my \n     payments.\n\n  So not only do these burdensome student loans with interest rates too \nhigh--if they double to 6.8 percent, but with costs already too high--\naffect the student when she or he graduates and wants to buy a house or \nstart a business, but they affect the whole economy, and they also \naffect the debt burden of parents, such as this mother--Jason and \nShawn's mother--who couldn't refinance her own mortgage because of the \ndebt burden she was carrying because she cosigned on student loans for \nher sons.\n  Finally, she writes this:\n\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\n\n       The American Way is to help our children and they would not \n     have been able to accomplish their dream of an education in \n     the music field if I hadn't cosigned for their educational \n     loans.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that sums it up. These two letters--the one \nfrom the University of Toledo student and from the mother of the \ntwins--sum up in so many ways why this issue is so important and why \nthe Senate needs to act, and act quickly, because the interest rates on \nstudent loans doubled last week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it seems as if the majority leader and \nsome others are rattling the cage once again in favor of the so-called \nnuclear option. For those who may not follow this topic closely, this \nis simply breaking the Senate rules in order to impose majority will on \nthe minority party by changing the procedures by which the Senate \nfunctions. In other words, it refers to a process by which the rules of \nthe Senate are broken in order to change the rules themselves.\n  As the distinguished majority leader has pointed out in the past--\nright here on the Senate floor in front of his colleagues and \nconstituents and all the American people, Senator Reid affirmed that \nthe proper way to change the Senate rules was through the procedure \nlaid out in those rules. The majority leader, Senator Reid of Nevada, \nwent on to say that he would oppose any effort in this Congress or the \nnext to change the Senate rules other than through the regular order, \nand he recommitted himself to this proposition in a colloquy with the \nRepublican leader earlier this year.\n  So I would ask the majority leader: Do you plan on keeping your word \nor are you going to resort to brute political force and break the \nSenate rules in order to change the rules and fundamentally transform \nthe nature of the U.S. Senate?\n  Should the majority leader break his promise, I believe he will \ninflict lasting and perhaps irreparable damage to this institution. And \nduring a time when cooperation is very important--as it always is--to \ntry to actually solve some of the Nation's biggest problems, poisoning \nthe well by exercising this so-called nuclear option would be the \nopposite of what we ought to be doing, which is coming together in a \nbipartisan way to address some of the Nation's biggest challenges.\n  I would also ask my Democratic colleagues, how do you reconcile your \ndesire for a filibuster-free Senate with the simple fact that Democrats \nwill not always be in the majority in the Senate? As we know, what goes \naround comes around, and the shoe will always be on the other foot. I \ncan think of a number of legislative proposals that Republicans on this \nside of the aisle would happily advance with a simple majority--let's \nsay, for example, a full repeal of ObamaCare. That would be a good \nplace to start. As the senior Senator from Tennessee Mr. Alexander \nrecently pointed out, we could finally establish the Yucca Mountain \nnuclear waste facility in Nevada. But the truth is that prudence and a \nhealthy respect for the fleeting nature of power in the Senate, as well \nas a healthy respect for the voices represented by the minority in the \nSenate, compel a different course of action because, as we know, the \nshoe will always be on the other foot at some day in the future.\n  I think it is worth pausing to examine the source of the majority \nleader's renewed interest in the so-called nuclear option. On the heels \nof the President's judicial nominations, many of our friends across the \naisle are renewing their wayward cries of Republican obstructionism in \nthe Senate, but the facts simply don't bear this out. The facts do not \nsupport this conclusion.\n  Indeed, as the Washington Post Fact Checker recently pointed out, \nfrom nomination to confirmation, President Obama's district court \nnominees have moved through the Senate at only a marginally slower pace \nthan his predecessors, while his appeals court nominees have sailed \nthrough at a much faster clip than President Bush's. The Senate has \nconfirmed 28 of the President's judicial nominees so far this year. By \nthis point in President Bush's second term, this body had confirmed \nonly 10. Twenty-eight under President Obama and 10 under President Bush \nat this point in their second term. In total, 199 of President Obama's \njudicial nominees have been confirmed and only 2 have been defeated. \nThat doesn't sound like obstructionism to me.\n  Meanwhile, the President has failed to produce nominees for 65 \npercent of the vacant judicial seats, many of which are in my home \nState in Texas. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows and as the \nAmerican people know, it is the President who nominates Federal judges, \nand then it is the responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent \non those confirmations. That is in the Constitution. But if the \nPresident doesn't nominate people for these vacancies, then the \nSenate's role is never engaged on those 65 percent of vacant judicial \nseats where the President has not even nominated an individual to \nserve. I would argue that is the true reason for the majority of \nvacancies and one that calls for the President's immediate attention.\n  So I hope that during the remaining few weeks here in July before the \nAugust recess, we don't see a manufactured crisis over how the Senate \noperates on nominees. We have some very controversial nominees--for \nexample, three of whom were unconstitutionally recess-appointed by the \nPresident. And don't take my word for it. In the case of the National \nLabor Relations Board, the court of appeals held that those were \nunconstitutionally appointed in order to circumvent the Senate's \nconstitutional role.\n  It is true that the U.S. Supreme Court has taken those cases, and we \nwill soon hear--perhaps by next summer--what the Supreme Court's view \nof the recess appointment authority of a President might be. But we \nknow that at least three of them--two at the National Labor Relations \nBoard and the so-called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nominee--\nwere recess-appointed and, I think it is pretty clear, in violation of \nat least the court of appeals' view of what the President's \nconstitutional authority would and should be.\n  We also have other nominees, some of whom are more controversial than \nothers. We have Gina McCarthy, who has been nominated for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We have James Comey, who was this \nmorning before the Senate Judiciary Committee and who I believe will \nenjoy broad bipartisan support as the next FBI Director. We have other \nmore controversial nominees, such as Thomas Perez to the Department of \nLabor. That is in part due to his activities as head of the Civil \nRights Division of the Justice Department, where he was harshly \ncriticized by the inspector general for politicizing what should be a \nnonpolitical position, enforcing the civil rights laws of the United \nStates.\n  So we are going to have plenty to talk about and a lot to do, but \nthis should not be used as an excuse by the majority leader to break \nhis word when it comes to changing the Senate rules through this \nnuclear option process. That would be a disservice to the country. It \nwould certainly irreparably damage the Senate as a deliberative body. \nIt would poison the well when we need to work together as much as we \ncan to try to get other important work done. And it would be extremely \nshortsighted because majorities can be fleeting, and those who are in \nthe majority today will find themselves in the minority in the future. \nI think that recognition would caution prudence and temper the \npolitical ambitions of the majority leader when it comes to jamming \nthrough some of these nominees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Affordable \nCare Act. I have long been concerned that this is an act that simply \nwon't work. I think the premise the bill was built around is a premise \nthat won't work.\n  I know things like guaranteed insurance sound very popular--that you \ncan get health insurance no matter what your health condition is--but \nthe problem with getting insurance after the fact as one of the \npotentials is that it discourages getting insurance before the fact. \nGetting insurance after you are sick is like getting fire insurance \nafter your house is on fire. You could probably get fire insurance \nafter your house is on fire, but it would sure cost a lot more than it \nwould have cost under what we would see as traditional insurance. So I \nhave always thought that premise was a problem.\n  I have always thought the requirements in the bill that depend \nheavily on young people who are healthy buying insurance at higher \nrates than young people have ever looked at before--and remember, that \nis probably the biggest uninsured component in this society because \nyoung and healthy people think they are young and healthy, and the \ntruth is that they normally are young and healthy, and they don't need \ninsurance like many members of this body might need insurance because \nthey just simply don't and they know it.\n  Frankly, now that the least likely to be healthy among us can't pay \nmore than three times the most healthy--we have never had that \nrequirement before--doesn't mean the cost of insurance goes down for \nunhealthy people as much as it means it goes up in cost for people who \nare healthy. And I think those young healthy people will be smart \nenough to figure out that it is probably not in their best interests, \neither their health or their finances, to buy the insurance they don't \nneed rather than to have the ability later to buy insurance if it turns \nout they need it. It just never made much sense to me.\n  Meanwhile, as we see that happening, from insurers to doctors to \nemployers, people are looking at this law and figuring out if this is a \nplace where they still want to focus their energies. I met with a \nnumber of doctors this morning who talked about how doctors are selling \ntheir private practices to hospitals and how specialty doctors are not \ngoing into specialty medicine because the cost is too high for the \nreward they might get.\n  I have talked to employer after employer who said: We have done all \nwe could to provide the insurance we have provided, but we can't meet \nthese new benefits and still stay in business. And even more employers \nhave said: We may not let anybody go who is a full-time employee, but \nin the future we are going to hire more part-time employees because we \ndon't have to cover those part-time employees under the law.\n  Then, as people are leaving health care behind and they are leaving \ntheir obligation to help provide health care behind, they keep getting \ndifferent messages from the Federal Government itself. Not too long ago \nthe supporters of this act--and I have never been one of them, I will \nadmit that right upfront--but the supporters of this act are saying we \nare going to stick with this, we are going to implement it, we are \ngoing to stay fully committed to it. But while we were gone last week, \nthe administration announced that in fact--they did it on a blog post, \nwhich I suppose is a way to announce something that is as consequential \nas this. It certainly got a lot of attention. But the blog posting said \nthe insurance reporting rules and penalties for employers would be \ndelayed for another year.\n  Suddenly, one of the wheels on this bicycle is gone. The employer who \nwas going to have to provide insurance or pay a penalty now does not \nhave to do it. But apparently the individuals who are going to have to \nbuy insurance for themselves, if it is not provided at work, have to.\n  At the same time the administration announced the income verification \nto have taxpayers help pay for a person's insurance would be waived. \nRemember, the income verification for any person or family at less than \n400 percent of poverty--which is a pretty big number; it is around \n$90,000 for a family of 4--you get some taxpayer assistance to pay for \nyour insurance. But now you do not even have to verify your income to \nget that. You can just say here is my income and whatever it is I want \nto have the taxpayer insurance based on what I believe my level of \nincome would be that I am willing to tell you about.\n  Suddenly the money the Government is spending is going to people who \nare getting taxpayer-paid insurance. There is no penalty for people who \ndo not provide insurance at work as the law requires. So, for a law I \nhave had problems with all along, I have even more problems with it \nnow. It is like: Never mind the employer mandate. Never mind the \nindividual income verification to get taxpayer assistance. How could \nyou take those two principles out of that law and expect it to be \nimplemented in a fair way?\n  The new plan apparently is let the Government sign up as many new \npeople as they can for government-assisted insurance. I understand why \nthat might be the most popular aspect of this bill. One of the great \nprinciples of society and people is when somebody is giving you \nsomething you are usually more glad to get it than you are when \nsomebody is taking something away from you. But in this case you are \ntaking money away from taxpayers to give to individuals to pay for \ntheir insurance and not fulfilling the rest of the commitments of the \nbill.\n  The administration obviously believes that paying the bill will make \nan unpopular piece of legislation more popular. In fact, many of the \nadministration's advocates are talking about how politically smart it \nis to put off the implementation of this bill for employer-based \ninsurance until after the next election. You can hardly find a story \nabout this without it talking about how shrewd it is, putting this off \nuntil people have voted one more time before they find out what is in \nit.\n  There were no real rules that came out until after the 2012 election, \nand then suddenly after the 2012 election, between then and the end of \nthe year, there are 20,000 pages of rules, rules that nobody saw before \nelection day, but suddenly the 20,000 pages of rules, 7\\1/2\\ feet \nhigh--7\\1/2\\ feet of rules that will be challenging to comply with but, \nmore importantly, nobody saw them before the 2012 election--now nobody \nhas to have a penalty as an employer until after the 2014 election.\n  I think I am getting to see a pattern develop here and the pattern is \nwhen people find out what is in this law they are not going to like it. \nIf it was believed they were going to like it, I think we would be \nrushing to implement the law before the 2014 election, not after. I \nthink we would be rushing to have the 20,000 pages of regulations out \nbefore the 2012 election, not after it. They had 3 years to get the \nregulations out before the 2012 election, 3 years, but they all come \nout after November. Now we are told we do not have time to implement \nthis. It has been 3\\1/2\\ years since the bill was signed into law. If \nthis is ever going to work, how much time is it going to take to \nimplement it?\n  This is a determined effort to get further and further down what I \nthink may be the wrong road before people find out what has happened to \ntheir insurance, before people know what has happened to their doctor, \nbefore people know what has happened to their health care. And when \nthey find out, I think they are not going to like it.\n  Since the passage of the bill, the law has had 8 interim final rules, \n3 final rules, 20 requests for comment, 21 proposed rules--according to \nthe Wall Street Journal, 1 information collection request, 2 amendments \nto the interim final rules, 6 requests for information, and 1 \nfrequently-asked-questions document.\n  The administration announced about a year ago that the long-term care \nprovisions of the bill, the so-called CLASS Act, simply wouldn't work. \nI remember when this was before the committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, when it was said: Look, there is no way this can \npossibly work. The advocates said no, this is actually going to make \nmoney. But once the bill was signed into law and was out there for \nabout a year, the Department of Health and Human Services said this \nlong-term care thing was not going to work; even though it is in the \nlaw, we are not going to implement it.\n  Then they announced we are not going to have the small business \nexchange available in January 2015; it\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\nwill be at least another year for that. The very same week they said we \nare not going to have income verification, we are not going to have the \nemployer mandate, there is another 606 or so pages of new rules and \nregulations. The rules and regulations seem to come out, but nobody \nseems to want to implement the law. There were 3\\1/2\\ years to get \nready. Now they can't get ready until after the next election.\n  If employers should have a delay, so should individuals and so should \nfamilies. In fact, I think what we should have is a permanent delay \nwhile we look for a plan that works, that can be implemented, that \nmakes sense, that is based on good health care and good health care \ndecisionmaking. I hope this Senate and this Congress and this \nadministration will try to find a plan that works instead of constantly \nsaying: You know, we are not ready to make this plan--which has been \nout there for 3\\1/2\\ years now--work and work to meet the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ]\n\n\n                                 syria\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, last week I led a bicameral delegation \nthat visited the Syrian border with Turkey. What we witnessed on the \nground highlighted the critical nature of events and the desperate need \nfor American leadership and eventually a negotiated resolution to the \nSyrian civil war.\n  This civil war is now in its 29th month. More than 100,000 people \nhave been killed, including at least 36,000 civilians, and 1.7 million \npeople have been forced from their homes, fleeing for their lives as \nthe chaos escalates. To describe this conflict as anything less than a \nregional disaster is to ignore the magnitude of its impact.\n  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \nviolence has pushed over 400,000 refugees to Turkey, almost 500,000 \nrefugees to Jordan, 160,000 to Iraq, 587,000 to Lebanon, and 88,000 \nrefugees to Egypt--a stunning development. The people of Turkey and \nJordan, including Prime Minister Erdogan and King Abdallah, should be \nspecifically applauded for their generous support of these refugees.\n  I also point out there are now secure locations inside Syria where \nrefugees can be housed within their own country.\n  There is noted international support to prevent the spillover of \nviolence. At the request of the Turkish Government and in fulfillment \nof our NATO obligations, the U.S. Patriot missile batteries at \nGaziantep are one example of efforts to deter the threat of ballistic \nmissiles beyond the Syrian border. Additionally, the Dutch and Germans \nhave deployed batteries to Turkey.\n  American troops are working diligently to strengthen our regional \nsecurity and protect innocent lives in harm's way. Our delegation was \nable to meet and visit with troops in Gaziantep last week. These highly \neducated and motivated men and women are proudly serving American \ninterests, and I commend them for their dedication to a critical \nmission.\n  Turkey must have the support it needs to defend its population and \nterritory from the raging civil war next door. Without robust \ncooperation among NATO allies, the stability of this entire region is \nat risk.\n  During our visit to a refugee camp in the town of Killis near the \nSyrian-Turkish border, roughly 40 miles from Gaziantep, we saw \nfirsthand the dire situation facing the countries that have accepted \nSyrian refugees and the challenges these individuals now face. At the \nrefugee camp, our delegation met with a women's group, children in \nschool, and with the elected camp council. Our conversations were \ninsightful--and heartbreaking. Over and over, the same question \nemerged: Why aren't the Americans helping to bring down Asad? Why are \nthe nations of the world allowing the slaughter of innocent people to \ncontinue? Is there no outrage over the displacement of more than 1.5 \nmillion people from their homes?\n  Frankly, these questions are very difficult to answer.\n  So far, the Obama administration has been reluctant to help in \ncontrast to the aggressive military and humanitarian aid provided by \nsome of our NATO allies such as Britain, France, and Turkey. I wish to \nemphasize: No one is asking for American boots on the ground. No one is \nasking President Obama to put troops in Syria. America is \nunderstandably war-weary from Iraq and Afghanistan, but our hesitation \nto provide adequate arms to the anti-Asad rebels is hard to justify, \nespecially when multiple red lines have been crossed.\n  Those who share President Obama's reluctance to assist opposition \nforces point to the uncertainty surrounding those who might assume \ncontrol of Syria if the rebels win. They ask: Which faction will \nemerge? The more moderate rebels under the Free Syrian Army or a \nradical Islamist band of opposition rebels?\n  While caution is definitely called for in this dangerous and volatile \nsituation, our reluctance to act reminds me of Shakespeare's Hamlet who \nonce observed that men ``rather bear those ills we have, than fly to \nothers that we know not of.''\n  I would remind Members--and the administration--that Hamlet's hand \nwringing and indecision ultimately led to his demise. In bowing to a \nfear of uncertainty and choosing disengagement, the implication is \nessentially that the world is somehow better off with a known \nquantity--even a known quantity in the person of Bashar al-Asad. I \ndisagree.\n  Here are a few facts about the ``ills'' we know regarding the Syrian \ndictator known as Bashar al-Asad:\n  No. 1, Asad is supported by the extreme Islamist regime in Iran, with \na supply of Iranian Revolutionary Guards to embolden his rampage.\n  No. 2, his grip on power has been serviced by Syria's client-state \nrelationship with Russia, which continues to defend its military aid to \nhim. President Vladimir Putin refused to join other nations at last \nmonth's G8 Summit in explicitly calling for an end to the Asad regime.\n  No. 3, Asad has tolerated--if not overseen--the killing of at least \n36,000 civilians in his own country, and this is according to numbers \nfrom the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. More than 3,000 of these \nhave been women and more than 5,000 were under the age of 16.\n  No. 4, under Bashar al-Asad's rule, the number of refugees has topped \n1.7 million, with thousands more seeking safety every day.\n  No. 5, Bashar al-Asad has targeted the villages of his enemies in a \nmerciless attempt to eradicate any who oppose him.\n  No. 6, following in his father's ruthless footsteps, he has shown \nthat he is willing to use every tool at his disposal to hang on to \npower, and that includes the use of chemical weapons, a development \nPresident Obama once called a red line, as well as rocket attacks on \nhis own people.\n  No. 7, we have every reason to conclude that Bashar al-Asad is a \ncalculating strategist and student of history who has learned from what \nhe views as the mistakes of Iraq's Saddam Hussein or Libya's Muammar \nQadhafi.\n  With Russian and Iranian assistance and arms, Asad has succeeded in \nstopping the momentum of the rebels. But with sufficient military \nsupport, the pendulum can, in fact, swing back toward the rebels.\n  I strongly disagree with those who suggest that the opposition rebels \ncould somehow turn out to be worse than the nightmare that has \nunfolded.\n  Increasing America's assistance to Syrian rebels, short of boots on \nthe ground, must be decisive and strategic in order to be effective. \nThat does not mean we send arms freely to all rebels. I challenge the \nnotion that in sending military aid, we forfeit the authority to choose \nwhich rebel leaders to support. I would also point out to Members that \nboth the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, and \nformer Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that within the administration, they argued in \nfavor of arming the rebels.\n  General Salim Idris, chief of staff of the U.S.-backed Supreme \nMilitary Council, has emerged as anything but a\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\nradical Islamist in presiding over the armed opposition and serving as \na conduit for military aid. A New York Times profile described him as \n``soft-spoken and humble compared with many military men.'' He defected \nfrom the Syrian military after an attack on his village last year--the \nsame village where he and his eight siblings were raised by a grain \nfarmer.\n  In a recent letter to the United Nations Security Council, General \nIdris's pleas for the Syrian people were clear and simple: ``Syria \nshould not be allowed to become the Rwanda of the 21st century.''\n\n  As I emphasized when speaking with Syrian refugees at the camp in \nKillis, a negotiated settlement will ultimately require reconciliation \nby representatives of all factions of the Syrian society--Alawites, \nSunni, Shia, and Christians. They must be prepared to negotiate with \nand eventually forgive their fellow Syrians who have made war against \nthem. But I do not believe that can happen as long as Asad and his \nRussian and Iranian backers see the momentum going their way. Russia \nwill never agree to back a meaningful peace negotiation if the Russian \nleadership thinks Asad can win outright. A leading-from-behind strategy \nwill not expedite the overthrow of the Asad regime. There is still an \nurgent need for American leadership.\n  There is no peaceful future for the Syrian people if Asad remains in \npower--only one of more violence, oppression, and regional instability. \nShould he prevail, the impact could have drastic implications on \nAmerica's national security interests, including the prospect of \nincreased sectarian violence in the region, the rise of al-Qaida-\naffiliated groups in Syria, and the expansion of Iran's extremist \ninfluence. The United States must not shy away from our potential to \nmake a meaningful difference.\n  Our Nation led an international coalition to act in Bosnia and \nKosovo, and we did so with success. We did not do so, regrettably, in \nRwanda--a mistake President Clinton has called his greatest regret.\n  I do not suggest that one visit to a refugee camp is by any means a \ncomprehensive assessment of U.S. foreign policy in Syria. Military \nassistance would be fraught with difficulties, and it produces a host \nof conflicting viewpoints among people for whom I have great respect. \nBut my visit to the refugee camps does have a profound effect, and my \nobservations of what is happening on the ground certainly bring home \nthe enormity of human suffering and devastation this conflict has \ncaused.\n  Most of those unfairly caught in the crossfire just want to get on \nwith their lives and protect their families. Instead, they have been \nforced from their homes and from their livelihoods--their entire way of \nlife ripped apart by the bloodshed that no human should endure.\n  I invite the American press to visit Gaziantep and the refugee camps \nnearby. The American people are entitled to know what is happening to \n1.7 million people. After more than 100,000 deaths, with so many people \nleft without a home, we should not stand by as the horrors continue to \nmount. The administration's hesitation leaves the fate of Syria's war-\ntorn people to a regime willing to kill and destroy to stay in power.\n  In summary, we know too much about Bashar al-Asad to maintain the \nstatus quo. Backed by Russia and Iran, he has overseen the massacre of \ninnocent lives, boldly crossed red lines, and violently suppressed any \nwho challenged him. To suggest we cannot do any better--that Asad is \nsomehow more acceptable than the opposition forces--falls short of \ntaking an honest, realistic look at what is happening.\n  The question now is not whether America puts boots on the ground. We \nshould not and will not do that. The question is whether the \nadministration will strengthen the capabilities of Asad's adversaries. \nThe question is whether the administration will trade its reluctance \nfor resolve and--like that of our NATO allies--respond with robust \nmilitary aid. So far, efforts in Geneva have failed to bring about a \nconsensus among major world powers that outlines a lasting political \ntransition. Without changing the momentum back to the rebels, the \ncurrent situation will not change, and the threat to regional stability \nand to American interests will continue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on July 1, interest rates on subsidized \nStafford loans rose from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. This means for \nstudents across the country, the annual cost of their student loans \nwill go up by as much as $1,000 a year. This makes no sense. The cost \nto the government is not 6.8 percent. In other words, the government \nwill be making money on the student loans. That was never our intent, \nand that makes absolutely no sense.\n\n  I hear many of my colleagues talk about how we do not want to \nincrease tax burdens on American families. Now we are taking our most \nvulnerable--students who need affordable higher education--and telling \nthem they are going to have to pay more money for their student loans. \nAnd, by the way, the government is going to make money off of that? We \nhave to do something about that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the size of student loans today. Total \nstudent debt passed the $1 trillion mark last year. There is more debt \nin student loans than there is in credit cards in America. Sixty \npercent of the students must borrow money in order to afford a college \neducation. Thirty-five percent of America's 35 million students are \nbehind on their loan payments. This is an enormous problem, and on July \n1 it became a more difficult burden for American families because of \nthe higher interest rates.\n  Senator Harkin, the chairman of the education committee, is \nabsolutely correct that we should take up a revision of how we charge \nstudents for loans and the availability of loans and the cost of \neducation when we take up the Higher Education Act reauthorization. \nThat committee will be taking it up shortly. But in the meantime, we \nshould take action to prevent the increase in these student loans from \ngoing forward. That is why I am a cosponsor and urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013. That \nact is pretty simple. It just says we are going to extend the 3.4 \npercent for another year. In other words, the government will not make \nthat money off the backs of our students. I hope all of us would agree \nthat we need to get that done now so the increased burden, the \nincreased costs, and the unnecessary costs to students are avoided.\n  Now, because of our budget scoring rules, S. 1238 needed to be paid \nfor. It is fully paid for. In other words, because current law would \nallow interest rates on subsidized loans to go up to 6.8 percent, to \ntake it back to 3.4 percent, the budget scorekeepers say we have to pay \nthe cost of that difference, even though the government would be making \nmoney at the 6.8 percent. So S. 1238 is fully paid for. We take a \nprovision that the Senate Finance Committee has been looking at, known \nas the stretch IRAs that basically deal with inherited individual \nretirement accounts, and we require that those funds be taxed in a more \ntimely way than they are today--a noncontroversial provision. It \nprovides the money.\n  I must tell you that I do not necessarily agree that the 3.4-percent \ncontinuation should not be baselined. Why do I say that? I hear so many \nof my colleagues say, when we have a tax bill and we extend tax relief, \nthat if we do not extend that tax relief, that is raising taxes on \nindividuals. In other words, what they are saying is that the temporary \ntax relief is really baselined and that if we do not extend that, we \nare increasing taxes. Well, here, for students, the 3.4 percent was the \nlaw. Why now, just extending that, do we all of a sudden have to come \nup with a different standard on how we pay for it? That being said, S. \n1238 is fully paid for.\n  What I think is wrong is for us to allow interest rates to go up \nwhere the government is making money off the backs of our students. We \nshould not be doing that. Higher education is already too expensive. We \nshould be looking at ways to make college education more affordable for \nAmerican families. For generation after generation, we have been \ntelling our children that the American dream is achievable to those \nindividuals willing to pursue an education and work hard. Are we now \nprepared to tell millions of students that\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nwe are pushing the American dream beyond their grasp?\n  Let me give one example. Amanda McIntosh wrote me a letter. She is a \nfirst-generation college student who holds a college degree from \nChristopher Newport University, a master's degree from Columbia \nUniversity, and a graduate certificate from Johns Hopkins University. \nAmanda is not from a wealthy family, so she has over $100,000 in \nstudent loan debt. Amanda would like to earn her doctoral degree so \nthat she can conduct research that influences policy regarding access \nto higher education for historically underrepresented populations, but \nshe is buried under student loans and unable to continue her education, \nunable to afford a car or make a downpayment on a home or otherwise \ninvest in the economy. She simply cannot afford to take on more loans.\n  What is the message here? What are we telling the future generations \nof Americans? We are saying: You need education in order to succeed. \nYou need education so we can have a competitive workforce. And then we \ntell them that the cost of education is out of their reach. And then we \nare going to tell them that the loans are going to be more expensive.\n  In Amanda's case, she would like to do something with her future that \ncould be extremely helpful to our country and to herself. She may not \nbe able to do that because of the cost of higher education. And then so \nmany students graduate with such large debt today that they have to \nlook at paying off their debt and it affects their career choice. These \nmight be gifted scientists who could really do something to help \ndiscover the answer to dread diseases, how we could cure them, but \ninstead they have to opt out for a short-term career decision to pay \noff their student loans.\n  We need to have a policy that makes higher education more affordable, \nnot more costly. Yet increasing the cost of the Stafford loans from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent will make it more expensive for families to be \nable to afford a college education.\n  Obtaining a college degree is not a luxury; it is an economic \nimperative. Affordable access to higher education means more \nscientists, doctors, nurses, engineers, computer programmers, and other \nhighly skilled workers our economy will need to fill the high-tech jobs \nof the future. A well-educated, highly skilled workforce is vital to \nsustain our national security and prosperity in a globalized 21st-\ncentury job market.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans \nAffordable Act of 2013, as a commonsense approach to protecting \nstudents at no additional cost to the taxpayer. As I said earlier, this \nbill would simply allow the 3.4 percent to remain in effect until our \ncommittee has the time to pass reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, and they could then take into consideration not just the \navailability and the cost of student loans but the cost of higher \neducation, the transparency in the cost of higher education, the \nconcerns we have about different types of schools and whether we are \ngetting value for the dollar. All that can be done as we reauthorize \nthe Higher Education Act. But in the meantime we should keep the loan \ncost to students at 3.4 percent and not allow it to increase as it did \non July 1. We will have the opportunity to do that, I understand, \ntomorrow on the bill on the floor. I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport that effort.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Jodi Schwartz\n\n  On a personal note, let me point out that a very valuable member of \nmy staff, Jodi Schwartz, will be leaving us at the end of this week. \nShe is our education person in my office who has been so helpful to me \nnot just on the student loan issue but on all educational issues--\naffordability of education, the quality of education, the opportunity \nfor everyone to have the great dream of America. She has been a very \nvaluable asset to our staff. I will certainly miss her in my Senate \noffice, and I wish her only the best.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Last week on July 2, the Tuesday before the Fourth of July \nIndependence Day on Thursday, the administration made an announcement \nthat they were going to delay implementation of a key component of the \nObamaCare law. I think that came as a surprise to a lot of people \nbecause the expectation has been all along that in January of this next \nyear many of the provisions in that law were going to go into effect.\n  Tomorrow, a majority of the Senate Republican conference will be \nsending a letter to President Obama asking for a permanent delay of the \nemployer mandate. I say permanent delay because they talked about \ndelaying it for 1 year. In making the announcement about the delay of \nthe employer mandate, the administration unilaterally acted and failed \nto work with Congress on what is a very significant decision.\n  This action finally acknowledges some of the many burdens this law \nwill place on job creators. I believe the rest of this law should be \npermanently delayed for all Americans in order to avoid significant \neconomic harm to American families.\n  In response to questions about the administration's decision, the \nPresident's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said, ``We are listening,'' \nwhile referring to the concerns of the business community over the \nonerous employer mandate that will result in fewer jobs and employees \nworking fewer hours.\n  We have been listening as well. As more employers have attempted to \nunderstand the burdensome requirements in the President's health care \nlaw, the louder their outrage has become. In particular, small- to \nmedium-sized businesses are simply drowning, drowning in their efforts \nto understand all of the regulations.\n  We are also listening to the views of the American people. A recent \nGallup poll from this week showed that a majority of Americans still \ndisapprove of the health care law. The survey showed that 55 percent of \nrespondents disapprove of ObamaCare. A Gallup survey last month \nrevealed for every one person who believes they will be better off \nunder ObamaCare, two believe they will be worse off.\n\n  Opposition to the health care law is growing and it will continue to \ngrow as more Americans realize the law is built upon broken promises \nand will result in higher health care costs and more taxes.\n  Under the individual mandate, the IRS, which is still under multiple \ninvestigations for unfairly targeting conservative groups, will play a \ncentral role in the implementation of the health care law in our \ncountry. Last fall the Congressional Budget Office estimated nearly 6 \nmillion Americans, primarily in the middle class, will have to pay a \ntax under the individual mandate, which was 2 million more than were \ninitially estimated.\n  When the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, the average \nindividual mandate tax will be nearly $1,200, which clearly--clearly--\ncontradicts the President's previous statement that the individual \nmandate is ``absolutely not a tax increase.''\n  Further, families are facing significant increases in premiums. The \nWall Street Journal recently published an analysis of premiums and \nconcluded under the health care law some Americans will see their \npremiums double or even triple, which is the opposite of the promise \nthat was made by the President that premiums would go down by $2,500 \nfor American families.\n  Given the widely held belief by the American people the Affordable \nCare Act will not fulfill its promises and will result in higher costs \nfor American families, I believe this law should be permanently \ndelayed. This law is unworkable, harmful to the economy and to American \nfamilies, and action to delay the employer mandate is an acknowledgment \nof that very fact.\n  Public opinion about the Affordable Care Act has been consistently \nlow. Perhaps Americans don't like it because it is affecting their \njobs. Four in ten small business owners say they have held back in \nhiring, and one in five owners says they have let employees go due to \nthe health care costs associated with the Affordable Care Act. As \nimplementation of the law continues, the number of small business\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nowners who take these steps could increase.\n  Employers are also cutting back on hours in anticipation of the \nmandate. Even though enforcement of the employer mandate may be \ndelayed, employers still know this is coming down the pike and will \ncontinue to make adjustments to their workforce in anticipation of the \nnew mandates.\n  A new mandate will also be imposed on individual Americans. On \nJanuary 1, Americans will be forced by their government to buy a \nproduct--health insurance--for the first time ever. This mandate will \nbe enforced by tax penalties administered through the Internal Revenue \nService. The Obama administration has requested over $400 million in \nfunding and nearly 2,000 bureaucrats for the IRS to implement the \nindividual mandate and 46 other statutory provisions.\n  The blizzard of ObamaCare rules and regulations continues. Regulators \nhave now written over 20,000 pages of ObamaCare-related rules and \nnotices in the Federal Register. And just this last week another 606 \npages of new regulations were released that were designed to assist in \nimplementing this massive law. It is no wonder the public outcry from \nemployers was so loudly opposed to the employer mandate.\n  American families are also struggling to understand how this complex, \nburdensome law will affect them. It is critical the President and his \nadministration listen to the American people and permanently delay this \nlaw.\n  I would add that if we look at the impact on the economy, not only is \nthis about higher premiums for middle-class families in this country, \nnot only is it about higher taxes that are going to be imposed upon \nmedical device manufacturers, on health insurance plans, pharmaceutical \ncompanies--all of which, by the way, will be passed on to individual \nconsumers--it is also about the impact this will have on jobs and the \neconomy. If we look at the numbers that came out last week and what \nthey said about the impact of policies coming out of Washington, DC, \nand the impact they are having on jobs in this country, the number of \npeople working part time for economic reasons--sometimes referred to as \ninvoluntary part-time workers--increased by 322,000 people to 8.2 \nmillion total people in the month of June. These are people who are \nworking part time because their hours have been cut back or because \nthey were unable to find a full-time job.\n  The real unemployment rate, or what we call the U-6 rate, is 14.3 \npercent for June of 2013, which is an increase of one-half percentage \npoint over the previous month. That is the total percentage of \nunemployed and underemployed workers, making the real number of \nunemployed Americans in this country 22.6 million people. These are \npeople who are unemployed, want work but have stopped searching for a \njob, or are working part time simply because they can't find full-time \nemployment.\n  I would add that when policies coming out of Washington, exemplified \nby the ObamaCare mandates, are imposed on the American economy, it \nmakes it harder for job creators and employers in this country to \ncreate the jobs necessary to affect these numbers in a positive way, to \nget Americans back to work, and back to work in a full-time way and \nback to work in a way where they are actually increasing their take-\nhome pay rather than having it decreased by higher costs for everything \nthey have to spend their income on, including the cost of health \ninsurance coverage.\n  We have been saying for a long time and there is study after study \nthat comes out that talks about how the health care law is going to \ncause health insurance premiums to rise, and there have been a lot of \npeople who have gotten up here in the Senate, others in the \nadministration, in an attempt to defend the ObamaCare law who have \nsaid: Oh, no, no, no, that is not going to be the case; it is actually \ngoing to drive premiums down. We continue to hear that, but more and \nmore evidence comes in, and not just studies being done out there but \nreal-life examples of the impact this law is having on insurance \npremiums.\n  In fact, there are some actuarial studies that have estimated \npremiums in various States around the country and what the impact on \npremiums would be. For the State of Colorado, in the individual market, \nthe estimate by the actuaries is that the insurance premium rates are \ngoing to go up by 19 percent; the State of Indiana by 95 percent in the \nindividual market, by 10 percent in the small group market; the State \nof Maine, the estimates are the individual market premiums are going to \ngo up by 40 percent, 9 percent in the small group market; the State of \nMinnesota, in the individual market, a 42-percent increase in premiums \nand 20 percent in the small group market; the State of Wisconsin, a 30-\npercent increase in the individual market. In the State of Ohio, last \nmonth the Department of Insurance announced the average individual \nmarket health insurance premium in 2014 will cost 88 percent more. \nAccording to Ohio insurance regulators, the department's initial \nanalysis of the proposed rate shows consumers will have fewer choices \nand pay much higher premiums for their health insurance starting in the \nyear 2014.\n\n  Well, it shouldn't be any big surprise when we look at the \nrequirements in the new health care law. The new health care law says \nyou have to have a certain kind of coverage. You can't continue to \noffer coverage available to people who might want to have different \nchoices about what types of things they want covered, what they want \ntheir copays or their deductibles to be. Basically, the law says if you \nare going to offer a plan, you have to offer this plan, it is a \ngovernment-approved plan, and it has to have these sorts of coverages \nand these sorts of things and these bells and whistles.\n  The new law also says you can get insurance after you get sick. It is \ncalled the guarantee issue. No longer is there any requirement to go \nout and get insurance to protect yourself and prevent yourself from \nhaving to be in that situation when illness strikes. Now, if you get \nsick, you can go out and buy insurance.\n  It also requires community rating, which changes the way in which \nhealth care costs are distributed across the range of people who are \ncovered by health care premiums in this country, making it more \nexpensive for younger people to get their health insurance coverage. \nThat is why we are seeing these steep increases in the individual \nmarket.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for a couple of \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. So when we look at all the mandates, the new requirements \nin the legislation, the new taxes in the legislation, and when we look \nat all the States trying to deal with and cope with this, and all the \nsmall businesses--and small businesses, obviously, weighed in heavily, \nwhich is why, as I mentioned earlier, the White House said, look, we \nare listening, we got the message, and so they waived this, they \ndelayed this at least for 1 year for the small businesses under the \nemployer mandate--all we are simply saying is: Look, there are lots of \nproblems associated with this law. This was a bad law. It is based upon \nbroken promises. It promised lower premiums; we are seeing higher \npremiums. It includes higher taxes. We are going to see effects all \nacross the economy when it comes to jobs as people cut back and start \nforcing people into part-time jobs so they are not hit with the \nemployer mandates under this legislation.\n  So the law affects jobs and it affects the economy. We have a \nsluggish economic growth rate that has now been adjusted down to 1.8 \npercent in the last quarter, and we continue to sort of muddle along. \nOne of the reasons for that is because we here in Washington, DC, \ncontinue to pile more and more costs on employers trying to do \nbusiness. So until we understand that to create jobs and grow the \neconomy we have to make it less difficult and less expensive for \nemployers and job creators to create jobs, we will continue to see this \ntrend in the future.\n  I would simply say to my colleagues here in the Senate, and to the \nadministration, if we are going to delay implementation of the employer \nmandate for a year, let's delay the individual mandate as well, and \nlet's not just do it for a year, let's permanently delay this. Let's \nstart over and do this the right way, in a way that actually reduces \npremiums and health care costs for people in this country, that makes \nit less expensive and less difficult for small businesses to create \njobs and\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\ngrow the economy, and to get Americans back to work in good jobs that \npay well, that increase the take-home pay so they can provide in a \nbetter way for their families.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wanted to speak in a little detail on \nanother topic, and that is the direction we are going on the student \nloan crisis, I guess. It is a shame we have come to this. A year ago, I \nvoted for the extension. We were told at that time that due to the \npolitical atmosphere, we had the big election year coming up, that we \ncouldn't get into the details and fix it the way it maybe needed to be \nfixed and should have been fixed back then. So a lot of us went ahead \nand voted for the extension, and now we find ourselves in the same \nposition this year as we were last year. There will be another election \nin 2014. So it seems as though we are always in an election cycle, and \nif we allow that to continue to direct what we do and how we do it, we \nwould get little done here, which is what the public is getting \nfrustrated with.\n  A few of us got together, myself, Senators Alexander, Carper, and \nKing, and we decided maybe we could come together and work on \nsomething. There is no perfect fix for anything here, I have found, and \nthis is complicated and confusing if you don't delve into it. So I \nstarted looking into it more this year than I had before.\n  I think a lot of our colleagues, and a lot of people in the country, \nbelieve the so-called ``doubling of the rates'' from 3.4 to 6.8 meant \neverybody's rates had doubled. First of all, there was just a small \npercentage of the loans we loaned out that were getting the advantage \nof the 3.4 if we extend it. Seventy-five percent of the loans--75 \npercent of the money out there--is at the higher rate of 6.8 or above.\n  I have tried to understand, the best I can, all the different aspects \nof the loans we have out there. We have the subsidized loans. Because \nof family income and participation someone is able to get a subsidized \nloan. What that means, if we break it down, is the first year you \nqualify for a subsidized loan you can borrow up to $3,500, and $3,500 \nin today's higher education world doesn't go very far. You are also \nallowed to borrow $2,000 of unsubsidized money, which means you would \nhave been paying 3.4 percent on the $3,500 and 6.8 percent on the \nunsubsidized.\n  So as you can see, it is not all clear-cut. Then, in the second year, \nyou can borrow $4,500 subsidized and $2,000 in unsubsidized; and then \nit goes to $5,500 and stays at $5,500 for the fourth year.\n  The thing that happens is the unsubsidized loans, if we are looking \nat the unsubsidized loans at 6.8 percent, they are staying. We have had \nsome say it is better to leave it alone, do nothing. Let it go ahead \nand double at 6.8 and leave it where it is. We worked out a proposal \nalong the lines of the President's proposal. Also, we had the so-called \nHouse Republican proposal.\n  Our proposal is much different. This is not a Republican or \nDemocratic piece of legislation. It is a bipartisan piece. We looked at \nall aspects of what we have to deal with in today's market.\n  On July 1 the rates went up. If we are able to come to agreement this \nweek or maybe the first of next week, we can retroactively bring those \nback so that when you go to school this fall you will know exactly what \nyour rates will be. We came to a bipartisan agreement that those rates \ncould be 3.66 percent, and that is for all undergraduates.\n  Now if you are getting a subsidized or unsubsidized loan, a 1-year \nextension goes from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. Under our proposal, \neverything is at 3.66 percent. That will save about $9 billion this \nyear in interest that students would be responsible for paying--$9 \nbillion for the youth of this country trying to get a higher education. \nIf we just do the 1-year extension, that is only a savings of $2 \nbillion. So there is a $7 billion savings beyond what the 1-year \nextension would do. We are just dealing with the facts that we have in \nfront of us.\n  So let's say you are going to a graduate unsubsidized Stafford loan, \nwhich many people in graduate school get. Right now, that is at 6.8 \npercent. Under our proposal, that goes to 5.21 percent.\n  If you have a PLUS loan--that is parents and graduate students--today \nyou are paying 7.9 percent, and you have been paying 7.9 percent. Our \nbill takes that to 6.21 percent. You can see the savings.\n  Some might say, well, the interest rates will go up after 3 or 4 \nyears, and then you will be at a higher rate. We put also, the same as \nin the law right now, an 8.25 percent cap. So if you borrow money this \nyear at 3.66 percent, that is locked in for the life of the loan. That \nis what you pay for the money you borrow this year for the life of that \nloan. Now, next year it could be 4.5 percent. It could go up with \ninflation.\n  When I was in school, and later on, inflation kicked up to 16 or 17 \npercent. That is outrageous.\n  In the Senate, Republicans and Democrats have come to an agreement \nthat we don't think the policy of this country should be that we should \nmake a profit on the loans that students are receiving to educate \nthemselves to have a better quality of life and opportunity. We have \ncome to that agreement. That is not the bill we got from the House. \nThey want to use profits to pay down debt.\n  Now, I understand there is a lot more that needs to be done on the \nprofit end of it and how we get to the true cost. The Presiding Officer \nhas been working hard on that, and I am willing to work with her. But \nthe agreement we have in front of us today is that we are not going to \nmake any profit that will go to debt reduction. If there is a so-called \nprofit, it should go to reduce and give the lowest rate we could \npossibly offer. That is what we have agreed on. We agreed on fixing the \nrates for the life of the loan. That is not what came from the House.\n  So when I say it is a bipartisan bill, these are things we are \nagreeing on that make a better piece of legislation.\n  People might say: But 4 years from now it might go up higher than 6.9 \npercent. In the 3 or 4 years that we know we will have tremendous \nsavings, there is a difference of $36 billion versus maybe $8 billion \nif you just keep extending 1 year at a time. A $2 billion savings here, \na $9 billion savings here. It is not hard to do the math.\n  Then, talk about a comprehensive education bill, I pray to God that \nwe can get a comprehensive education bill, but I am not sure the \nAmerican public believes we are able to get any type of a consensus on \nany type of comprehensive bill.\n  When I first got here, they told me we were trying to get our \nfinancial house in order. Then we had the sequester coming at us. The \nsequester basically was a penalty we voted on, but no one ever thought \nwe would let it get that Draconian, to the point we couldn't come to an \nagreement and we would have to have this type of a punishment put on \nourselves. So we put a supercommittee together for the purpose of \ngetting a superdeal so we could get our financial house in order. It \nwasn't that super. It didn't work.\n  So then the sequester kicked in and the Draconian cuts across the \nboard. You don't run your life that way, your business that way, \nwhether it is small or large. You don't cut everything. You have your \npriorities and necessities you have to maintain in your life on a daily \nbasis. Then you have excesses you can do without. So you make \nadjustments and you pick and choose.\n  That is not working right now, and what is happening is people are \nsuffering needlessly because we cannot come to an agreement to get our \nfinancial house in order, to find a budget that works for this country, \nto find a tax system that is fair and equitable that people believe in. \nWe haven't been able to do that.\n  We are being told: Let's go ahead and extend the 3.4 percent for the \nsmallest portion of the amount of loans that we loan out, and everyone \nelse can pay the higher rate.\n  I am not willing to do that. I think we can do better. I think we are \nbetter than that--on both sides of the aisle. Chastising each other and \nsaying one wants to raise rates and one is insensitive toward students, \nand it is a Republican or Democrat plan, doesn't fix anything around \nhere. It hasn't since I have been here, and I don't think it is going \nto. It will if we put our country first. And we know one thing: By \nputting our country first, we put our students first.\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\n  Without educating the populous, we have nothing. We can't compete in \nthe world of economics. We can't compete in the world of science and \ntechnology. We just can't.\n  The best investment we can make is in our youth. The best investment \nwe can make is in education. We might buy a car and think that is a \ngreat investment. We might buy a piece of property or a house and think \nthat is a great investment. The best investment we will ever make is in \neducation. We want to make it as affordable and doable as humanly \npossible, and that is what we have worked on together, on a bipartisan \nbasis. We are hoping we can find common ground.\n  We have talked about caps. The caps are inherently built in. Let's \nsay you graduate, get a degree, and find a job that pays $40,000--which \nis not a lot in today's market for the money invested--and get married \nand have a child or two. With the system we have built in right now, \nyou only pay 15 percent of your disposable income. That breaks down to \nabout $142 a month that you will pay on your student loan to make it \naffordable. If you are not able to pay that off at the end of 25 years, \nit is exonerated and wiped out.\n  Pell grants. If a person is in need because of their income, they can \nget up to $5,645 a year free. Those are grants we give out, which are \nexcellent, helping students who don't have an opportunity or chance, \nwith any support from their family, to be able to get a higher \neducation. We are doing an awful lot of things to help. The bottom line \nis that we have come to an agreement that it shouldn't be subsidized, \nthere shouldn't be a profit made, and it should be affordable--and it \nhas to run efficiently.\n\n  I think $36 billion in savings over 4 years is pretty substantial \ncompared to us doing nothing. I also think those who say let the rates \ngo up to 6.8 percent are misinformed. I don't think they have been told \nthe facts or the truth.\n  What we are asking for is basically a level playing field, looking at \nwhat we can do that is positive, getting more groups to sit down and \nsincerely work toward what I think is going to be a good outcome and a \ngood process.\n  Extending what we have doesn't work. Not being able to come together \nto make sure our loans are affordable is not acceptable. I think if we \ncontinue to strive to work toward finding a reasonable outcome, we will \nbe able to succeed.\n  Tomorrow we will have a vote, and there will be more discussions \nabout student loans. The bottom line is we want rates to come down for \neverybody. Every student in every category should have the benefit of \nthe lower rates that are available to the public today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, over this past week I had the \nopportunity to visit with many students, many faculty and staff of our \ncolleges, both private and public, all around the State of Connecticut.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has led very strongly in this effort. \nWhat I found is that students and teachers of Connecticut and around \nthe country absolutely understand how destructive and lastingly harmful \nthis doubling of interest rates will be for people of all ages in \nAmerica.\n  Never before has higher education meant more to earning potential and \nemployment, now and in the future. Never before have the faculty, \nstaff, and students of America been more united in their understanding \nof how critical higher education is--not only to them but to our \neconomy. Our students are the ones who will buy homes, build families, \nstart businesses, and contribute to our economy. They will do more to \ngive back and contribute if they have the great advantages of higher \neducation spared from the financially crippling debt that threatens \nthem now.\n  In fact, financially crippling debt is a reality for more than 73,000 \npeople who owe an average of $29,000 in Connecticut alone. That debt is \na burden for our entire economy as much or more as it is for those \nindividuals. So there is a strong societal and national interest in \nthis issue.\n  I didn't need to tell the students of Connecticut what the \nconsequences are of doubling the interest rates, and I didn't need to \ntell them what it would mean for their future. They told me.\n  They told me at Middlesex Community College, where I spoke to the \ncommunity college sector--I discussed the issue with the president of \nthat college, Anna Wasescha, along with public officials, students, and \nfinancial aid people.\n  They told me at Northwestern Connecticut Community College, where I \nspoke with the president Barbara Douglass and individuals there, \nstudents and faculty, who noted to me that 51 percent of their students \nreceived some kind of financial aid, including Stafford loans.\n  All around Connecticut I spoke to faculty and students, such as Sam \nChaney, who is a 2010 graduate of Quinnipiac. He said to me when \nstudents graduate:\n\n       . . . you're not just paying rent, you're paying as much or \n     more in student loans. . . . I hope they're not in the \n     position I was in, being told not to worry about the sticker \n     price of college.\n\n  I heard from Irene Mulvey, the president of the Connecticut chapter \nof the American Association of University Professors. Her organization \nis constantly in touch with student borrowers and knows just how much \nsubsidized Stafford loans mean to them. As she said to me, ``As faculty \nmembers, we see the impact that student loan debt has on our students \nand their families every day.'' She called this doubling of interest \nrates ``indefensible.''\n  She is correct. It is indefensible, unconscionable, unacceptable. \nEven at 3.4 percent, as the Presiding Officer well knows, our Federal \nGovernment profits from the student loan program. It profits in the \namount of $51 billion a year. Doubling the interest rate simply means \nmore profits for the Federal Government.\n  There is a fundamental principle at stake; that is, whether our \nNation is going to continue profiting from student loans, which should \nbe regarded not as a benefit to the students but an investment in our \nNation, not as a charitable or eleemosynary program but as a vital \ninvestment in the skills and talents and the major resource our Nation \nhas as a free and democratic society, the talents and skills of our \npeople.\n  Freedom from student debt should be a fundamental national interest \nas important as any that this body addresses. It is as vital to the \nfuture of the country as our national defense.\n  I did not need to tell the students of Connecticut what this doubling \nof interest rates would mean to them--$31 a month, $1,000 a year. They \nknow. They do the math. They get it better than people in this Chamber \nor in the House of Representatives. They told me what the $1,000 would \nmean to them. Elizabeth Tomasco: ``Textbooks and start saving for my \nvery own car.''\n  Gina: ``I would use $1,000 to pay for books. Don't double my rate.''\n  Across Connecticut, students are telling us: Don't double my rate.\n  I did not need to tell them as well that there are a lot of borrowers \nin this country who get a pretty good rate, a lot better than 3.4 \npercent. In fact, those borrowers are the biggest financial \ninstitutions, the big banks who borrow from the Federal Reserve at a \ndiscount window at less than 1 percent--.75 percent often.\n  They are angry about it; that they are worth less in these financial \nmarkets, in the view of our Federal Government that loans money, than \nthe big banks and big institutions that, in fact, are sometimes \nregarded as too big to fail. Students are failing to pay back those \ndebts, but the nation is failing our students and it is failing itself \nbecause our national interest is in the student loans and talents and \nskills and opportunity it provides, not just in the next year or couple \nof years but for a lifetime and for the long term of our Nation.\n  I am a proud supporter of the Bank on Student Loan Fairness Act, \nwhich would give them the same kind of fairness, equivalent fairness \nthat our big banks enjoy when they borrow from the Federal Reserve. But \nin the meantime, we need a solution for this next year, and it is the \nKeep Student Loans Affordable Act. It is a remedy of short duration, I \nhope, that will in the end be accompanied and followed by longer term \nreforms that will give students the benefit of those lower rates, lower \neven than 3.4 percent, so our Federal\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\nGovernment ceases to use students as a profit center and ceases to take \nadvantage of them.\n  I am not against smart cuts to reduce our debt and our deficit. These \nkinds of burdens on students, using them as a deficit solution, is not \na smart cut. That is an understatement. In the long term, we need to \nreduce the cost of higher education, which has increased over the last \nfew decades by 1,000 percent. That is the result of year after year \noverinflationary increases in tuition which over time have managed to \nmake a college degree unaffordable to all but the most well off unless \nthey use that kind of financially crippling debt to attend.\n  The age of supporting oneself through a 4-year college degree is past \nfor most. This unfortunate trend has been coupled with more and more \nemployers requiring a bachelor's degree for even consideration in the \nhiring pool. So the doubling of interest rates is indeed indefensible, \nas Irene Mulvey told me. It is indeed unacceptable in the greatest \nnation in the history of the world--which must continue the quality and \naffordability of higher education if we are to remain the greatest \nnation in the history of the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will join the Members of this Senate who have \nsupported the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act and will support a \nreasonable measure keeping these rates at 3.4 percent. To allow \nvariable rates and, in effect, teaser loan levels that can rise beyond \naffordability, without caps, without protection is, in fact, against \nthe national interest. This measure will help us keep students in \nschool and spare them the kind of financially crippling debt that all \ntoo many of our young people have when they leave college.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask I be permitted to speak in morning business for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Time to Wake up\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here for my 38th weekly ``Time \nto Wake Up'' speech, and today I want to ask the question: What if?\n  What if climate change is real? What if the 30-plus gigatons of \ncarbon pollution mankind is dumping into the atmosphere every year \nmakes a difference? What if it is warming the planet and changing the \nweather? What if it is warming the seas and raising their level and \nmaking them more acidic? What then? What if this is serious?\n  What if this is serious and we are not? What if this is serious and \nwe are sleepwalking when we should be awake? What if this is deadly \nserious and we are reckless when we should be responsible?\n  What if we are completely missing this moment in history? Winston \nChurchill talked about ``sharp agate points upon which . . . destiny \nturns.'' What if our destiny will turn based upon what we do about \ncarbon? What if we have been warned? What if we have been thoroughly \nand convincingly and reliably warned? What if we have been warned by \nvirtually every climate scientist--at least 95 percent of them--by the \nscientists who work for the United States of America at the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, at the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, by the vast majority of scientific societies, \nsuch as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the \nAmerican Geophysical Union, and the American Meteorological Society, \namong others?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from a great number of those \norganizations printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  What if we have been thoroughly and convincingly and reliably warned \nby thorough, convincing, and reliable scientists and have chosen \ninstead to listen to the cranks and the polluters?\n  Let's play this out a bit. Foresight is supposed to be a capability \nof our species. What if it turns out the world will care about this? We \nAmericans have held ourselves out as a beacon of light to other \nnations. We have proclaimed we are a shining city on a hill. What if \nthat is true? What if President Clinton was right; that the power of \nour American example is, indeed, greater than any example of our power? \nWhat if Daniel Webster was right; that if the example of our great \ndemocratic experiment ever became an argument against that experiment, \nit would sound the knell of popular liberty throughout the world? What \nif our political and moral failure to address carbon pollution became, \nin fact, an argument against our American example, an argument against \nour American example punctuated by the exclamation points of local \nclimate change happening right there in towns and barrios, hills and \nhamlets, on coasts and farms all around the world?\n  What if the world takes notice of that? What if the world takes \nnotice of what is already happening all around them and takes notice of \nhow we blew it at dealing with carbon pollution and, as a result, turns \naway from our great American experiment because of this conspicuous and \nconsequential failure of American democratic governance and leadership?\n  Let's really push it here. What if Abraham Lincoln was right, was not \njust making it up when he said America was ``the last best hope of \nEarth.'' The last best hope of Earth. He was not alone. Thomas \nJefferson too in his first inaugural said this American Government was \n``the world's best hope.''\n  What if we are, indeed, the last best hope of Earth, a hope which it \nis up to each American generation to, as Lincoln said, ``nobly save or \nmeanly lose''? What if we in this generation of Americans meanly lose \nsuch a measure of that American light and hope in the world? What if \nwe, the children of the ``greatest generation,'' were to blunder into \nhistory as the ``vilest generation'' because we failed so badly at this \nplain and present duty?\n\n  In sum, what if the deniers, the mockers, and the scoffers are wrong? \nWhat if they are wrong? Someone has to be. There are two sides to this. \nWhat if it is the deniers and the scoffers and the mockers who are \nwrong? What if the evidence keeps piling up and the tide of public \nopinion keeps going out and the deniers are left stranded with their \ninadequacies plainly visible?\n  Please, let's look at the two sides. On the side of waking up and \ndoing something about carbon pollution: the President of the United \nStates of America, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and our military leaders, \nthe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Council of the \nChurches of Christ, and many faith groups and leaders. On the side of \nwaking up: icons of our American corporate community, including GM, \nFord, Coke, Pepsi, Nike, Apple, Walmart, and hundreds of others. Also \non the side of waking up: the property casualty insurance and \nreinsurance industry and many in the electric utility industry and the \nvast majority of national scientific societies. In particular, I wish \nto mention the scientists at NASA who right now are driving an SUV-\nsized rover around on the surface of Mars. That might be an \norganization whose scientists actually know what they are talking \nabout.\n  What if it turns out that the other side of the argument is actually \nphony?\n  What if it turns out that the other side of the argument is a few \ncranks, a lot of people and organizations on the payroll of the \npolluters, and a cynical propaganda campaign intended to mislead and \ndeceive?\n  What if it is the argument that climate change is a hoax--which we \nhear around here--what if it is that argument that is the real hoax?\n  What if the so-called climategate scandal was no fraud at all, but \nthe whipped-up allegations were the fraud and the so-called climategate \nwas really climategate-gate?\n  What if that cynical, polluter-driven propaganda campaign is one of \nthe biggest and most successful frauds ever perpetrated on the public--\na fraud that, when it is ultimately exposed for what it is, will change \nthe way we think about political information and trust in corporations, \njust as my generation seeing the Cuyahoga River burn changed the way we \nthought about the environment?\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n  What if the great climate denial fraud will stand in the annals of \nAmerican scandal beside Watergate and Teapot Dome and the corruption \nleading up to the great crash of 1929 as a dark smear across the pages \nof our American history?\n  There was an iconic recruiting poster for World War I. I wish I had \nit with me, but I don't. It is a picture of a fellow sitting in his \narmchair with two little children, and they are asking him: ``Daddy, \nwhat did you do in the Great War?'' And he is looking sadly out at the \nviewer of the poster because clearly he had not done his part in the \ngreat war. That was the message of that poster--``Daddy, what did you \ndo in the Great War?'' What if we have to be asked by our children and \ngrandchildren, when they are studying this disgraceful episode in their \nhistory classes, ``Mommy, what did you do in the great climate fraud? \nGrandpa, what did you do in the great climate fraud?''\n  Why do I come every week to give these speeches? Because these \nquestions stick in my craw. These are the questions that haunt me and \nthat I can't shake. And upon the answer to these questions, to these \nwhat-ifs, the future may depend, destiny may turn. I have asked them \ntoday as questions, but many of the answers are already clear. Many of \nthe answers are crystal clear. Many of the answers are so likely clear \nthat no rational person would bet against them. And many of the answers \ncarry stakes so high that they cry out for prudent choices to be made.\n  Many of the answers are crystal clear--as clear as measurement. For \nat least 800,000 years the concentration of carbon dioxide in the \nEarth's atmosphere held between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon \ndioxide--for 800,000 years, always in that range. Now it is 400 parts \nper million and climbing. That is a measurement. Oceans are already 30 \npercent more acidic than before the Industrial Revolution and getting \nmore so. That is a measurement. The winter water temperature of \nNarragansett Bay has risen 4 degrees since the 1960s. That is a \nmeasurement. Millions of acres of western pine forest, once protected \nby cold, have been ravaged by the pine beetle. That is a measurement. \nThirteen of the past 15 years are among the hottest 15 years on record. \nThat is a measurement. Being against science is one thing. Being \nagainst measurement, that takes us to a new extreme.\n  Many of the answers are so likely clear that no rational, prudent \nperson would bet against them. The principle that carbon dioxide and \nwater vapor in the atmosphere create a greenhouse effect that warms the \nplanet goes back to the time of the American Civil War. It is firmly \nestablished science.\n  The head of the World Bank recently said, ``If you disagree with the \nscience of human-caused climate change, you are not disagreeing that \nthere is anthropogenic climate change; what you are disagreeing with is \nscience itself.''\n  I submit that my denier colleagues in their own personal lives would \nnever take the wild risks, the reckless risks they are asking us to \ntake on carbon. If they went to 100 doctors and 95 or more of the \ndoctors told them that their child or grandchild needed treatment and \nit was urgent, I doubt very much they would go with the three or four \nwho didn't. In fact, it would probably be a matter for their State \nchild welfare services if they ignored that kind of warning about the \nhealth of a child or a grandchild. But that is what they want us to do \non carbon pollution.\n  Many of the answers carry stakes so high that they plead for prudent \nand rational choices. The downside is so deep that the balance has to \nbe toward precaution if we are indeed a rational species. We are \ntalking about fundamental changes in the habitability of our planet, \nwith considerable human dislocation and disorder a likely result. We \nare talking about measurements of basic planetary conditions veering \noutside the entirety of human experience, to measurements whose \nantecedents are found only in geologic time and which we find there in \nthe geologic record, associated with massive disruptions, upheavals, \nand die-offs.\n  The facts are clearly measured, the principles are solid and sound, \nand the stakes are very high. Yet we sleepwalk on the precipice, \nrefusing to listen, refusing to speak of it, refusing to act when duty \ncalls us to act. It is time to wake up--or perhaps I should say, what \nif it really is time to wake up and we are just missing it, \nsleepwalking on the lip of the precipice, listening to the lullabies of \nthe polluters, and ignoring the facts and consequences that are plain \nto our sight and reason, plain in front of our faces? What then?\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Association for the\n\n\n                                       Advancement of Science,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2009.\n       Dear Senator:  As you consider climate change legislation, \n     we, as leaders of scientific organizations, write to state \n     the consensus scientific view.\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science. Moreover, there is \n     strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad \n     impacts on society, including the global economy and on the \n     environment. For the United States, climate change impacts \n     include sea level rise for coastal states, greater threats of \n     extreme weather events, and increased risk of regional water \n     scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and the \n     disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The \n     severity of climate change impacts is expected to increase \n     substantially in the coming decades \\1\\\n       If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate \n     change, emissions of greenhouse gases must be dramatically \n     reduced. In addition, adaptation will be necessary to address \n     those impacts that are already unavoidable. Adaptation \n     efforts include improved infrastructure design, more \n     sustainable management of water and other natural resources, \n     modified agricultural practices, and improved emergency \n     responses to storms, floods, fires and heat waves.\n       We in the scientific community offer our assistance to \n     inform your deliberations as you seek to address the impacts \n     of climate change.\n       \\1\\ The conclusions in this paragraph reflect the \n     scientific consensus represented by, for example, the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Global \n     Change Research Program.

Madam President, before my friend from Rhode Island \nleaves the floor, I wish to thank him for coming to the floor of the \nSenate every week to give a message that we need to hear all the time \nabout a serious worldwide crisis. I thank him for his passion and for \ncalling on us to remember that when it is time for our children and \ngrandchildren to ask where we were, I want to say I was with Senator \nSheldon Whitehouse and those of us who care deeply about solving these \nproblems. So I thank the Senator from Rhode Island very much.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who have come to the floor today and \nhave spoken on the issue of keeping student loan rates low. I know \nSenator Blumenthal was here a few minutes ago. Our chairman, Senator \nHarkin, has come to the floor, as well as Senator Brown, Senator \nSanders, and Senator Reed, who has been such a passionate advocate and \nleader on this\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nissue. I thank as well our Presiding Officer from Massachusetts for her \npassion in keeping us on point. I thank Senator Boxer and Senator \nMurray and others who have come to the floor, including Senator Kay \nHagan, who is leading this fight with Senator Jack Reed in what we \nintend to do tomorrow, which is focus on a very simple issue: Let's not \ndo harm to students as it relates to student loan rates going up, while \nwe fix the larger problem of affordability of college.\n  Let's be very clear. The majority of the Senate voted on June 6 to \nkeep student loan rates at 3.4 percent--the majority. When we run for \noffice, if one person gets one more vote than the other person, that \nperson wins the election, and that is a majority. So it is unfortunate \nthat a majority could not have ruled here, but because of the rules of \nthe Senate, because of the rights of the minority and the filibuster \nand so on, there have been objections from Republican colleagues, and \nwe have had to now go through this other process to overcome a \nfilibuster.\n  We had the vote, and the majority of the Senate voted to keep rates \nlow for students. Let's make that very clear. However, in order to \novercome a Republican filibuster, we need 60 votes to block that \nfilibuster. So tomorrow is about that vote.\n\n  We all know that on July 1 the interest rate for students jumped from \n3.4 to 6.8 percent. Let's all look at what is happening around in our \ncommunities with our families right now as well. Keep in mind, you can \nget a mortgage or a car loan for about 4 percent. So we are now seeing \nstudent loan interest rates higher than that. Under proposals we have \nseen predominantly coming from the other side of the aisle that would \nhave those rates go up and up based on ``the market,'' we could see \nthose rates go to 7, 8, 9, 10 percent in the future. It makes no sense.\n  If you can get a car loan, if you can get a mortgage for about 4 \npercent, what about students? Why are we now in a situation where \ncollege students are seeing their interest rates on their student loans \ndouble--double--or higher, which has been proposed by many in this \nbody?\n  To add insult to injury, if we do not fix this the Federal Government \nwill start to gain huge profits, as our Presiding Officer has reminded \nus over and over--more than $50 billion just this year on the backs of \nstudents and families.\n  So what we are looking at right now is billions of dollars in profits \non the backs of students if the rate is doubled. If it goes higher, if \nit goes to the 7 or 8 percent being talked about in the Republican \nproposals or the 8.5 percent that was passed in the House, we are \nlooking at over $100 billion--more than that--in profits by the Federal \nGovernment on the backs of students and families, right at a time when \nthey are just trying to hold it together.\n  They want to go to college. We want them to go to college. We want \nthem to get an education. We benefit as a country from making sure we \ncan outcompete and outeducate the competition around the world. Yet \nthose who say they care about students are proposing options that would \nincrease costs for students and profits for the Federal Government. We \nshould not be making profits on the backs of students who are trying to \ngo to college. So our proposal that we will be voting on tomorrow would \nlock in the 3.4-percent interest rate on student loans to make sure \nstudents and families can afford college.\n  I would like to share a couple of e-mails I have received out of \nthousands. I want to thank students and families all across Michigan \nwho have engaged in this effort, who have gone to DontDoubleMyRate to \nget information and tell their story, who have come to my Facebook page \nand have called us and e-mailed us to tell us how this impacts them.\n  Corey, a student right now at Central Michigan University in Mount \nPleasant, MI, wrote to me about this issue and said:\n\n       I am asking you to please not allow my student loan rates \n     to be doubled. I am a hard-working and respectful student. I \n     make all of my payments. I go to class and do well. I work \n     hard and am grateful for the chance to get a higher \n     education, but if student loan rates go up I would be left to \n     make a decision whether or not school would be affordable.\n\n  Whether or not school would be affordable--that is what this issue \ncomes down to.\n  If we do not fix this, and fix it in a responsible way that keeps \ncosts low, students like Corey and 7 million students across our \ncountry will have to rethink their college plans.\n  This issue should not be controversial. This is not a partisan issue. \nIf I were to pick a partisan issue on the floor of the Senate, it would \nnot be student loan interest rates and the cost of college. I would \nthink this is one of the areas on which we could come together.\n  Just last year we kept the interest rate low. We passed, for a year, \nan extension of the 3.4-percent rate. It was good enough to do last \nyear; I do not know why we cannot keep that going while we tackle the \nlong-term solutions. This should not be partisan. I know there are \npeople of goodwill on both sides of the aisle trying to figure out \nsomething. But, unfortunately, because of the desire of the other side \nof the aisle and the desire of the House to have this market based and \nfloat with the marketplace and go up with market interest rates, we \nfind ourselves in the situation where it is even worse to pass one of \nthe proposals that has been made rather than just allow the rates to go \nback up to the fixed rate of 6.8 percent, which is really crazy.\n  Republicans, in what we see in the House of Representatives, cap the \nrates at 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent. Now, again, remember, right now \nyou can get a car loan--you know, 15, 20 years, however long you \nfinance your car: 10, 15, 20 years--at 4 percent; have a 30-year \nmortgage at 3.5, 4 percent, 4.5 percent, 5 percent--all less than what \nwe are talking about for a student to be able to get a loan to be able \nto go to college, which we all say we want them to do.\n  We are lending to banks at a much lower rate, as our Presiding \nOfficer has reminded us over and over. I do understand it is a 24-hour \nlending rate. I do understand it is a different structure. But, still, \nif we can lend to banks at 0.75 percent, we cannot even fix a rate of \n3.4 percent for students, when we have a tremendous stake in their \nwillingness to go to school and work hard and be successful?\n  So under the plans we are seeing on the other side of the aisle and \nthe plan we have seen in the House of Representatives, we would see \nrates go to 7, 8, 9 percent; some of them tapped out at 10.5 percent--\n10.5 percent. It makes no sense.\n  Corey from Central continues with his e-mail:\n\n       From the time we first start learning, we are encouraged to \n     attend college and get a good job so that we can be a part of \n     helping this country grow. I am simply asking you to help \n     continue to make this an affordable option for me, and many \n     others like me.\n\n  Our country will not grow without a strong middle class, and we will \nnot have a middle class if people cannot get an education to get the \nskills they need, go to college, dream big dreams, and know they can be \nsuccessful in attaining those dreams.\n  We are saying we need to do everything possible to make sure students \ncan afford to go to college and that they do not come out with $20,000, \n$30,000, $50,000 of debt. I talk to medical students coming out with \n$100,000, $150,000 of debt. You could buy a house for that. Then, \nrather than making a decision maybe to go into primary care, where we \ncertainly need doctors, they have to decide to go into a specialty \nbecause they have to pay off their student loans. There are stories \nlike that all across our country--judgments being made.\n  So I have a very different view in terms of how we go about this--not \njust in the short run but what we lock in for the long term. The \nproposals on the other side lock in rates that will go up as interest \nrates go up. I do not think we should be doing that.\n  Here is another e-mail from Matthew in Royal Oak:\n\n       Students are not asking for a bailout like the one Wall \n     Street got, just an opportunity to obtain an affordable \n     education so we can compete in a global economy.\n\n  That is what we are talking about: Corey and Matthew and 7 million \nother people.\n  Let me conclude by saying that for me, this is very personal because \nI would not have been able to go to college, I would not have been able \nto be\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nthe first one to get a 4-year college degree in my own family if people \nI did not know in Michigan and in Washington had not decided that an \naffordable education was important to have.\n  My dad was very ill when I was in high school. I had great grades, \nbut we did not have very much money. Because of a tuition-and-fees \nscholarship I received and student loans I was able to go to college. I \nwant to make sure that every young person who wants to go to college \ncan do that, and that whether we know them or not--we know their name, \nwe know where they live--it does not matter. Nobody knew this red-\nheaded, freckle-faced kid from Clare, and yet because somebody put a \nvalue on education and its importance to our country, I have had the \nopportunities I have had in my life.\n  I think that is what this vote is about. Tomorrow is about keeping \nthe rates low, giving us time to address the broader issues around \naffordability. There is a lot of work to do. We can do that on a \nbipartisan basis, but first we need to start by doing no harm. That is \nthe vote tomorrow.\n  I hope we will see a ``yes'' vote on the Keep Student Loans \nAffordable Act.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if I might ask, through the \nChair, the Senator from Michigan a question. I notice her chart on 7 \nmillion students, and I wonder which 7 million students she is talking \nabout.\n  My understanding is there are 11 million students who will take out \nnew student loans this year, I believe that 2 million of them are low-\nincome students who get subsidized loans, and that the Democratic \nSenator's proposal would help those 2 million students by keeping their \nrate at 3.4 percent instead of 6.8 percent. So who are the 7 million \nstudents the Senator from Michigan is talking about?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, if I might respond, this number comes \nfrom the Joint Tax Committee. I would be happy to follow up with the \nSenator on that, but that is where the number comes from.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  It could be my numbers are wrong. I think the 7 million student \nfigure is actually a very good billboard for why not to support the \nDemocratic proposal but to support the bipartisan proposal because what \nthe proposal of the Senator from Michigan will do is keep rates high \nfor 7 million middle-income students whom her proposal does not help.\n  There are 11 million students across this country who are going to \ncollege this fall. They will take 18 million loans out. They will \nborrow over $100 billion. What happened on July 1 was that the rate \nwent back up to 6.8 percent for the loans that are for the lower income \nstudents--only those. For the loans that go to the middle-income \nstudents--and my understanding is there are about 7 million of those--\nit stays right where it is: 6.8 percent.\n  Under the bipartisan proposal, their rates would be 3.66 percent. In \nother words, the bipartisan proposal would not only create a permanent \nsolution, but it would lower rates--it would lower rates almost half--\nfor the 7 million middle-income students who otherwise would be \ntwisting in the wind for the next 10 years paying higher rates--\nhundreds of millions of dollars of higher rates.\n  So the number 7 million, I believe, is correct, I would say to the \nSenator from Michigan, but that is the number of middle-income students \nwho are going to be paying higher interest rates under her proposal. I \nam glad she brought up the number. If I am mistaken about that, I need \nto know it before tomorrow's vote because I believe there are 2 million \nstudents with subsidized loans. That is who the Senator seeks to help. \nThere are 7 million students who are undergraduates who have loans that \nare unsubsidized. Those are middle-income undergraduates. They are \ngoing to be paying 6.8 percent under the Senator's proposal. They are \ngoing to be paying 3.66 percent under the bipartisan proposal.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would my friend from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would be happy to, Madam President.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. First, in prefacing this in terms \nof the number the Senator asked me about before, we will check. I do \nknow there are about 300,000 students in Michigan affected, over \n500,000 in California. So that is almost 1 million. So the 2 million \nthe Senator is talking about seems low if those two States together \nhave about 850,000. But certainly we will check. We want to make sure \nthe numbers are right.\n  My question would be: The number the Senator quotes as the interest \nrate in his proposal, is that a fixed rate or will that go up?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is a fixed rate for the students who borrow the \nmoney this year.\n  Ms. STABENOW. For next year, though?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, if you are 1 of the 11 million students who \nborrow money under the bipartisan proposal--let's say you are an \nundergraduate, and that is two-thirds of the loans--your rate would be \n3.66 percent this year, next year, and for the next 10 years.\n  Next year it will be whatever it costs the government to borrow \nmoney. The government will loan it to the student, without overcharging \nthe student, in order to reduce the debt to pay for government programs \nor any other reason. So the formula would be that we would not add any \ncost to the taxpayers, but we would not overcharge the students to \nreduce the debt or to pay for a program. Next year the interest rate \nmight be higher. The next year it might be higher. But those would be \nfor new loans.\n  Then, of course, there are already two caps in the law that would be \ncontinued under the bipartisan proposal. One says that any student at \nany time can consolidate his or her loan at 8.25 percent. So the loan \ncannot go higher than that.\n  The second says while you are paying off your loan, you will not pay \nmore than about 10 percent of your income. If after 20 years or so you \nhave not paid off your loan, it is forgiven. So these are two caps that \nare already in the law.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Do I understand correctly, though, that for a student \nnext year who took out a loan, it might be higher? If a student took \nout a loan in year 3, it might be higher? It is my understanding that \nover time, over the next 3, 4, 5 years, we are looking at rates at \nleast of doubling, if not more. The Senator is saying cap it at 8.25. \nThat is a lot more than doubling of the rates that will happen right \nnow.\n  But is it accurate to say if the year in which you are taking out the \nloan, depending on whether it is next year, the year after, the year \nafter, that it would be in anticipation that the interest rate would \nrise?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say to the Senator through the Chair, she is \ncorrect. The idea of this is instead of Congress playing political \n``fix it'' during every election, we have turned this into a sort of \ndoc fix where we are treating students the same way we treat doctors \nwho serve Medicare patients. We run in here and have a big political \nfight about what we should be paying. Instead of doing that, we have a \npermanent solution that is based on what the market rate actually is. \nWe say whatever it costs the government, whatever it costs the \ntaxpayer, we loan it to the students at that level.\n  The Senator is correct; if it costs the government more to borrow the \nmoney because the rates are higher that year, the rate will be higher \nthat year. But there is the 8.25-percent cap. Throughout the history of \nthe student loan program, there have been caps in the past. There was a \n10-percent cap for about 15 years. There was a 9-percent cap for about \n20 years. If the Senator is suggesting there be a cap on the loan at a \nlower level than that, then the Senator will have to raise a lot of \nmoney.\n  For example, if we had a 6.8-percent cap on all loans going forward, \nmy guess would be that it would cost $50 billion or $60 billion over a \n10-year period of time. I do not know where we will get that money. So \nthe President made the proposal that we have a permanent solution. He \nsuggested that we take the amount of money--ask the Congressional \nBudget Office. This is not some Republican or Democratic figure. Ask \nthe Congressional Budget Office: What does it cost to borrow the money \nand to make the loans? Let's then loan it to the students. Let's not \novercharge them for any purpose. That is the proposal.\n  So my question would be, why would we do a short-term fix for 1 year \nthat\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\nbenefits a small percent of students, and leave 7 million middle-income \nstudents twisting in the wind, paying an interest rate that is nearly \ntwice as much as they would pay under the bipartisan permanent solution \nthat is based on the very same idea the President proposed, that the \nHouse of Representatives has passed, and that a bipartisan group here \nhas proposed?\n  I think the more Senators look into this and understand the cost of \nit, they will agree the goal is to say, we do not want to add any cost \nto the taxpayers, and we certainly do not want to overcharge the \nstudents on a loan, that they will come out with something about like \nwhat the bipartisan proposal is and what the House passed and what the \nPresident proposed.\n  If I could make one other comment, the Senator from Michigan was \ntalking about large loans for students. I agree that is a problem. I am \na former university president. I am a former Education Secretary. I \nhave watched this for a long time. I think a lot of students are \nborrowing too much money. We need to think about ways to change that. \nRight now, they are entitled to borrow certain amounts, even if the \ncollege thinks it is unwise for them to do that. Maybe we need to \nchange that. Maybe colleges need to have some skin in the game when \nthey make a loan, whether they are a public, or nonprofit or a for-\nprofit college. That is something we ought to look into.\n  But what we are debating this week is a simple question of what is a \nfair rate? What is a fair rate? The bipartisan proposal is an 8-page \nbill that says: Let's take what it costs the government to borrow the \nmoney, that is whatever the Congressional Budget Office says it is, \nlet's loan it to the students without any profit, and let's have two \ncaps on it going forward. One would be 8.25 percent. Any student could \nconsolidate any loans at that level if it goes higher. The other would \nbe a cap on how much you have to pay each year as you pay your loan \nback. I hope my friends on the other side recognize that unless I am \nmistaken, their proposal does help, for 1 year, 2 million low-income \nstudents who already have their interest paid by subsidy by the \ntaxpayers, who also are eligible, for the most part, for Pell grants. \nBut it does nothing for 7 million middle-income undergraduates whose \nrates on new loans will stay at 6.8 percent.\n  The bipartisan proposal would lower those rates to nearly half that \nlevel. Why would we leave those middle-income students--those 7 million \nmiddle-income students--twisting in the wind, paying twice as much in \ninterest rates as they need to pay? That is the question. I hope after \nthe vote tomorrow that we can sit down, talk this through, and come to \na result. We should not be having political gamesmanship about this. We \nare talking about 11 million families here, 18 million loans, over $100 \nbillion. We are talking about people who are making their plans to go \nto college. It is not easy to go. Many Senators have talked about that.\n  People might have $100,000 in loans, but they cannot get it through \nthe subsidized loan program. You can only receive up to $23,000 that \nway. We can look at all of that at some point. But we need to pass this \n8-page bill, set a fair rate, spare the taxpayers, spare the students. \nThere is no need to deal with ``some of the loans,'' when we can lower \nrates for ``all of the loans'' and put it on a permanent fair basis, \nvery much in the way the President recommended in his budget, very much \nin the way the House of Representatives passed it, and very much in the \nway the bipartisan group has suggested.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am going to be brief, because things \nwent a little longer. First, I have a great deal of respect for my good \nfriend, and he truly is my good friend, the Senator from Tennessee. I \nunderstand what he is getting at. I certainly agree with one part of \nhis comments that the unsubsidized and subsidized students should be \ngiven good treatment. We should not just aim at 2 million when there \nare 7 million more. I am on board with that.\n  I would make three points in reference to my colleague's comments and \nin reference to the bill, and why I am a sponsor of the Jack Reed bill. \nFirst, the bottom line is, we here are in this mystical world of \nbaselines. Under present law, the government actually will make about \n$180 billion from students over the next 10 years. It is revenue \nneutral in the budgetary sense, but not in the family sense, in the \nsense that families are actually going to end up paying more.\n  My good friend from Tennessee and many on his side--and they are \nbudget hawks--say they do not want to see that baseline changed. So \nthey have come up with a fine proposal if you believe that you should \nnot change that baseline. But if you believe, as I do, that actually \nthe government should not be making extra money from the students as \nthey pay, even if it means dipping into our Federal accounts to make \nthat happen, then it is not such a fine proposal. But let's not confuse \nbudget neutrality with neutrality between what the government does and \nwhat students get.\n  The proposal is indeed budget neutral, as would be letting things \nexpire. The proposal is not family neutral. Students end up paying \nmore, more than the government's cost. That is point No. 1. I know my \ncolleague understands, and that is the dilemma we are in because there \nare different values here. To me, if I had to do one thing, one of my \nhighest priorities and where the Federal Government ought to help out \nfamilies, middle-class families, is helping pay for the cost of \ncollege.\n  Revenue neutrality, particularly at an artificially high baseline, \n6.8 percent, does not help out families, does not make it worse than \nthe present baseline, does not make it better. I would like to make it \nbetter.\n  Second point. I have spent much of my time in the Senate helping \nmiddle-class families pay for college. I am the author of the American \nOpportunity Tax Credit which gives every middle-class family up to \n$180,000. So I agree with my colleague's point about the middle class, \ngives them--I know he is going to want to ask me a question, but I \ncannot. I will come back. I have a meeting on this issue with some of \nthe people from the White House right now, so I am not going to be able \nto answer a question. I do not want my colleague to stay.\n  I believe in this strongly. The tax credit is something I am proud \nof. That is on the books for 5 years, $2,500 in the pockets of middle-\nclass families to help pay for college. But one of the problems we face \nis, every time we give the students a break, the colleges raise \ntuition. So the family is not any easier off paying for college. We \nneed something to deal with that issue. I do not know what it is, but \nit will not be in any plan we are going to pass in the next week or \ntwo. So my view, to extend the present 3.4-percent rate for 1 year, to \nkeep the situation the way it was before July 1 for a year while we \ncome up with that type of solution, makes sense, makes a good deal of \nsense.\n  Third. We have another problem. A lot of these for-profit colleges \nhave a high default rate. They raise the rates for everyone else. What \nare we going to do about those? Some of those are not for-profit. But \nany college that helps students get a lot of loans, and then has a huge \ndefault rate, low graduation rate, makes all the rest of us pay. It is \na little like health care, where a few people are making the rest of us \npay quite a bit. That was through no fault of their own. Who knows what \nthis is. What do we do about them?\n  I agree with my good friend from Tennessee, we do not want to keep \ndoing this year to year, like the doc fix. It would be a lot better, \njust like the doc fix, if we had a permanent solution that deals with \nthese two issues instead of brushes over them. A 1-year extension \nkeeping the present situation, not raising anybody's rates at all, \nmakes sense, because while students will gain some, not probably as \nmuch as under present law, under the Reed law, now they may lose a lot \nlater, because there are no caps except for the 8.25 percent when you \nrefinance. But otherwise, the caps are each year. You can be 3.4 this \nyear, and if interest rates go up 3 percent, you will be at 6.4 next \nyear. If they go up 2 percent after that, you will be at 8.4. If they \ngo up 2 percent after that, you will be at 10.4 for your 4 years in \ncollege.\n  We do not know what interest rates will be. It is anybody's guess. \nBut that is why caps are a good thing, so when\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\nit gets too high, we have some limit. I am not sure a cap simply on \nconsolidation is a good enough cap.\n  I respect my friend from Tennessee, but I would argue there are two \nreasons that the proposal Senator Stabenow talked about is better: One, \nit does not make money from students to pay the government, which using \nthe present baseline and being budget neutral we would have to continue \nto do.\n  No. 2, it doesn't allow us to get to a long-term solution, which we \nmust do and should do, and maybe now that we are in this dilemma we are \nimportuned for doing.\n  I wish to have a colloquy with my colleague from Tennessee. I will be \nback after this meeting if he is still around. I respect him, and I \nknow he is trying to come up with a fair and good solution--one that \nideologically or substantively I might disagree with, but I hope we \nkeep moving toward one another so we can gain a good solution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New York. I understand he has \na previous meeting. I don't want to make him late because maybe it will \nproduce some result. I hope it will produce a result--I don't see an \nissue that benefits either political party or any Senator.\n  The questions we who have been working on this have asked the \nCongressional Budget Office are very simple. We have said our goal is \nto create a permanent solution along the lines the President \nrecommended, that the House of Representatives has now passed, that \nneither costs the taxpayers additional money or overcharges the \nstudent. Please give us what the interest rates would be and what the \ntype of loan should be.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, goes through all of this and they suggest a variety of options \nthat we have.\n  What they have told us is that the proposal of the bipartisan group \ncomes as close to being equal as one can get. It is about nearly $1 \nbillion over 10 years which, when you are loaning $100 billion a year, \nis sort of a rounding error.\n  The intention is to loan it to the students for what it costs the \ngovernment to borrow the money, but we are not going to overcharge the \nstudents and we are not going to ask the taxpayers to pay an additional \nsubsidy.\n  Within that, if you accepted that idea, then you could say there are \na variety of ways to do that. You could do it as the bipartisan group \nhas suggested or you could try to put a cap on it. Whenever you put a \ncap on, it costs a lot more to students. A cap at 10 doesn't cost very \nmuch because the interest rates aren't estimated to be that high for \nundergraduates especially. But as you go down to 9, 8, 7 or 6.8, it \nballoons very rapidly. We could meet that principle, fair to taxpayers \nand fair to students, but we are going to have to raise a lot of money \nto do it. I haven't heard anybody suggest where $50 or $60 million more \nis going to come from.\n  I think it is better to go ahead and amend the House bill, get a \nbetter bill, put the Senate's imprint on it, and send it to the \nPresident. Let's let all of today's students take advantage of today's \nlow rates and pass a permanent solution that would reflect what the \nactual cost is. It may go up; it may go down. That is the reality.\n  As we know, with low-income students, those eligible for subsidized \nloans, the taxpayer already pays the interest on those loans while the \nstudent is in college. That is about $50 billion over 10 years. Those \nstudents are also eligible for Pell grants, most of them are, and that \nis about $350 billion over 10 years. This is a substantial subsidy.\n  The Senator mentioned the Federal Credit Reform Act. The Federal \nCredit Reform Act is the way the Congress has said the CBO should count \nwhen it is making these computations, so it does that. It also does it \naccording to a fair value method of accounting. Maybe the simplest way \nto explain it is to say the Federal Credit Reform Act actually favors \nstudents pretty heavily in this computation. The fair market value \naccounting is more realistic, and favors the taxpayers' point of view. \nWe are using the accounting system--or the CBO is--for this bill that \nis more generous to students.\n  I still, after listening respectfully to all I have heard, don't see \nwhy in the world we are going to insist that for the next year several \nmillion middle-income students are going to have to pay 6.8 percent \nwhen they could be paying 3.66. This is what I can't understand. I hope \nwe continue this debate and tomorrow we will have at least one vote on \nit. I hope after that we have more discussion and that we come to a \nresult because there are a lot of families waiting for us to make a \ndecision.\n  The President has weighed in. The House of Representatives has passed \na bill. We have a bipartisan bill on the floor. We need to come to a \nresult, send it to the President so families can make their decisions \nabout how they are going to pay the college bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Last year the most profitable company in America was \nExxonMobil. ExxonMobil made about $44.9 billion in profit last year. \nAmerica's student loan program did better. America's student loan \nprogram last year made a profit of right around $50 billion, eclipsing \nthe profit of ExxonMobil, of Apple, of JPMorgan Chase. In fact, of \nevery U.S.-based company, none of them ran a profit as high, as steep, \nas generous as the U.S. student loan program did.\n  Why I am coming down to the floor to support a 1-year freeze on \nstudent loan rates is because, as you have led this argument, that is \nthe discussion we should be having. Why on Earth do we allow our \nstudent loan program to make profits greater than any other American \ncompany makes today? Why are our students being asked, more so than \nalmost any other population in our country, to bear the burden of \npaying down our deficit? It doesn't make any sense.\n  It is time then that in the context of the Higher Education Act, \nwhich we are hopefully going to debate later this year, we have that \nbroader conversation. This bill on the floor now, giving us a 1-year \nfreeze to keep students where they are today, paying a 3.4-percent \ninterest rate, just makes sense--both in the short term to try to make \nsure students don't have to pay upward of $5,000 over the course of the \nrepayment of their loan but then allows us to start to have a \nconversation with ourselves as to whether we want to allow the student \nloan program to be the most profitable company in the United States on \nthe backs of students.\n  This matters to me because I am one of the millions of young \nAmericans who is still paying back my student loans. My wife and I are \npaying them back as we speak. Of course, with two young little boys at \nhome, we are also scurrying to save as much as we can to pay for their \nfuture college costs.\n  I am not going to stand here and complain because between my wife and \nI we make a pretty good salary. We can afford to pay back our student \nloans, and we can afford to squirrel a little bit away for our two \nlittle kids. But our story is not the reality for millions of other \nyoung families who can't afford to do both of those things.\n  The average college graduate in this country has a much lower \nunemployment rate than other Americans, somewhere around 4 or 5 \npercent. Young college graduates today stand at an 8.8-percent \nunemployment rate and an 18.3-percent underemployment rate. That is the \nstuff we don't talk about enough. There are a lot of young people who \nare working part-time or temporary jobs that don't bring in enough \nmoney in order to pay back their student loans, which on average today \nare somewhere around $30,000. That is the average. Everybody can point \nto a neighbor or a friend who is walking out of their undergraduate \neducation today with $100,000 or more.\n  The fact is there are millions of families in the position of my \nfamily. We are squeezed between paying back the debt we owe and trying \nto put away money so our kids don't have to have the same kind of debt \nwe do. That is money that doesn't go into the main street of our \neconomy, doesn't go to fix up your house and put a carpenter to work, \nand doesn't go to the local grocery store or to the restaurant around \nthe corner. Instead, it is money that gets sent, by and large, to the \nbig banks. It doesn't make sense. This bill on the floor allows us to \nhave this bigger, broader conversation.\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\n  I will say this though. We are fooling ourselves if we think the \nsolution to our higher education affordability crisis is only the \ninterest rate we pay on loans. It is not. Shame on us if coming out of \nthe resolution of this debate, which I hope comes in the next couple of \nweeks, we don't step back and say there is so much more that this \nSenate and this Congress can be doing to take on the broader issue of \naffordability.\n  Students took out about $113 billion in student loans this last year. \nThat is double what they took out just 10 years ago. We can't afford to \nhave the amount of money being taken out in student loans double on a \ndecade-by-decade basis. That will bankrupt not only our students, but \nit will bankrupt our country no matter what interest rate we put on \nthese loans.\n  In the context of the Higher Education Act, we ought to start \nchallenging schools to think out of the box when it comes to assessing \nthe cost of education. Wesleyan University in Connecticut has given the \noption to students to get a degree in 3 years instead of 4. More and \nmore schools are moving to cheaper but still high-value online \neducation.\n  It is probably time we stepped back and asked even tougher questions \nabout whether it makes sense to award degrees based on a largely \narbitrary number of credits, rather than an assessment of the skills \nyou have gained, maybe over 4 years but, frankly, maybe even over 2\\1/\n2\\ or 3 years.\n  If college is about preparing students for the workforce, then maybe \nwe should be awarding degrees and costing out degrees based on whether \nyou are ready to enter the workforce, not just based on if you have \ngone the requisite number of years or taken the requisite number of \ncourses. Maybe 50 years ago we could afford the system we have, but we \ncan't any longer. We can't have that conversation if we don't settle \nthis one.\n  My hope is we will be able to extend the 3.4-percent interest rate \nfor the time being and that we can have a serious conversation about \nthe issue of profitability in the long run.\n  Lastly, I will just say this. Senator Alexander has left the floor, \nbut the Republican proposal is temporary as well. He is right to point \nout that for a certain subset of individuals who don't qualify today \nfor the 3.4-interest rate, the Republican proposal may, in the short \nrun, provide a different lower interest rate. But we know interest \nrates are going up. We know their proposal is no less temporary than \nthe 1-year freeze we offered, because ultimately in the long run or, \nfrankly, in the medium run, those students who today might qualify for \na lower rate are going to be paying a much higher rate in the not-so-\ndistant future.\n  We are kidding ourselves if we think the benefit of the Republican \nproposal is that in the long run students are all of a sudden going to \ngain the benefit of today's interest rates, which is not how things \nwork. It is not how the trend line is going.\n  Lastly, about 1 month ago I was sitting with a group of counselors at \na local afterschool program in Danbury, CT. They were all sort of \nworking part-time jobs and counseling kids at this afterschool program \nbecause they believed in the program. These were community-minded kids. \nThey were the salt-of-the-Earth kids who truly cared about trying to \nhelp out disadvantaged youth in their neighborhood, but none of them \nwere going to college.\n  I asked them: Are you not going to college because of the cost?\n  They looked at me as if I had three heads. They said: Of course, the \nreason we are not going to college is the cost. We would love to be in \ncollege today, but there is no way we can afford it.\n  The fact is we are looking at 4.4 million students over the next 10 \nyears who are likely to not be able to afford college simply because of \nthe cost. The difference between 3.4 and 6.8 percent can be $5,000 for \nsome students over the course of the repayment of their loan. That is \nthe difference maker for students. We are kidding ourselves if we don't \nthink that 18- and 19-year-old kids aren't doing the math when they are \ndeciding whether they can afford to go to college. They are much more \nsophisticated than people on this floor think they are. They understand \nthe deal we are potentially giving them on the floor of the Senate is \none that will make college unaffordable for tens, if not hundreds, of \nthousands of students. Shame on us if we don't have a better answer for \nthose kids in Danbury, CT, and millions of others similar to them \nacross the country who just want a shot at college and wish to make \nsure that they alone are not asked to pick up the burden of paying down \nthe deficit of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable, the bill that has been introduced by Senators \nReed and Hagan. We have been talking a lot in the last few hours about \nstudent loans, about the cost of student loans, and we have talked \nparticularly about subsidized loans.\n  I just want to start this by pointing out that ``subsidized loans'' \nis not the right term. No one is subsidizing any of our students. The \nlowest cost loans the U.S. Government issues today produce a profit for \nthe government. In other words, who is doing the subsidizing? Our \nstudents are doing the subsidizing. They are the ones who are creating \nthe profits for the U.S. Government.\n  Let's talk about those profits. This year those profits, as the \nPresiding Officer rightly pointed out, will be more than $50 billion. \nThose are profits made on the student loans that are already \noutstanding and the profits we are going to start making off the new \nloans when the interest rate doubles at 6.8 percent.\n  Under this bill, Keep Student Loans Affordable Act, we are talking \nabout how to prevent making even more profits off our students--a \nshort-term patch to hold interest rates steady for all of our students \nwhile we try to attack the core problems.\n  The problem we have as we deal with this, and the problem with the \nRepublican proposal, is right now the new loans are scheduled to \nproduce $184 billion in profits for the U.S. Government over the next \n10 years.\n  Let me say that again. At the current interest rate of 6.8 percent, \nwhich is where it went as of July 1 since Congress didn't act, the U.S. \nGovernment will make $184 billion in profits off our students over the \nnext 10 years.\n  The Republicans have put forward a plan, and they have said in their \nplan that they want to be ``budget neutral'' or ``deficit neutral.'' \nThey have used both terms. But understand what that means. The proposal \nthey are putting forward, in fact, produces $184 billion in profits for \nthe U.S. Government. In fact, the Republican plan goes just a little \nbeyond that and produces an extra $1 billion in profits for the U.S. \nGovernment. That is what the Republicans are putting forward.\n  How can you sell something that says we are going to make $185 \nbillion off the backs of our students? The answer is, according to the \nRepublicans, to offer them a teaser rate. Tell them that just next year \nwe are going to keep that interest rate low. The year after that, well, \nit might be a little bit higher, and the year after that it might just \nbe a little higher than that, and don't ask any questions about the \nyears going forward.\n  But understand this: Senator Alexander, for whom I have deep respect, \nmade the point he just wanted to use the CBO's scoring numbers. That is \nthe neutral arbiter of what things cost. What does the CBO say about \nthe Republican plan? The answer is it will produce more--that is just a \nlittle bit more--than the same $184 billion in profits that come from \ndoubling the student loan interest rate to 6.8 percent.\n  In other words, what the Republicans are proposing is the same thing \nyou got in the mail when you got this zero percent interest teaser rate \ncredit card. Boy, we will give you something cheap up front, but don't \nread the fine print, and don't see what is going to happen on down the \nline--or the same thing that happened with the teaser-rate mortgages. \nThey were nice low payments at the beginning, until the whole thing \nexploded later on.\n  That is the Republican plan. It is not a fix, it is just a different \nway to make $184 billion in profits off the backs of our students.\n  What the Democrats are proposing is a plan that says: Don't raise the \ninterest rates on anybody. Just keep them where they are, including 3.4 \npercent on our Stafford loans. Let's keep it there.\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\n  Here is a point I want to make that I haven't heard anybody talking \nabout. What the Democratic proposal has in it is an acknowledgement \nthat the U.S. Government is going to make less money doing that because \nthere is no back end to make this up. Because the U.S. Government is \ngoing to lose money--it is not going to make as much money by doing \nthat--this plan has something in it to pay for it, to offset the cost \nto the budget. We have proposed closing a tax loophole, raising about \n$4 billion in new revenues so we don't make that $4 billion in revenues \noff our kids immediately.\n  In other words, if we are going to reduce the profits we are trying \nto make from our kids, there has to be a way to pay for it. The plan \nproposed by the Democrats is short term. It is a 1-year fix, and it has \na proposal to pay for it because it actually proposes reducing the \nprofits the U.S. Government makes.\n  Take a look at the Republican plan. There is no pay in the Republican \nplan because it proposes to continue to make that $184 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  So that is what this is about. We know what we need in the long term \nis to solve two big problems: The first is the $1 trillion in \noutstanding student loan debt. We have to find a better way to deal \nwith it, a way that is not continuing to produce profits for the U.S. \ngovernment. The second is the rising cost of college. We have to \naddress that, and it is going to be a hard problem to tackle. We can't \nsolve it in a matter of a few days. It takes time to do it.\n  So the Democrats propose: Don't raise interest rates on anyone. Don't \ndouble my rate. Keep them where they are, and let's buy a year with a \nshort-term patch in order to address the systemic problems we need to \naddress--the outstanding student loan debt and the rising cost of \ncollege for all of our students.\n  This is our chance to help our students. This is a small downpayment. \nIt is a small help for some of our students and a real commitment that \nwe are going to make a difference in the future. It is not a proposal \nthat says we are going to try to fool them, that we are going to reduce \nprices just for a little while and then sock somebody else on the back \nend. That is not what this should be about. That is not what the U.S. \nGovernment should be doing. It is our responsibility, it is our \nopportunity to invest in our students.\n  The Democrats propose we get started on that and we get started on it \ntomorrow. I support the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act, and I \ncommend Senator Reed and Senator Hagan for their work. I hope tomorrow \nthis body will come together and pass it for our students and for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly).

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate John \nBreitfelder of New Canaan, who was selected to represent Connecticut in \nthis year's Healthy Lunchtime Challenge contest hosted by First Lady \nMichelle Obama.\n  Today, John joins 54 students, ages 8 to 12, at the White House for a \nKids' State Dinner. These winners hailing from all 50 States, 3 U.S. \nterritories, and the District of Columbia will share a healthy lunch \nfeaturing their winning recipes. John's creation, a quinoa ``risotto'' \nwith shrimp and kale was selected from over 1,300 recipes evaluated by \na panel of judges, which included representatives from the First Lady's \nLet's Move!, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of \nEducation, DC Central Kitchen, and two student graduates of the Share \nOur Strength's Cooking Matters Program. The contest ``invited a parent \nor guardian to work with their child ages 8-12 to create a lunchtime \nrecipe that is healthy, affordable, original, and delicious.'' The \nwinning recipes adhere to the USDA's MyPlate guidelines, featuring each \nof the food groups.\n  I applaud John for taking the initiative to enter this contest to \nexplore how healthy foods can also be delicious, and the support of his \nfamily. This innovative competition not only combats childhood obesity, \nbut also raises awareness of the importance of cooking for overall \nhealth as well as success in the classroom.

Mr. President, Delaware's law enforcement officers \ndo their jobs day in and day out with exceptional courage and \ndedication.\n  When the worst happens in our community, our emergency responders \nrush toward danger while everyone else is rushing away.\n  It is my honor to congratulate four outstanding law enforcement \nofficers on receiving the Lieutenant Joseph L. Szczerba Service Award, \npresented to Delawareans who go above and beyond the call of duty.\n  It is hard to think of more deserving public servants than these four \nheroes: Officer Justin Wilkers of the Wilmington Police Department and \nOfficers Steven Rinehart, Michael Manley, and Arlene Redmond of the \nCapitol Police.\n  Each of their stories is heroic.\n  On February 3 of this year, Officer Wilkers and his partner pulled \nover an SUV for a motor vehicle violation. In what should have been a \nroutine traffic stop, the suspect instead raised a gun and fired at \nOfficer Wilkers, hitting him in the face.\n  Officer Wilkers was treated at Christiana Hospital for his injuries, \nand when he was released a week later, Delaware police officers lined \nup outside the hospital in applause.\n  With typical modesty, he said, ``'I don't understand what the big \ndeal is.''\n  The truth is, this kind of service and sacrifice is a big deal. Just \n3 days after Officer Wilkers was injured in the line of duty, we saw \nonce again how our law enforcement officers give us their best in the \nvery worst of situations.\n  February 12 began like any other day at the New Castle County \nCourthouse, but that morning, a suspect in the lobby began shooting. \nCapitol police officers jumped into action and were immediately \ntargeted by the shooter.\n  Officers Steven Rinehart and Michael Manley were hit in the chest. \nThankfully they were wearing bullet-resistant vests that saved their \nlives. Along with Officer Arlene Redmond, they showed courage when it \ncounted the most.\n  I will keep working to ensure Delaware's law enforcement officers \nhave all of the tools they need to do their jobs and stay safe, \nincluding the kind of bullet-resistant vests that saved the lives of \nOfficers Rinehart and Manley in the Wilmington courthouse that day.\n  These brave men and women put their lives at risk every time they put \non a uniform to protect Delawareans. Almost 2 years ago, my friend, \nLieutenant Joe Szczerba, was taken from us\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nin a senseless crime, an act of cowardice dwarfed by Joe's \nextraordinary courage and sacrifice.\n  The Lieutenant Joseph L. Szczerba Service Award helps to ensure that \nhis memory lives on for years to come.\n  This year, there could be no recipients more deserving than Officers \nWilkers, Rinehart, Manley, and Redmond. They have my congratulations \nand my deepest gratitude for their service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5565-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ESCANABA, MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the city of Escanaba celebrates its \nsesquicentennial anniversary this year. This great occasion will be \nmarked by a host of festivities. Escanaba, like many cities and towns \nacross the Upper Peninsula in Michigan, has added greatly to our \nState's rich history and cultural heritage. It is through active \ncommunities like Escanaba that the spark of innovation and ingenuity \nhas been nurtured for generations.\n  Escanaba is a city with a natural charm that is impossible to miss. \nThe city is named after the Escanaba River, a 52-mile winding river \nthat is central to the formation and growth of the city. Lured by the \nmajestic river of flat rocks, travelers settled in this region to \ncultivate the area's many natural features and to live alongside the \nLittle Bay de Noc. These waterways are the lifeblood of this community. \nThe city is full of wonder and opportunity for the families who make \nthis community home. It is also a fertile ground for wildlife and an \ninviting host for fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts alike.\n  The first permanent settlement dates back to the 1830s to Louis \nRoberts, a fur trader. A steady stream of families would follow Mr. \nRoberts to the area, and soon after, sawmills would eventually spring \nup along the river. The area that would become Escanaba was surveyed by \nEli P. Royce and formally established in 1863. It is from these humble \nbeginnings that this city by the river was formed. The sawmills fueled \ninvestment and industry, and the city's population grew as a result. \nToday, the area is home to manufacturing, lumbering, hardwood flooring, \ncommercial fishing, paper making, and more. As with many cities and \ntowns in the Upper Peninsula, Escanaba's history is both fascinating \nand full of character. It is steeped in family, faith, and \nperseverance.\n  There are many reasons to visit this part of Michigan and to enjoy \nwhat makes this area special. In addition to the striking natural \nwonder that abounds, Escanaba also offers a number of historically \nsignificant landmarks, including the House of Ludington, Ludington \nPark, William Bonifas Fine Arts Center, and Sandy Point Lighthouse. The \nSandy Point Lighthouse was built in 1867 to welcome travelers to the \ncity by boat. This vital structure predates the railroad and would \nserve an integral role in the city's development for seven decades.\n  The 150th anniversary of Escanaba is a celebration of the important \nplace this proud community holds in the ever-evolving story of our \ngreat State of Michigan. It is, indeed, a tribute to the strength and \nperseverance of its citizens and emblematic of America's working \nfamilies who form the foundation of sprawling and vibrant communities \nacross our Nation. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in \nsaluting the residents of Escanaba as they celebrate the \nsesquicentennial anniversary of this fine city. I wish them centuries \nmore opportunity, advancements, and individual achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5565-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. BARRY L. BOOTH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nDr. Barry L. Booth of Spanish Fort, AL. I have had the great fortune to \nwork with Dr. Booth on a variety of projects in South Alabama, \nincluding the Honor Flight South Alabama program, the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial at the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, and the creation \nof the Alabama State Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Spanish Fort, AL. \nThey have been remarkable successes, in great part through the \nleadership of Dr. Booth.\n  Barry Booth was born and raised in humble conditions in West \nVirginia. He worked hard, took care of his grades, and was admitted to \nAuburn University. He hitchhiked to Auburn where he says he arrived \nwith ``empty pockets.'' He enrolled in the Naval ROTC and was \ncommissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve upon his \ngraduation from the University of Alabama, School of Dentistry in 1966 \nand that same year he volunteered for active duty, signed with the \nMarine Corps in San Diego, and in 1967 volunteered to go to Vietnam as \na medical civil action patrol dental officer with the 3rd Marine \nDivision and the U.S. Army 5th Special Forces.\n  Dr. Booth earned a Gold Parachutist Device, the U.S. Navy Unit \nCommendation, and the Vietnam Service Medal, among others. He was \nhonorably discharged in July 1969. It is clear that his patriotism has \ncontinued to grow since joining the Marine Corps. In fact, in the wake \nof the terrible events of September 11, 2001, Dr. Booth attempted to \nrejoin the Marine Corps, at age 60, and had to be officially denied.\n  Dr. Booth has been a busy and invaluable servant to the veterans in \nSouth Alabama. He was vital to the establishment of the Honor Flight \nSouth Alabama program. Honor Flight South Alabama has brought over a \nthousand veterans and their companions to the memorials they earned, \nincluding the World War II Memorial, here in Washington, D.C. I have \ntaken great pleasure in having the chance to share in the fellowship of \nthese veterans. They are truly a remarkable breed of patriots. They \nendured and survived the biggest war in the history of the world, and \ntruly deserve such a great memorial in their honor. I appreciate the \nconsiderable good work Dr. Booth, and the rest of his team, have done \nto bring these wonderful veterans to our Nation's Capital.\n  Dr. Booth also helped develop the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at the \nUSS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park. Because of this memorial, many \npeople in the Mobile region have had the opportunity to learn more \nabout the sacrifices made by our Vietnam veterans. This memorial will \nserve as an important reminder of what these servicemembers endured.\n  In addition, Dr. Booth was pivotal in the creation of the Alabama \nState Veterans Memorial Cemetery. In addition to his time and \nresources, he even donated 3 acres of family land for the now-active \ncemetery at Saluda Hill near Historic Blakely State Park. For 50 years \nbefore this, the State of Alabama had not had the space to bury new \nveterans in a State veteran's cemetery. The new cemetery provides South \nAlabama veterans a proper, dignified, and peaceful burial area.\n  Lastly, Dr. Booth has contributed to a number of veteran and service \norganizations through his active membership. He is a member of the \nVietnam Veterans of America Chapter 864, the Navy League, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, the Sons of the American Revolution, \nand is a life member of both American Legion Post 199 and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars. For his commitment, he was named 2009 Veteran of the \nYear by the Mobile Bay Area Veterans Day Commission and Fairhope, \nAlabama's Veteran of the Year for 2011.\n  For years I have enjoyed the kindness and warmth of Barry's \nfriendship. He has been critical to the success of a number of projects \nwe have worked on together. He is a true patriot, and a good man who \nexpects nothing in return for his efforts. He simply understands what \nour military personnel are called upon to do for their country, he has \nseen it first hand, he knows the pain of loss and injury, and his \nloyalty to them compels him to do all he can to honor their service. I \nwould like to thank him for his service to his fellow veterans, to the \nState of Alabama, and to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5565-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5565-S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

He developed his interest for these subjects \nwhile attending\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nAuburn University, where he graduated in 1962. The items he has \nassembled over his lifetime represent a broad range of our country and \nAlabama's history, and the exhibit represents the finest items in the \nVick collection. On display is a vast assortment of historic American \nand international postal stamps, marks, and correspondence, and \nincludes letters from Confederate Marine Corps Lt. Edward Crenshaw of \nButler County and Raphael Semmes, captain of the C.S.S. Alabama. These \nitems, numbering in the thousands, will be invaluable to researchers \nfor years to come.\n  This exhibit is currently being displayed in the Special Collections \nand Archives Department of the Ralph Brown Draughon Library, and is a \nfantastic showcase of both the generosity of the Vicks and their love \nfor Auburn University. I encourage anyone with an interest in the \nhistory of Alabama to visit the exhibition. Again, I thank John and \nFaye for their kind gift to Auburn University and the people of \nAlabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5566-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL WILLIE J. WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Lt. Gen. \nWillie Williams for his exceptional service to our Nation of over 39 \nyears in the military and to congratulate him on his retirement \ntomorrow from the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  General Williams has had nearly four decades of distinguished and \nhonorable service to our Nation's defense. He joined the Marine Corps \nwith a commission in 1974 from the Platoon Leaders Course after \nreceiving his bachelor of arts degree in business administration from \nStillman College in Tuscaloosa, AL. He started out as a supply officer \nwith 11th Marines, an artillery regiment, but would go on to serve in \nnumerous command and staff positions throughout his exemplary career in \nthe Marine Corps.\n  In the late 1980s, near the end of the Iran-Iraq war, General \nWilliams was handpicked to lead the logistics element in the Marine \nair-ground task force that was a part of Operation Earnest Will, the \nmission to escort and protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Lessons \nlearned from that operation laid the foundation for how the corps would \napproach resupply into the region during the first Persian Gulf war and \nlater during the occupation of Iraq.\n  General Williams once said that the assignment during the Iran-Iraq \nwar defined him as an ``operational logistician.'' He then went on to \ncommand the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit's Service Support Group \nfollowed by Brigade Service Support Group 1, both during the mid-1990s. \nThen, after serving a year as the commanding general of Camp Butler in \nOkinawa, General Williams took command of 3rd Force Service Support \nGroup in 2001.\n  From there, he was selected for the top job at Marine Corps Logistics \nCommand in Albany, GA, a hub for the service's worldwide supply chain \nand equipment maintenance efforts. This hub helped with the logistical \noperation for as many as 25,000 Marines in Iraq's Anbar province at the \ntime of his command.\n  For his last assignment, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, then \nGen. James T. Conway, called General Williams back to Washington in \n2009 to become the director of Marine Corps Staff. He was appointed by \nPresident Obama and pinned on his third star, placing him among the \nselect group of only 16 lieutenant generals in the Marine Corps. In \nthis new capacity, General Williams was the principal assistant and \nadvisor to the Commandant and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps. \nAdditionally, General Williams also maintained influential \ncommunication with his counterparts in the Army, Navy and Air Force for \nthe crucial advancement of the Corps' point of view on matters in which \nall have vested interest.\n  General Williams embodies everything that it means to be a U.S. \nMarine. The time he has spent in the Marine Corps has not only had a \ngreat impact on the institution, but he also helped professionally \ndevelop countless marines over his nearly 40 years of selfless service. \nThrough his example, those marines have come to know and appreciate \nthat only by sacrifice will the freedoms of others, with honor, courage \nand commitment be secured.\n  Furthermore, General Williams has been a tremendous asset to me and \nmy staff. He was a reliable source of information and advice in \nresolving a number of issues that affected Alabama. I got to know him \nthen and to learn of his love for his home State and for her people. I \nwill miss his guidance and leadership with the Marine Corps, but am \nvery thankful that he will be bringing his considerable talents to \nHuntsville, AL.\n  On behalf of the State of Alabama and the U.S. Senate, I congratulate \nLt. General Willie J. Williams on his retirement from the U.S. Marine \nCorps and wish General Williams only the best as he takes off the \nuniform and begins a new chapter in his life of service in \nHuntsville.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5566-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING DANIEL JOHN MEADOR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today \nto Daniel John Meador, who was born in 1926 in Selma, AL. Mr. Meador \nattended the Citadel and graduated from Auburn University and the \nUniversity of Alabama Law School, and received a master of laws from \nHarvard Law School in 1954. He served in the U.S. Army, first in \nartillery, then in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Korea during \nthat conflict. Following the war, he returned to the United States and \nserved as a law clerk to Justice Hugo L. Black of Alabama, then on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. He practiced law in Birmingham, AL, for a short \ntime before joining the faculty at the University of Virginia. In 1965-\n66 he was a Fulbright lecturer in England, and from 1966 to 1970 was \nthe dean of the University of Alabama, School of Law, departing just as \nI was starting law school there. In 1970, he rejoined the University of \nVirginia law faculty as James Monroe Professor of Law, a position he \nheld until his retirement in 1994. At the University of Alabama, he was \na true reformer who wanted the school to be one of national stature. He \nalso was a strong and principled leader for racial progress during \nthose difficult times of discord. We can take pride in the fact that \nhis work paved the way for the school to be one of the very best public \nlaw schools in America.\n  Dean Meador's major professional interest was the State and Federal \nappellate courts, and he was involved in numerous projects and studies \ndesigned to strengthen and improve them. From 1971 to 1975, he served \non the Advisory Council for Appellate Justice and in 1977-79 he was an \nassistant attorney general in the Department of Justice where, at the \nrequest of Attorney General Griffin Bell, he organized a new office in \nthe Department--the Office for Improvements in the Administration of \nJustice. Its mission was to identify problems in the Federal and State \ncourts and develop solutions. In addition, he served on numerous boards \nand committees working to further improve the Court system in our \nNation. He was a good writer. I enjoyed his novel, His Father's House, \nset in Marengo County, Alabama, and Germany.\n  Few lawyers have been held in higher esteem, or have received more \nhonors, or participated in more projects for the betterment of the \nprofession than Dean Meador. While Alabama has perhaps produced a few \nlawyers better known than Dean Meador, few have given more brilliant \nand sustained service in so many ways to the nurturing and development \nof the law and the courts than he. The great American rule of law \nsystem was enriched by him throughout his life.\n  He is best remembered by those who knew him as a masterful teacher \nwith a passion for history, friends and family. He leaves behind his \nwife, Alice, brother, three children, and seven grandchildren. They \nhave been given a great legacy indeed. Dean Daniel John Meador was a \ngreat Alabama native, one of its greatest servants of the law, and I am \nhonored to be able to pay tribute to his many contributions to \neducation, the law, and the courts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5566-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5566-S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL RAYMOND REES\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to MG \nRaymond F. Rees, one of Oregon's most remarkable military leaders. \nAfter 51 years of service to our Nation and the State of Oregon, \nGeneral Rees will retire from the\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nOregon National Guard and the U.S. Army next week. I know I speak for \nOregonians across the State in thanking him for his service.\n  General Rees hails from the small eastern Oregon town of Helix, which \nboasts a proud population of 184. He learned the importance of hard \nwork at an early age, putting in long hours on the family ranch. After \ngraduating from West Point in 1966, he completed airborne and Ranger \ntraining, preparing himself for a tour in Vietnam with the 101st \nAirborne Division. Upon leaving the active Army, he joined the Oregon \nNational Guard where he commanded at every level, serving both within \nthe State and across the country.\n  Those who know him were not surprised that General Rees held a number \nof impressive titles over his long and distinguished career. He served \nas the director of the Army National Guard, the vice chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau, and as the acting chief of the entire National \nGuard. He also served as the chief of staff for U.S. Northern Command \nand the North American Aerospace Defense Command at Peterson Air Force \nBase in Colorado. This month, he steps down as Oregon's Adjutant \nGeneral, a job he held twice before. In fact, General Rees is the \nlongest serving Adjutant General in the United States, with over 17 \nyears of service to four different Oregon Governors.\n  General Rees has always been a champion of the Guard, both locally \nand nationally. Policy decisions he helped shape in the early 1990s \nenabled the National Guard to better respond after the horrible attacks \nof September 11, 2001. Under his leadership, the Oregon Guard deployed \nto Afghanistan and Iraq. And Oregon units were able to respond rapidly \nin the wake of Hurricane Katrina, sending nearly 2,000 servicemembers \nwithin 72 hours.\n  Nobody worked harder to strengthen the synergy between the Guard and \ncommunities across our State than General Rees, or to make sure that \nour returning men and women receive the vital services they earned. He \nhelped establish the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, providing \ncritical, sustaining support for Guardsmen and their families before, \nduring, and after deployments. He led modernization efforts across \nOregon, providing Guardsmen with the best equipment and facilities. He \nopened or improved projects across the State, including readiness \ncenters in Pendleton, La Grande, Hermiston, Klamath Falls, Ontario, The \nDalles, St. Helens, Clackamas, Gresham, Dallas and Salem. He was \ninstrumental in helping us sign a new lease for the Portland Air \nNational Guard Base, allowing the Air Guard to train and keep the skies \nsafe along the west coast.\n  Building bridges between the Guard and foreign militaries is another \nlegacy that General Rees will leave behind, and the Guard's State \nPartnership Program enjoyed no stronger supporter. Under this \ninitiative, State Guard folks are partnering with more than 60 nations \nto improve regional and cultural awareness, increase security \ncooperation, and help prevent threats from emerging. I am proud to say \nthat under General Rees' leadership, Oregon has become one of the few \nStates to partner with two countries simultaneously: Bangladesh and \nVietnam.\n  I could go on and on about the contributions General Rees made on \nbehalf of servicemembers, their families, our citizens, and the State \nof Oregon. So today I want to join folks across the State and the \ncountry to stand and offer our congratulations to General Rees on his \ndistinguished career. Whether as a cavalry troop commander, a cobra \ngunship pilot, or the Adjutant General of the Oregon National Guard, \nGeneral Rees always shouldered more than his share of the task. We will \nmiss this dedicated soldier, talented leader, and gifted diplomat--but \nhis is a retirement well earned. I commend General Rees for his service \nto our country, and I want thank his wife, Mary Len, for her tireless \nsupport along the way. After decades of service, I wish Major General \nRees a long and relaxing retirement. Well done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5567-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5567-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5567-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1171.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor reform of public and private pension plans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pension reform \nlegislation I am introducing today. I am taking this step for a simple \nreason: America cannot continue sleepwalking into the financial \ndisaster that awaits us if we do not get the public pension debt crisis \nunder control.\n  The bill I introduce today is called The Secure Annuities for \nEmployee Retirement Act of 2013--the SAFE Retirement Act, for short. In \naddition to public pension underfunding, the SAFE Retirement Act \naddresses two other critically important aspects of retirement policy: \n401(k) plan coverage and access to professional investment advice for \nworkers and retirees. I will briefly address each part in turn.\n  I have been working on the public pension underfunding problem, which \nI call the pension debt crisis, for some time. Two years ago, I stood \nbefore this Senate and described the financial challenge public pension \nplans pose to Americans. I described how the gap between the pensions \nthat have been promised to workers by State and local governments and \nthe money set aside was as much as $4.4 trillion short by some \nestimates, more than the total amount of municipal bond debt \nnationwide.\n  I explained that the problem of public pension underfunding existed \nbefore the 2008 recession and any attempt to lay blame for the problem \nat the feet of Wall Street or big business or some other group was just \nblame shifting.\n  I observed how the business world long ago recognized that \ntraditional pension plans--defined benefit plans--had become \nunsustainable for most private companies and that most had moved toward \n401(k)-style plans--or defined contribution plans--because costs are \nlower and more predictable and they fit well within an increasingly \nmobile and dynamic workforce. As usual, governments have been slow to \ninnovate, slow to adapt, and when they have acted, their actions have \nbeen too limited to solve the problem.\n  I said at the time I had not settled on the best solution, but that I \nwas working hard and talking to the experts about the best way to \nproceed. That is what we did.\n  Last year, after extensive study, I delivered a report about the \npublic pension debt problem titled ``State and Local Government Defined \nBenefit Plans: The Pension Debt Crisis that Threatens America.'' The \nstudy showed that public pension underfunding is a longstanding problem \nand that thecurrent pension debt crisis goes back more than a decade, \nif not further. The report explained why public pension debt is a \nFederal concern, reviewed previous Federal attempts at legislation and \nmore recent State legislative measures focused almost exclusively on \nnew employees and the attempt by the Government Accounting Standards \nBoard to restore a level of discipline to public pension accounting.\n  At the end of the report, I laid out four essential goals for public \npension reform. First, public pension plans must be affordable for \npublic employers and taxpayers. Second, plans must be structured so \ntaxpayers in the future have no liability for past years of employee \nservice. Third, public plans should provide retirement income security \nfor employees. Finally, fourth, a Federal bailout of the States must he \navoided at all costs.\n  As you will see, I listened to people on all sides of the public \npension debate, including employee groups who want public plans to \nprovide lifetime income. I could have merely recommended that State and \nlocal governments move to a 401(k)-style plan, but I settled instead on \na policy of trying to achieve retirement income security as well.\n  Despite numerous legislative initiatives enacted at the State and \nlocal level, the public pension debt crisis has gotten worse, not \nbetter. In my report, I warned that examples such as Prichard, AL, \nVallejo, CA, and Central Falls, RI, were only the beginning. Sadly, I \nwas right. Since that time, we have witnessed the pension debt crisis \ndescend on much larger cities such as San Jose, CA, Stockton, CA, San \nBernardino, CA, and Detroit, MI. Does anyone doubt that a State could \nbe next? How many times does the credit rating of Illinois have to be \ndowngraded before we act? How long can Rhode Island hold out when it is \nexpected to save its struggling cities while it struggles with its own \nState pension crisis?\n  The problem is getting more serious every day, and the four goals I \noutlined in my report cannot be reached merely by fine-tuning the \nexisting pension structures available to public employers. A new public \npension design is needed, one that provides cost certainty for State \nand local taxpayers, retirement income security for State and local \nemployees, and does not include an explicit or implicit government \nguarantee.\n  I am pleased to say I believe I have designed such a plan. Title I of \nthe SAFE Retirement Act creates a new pension plan called an annuity \naccumulation retirement plan. I call it the SAFE Retirement Plan.\n  The concept of the SAFE Retirement Plan is simple: take advantage of \nthe lifetime income that fixed annuities can provide while mitigating \nthe volatile effect of interest rates on pension levels by purchasing \nan annuity contract for each worker every year during their career so a \nworker builds a solid pension year by year during their entire working \nlife.\n  With a SAFE Retirement Plan, employees receive a secure pension at \nretirement for life that is 100-percent vested, fully portable, and \ncannot be underfunded. Employers and taxpayers receive stable, \npredictable, and affordable pension costs. Underfunding is not \npossible. The life insurance industry pays the pensions and bears all \nof the investment risk. Unlike current public pension plans, the SAFE \nRetirement Plan will be protected by a robust and multi-faceted State \ninsurance regulatory system built to ensure financial strength and \nsolvency and backed by a State law-based consumer safety net. Rather \nthan repairing their pension plans, States that adopt the SAFE \nRetirement Plan will be upgrading their pension plans.\n  Remember, there is no Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation backing \nState and local pension plans, and there never will be. Corporations \nthat sponsor pension plans pay premiums to the PBGC, and their workers \nand retirees receive a level of insurance in the event the plan does \nnot have assets sufficient to pay promised benefits.\n  State and local workers enjoy no such protection, so another solution \nis\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nneeded. The SAFE Retirement Plan, in my opinion, is the answer. It is \nsupported by a well-regulated, highly solvent State insurance system \nand has a built-in financial backstop that does not rely on State or \nFederal taxes. Honestly, regardless of which side of the debate \nSenators have been on to date, they must acknowledge that from a \nsolvency perspective, this is a big improvement over the current public \npension system.\n  I know some will argue my bill will give too much new business to the \nlife insurance industry. That is not how I look at it. The way I see \nit, my bill takes advantage of the life insurance industry to help \nAmericans solve a serious pension problem. After all, the life \ninsurance industry is the only industry in the world designed from the \nground up to manage longevity risk.\n  Annuity contracts purchased through a SAFE Retirement Plan will be \ncompetitively bid upon, on a group contract basis, so the workers \nreceive the highest possible pension in retirement. Government finance \nofficers will be involved in the bidding process to ensure best \npractices, and life insurance companies will be supervised by their \nrespective State insurance departments. The life insurance industry is \nreliably solvent because State insurance regulations are strict, with \nstringent reserve requirements and conservative investment standards. \nIn fact, State-licensed life insurance carriers survived the 2008 stock \nmarket meltdown in far better condition than any other part of the \nfinancial sector.\n  The status quo is no longer acceptable. In fact, maintaining the \nstatus quo comes with a very high cost. In 2011, S downgraded the \nUnited States in part because of the enormous debt represented by \nunderfunded State and local pension plans. The credit rating agencies \nhave downgraded Illinois multiple times, and Moody's has begun \nscrutinizing State and local pension obligations more closely. What \nwill happen when the credit rating agencies see that most State and \nlocal governments have no serious plan to address the crisis?\n  A pension is insurance against outliving the money you have available \nto pay your monthly bills. It cannot be denied that people are living \nlonger. As wonderful as that is, it also means we need to find new ways \nto stretch our monthly pension dollars over longer lifetimes. The SAFE \nRetirement Plan can meet the test.\n  In addition to public pension reform, title II of the legislation I \nintroduce today has several important private pension reforms. The \ncenterpiece is the Starter 401(k), a new type of 401(k) plan that \nallows employees to save for retirement while placing minimal burdens \non employers. Starter 401(k) plans allow employees to save up to $8,000 \neach year but do not require employer contributions. This plan will be \nespecially useful to small companies that do not have a retirement plan \nand startup companies that must devote all of their resources to \nbuilding their business in the early years.\n  The Finance Committee has received evidence in hearings that access \nto a retirement plan at work is the best way to ensure that individuals \nsave for retirement. The policy goal of Congress, therefore, should be \nto encourage employers to establish and maintain a workplace retirement \nplan. The corollary is that Congress should not adopt policies that \ndiscourage employers from maintaining a retirement plan.\n  The Starter 401(k) is a winner on all counts. It is targeted at \nbusinesses that do not already have a plan for their employees, it \nallows employers to help employees save their own money in amounts \ngreater than they could on their own, and it has none of the expensive \nand burdensome testing and contribution obligations for employers \nassociated with other retirement plans. As one of the many supporters \nof this bill told me: `` [T]he Starter 401(k) is an idea whose time has \ncome.''\n  In addition to the Starter 401(k), the private pension reforms I \nintroduce today will help employers by simplifying reporting rules, \neasing discrimination testing safe harbor rules, allowing modernized \nelectronic disclosure options, and encouraging the provision of \nlifetime income options for employees. These are commonsense and long-\noverdue reforms to our Nation' s retirement savings laws, especially \nwith regard to small-and mid-sized employers.\n  Last but not least, title III of the legislation I introduce today \nwill ensure that retirees continue to have affordable access to \nprofessional investment advice.\n  The Acting Secretary of Labor is set to rewrite a 1975 regulation and \ndramatically expand the ERISA fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction \nrules applicable to 401(k) plans. The Acting Secretary also intends to \napply the new and restrictive rules to IRAs, which will cause \ninvestment advisers to stop providing advice to many IRA owners.\n  I have written to the Secretary of Labor in the past about the issue, \nbut my concerns have not been addressed. In fact, there have been a \nnumber of letters from Members in both Houses of Congress and on both \nsides of the aisle imploring the Department of Labor to reconsider the \nissuance of the expansive and burdensome regulations. Forty Members of \nCongress have written the Labor Secretary on this issue just since \nFebruary, to no avail. In light of the DOL's--the Department of \nLabor's--intransigence, my bill includes a legislative solution to the \nproblem.\n  The IRA prohibited transaction rules are codified solely in the \nInternal Revenue Code and address transactions that involve self-\ndealing and conflicts of interest. Prior to the issuance of a 1978 \nExecutive Order, Treasury had jurisdiction over the IRA prohibited \ntransaction rules governing investment advice. The 1978 order \ntransferred Treasury' s jurisdiction to the DOL.\n  The SAFE Retirement Act restores jurisdiction for IRA prohibited \ntransaction rules to the Treasury Department. In addition, Treasury \nwill be required to consult with the Securities and Exchange Commission \nwhen prescribing rules relating to the professional standard of care \nowed by brokers and investment advisers to IRA owners.\n  The 1978 Executive Order also transferred to the DOL some of the \nTreasury Department's joint jurisdiction over the prohibited \ntransaction rules applicable to retirement plans. The bill I introduce \ntoday restores joint jurisdiction to Treasury and the DOL.\n  Joint jurisdiction makes sense in light of the DOL proposal to expand \nthe 1975 regulation because Treasury must enforce prohibited \ntransaction violations through the assessment of excise taxes. Treasury \nshould have a role to play in any expansion of the rules because \nexpanded rules will mean more excise tax cases for the IRS to process.\n  If the Acting Secretary of Labor believes that the 1975 fiduciary \nregulation that has governed retirement investment advice for nearly \nfour decades should be revisited, then the 1978 decision to grant the \nSecretary of Labor additional ERISA regulatory authority also should be \nrevisited.\n  After all, we do not know that the DOL would have been granted \nadditional authority in 1978 if the sensible 1975 regulations had not \nbeen issued.\n  Make no mistake, the position I take today regarding IRA investment \nadvice is not a partisan position. In the last Congress, 124 Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle and from both Chambers--including 75 \nDemocrats, I might add--wrote to the Labor Secretary asking her not to \ntake this course of action. The Secretary finally withdrew the proposal \nlast year. But now that the Acting Secretary is again threatening to \nintroduce this ill-conceived rule, dozens of Members of Congress have \nagain written the Acting Secretary asking that IRAs be protected.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to submit for the Record two letters written \nin March and June of this year by a total of 40 Members of the House \nDemocrat caucus once again asking the DOL to avoid the mistake it is \nabout to make.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2013.\n     Hon. Seth D. Harris,\n     Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Harris: As Members of the Congressional \n     Black Caucus and the House Financial Services Committee, we \n     are following-up on the Department of Labor's\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\n     progress on a re-proposal defining the term ``fiduciary'' \n     under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n     (ERISA). We appreciate the Department's efforts to examine \n     this issue and protect investors from misleading investment \n     advice. However, we maintain concerns that if the re-proposal \n     reflects the Department's initial fiduciary proposal it could \n     disparately impact retirement savers and investment \n     representatives in the African American community.\n       The African American community has been hurt to a larger \n     degree by the economic crisis and the challenge of day-to-day \n     expenses is making long-term saving difficult. The service \n     that an investment representative provides to these \n     traditionally underserved families is critical for them to \n     feel confident to understand and invest in the long-term \n     retirement vehicles intended by Congress to help them. In \n     fact, a Prudential study finds that for those African \n     Americans who use a financial advisor, ``product ownership \n     and detailed financial planning increase, and confidence in \n     meeting key financial goals typically doubles.''\n       We are particularly concerned about the effects these \n     regulations will have on savers in individual retirement \n     accounts (IRAs). If brokers who serve these accounts are \n     subject to ERISA's strict prohibitions on third-party \n     compensation, they may choose to exit the market rather than \n     risk the potentially severe penalties under ERISA for \n     violations. If that occurs, it could cause IRA services to be \n     unattainable by many retirement savers in the African \n     American community.\n       Due to these concerns, we urge the Department to take full \n     consideration of the rule's impact on African American \n     communities in its economic impact study. Also, it is \n     critical that the Department continue to work together with \n     appropriate agencies and stakeholders on a balanced approach \n     to both protect investors and maintain affordable access to \n     retirement savings products during this time of economic \n     uncertainty.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns. We look \n     forward to continue working with you on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gregory W. Meeks; Gwen Moore; Emanuel Cleaver; Al Green; \n           Maxine Waters; Wm. Lacy Clay; Terri Sewell; David \n           Scott.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Seth Harris,\n     Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Harris: We are writing to discuss the \n     Department of Labor's proposed rule to amend the definition \n     of ``fiduciary'' for purposes of the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 (ER1SA). We applaud the \n     Department's efforts to engage on this important subject, but \n     we arc concerned that the re-proposal will disadvantage those \n     it aims to help.\n       One of our goals as Members of Congress is to work together \n     on issues that affect the minority communities we represent. \n     We write this letter because of our joint concern the re-\n     proposed fiduciary definition could restrict our \n     constituents' access to professional financial advisors.\n       At a time when many Americans arc struggling to ensure a \n     secure retirement, we have concerns that the Department's re-\n     proposal could severely limit access to low cost investment \n     advice. After years of hard work, often for long hours and at \n     low wages, many of our constituents face the challenge of \n     planning for their retirement without access to professional \n     investment advice and services. We are concerned that a new, \n     more restrictive definition of fiduciary would add yet \n     another barrier to accessing qualified retirement planning \n     services. As you know, studies have shown that even savers \n     with small IRA and 401k balances benefit greatly from the \n     ability to sit with a trusted adviser to help plan for their \n     future. We believe the Department should adopt policies that \n     expand access to advice, particularly in light of the racial \n     and gender disparities that currently exist in retirement \n     savings.\n       We cannot overstate our desire to ensure that this re-\n     proposed rule enhances investor protection without reducing \n     investor access to affordable retirement advice, products and \n     services. As many of us have expressed to the Department, any \n     attempt to change the existing regulatory structure governing \n     the fiduciary standard should be executed carefully, \n     prudently, and in conjunction with the SEC to avoid \n     uncertainty and disruption in the marketplace. We encourage \n     the Department to learn from its earlier experience by \n     ensuring that the reproposal addresses the concerns raised by \n     a bipartisan, bicameral Congress that caused the Department \n     to withdraw the original proposal in September 2011.\n       Thank you for consideration of our concerns, and we look \n     forward to closely working with you on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frederica S. Wilson; Corrine Brown; Barbara Lee; Wm. Lacy \n           Clay; Danny K. Davis; Donna M. Christensen; Cedric L. \n           Richmond; Emanuel Cleaver; James E.

These letters are proof positive that opposition to the \nLabor Department's fiduciary regulation continues to be both bipartisan \nand bicameral.\n  As I close, I also wish to have printed in the Record copies of the \nmany letters I have received in support of the SAFE Retirement Act of \n2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    American Benefits Council,\n\n                                                     July 8, 2013.\n     Re SAFE Retirement Act of 2013.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the American Benefits \n     Council, I am writing to thank you for your leadership \n     regarding the critical challenges facing our private \n     employer-sponsored retirement plan system. Your bill, the \n     SAFE Retirement Act of 2013, includes many provisions that \n     would address important private retirement plan issues and \n     builds on the success of the current system.\n       Your bill contains provisions that would broaden coverage, \n     increase retirement adequacy, and make plan delivery of \n     information more effective. In particular, the bill provision \n     facilitating electronic communication would allow employers \n     to use forms of disclosure that are far more effective in \n     communicating with participants. Your bill would also \n     facilitate greater use of automatic enrollment, which is \n     critical to increasing the level of retirement savings. There \n     are also many provisions that would broaden plan coverage \n     among small employers, including an enhanced credit for \n     establishing a plan. We believe these proposals are important \n     to further strengthening the private employer-sponsored \n     retirement system and helping workers obtain personal \n     financial security.\n       We applaud your leadership and we look forward to the \n     opportunity to work with you on this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Lynn D.

We have been serving retirement and welfare \n     plan participants in Utah since our foundation locally in \n     1980.\n       As a trusted service provider we deal firsthand with the \n     challenges facing plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries, and plan \n     participants across a wide spectrum. Many of these concerns \n     are addressed by your legislation. We are especially \n     encouraged by the provisions of the Act designed to increase \n     auto enrollment and auto escalation, allow for new timing \n     allowances designed to increased adoption of qualified plans, \n     increase portability, address longevity risks, and provide \n     for a more flexible safe harbor 401k environment.\n       Thank you for supporting the retirement system that all \n     Americans depend on for their future to come.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                  W.

ACLI member \n     companies offer insurance contracts and other investment \n     products and services to qualified retirement plans, \n     including defined benefit pension, 401(k) and 403(b) \n     arrangements, and to individuals through individual \n     retirement arrangements (IRAs) or on a non-qualified basis. \n     For many years our members and their products have helped \n     Americans accumulate retirement savings and turn those \n     savings into guaranteed lifetime income.\n       Our members will be eager to study the provisions of the \n     Safer Pension Act of 2013. We support enhancements to the \n     current employer sponsored system with the goal of increasing \n     simplification, coverage, and facilitating lifetime income \n     options. We look forward to working with you on a number of \n     enhancements including:\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\n       Facilitating electronic delivery of participant statements;\n       Expanding the ability of employers to offer annuities in \n     defined contribution plans;\n       Encouraging multiple employer defined contribution plans; \n     and\n       Expanding autoenrollment/autoescalation opportunities for \n     workers.\n       As Congress considers tax reform, we appreciate your \n     continued support of the current retirement security system. \n     ACLI and its member companies look forward to working with \n     you and your staff to improve retirement security for all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Walter C.

Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Hatch: On behalf of the American \n     Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries (ASPPA) and its \n     affiliates, we hereby express our strong support for the SAFE \n     Retirement Act of 2013.\n       ASPPA is a national organization of more than 15,000 \n     retirement plan professionals who provide consulting and \n     administrative services for qualified retirement plans \n     covering millions of American workers. ASPPA members are \n     retirement professionals of all disciplines including \n     consultants, investment advisors, administrators, actuaries, \n     accountants, and attorneys. The large and broad-based ASPPA \n     membership gives it unusual insight into current practical \n     problems with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and \n     qualified retirement plans with a particular focus on the \n     issues faced by small- to medium-sized employers. ASPPA \n     membership is diverse and united by a common dedication to \n     the private retirement plan system.\n       The private retirement system provisions in Title II of the \n     SAFE Act will dramatically simplify the operation of \n     qualified retirement plans by eliminating unnecessary \n     paperwork and traps for the unwary, as well as providing new \n     approaches to expanding the availability of workplace savings \n     through qualified retirement plans, especially small business \n     retirement plans. These common sense proposals will go a long \n     way toward improving the retirement security of millions of \n     working Americans.\n       ASPPA commends your offering of these proposals, and \n     applauds your commitment to enhancing the private retirement \n     system and the retirement security of our nation's workers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Brian H.

Orrin Hatch,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of Americans for Tax Reform, \n     I write today in support of your new bill, the ``Secure \n     Annuities for Employees (SAFE) Retirement Act of 2013.'' I \n     would urge all senators to support this common-sense, job-\n     creating legislation.\n       The SAFE Retirement Act provides net tax relief for \n     retirement savings. Title II of the legislation spells out a \n     host of common-sense and long-overdue reforms to our nation's \n     retirement savings laws, especially with regard to small- and \n     mid-sized employers. Pending a final score from the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation, it seems self-evident that this \n     section alone makes the SAFE Retirement Act a net tax cut for \n     American families and employers.\n       The SAFE Retirement Act is good public policy for state and \n     local taxpayers. Title I of the bill allows states to opt \n     into an annuity-based alternative (a ``SAFE Retirement \n     Plan'') to today's under-funded legacy defined benefit \n     pension regime. A state wisely choosing to do so would give \n     taxpayers the assurance that government employees won't \n     strain state government funding obligations into perpetuity--\n     the harsh reality facing many states today as they struggle \n     with meeting the pension promises of an earlier era.\n       The SAFE Retirement Act builds upon the modernization \n     efforts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. This bill \n     gives ordinary employers what they've been looking for--a \n     cost-effective, easy to administer, and lower-hassle \n     retirement planning structure they can work with. Common \n     sense reforms like extending elective dates, providing safe \n     harbors, and simplifying paperwork should be able to get \n     broad support. In particular, the ``Starter 401(k)'' is an \n     idea whose time has come.\n       The ``Secure Annuities for Employees (SAFE) Retirement Act \n     of 2013'' is a great example of good, solid legislative \n     blocking and tackling. I look forward to working with you on \n     this legislation as it winds its way through the lawmaking \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Grover Norquist.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. These letters come from businesses and organizations \nrepresenting employers, life insurance companies, State insurance \ncommissioners, State guarantee associations, and tax policy groups. \nThese letters demonstrate that the SAFE Retirement Act is good policy \nand will make good law. America's retirement system deserves no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5572-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      Committee on indian affairs\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

and\n       (iii) full accreditation of and access for international \n     and domestic election observers; and\n       (C) prompt passage of legislation through the Parliament of \n     Afghanistan that codifies the authorities and independence of \n     the IEC and an independent and impartial election complaints \n     mechanism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/09/senate-section/article/S5575-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 10, 2013\n\n  Ms. WARREN.
