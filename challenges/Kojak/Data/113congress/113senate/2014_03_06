Mr. President, it is my pleasure to welcome to the Senate \nhis Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. I know I speak for the entire Senate \nfamily when I express our gratitude for the prayer to open the Senate \nand his words of encouragement and his blessing.\n  His Holiness the Dalai Lama is well known throughout the world as the \nspiritual leader of the Tibetan people and for spreading the gospel of \npeace, compassion, and love to our fellow human beings. But it is the \ntradition when the Senate welcomes a guest Chaplain to say a few words \nabout the honored guest.\n  My friendship with His Holiness has roots from a good man from \nCalifornia by the name of Richard Blum who has done more, in my \nopinion, to help the Tibetan people and His Holiness than anyone else. \nHis Holiness often says that he is only a simple monk born to a farming \nfamily in northeastern Tibet.\n  To millions of people in Tibet and across the globe, he is much more. \nHe is a source of hope and inspiration in a world that can sometimes \nseem very dark. When he was only 2 years old, His Holiness was \nrecognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. Four years \nlater, when he was a little boy, he began his monastic education. He \nstudied logic, art, Tibetan culture, and Buddhist philosophy, among \nmany other things.\n  At age 23 he passed his exam with honors and was awarded what would \nbe an equivalent of a Ph.D., a doctorate of Buddhist philosophy. For \nmore than half a century, the Dalai Lama has been traveling the world \nraising awareness about the concerns of 6 million fellow Tibetans--as \nhe would say: Making new friends around the world.\n  In Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, the Dalai Lamas, all of them, are \nenlightened beings who have postponed their own nirvana, or liberation \nfrom the cycle of reincarnation, in order to serve humanity. This \nparticular enlightened being has chosen to serve humanity by spreading \na message of peace.\n  He motivates countless people around the world, people of every \nfaith, to practice compassion toward one another. His Holiness urges us \nall: ``Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.'' The Dalai \nLama's teachings contain lessons from people around the world and \ncertainly within this Chamber. His Holiness also advises us: ``The best \nway to resolve any problem in the human world is for all sides to sit \ndown and talk.'' Pretty simple, but very true. It is advice that those \nof us fortunate enough to serve our country and our constituents in the \nSenate should take to heart and follow.\n  The presence of His Holiness in this Chamber today inspires me as I \nhope it does all of us to renew our commitment to speak and act with a \npure mind and to help dispel the misery of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1329-6", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1329-S1330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                                Resumed\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Welcoming the Dalai Lama\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I feel honored to be a Member of the Senate \nand to be President pro tempore. But I cannot think of any greater \nhonor than this morning, when I was able to introduce to the Senate an \nold and dear friend, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Marcelle and I have \nbeen friends of His Holiness for decades. We count that as a great \ntreasure, as does Senator Feinstein, whom I saw earlier on the floor, \nanother long-time friend of His Holiness, along with her husband.\n  I have watched him for so many years in his representation of the \nTibetan people. He is joined on the floor by another Buddhist, Senator \nHirono of Hawaii. The gracious comments of Senator Reid reflect how \npeople feel about him. I think of the faith of his people and how they \nare moved. I told his Holiness of this story when I walked through the \nstreets of Lhasa, Tibet, years ago, and a man holding a small child saw \nme and pointed to my camera and held up a picture of His Holiness.\n  He was risking being imprisoned for having that. But he insisted I \ntake his picture. I did. I have given that photograph to His Holiness. \nI told him the story, that when we asked the man why he risked prison \nto show the picture of His Holiness, he said: Because people have to \nknow. The world has to know the great faith of the Tibetan people \nlonging for the autonomy they deserve to practice their faith.\n  Fortunately, they have as a symbol of that faith the Dalai Lama, a \nNobel Peace Prize recipient, a man who touches everybody's conscience. \nHe touches this Catholic every time I see him. It goes beyond whatever \nfaith you are. He is a gift to the world. I am so honored to have been \nable to introduce him here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise to talk about two very important issues for the \ncountry and for Louisiana. The first is fixing the national flood \ninsurance system, getting it right. The good news is I think we are \nwell on a path to doing that effectively. The second is veterans \nmedical clinics, two of which are in Louisiana. They have been held up \nfor completely bureaucratic reasons and aren't moving forward as they \nneed to serve the veterans in Lafayette and Lake Charles, LA, and in \nabout 25 other locations around the country.\n  First, flood insurance. Only a couple of days ago the House passed by \na huge margin, over 300 votes, a strong bill to permanently fix the \nNational Flood Insurance Program. Those aspects of the so-called \nBiggert-Waters act passed over 1 year ago but are unworkable, clearly \ncreating problems on the ground.\n  This is great news, because unless we fix those very real problems, \nwe would have major problems on our hands in the National Flood \nInsurance Program, not only in Louisiana, not only in Florida, and not \nonly in the Superstorm Sandy area, but in every State in the country--\nevery State. It is not a question of if these issues are coming to your \nState, it is a question of when and exactly to what extent.\n  Over 1 year ago, we passed the Biggert-Waters act. That was an \nimportant reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program. It \nalso included reforms, and many of those reforms needed to happen to \nstabilize the financing of the program.\n  What no one understood adequately then, however, is that those well-\nintended reforms, in practice, in implementation by FEMA, would lead to \nunsustainable, completely unaffordable rate increases in a significant \nnumber of cases.\n  That only began to be understood in the months after the bill was \npassed as FEMA started to implement it, as FEMA came to homeowners, \ncame to State authorities, came to Members of Congress, and began to \nlay out some of the rates we would see in certain areas.\n  I am not talking about modest rate increases. We need modest rate \nincreases to stabilize the financing of the program. I am talking about \ncompletely unaffordable rate increases in some cases--flood insurance \nrates going from $300 a year to $11,000 a year or $19,000 a year or \n$26,000 a year on a modest middle-class home and on a middle-class \nfamily that followed the rules every step of the way. We can't allow \nthat to stand.\n  First, it is fundamentally unfair. As I said, these middle-class \nfamilies followed the rules every step of the way. They built to the \nright elevation when they built their homes, never let their premiums \nlapse, and never let their insurance lapse.\n  In that context, for them to be hit with truly unaffordable rate \nincreases--increases that could literally cause them to have to walk \naway from their home in some significant number of cases and not be \nable to afford to stay there--is just plain wrong.\n  Secondly, it is completely counterproductive, because one of the ways \nwe have stabilized the National Flood Insurance Program fiscally is to \ngrow the program, to have more folks paying premiums, and to have more \nfolks covered, not fewer. This aspect of Biggert-Waters, which would \nlead to truly unaffordable rate increases in a significant number of \ncases, is unworkable from the very vantage point of the goal of \nBiggert-Waters to stabilize the system. So we can't let that stand for \nthat reason either.\n  The good news is, because of those very real problems, both the \nSenate, and now the House, have come together in a major bipartisan way \nto fix the issue. The Senate acted about 1 month ago passing meaningful \nlegislation. I was an original coauthor and a strong supporter. As I \nsaid a few minutes ago, the House acted two nights ago--Mardi Gras \nnight in Louisiana terms--to take strong action to fix this program.\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n  The House bill is stronger and more significant in several respects, \nmostly because the reforms in the House bill are permanent. It is not a \ntimeout, as the Senate bill was. It is a permanent fix that creates a \nmuch higher degree of certainty and permanence immediately.\n  Also, the House bill is fully paid for with a modest premium increase \non everybody's premiums--very modest, completely affordable--to make \nsure that all of these changes are paid for. Because of these aspects \nof the House bill, because of the permanent nature of the fix, the fact \nthat we create certainty and predictability immediately moving forward \nfor homeowners and real estate markets is actually the preferable \napproach.\n  I urge all of us in the Senate to take up that bill at the soonest \npossible moment. Specifically, I urge the distinguished majority leader \nto put it on the floor, to create time on the floor, so we can deal \nwith the House bill absolutely as soon as possible.\n  I know there will be some attempt to obtain unanimous consent to pass \nthe House bill immediately. Of course, I will consent; I am all for \nthat. But, realistically, I don't think that is going to happen on the \nSenate floor. The Senate bill had some objectors, the Senate bill had \nsome opponents, and so does the House bill.\n  Realistically, I urge the majority leader to create the time on the \nSenate floor to take this up and move through the process absolutely as \nquickly and as expeditiously as possible. That is the way it is \nactually going to work and that is the way it is actually going to \nhappen.\n  I hope we can do that as early as next week. I strongly support our \nconsideration of this bill on the Senate floor as early as next week.\n  The second national and Louisiana issue I want to discuss has to do \nwith veterans and veterans' health care, which we have been talking \nabout on the Senate floor for some time, specifically the need to move \nforward with 27 fully approved, fully authorized, VA community-based \nclinics that have been stalled because of bureaucratic problems. Again, \nthese clinics are around the country: two in Louisiana, one in \nLafayette, one in Lake Charles. These clinics have been approved by the \nVA and have been in their plan for some time. They are fully \nauthorized. We thought they were fully paid for until, first, the VA \nmade some bureaucratic mistakes to delay the Lake Charles and Lafayette \nclinics in particular; and then, out of the blue, the CBO changed the \nway they score all of these clinics, all of these issues, and created \nanother bureaucratic hurdle.\n  Again, the good news is we came together in a bipartisan way and have \na solution to those purely bureaucratic hurdles so that all of these \nclinics can move forward expeditiously. The House specifically passed a \nbill that would take care of these bureaucratic hurdles. They passed it \non the consent calendar by a whopping bipartisan margin.\n  So I come to the floor urging all of us to do the same. Specifically, \nI have an amendment to the bill that also makes it even more fiscally \nsustainable by having a pay-for for any conceivable cost to this bill, \nand that is what my amendment would do.\n  This VA clinic legislation was in the Sanders veterans bill last week \nand it was in the Burr alternative. It was in both the Democratic and \nthe Republican veterans packages. Neither of those packages passed. The \nSanders bill was defeated on a budget point of order, which I supported \nbecause I don't think it is properly paid for and is sustainable both \nin terms of our budget and, even more important for veterans, how the \nveterans system works and handles its current patient load. The Burr \nbill never even got a vote.\n  We have disagreements about those larger packages. Those are real, \nsubstantial disagreements, but in the midst of that I would hope we can \nagree to what we can agree on, and these VA clinics certainly fall into \nthat category. We have cleared all objections to this VA clinic piece \nspecifically. We have addressed all issues having to do with these VA \nclinics, in part through my amendment at the desk. The only possible \nobjection I know of is the fact that a larger package is not passing.\n  I understand there are big arguments about that larger package. Those \nare legitimate differences of opinion. I don't think that should stand \nin the way of our agreeing to what we can agree to and moving forward \nwith an important piece of the puzzle for veterans health care--these \n27 community-based clinics around the country.\n  In that spirit I will be asking for a unanimous consent agreement \nwhereby we would take up the House-passed bill. Again, this House-\npassed bill was actually on the consent calendar, passed with a \nwhopping bipartisan majority. We would adopt my amendment at the desk, \nwhich addresses some fiscal concerns with the bill, and we would then \npass it through the process. This would be our coming together and \nagreeing to what we can agree on. That is what the American people want \nus to do as we work on all other aspects of health care and veterans' \nbenefits covered by both the Burr and the Sanders bill debated last \nweek.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3521\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3521, which was received from the House; that my \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank very much my colleague from \nLouisiana for bringing forth this very important issue. Senator Mary \nLandrieu from Louisiana has also raised this issue, as have many \ncolleagues.\n  My friend from Louisiana is absolutely right; this is an important \nissue and this is an issue that should be passed. But I would say to my \nfriend from Louisiana that last week we brought forth the most \ncomprehensive piece of veterans legislation in the modern history of \nthe United States of America, and that legislation dealt with many \nissues raised by veterans organizations that represent millions of men \nand women who have put their lives on the line to defend our country.\n  Let me very briefly--very briefly--touch on some of those issues \nincluded in this comprehensive piece of legislation that lacked three \nvotes. We had 56 votes. One Senator was absent and would have voted, so \nwe need three votes to pass this. This would have addressed some of the \nserious problems in the claims backlog that my friend from Louisiana is \nmore than familiar with. It would have addressed the crisis of advanced \nappropriations to make sure if there is ever again another government \nshutdown that no veteran--disabled veteran and no veteran who is on a \npension--would fail to get their check.\n  This legislation also included an enormously important provision \nexpanding the caregivers program, so wives and sisters and brothers \ntaking care of disabled vets finally get the attention they deserve.\n  That legislation would have addressed a terrible problem facing some \n2,300 families, where men and women who were injured in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and can no longer have babies receive help through in vitro \nfertilization or other processes or adoption, if they want the help, in \norder to have families.\n  The legislation also addressed the very serious problem that many of \nour young men and women are not getting the education they need because \nStates are not allowing them to get instate tuition.\n  That legislation addressed many other crises, which is why that \nlegislation had the support of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and in fact virtually \nevery veterans organization in the country.\n  So let me say this to my friend from Louisiana, and I say this \nsincerely. What I will not do is dismember this piece of legislation. \nWhat I will do is work with my colleague and other Republicans who \nvoted against this comprehensive piece of veterans legislation so we \ncan bring to the floor a bill that reflects the needs of millions and \nmillions of veterans who are hurting.\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Louisiana on a \ncomprehensive bill, but at this point I object to his proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor and my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I find that very regretful. Of course I will continue to \nwork with the Senator from Vermont. Of course I will continue to work \non that larger package, which I have been actively involved in for some \ntime. I will continue that. But basically the Senator from Vermont is \nholding a very tiny piece of this hostage--a tiny piece that will have \nno impact whether it is in or out in terms of passage of that broader \nbill.\n  What is happening is we have a piece that on its substance, on the \nsubstance of the clinics themselves, no one objects to; a piece that \npassed the House by a huge overwhelmingly bipartisan majority. Yet it \nis not going to pass here today or perhaps anytime soon because it is \nheld hostage over larger fights.\n  I will continue to work on that broader veterans piece. I support a \nbroader veterans bill, if it is styled the right way and if it is \nfiscally responsible. I support the Burr alternative. I will continue \nto look for common ground between that Burr alternative and the Sanders \nbill. But whether this clinic piece is in or out of that discussion \nwill have zero impact on passing that piece. I honestly think it will \nhave zero impact.\n  I find it very unfortunate we can't get this done in the meantime; \nthat what my colleague considers the perfect is now the enemy of the \nvery good, and we can't serve veterans by coming together on what we do \nagree on and acting in the meantime.\n  With that, I urge my distinguished colleague from Vermont to \nreconsider over time, as we work on this larger veterans bill, because \nwe could pass this today. The House would pass the slightly modified \nversion immediately, and we would be moving on with 27 community-based \nclinics around the country which veterans in all of those communities \ndesperately need.\n  Additionally, I wish to thank Senator Inhofe for his active \ncooperation in moving these clinics forward.\n  Mr. President, my good friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, is \nin support of vital legislation that recently passed the House of \nRepresentatives, H.R. 3521 the Department of Veterans Affairs Major \nMedical Facility Lease Authorization Act of 2013. The legislation \nauthorizes 27 Department of Veterans Affairs clinics across this \ncountry including much needed clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles, \nLA.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with my good friend from Louisiana that this \nlegislation, H.R. 3521, is critical to providing the best treatment for \nour country's veterans, and I believe that it is the government's duty \nto honor the promises made to our veterans. In Oklahoma, roughly \n340,000 veterans call our State home, attend our churches, and \ncontribute to our communities. On behalf of Oklahoma, we are humbled by \nthe immeasurable dedication of each and every one of them.\n  Therefore, this legislation also authorizes funds for an improved \nVeterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, OK. The current building \nlacks the space to care adequately for the large number of veterans \nthat receive their medical treatment at the facility. Due to the size \nof the facility, services such as the Behavioral Health services are \nlocated several miles away. Lastly, the parking lot capacity is not \nacceptable. This bill will improve this clinic to include primary care, \nwomen's health, imaging, specialty care, physical therapy, audiology, \noptometry, mental health, prosthetics, dentistry, and a pharmacy.\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, it is absolutely critical for Louisiana veterans as \nwell that both of the clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles are \nauthorized and finally built. To clarify, both of the Louisiana clinics \nare not new projects. They would actually be nearing completion, but \nbecause of bureaucratic mistakes committed by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, they have faced significant delays. Two years ago, \ndue to an unexpected change by the Congressional Budget Office--CBO--in \nhow it estimates the cost of VA clinics, these two vital clinics were \nthen stripped out of a VA authorization bill. Veterans in Louisiana \nhave waited long enough. It is time for the United States Senate to \nact. This legislation makes it so veterans are not forced to drive a \n100 miles to receive much needed services.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With the passage of this bill, there will be funding to \nimprove and expand our VA clinics in 19 States across the United \nStates, including Louisiana and Oklahoma. The facilities would then be \nable to provide the services that were promised to our men and women \nthat were willing to make the personal sacrifices necessary to serve in \nthe defense of our country. Many of our veterans have paid the price \nwith scars, some visible while yet many go unseen such as post-\ntraumatic stress disorder--PTSD, depression, and traumatic brain \ninjuries--TBI. I urge our colleagues to remember that it is our \nNation's duty to care for them in return.\n  Mr. VITTER. This legislation makes important reforms to the VA \nleasing process taking into account CBO concerns, and it has received \nvast bipartisan support in the House passing 346-1. I urge my \ncolleagues to provide the same support for our veterans in the Senate \nand pass this legislation now by unanimous consent.\n  With that, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me reiterate my hope that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana will in fact work with us. It is my intention to see \nthis bill gets to the floor again before Memorial Day. I think we owe \nit to the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend \nthis country to address their serious needs.\n  The issue of these 27 medical facilities is one of those needs, but \nthere are many more, and I look forward to working with the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and other Senators to do what the veterans communities \nwant us to do and to go forward on what will be the most significant \npiece of legislation to take care of the needs of our veterans passed \nin several decades.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I, too, want to lend my voice--after \nlistening to the discussion that just occurred on the floor--because I \ndon't think there is any group of Americans who are more deserving of \nour support than the men and women who have worn the uniform of this \ncountry and so bravely and courageously defended America's freedom and \nour democracy. I hope, such as my colleagues who spoke just a minute \nago, we can come to an agreement that would allow us to do the things \non which we agree.\n  There are so many things on which we agree--I think 80 percent of the \ndebate last week between what the Senator from Vermont proposed and the \nSenator from North Carolina proposed were the same--that we ought to be \nable at least to do those we agree on and address some of the very \nvital and urgent needs our veterans community has. So I would lend my \nvoice to supporting efforts to get things moving.\n  There is a bill that has come over from the House of Representatives \nthat addresses many of these issues, not as comprehensively as was \nproposed last week by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. Obviously, we have some issues that need to be \naddressed that will support and help those Americans who have borne the \ncost of battle for our country and defended America's freedoms, but we \nshould work together to find that agreement and to move legislation \nforward that would address those needs.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor, however, to talk about the pain \nthat ObamaCare and the Obama economy are causing Americans.\n  CBS News/New York Times released a new poll last week finding there \nis widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama: 59 percent of the \nAmerican people are disappointed in the President's Presidency, the \npoll found, while 63 percent think the country is on the wrong track.\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n  Just 38 percent of the people in this country approve of the \nPresident's handling of the economy, and 39 percent approve of his \nhandling of foreign policy.\n  When it comes to the President's signature law, ObamaCare, just 6 \npercent--6 percent--of the American people think the law is working \nwell. A whopping 92 percent support changing the health care law or \nrepealing it altogether.\n  In similar news, Gallup reported last month that its Economic \nConfidence Index was negative for every single State. In other words, \nthe majority of Americans in every State have a generally negative view \nof the economy. Only in DC--in the District of Columbia, home of too \nmany disconnected Democratic politicians--did Gallup find a net \npositive view of the economy.\n  Needless to say, the American people are, to put it mildly, \ndissatisfied. Why are they dissatisfied? Because they spent 5 years \nwaiting for the relief they were promised and it hasn't arrived.\n  A Pew Research Center poll in September found that 63 percent of the \nAmerican people believe the Nation's economic system is no more secure \ntoday than it was before the 2008 market crash. The same poll also \nfound the majority of Americans report household incomes and the job \nsituation have hardly recovered at all from the recession. President \nObama may have inherited a difficult economic situation, but he has had \n5 years to make it better. Instead, he is making things worse.\n  Over the past 5 years household income has declined by $3,600. Income \ninequality is at its highest point literally since the Great \nDepression. The number of Americans receiving food stamps has soared \nfrom over 32 million to now more than 47 million--almost 48 million \nAmericans receiving food stamps. That means that one in five--literally \none in five--American households is on food stamps. Ten million \nAmericans are unemployed, almost 4 million of them for more than 6 \nmonths, and the labor force participation rate is at Jimmy Carter-era \nlows, thanks in part to literally thousands of Americans who have \nsimply given up hope of ever finding a job and dropped out of the labor \nforce altogether.\n\n  Then there is the President's health care law. The President promises \na health care law with lower costs while allowing you to keep the plan \nand the doctor you like. In reality health care costs have skyrocketed \nand Americans have been losing their doctors and their health care \nplans in droves. Seniors are being hit hard by cuts in the Medicare \nAdvantage Program and lower income seniors are being hit the hardest. \nMeanwhile, businesses are struggling with the law's burdensome taxes \nand regulations, while workers struggle with reduced hours and fewer \nopportunities.\n  A recent report from the Congressional Budget Office found that the \nPresident's health care law will reduce the number of full-time workers \nby up to 2.5 million over the next 10 years. Then there is last week's \nreport from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that found \nthat 11 million small businesses are going to see workers have their \npremiums increased as a result of ObamaCare.\n  Yesterday, in an attempt to improve the Democrats' steadily worsening \nelection prospects in November, the administration announced yet \nanother--another--ObamaCare delay for selecting health plans, as well \nas a pardon for the administration's union friends. It is no wonder \nAmericans are so unhappy.\n  Despite the abundance of evidence that their policies have failed, \nthe Democrats and the President continue to dismiss Americans' stories. \nIn fact, the Senate majority leader had the gall the other day to get \nup on the floor of the Senate and say every single ObamaCare horror \nstory is untrue. That is right. Instead of looking at the overwhelming \nevidence that ObamaCare just isn't working, and maybe rethinking his \nsupport of that law, the majority leader decided to accuse every single \nAmerican who has had a bad experience with ObamaCare of lying about his \nor her story. Now that is a lot of denial right there.\n  They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and \nover and hoping for a different result. Yet that is exactly what the \nDemocrats and President are doing. Instead of looking at the evidence \nof the past 5 years and rethinking their policies, Democrats are piling \non more of the same. For Americans hurting for jobs and opportunities, \nDemocrats have recently taken to advocating a hike in the minimum \nwage--a policy, I might add, that the Congressional Budget Office said \nwould result in up to 1 million fewer jobs and a policy that would hit \nthe lowest income workers the hardest.\n  Then there is the President's budget. The President's budget proposal \nwould have been a great opportunity for the President to rethink some \nof these failed strategies of the past 5 years and to focus on \ncontrolling spending and promoting economic growth. Instead the \nPresident produced a political document that panders to the far \nleftwing of his party and eschews any type of meaningful reform.\n  His budget won't control spending. Instead, it increases spending by \n63 percent over the next 10 years and it adds another $8.3 trillion to \nour $17 trillion debt. To pay for some of that spending, the \nadministration is proposing even more tax increases, over $1 trillion \nworth of new tax increases on top of the $1.7 trillion in tax increases \nthe President has already gotten since he came to office.\n  The administration has even backed away from changes to our broken \nentitlement programs, such as gradually raising the eligibility age for \nMedicare, which would have helped put the Medicare Program on a \nstronger financial footing going forward.\n  And as for balancing the budget, well, that is a fantasy. The \nPresident's budget doesn't even pretend to balance. With 2 years left \nin his Presidency, it appears the President has given up on governing \nand resigned himself to playing election year politics. His lameduck \nbudget will further grow the Federal Government while the middle class \ncontinues to shrink.\n  If the President and Democrats really want to help Americans the way \nthey claim, there are real steps they could take right now to start \nturning our economy around and putting Americans back to work. Instead \nof a job-killing minimum wage hike, they could support initiatives to \nreduce the cost of hiring and give businesses incentives to hire \nworkers. Instead of perpetually extending unemployment benefits, they \ncould support legislation, such as a bill I introduced to provide \nrelocation resources to allow the long-term unemployed to move to areas \nwhere the job market is stronger, and strengthen Federal worker \ntraining programs. This would help give the unemployed what they really \nwant--not months of meager government benefits but steady, good-paying \njobs with the potential for growth.\n  Speaking of jobs, if the President wanted to create jobs immediately, \nhe could easily do that today with a stroke of the pen that he talks \nabout: Approve the bipartisan Keystone Pipeline and the 42,000-plus \njobs it would support. All it would take is a stroke of the pen he \nkeeps talking about.\n  Then there is trade promotion authority. The President did talk about \ntrade promotion authority in his State of the Union Address, but he \nabandoned it shortly afterwards as a result of some Democrats' \npolitical concerns about pushing the policy in an election year. Trade \npromotion authority would help farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and \njob creators gain access to 1 billion new consumers around the globe. \nIf the President were serious about creating jobs for Americans, he \nwould be urging the majority leader to take up this bipartisan \nlegislation today.\n  Finally, the President should be supporting bipartisan efforts to \nrepeal the costly medical device tax in his health care law, the tax on \npacemakers and insulin pumps. According to a recent study, more than \n30,000 jobs in the medical device industry have been affected by this \nburdensome provision in the law. If this tax isn't eliminated soon, \neven more jobs in the industry are going to be lost or sent overseas.\n  It is not surprising that the American people are unhappy. ObamaCare \nand the Obama economy have done nothing to ease the struggles Americans \nhave faced since the recession, and instead of proposing new \ninitiatives, the Democrats and the President continue to push for more \nof the same, and to double down on the same failed policies.\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n  Well, 5 years is long enough. It is time for Democrats to abandon \ntheir failed economic experiments and to work with Republicans to pass \nlegislation that will actually create jobs and opportunities and put \nAmericans back to work. We can do that. We can do that today. The \nPresident can pick up the phone he talks about and call the majority \nleader. Ask him to bring up any one of these initiatives I have \nmentioned on which there is broad bipartisan support: the Keystone \nPipeline, trade promotion authority--initiatives that would grow jobs--\nrepealing the medical device tax. There were 79 votes in the Senate on \namendments to the budget last year in support of appealing that onerous \ntax.\n  There are things we can do together, that we can do today to create \njobs and grow and expand this economy, lower the cost of hiring people \nin this country, so we can get more Americans back to work with good-\npaying jobs that will help lift them higher in their economic \ncircumstances and give them a better and a brighter future. I hope that \nis what the President will choose to do rather than following through \non so many of these election year ploys, if you will, that are simply \ndesigned to help win elections come election day rather than doing \nsomething that is meaningful to help middle-class families and the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Rose Eilene \nGottemoeller, of Virginia, to be Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl and International Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:20 \na.m. will be equally divided between the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader or their designees.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. It is always good to see my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Jersey presiding before the Senate.\n  I come to the floor to support the nomination of Rose Gottemoeller \nfor Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity. She has been the Acting Under Secretary since February 2012. \nIt has been 2 years now.\n  She is a distinguished public servant who over her long career has \nplayed a vital role in addressing the critical proliferation challenges \nthe United States faces. In my mind, it would be difficult to find a \nperson more appropriate to take on the variety of new and old \nproliferation threats we face.\n  Rose Gottemoeller was the chief U.S. negotiator of the New Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty with the Russian Federation. During the Clinton \nadministration she served in the Department of Energy overseeing its \nnuclear proliferation portfolio. During the critical period of 1993 to \n1994, she was at the National Security Council overseeing the \ndenuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus--a topic of some \nimportance given the current crisis in the Ukraine.\n  As we consider this nomination, it is worthwhile reviewing the array \nof issues and nonproliferation threats we face.\n  In Syria, we are facing ridding the regime of its chemical weapons \narsenal, seeking to keep the pressure on Assad to fulfill his \ncommitments and verify that Syria is in full compliance with provisions \nto destroy its chemical weapons production, mixing, and filling. The \nUnited States, along with the rest of the international community, is \nengaged in the complex process to transport and safely destroy Syria's \nchemical weapons stockpile.\n  Second, on the issue of Iran's nuclear program, we are entering a \ncritical stage in negotiations. As I noted in remarks on the floor last \nmonth, we must, in my view, maintain the pressure on Iran to dismantle \nits nuclear weapons program. As part of our negotiations, we must \ninsist on the most stringent measures to verify whether Iran is in \ncompliance with agreements it has signed. We need to ensure that any \nfinal deal that might be signed can be precisely monitored, providing \nus a warning signal at the first hint that Iran is seeking to achieve \nnuclear breakout.\n  Third, in terms of North Korea, the United States has stated that we \nwill not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, which would \npotentially unleash an arms race in the region and threaten our \nsecurity and the security of our allies.\n  Fourth, we have to maintain and sharpen our efforts to prevent \nterrorists from getting their hands on and/or using nuclear, chemical, \nor biological weapons.\n  Finally, despite all of our recent difficulties with Russia, it is \nvital that we continue to implement and verify the arms control \ntreaties we have with them, particularly the New START treaty. These \ntreaties are not something we do as a favor to Russia; they are a vital \nmeasure for limiting the potential dangerous nuclear escalation that \nmight occur in a crisis.\n  For all of these reasons and many others, we need to confirm the \nnomination of Rose Gottemoeller so she can fully assume her new \nresponsibilities as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. She has all the authority necessary to \nrepresent U.S. security interests in the international community.\n  Having said that, I know there are differences within the Senate \nabout the question as to how we should approach nonproliferation \nissues, but regardless of those differences, I believe there are a \nnumber of issues on which we can all agree.\n  We can all agree that we face a new and more complex set of \nproliferation threats--the threat of terrorists getting their hands on \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, the danger of regional armed \nnuclear adversaries, such as North Korea and Iran, using their nuclear \ncapabilities to blackmail our partners and allies.\n  In response to these threats, we all agree we need a more modern and \nflexible nuclear enterprise and updated policies that can respond to \nthese new threats as well as the old threats we face. I hope we can \nagree that we need to confirm this nominee to be in a position with \nauthority to help update and implement those policies with the full \nauthority of the position.\n  What I would say to the Senate is that at the end of the day there \nare some who may disagree on verification and compliance procedures or \non the nature of the modernization of our program, but we cannot \ndisagree on the significance of the threats we face and the need to \nhave a team in place tasked with representing our security interests at \nthe highest national level.\n  This is not a time to say no to confirming a qualified, experienced \nnonproliferation expert when so much is at stake in Syria, North Korea, \nand Iran, and negotiations with Russia--not when we imagine the \nconsequences of what the spread of these weapons can bring. I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm this nominee in the national security interest of \nthe United States and look forward to a strong support of her \nnomination.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 7 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Jim Young\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart that I \npay tribute to the life and legacy of a friend, Jim Young. Jim passed \naway on February 15 after a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with his wife Shirley, his children, and \nhis grandchildren during a very difficult time.\n  Even as we mourn his passing, though, we celebrate his deep love for \nhis family, his tremendous commitment to his community, and his \nimpressive example of leadership. Jim's family, friends, coworkers, and \nadmirers from across Nebraska and our great Nation are mourning the \nloss of a life defined by great service and great leadership. It is my \nprivilege today on the floor of the Senate to honor his legacy.\n  Jim knew the importance of hard work and commitment to purpose. That \nis how he climbed the ladder of success to become the president and \nchief executive officer and, later, chairman of the board of Union \nPacific Corporation.\n  Jimmy's integrity was unquestioned. He loved his work. He carried his \nenthusiasm beyond UP as he led the American Association of Railroads \nand other professional organizations.\n  Jimmy's leadership spurred impressive reinvestment and growth in the \nrailroad, but many would say his true accomplishment was his focus on a \npositive work environment and taking care of his coworkers. His concern \nfor their well-being was genuine, and they knew it.\n  It would be difficult to categorize Jimmy's greatest contributions \nbecause beyond his tremendous impact on UP and the rail industry, Jim \ndid everything. He loved our great State. He loved his hometown of \nOmaha. He set a shining example of what it means to give back to the \ncommunity.\n  The list of boards on which he served and organizations for which he \nvolunteered could literally fill a book. From the Greater Omaha Chamber \nof Commerce to the Joslyn Art Museum, from the University of Nebraska \nto the Salvation Army, Jimmy's commitment to serving and to improving \nthe lives of others is just simply unmatched.\n  He did not take for granted his success, and he dedicated time and \nattention to assisting those who had less--those with fewer resources. \nEvidence of his generosity can be found in all corners of the \ncommunity. It would range from the Jim and Shirley Young Scholarship \nProgram at Jimmy's alma mater, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to \nhis involvement in the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and his service as a \nchurch elder and a youth sports coach.\n  I am so confident I speak for all Nebraskans when I say we have lost \na great leader and a community partner. I feel as though I have lost a \nfriend.\n  Jim gave of himself in all he did. From the boardroom to the \nballfield, his presence is going to be so missed.\n  It is my sincere hope that Jimmy's wife Shirley, his children and his \ngrandchildren, find comfort knowing that so many lives were made better \nbecause of his efforts.\n  Jim leaves a vibrant legacy of leading by example, inspiring others \nby believing in every single person's potential, and of dedicating both \ntime and treasure to opening doors of opportunity for those who just \nneeded a champion. It would be difficult to imagine a more meaningful \nlife legacy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when American men and women decide to defend \nour freedoms as members of the U.S. Armed Forces, they do so with full \nknowledge that they could make the ultimate sacrifice--the ultimate \nsacrifice--on behalf of our county. These are very courageous men and \nwomen. While we can't protect every member of our military from harm at \nthe hands of America's enemies, we should at least guarantee them \nprotection from harm at the hands of their fellow servicemembers.\n  The need to address the problem of sexual assault is not lost on the \nmilitary officers and officials with whom I have met. They acknowledge \nthere is a problem. I believe they are working in good faith to fix it.\n  The vast majority of U.S. military personnel are appalled by sexual \nassault in their ranks, as are their commanders. I applaud their \ndedication to this Nation and their fellow servicemembers. I applaud \nthe action of those who have zero tolerance for these crimes, but I am \nconvinced that Congress must act aggressively to eliminate a military \nculture that not only allows sexual assault to happen but too often \npunishes the victims when it does.\n  We have already taken some action to combat the sexual assault in the \nDefense authorization bill. I am pleased today we will vote on two \nproposals for further action.\n  Congress cannot stand idly by while the blight of sexual assault \ncontinues. Every military leader has the responsibility to take a stand \nwith us for a zero tolerance approach to military sexual assault, to \nstand by the victims of sexual assault, and to stand with the good men \nand women they command.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have two votes at 2 o'clock. I ask \nunanimous consent that the additional time until 2 p.m. be equally \ndivided and controlled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I rise today to speak about the need to strengthen \nour military and stand by our brave men and women in uniform by passing \nthe bipartisan Military Justice Improvement Act.\n  I start by thanking all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor the seriousness with which they have approached this issue and the \neffort they have put into looking at the solution survivors of sexual \nassault in the military are asking for. I specifically thank my friends \nfrom Missouri and New Hampshire for their determination and leadership \nin fighting for victims of sexual assaults in our military. I look \nforward to voting for their bill on the floor today.\n  I defer the colloquy to Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, when the majority leader said 1 minute \nago that Congress cannot idly stand by and not do anything, I have to \nremind him that we have been doing so for quite some time. We have been \nworking on the problem of sexual assault, and the reality is that \nCongress has been aggressive in instituting reforms to tackle sexual \nassault in the military since the fiscal year 2009 Defense \nAuthorization Act. We have enacted 47 provisions, either directly \naddressing sexual assault or instituting reforms to the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice that will improve efforts to address allegations of \nmisconduct.\n  These reforms have strengthened the protections and the care of the \nvictims while preserving the rights of the accused. These historic \nreforms are vital to ensuring a sound, effective, and fair military \njustice system.\n  I look at the bill we are considering that will be coming up in a \nshort while. The bill would modify the court-martial convening \nauthority in a way that I believe creates very serious procedural \nproblems.\n  In a January 28, 2014, letter to the Department, it cited--and I am \ngoing to cite some very technical problems:\n\n       Potentially irreconcilable and could result in long delays \n     from bringing some cases to trial and, if a conviction \n     ultimately results, could produce still more years of \n     appellant litigation, perhaps ultimately culminating in the \n     conviction's reversal.\n\n  To make matters even worse, the bill includes a requirement that the \nnew military judge advocate billets required to perform these duties \nmust be taken from existing billets. This is what we have been fighting \nand arguing about, the problems that we are having now in the overall \nmilitary. No billet growth is authorized in this, so it will have to \ncome from existing billets.\n  I received a personal letter from the Judge Advocate General of the \nArmy, General Darpino.\n  He said:\n\n       The bill would not be cost neutral. According to initial \n     estimates, the Army would require an additional 50 judge \n     advocate colonels along with the increase of about 200 judge \n     advocates of other ranks and about 150 legal support staff.\n\n  That is a quote. She went on to say:\n\n       . . . this is happening at a time when the services are \n     attempting to reduce their personnel costs to accommodate \n     shrinking budgets. And that is just the impact in the Army. \n     On November 18, 2013, the Department of Defense provided an \n     assessment of the devastating impact of the Gillibrand bill. \n     The Defense office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation \n     estimate a total cost of over $113 million per year--\n\n  That is every year--\n\n     to implement her bill in the Army, Navy, Air Force and \n     Marines. Not only is her bill not executable in a cost-\n     neutral basis, it is not possible to grow the total inventory \n     of nearly 600 judge advocate officers and legal assistants \n     required by the bill within the 180 days of enactment. The \n     decision we make today will have significant consequences for \n     the future of our military. More specifically, the bill we \n     are debating this week threatens to tear apart what I \n     strongly believe is the fabric of our Armed Forces: the chain \n     of command.\n\n  I can't find people I can confide in and talk to personally, who have \nbeen in the military, who don't agree with this. I was in the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice when I was in the U.S. Army--not at the level \nof some of the Senators who have been there more recently, such as \nSenator Graham, for example, and at a higher level. I was an enlisted \nman. But I was a reporter, and a lot of times the reporters, the \nenlisted personnel, really know more about the situation than some of \nthe bosses. I was firmly convinced that--granted, this was years ago--\nyou can't mess with the chain of command.\n  When you stop and think about what a commander has to do--he is \nrequired to take care of the physical and medical condition of our \ntroops. He is required to oversee their training. He is required to \nhave medical care if they are wounded, and he has to make the decision \nof sending our troops into combat. It is inconceivable to me, with all \nof these responsibilities, that he be taken out of this chain.\n  It is not just me. Others agree with this. I had conversation with \nCol. Ana Smythe of the Marine Corps. She said at a press conference:\n\n       What you don't understand if you're not in the military is \n     that the fabric and the essence of the military is built \n     around the chain of command. . . . If we dismantle or weaken \n     the chain of command, we are lost.\n\n  The CMSgt Barbara Taylor said about the Gillibrand bill:\n\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n\n       It would be devastating to the United States military. . . \n     . A commander cannot be held responsible if he does not have \n     the authority to act.\n\n  So I think those of us who have had military experience and who have \nbeen involved in the military understand the serious problems that \nwould come from the adoption of this bill. I strongly recommend we \ndefeat the Gillibrand bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am relieved that legislation \naddressing the crisis of military assault has finally been brought to \nthe Senate Floor, and I commend the Senator from New York, Mrs. \nGillibrand, and the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, for their \nleadership in bringing this important issue to the forefront.\n  I also acknowledge the courage and conviction of Jennifer Norris and \nRuth Moore--two Mainers who were sexually assaulted while serving our \ncountry. They have made it their mission to change the broken system \nthat has not put victims first. Through their advocacy they have helped \nto shine a light on this crisis, and they deserve our gratitude.\n  In fact, as Senator Gillibrand and I were coming on to the floor, we \nwere stopped by a reporter who asked us: What has made the difference? \nI said it had been the leadership of the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from Missouri, but I also pointed to the survivors of military \nsexual assault who have come forward and been willing to tell their \nstories, painful though those stories are.\n  Since 2004, I have been sounding the alarm over the military's \nineffective response to the growing crisis of sexual assault in the \nmilitary, including the need to ensure appropriate punishment for the \nperpetrators of these crimes, to provide adequate care for the \nsurvivor, and to change the culture across the military so that sexual \nassault is unthinkable.\n  It was 10 years ago, during an Armed Services Committee hearing, that \nI first brought up the alarming increase in the number of sexual \nassaults in the military. Back then the attitude of the witness, GEN \nGeorge Casey, Jr., then Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, testifying at \nthat hearing was completely dismissive, even though these are serious \ncrimes that traumatize survivors and erode the trust and discipline \nfundamental to every military unit. I was appalled at the reaction.\n  While the attitude today among the most senior military leaders is \nmarkedly different than the one that I encountered a decade ago, the \nwork of translating the military's stated policy of zero tolerance into \nreality remains unfinished business. Fostering a culture of zero \ntolerance so that the number of assaults is greatly diminished remains \na goal, not reality. Ensuring that survivors do not think twice about \nreporting an assault for fear of retaliation or damage to their careers \nis still not part of the military culture.\n  In 2011 I joined our former colleague, John Kerry, in introducing the \nDefense STRONG Act as an initial step to address this crisis. The \nprovisions of that bill, which were signed into law as part of the \nfiscal year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, provide survivors \nof sexual assault the assistance of advocates with genuine \nconfidentiality, guaranteed access to an attorney, and expedited \nconsideration for the victim to be transferred far away from the \nassailant.\n  These were helpful first steps. But more than anything, the victims \nof sexual assaults, the survivors, need to have the confidence the \nlegal system in which they report a crime will produce a just and fair \nresult. We need to encourage more reporting, and that is what Senator \nGillibrand's bill will accomplish. This is a goal that I believe is \nshared by all Members of the Senate, despite our differing opinions on \nthe best path forward for achieving these goals.\n  In the 113th Congress, a number of proposals have been introduced \naimed at reducing the barriers to justice that many survivors of sexual \nassault face in our military. I have been pleased to work with both \nSenators Gillibrand and McCaskill toward this end. As a result of our \nefforts, as well as those of many others, including Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member Inhofe, important provisions that all of us agree on \nhave been signed into law as part of this past year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Among those provisions is legislation that I coauthored to extend the \nSTRONG Act to the Coast Guard. In addition, Senator McCaskill and I \nwrote provisions mandating a dishonorable discharge or dismissal for \nany servicemember convicted of sexual assault. We also allowed a \ncommander to relocate an alleged perpetrator of a sexual assault crime \nrather than the survivor. Why should it be the survivor who has to \nmove?\n  Senator Gillibrand and I authored a provision that eliminates the \nelements of the character of the accused from the factors a commander \ncould consider, making it more like what would occur in the civilian \nsystem. Senator Gillibrand, Senator McCaskill, and I authored a \nprovision that eliminates a commander's ability to overturn a \nconviction by a jury post trial for major offenses.\n  I mention these reforms because I am encouraged that we have taken \nthese steps to address this vitally important issue. But more remains \nto be done. I remain cognizant of the fact there are strong views at \nthe Pentagon and within this body about how we should best move forward \nfrom here and what that may mean for the military's unique legal \nsystem. But one of the criticisms which I totally reject is that we \nshould just wait a few more months for the result of a few more studies \nor wait a few more years to see if the recently enacted provisions have \nmade a difference. I strongly disagree.\n  How many more victims are required to suffer before we act further? \nHow many more lives must be ruined before we take additional steps that \nwe know are required to solve this problem? Rather than waiting for the \nresults of yet more studies, we must continue to enact real reforms to \nincrease the confidence of survivors to come forward and report the \ncrimes, to ensure that perpetrators will be dealt with appropriately, \nand to strengthen prevention efforts right now.\n  Senator Gillibrand's bill is a reasonable proposal designed to \ncommunicate to survivors and potential perpetrators alike that when \nsurvivors are subjected to these unacceptable, horrific crimes, they \nwill have access to a legal system that fully protects their interests. \nProviding our troops with that basic confidence is the least we can do.\n  I believe there is no question of Congress' commitment to reducing \nthe instances of sexual assault in the military and providing \nappropriate redress and care for survivors. While we debate various \nproposals, we are united by the need for serious reforms that will \nstrengthen the military's response to sexual assaults. But for the \nleadership of Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill, and the courage \nof those survivors who were finally willing to come forward and tell \ntheir stories and know that we would listen to them, believe them, and \nact, we would not be here today. I am certain that our work will reduce \nthe unnecessary suffering and injustice felt by those who have survived \nthese horrific crimes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The Defense Department has been promising Congress and the American \npeople for a long period of time that they are working on this problem \nof sexual assault, and we are still looking for results, and the \nstatistics get worse. So I believe what Senator Gillibrand is saying \nwith her legislation is enough is enough.\n  I am proud to be a partner in this effort. It fits into an overall \nprinciple of government that I have: Greater transparency brings \naccountability. And I believe this legislation will make this whole \nproblem much more transparent and, with it, accountability to hopefully \nget the issue solved.\n  I appreciate the fact that a large number of commonsense reforms were \nincluded in the national defense authorization. These changes were long\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\noverdue. However, we are past the point of tinkering with the current \nsystem and hoping that does the trick. We have had promises about \ntackling the problem of sexual assault within the current system for \nyears and years, but the problem is still not any better and, \nstatistics show, is getting worse. We don't have the luxury of time to \ntry some new reforms of the current system and hope they have an \nimpact. We have had those promises before.\n  What is more, the current system appears to be part of the problem. I \nwill elaborate on that.\n  We know from the recent Defense Department report that 50 percent of \nfemale victims stated they did not report the crime because they \nbelieved nothing would be done as a result of their reporting; 74 \npercent of the females and 60 percent of the males perceived one or \nmore barriers to reporting sexual assault; and 62 percent of the \nvictims who reported sexual assault indicated they perceived some form \nof professional, social, and/or administrative retaliation.\n  We can talk about protecting victims, and we can enact more \nprotections, as we did in the national defense authorization, but the \nfact remains that the current structure of the military justice system \nis having a deterrent effect on the reporting of these assaults. If \nsexual assault cases aren't reported, they can't be prosecuted. If \nsexual assault isn't prosecuted, predators will remain in the military, \nwhich results in the perception that sexual assault is tolerated in \nthis culture. That destroys morale and it destroys lives. If an enemy \ntried to sow that kind of discord among our military, we wouldn't \ntolerate it, but we are doing it to ourselves.\n  The men and women who have volunteered to place their lives on the \nline deserve better, and our military readiness obviously demands it.\n  Taking prosecutions out of the hands of commanders and giving them to \nprofessional prosecutors who are independent of the chain of command \nwill help ensure impartial justice for the men and women of our forces.\n  I know some Senators will be nervous about the fact that the military \nis lobbying against this legislation. I have the greatest respect for \nour military leaders, but Congress has given the military leadership \nmore than enough time to fix this current system. We can't wait any \nlonger. We should not be intimidated by people coming to the Hill \nbecause of their stars and ribbons. They deserve our respect but not \ndeference to their opinion.\n  We also hear that this measure will affect the ability of commanders \nto retain ``good order and discipline.'' Our legislation in no way \ntakes away the ability of commanders to punish troops under their \ncommand for military infractions. Commanders also can and should be \nheld accountable for the climate under their command. But the point \nhere is that sexual assault is a law enforcement matter, not a military \none.\n  If anyone wants official assurances that we are on the right track, \nwe can take confidence in the fact that an advisory committee appointed \nby the Secretary of Defense supports these reforms. There is an \norganization appointed by the Secretary of Defense which goes by the \nacronym DACOWITS--the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \nServices--which voted overwhelmingly in support of each and every one \nof the components of the Gillibrand bill.\n  DACOWITS was created back in 1951 under Defense Secretary Marshall. \nThe committee is composed of civilian and retired military women and \nmen appointed by the Secretary to provide advice and recommendations on \nmatters and policies relating to the recruitment and retention, \ntreatment, and well-being of our highly qualified professional women in \nthe Armed Forces. Historically, the recommendations by DACOWITS have \nbeen instrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining \nto women in the military. This isn't an outside advocacy group or ad \nhoc panel; it is a longstanding advisory committee handpicked by the \nSecretary of Defense, and it supports the substance of this \nlegislation.\n  It is easier to support incremental reform. In fact, it is also \nprudent to try small reforms before making bigger changes. I understand \nwhy some Senators are nervous about a total overhaul of the military \njustice system. It isn't something I approach lightly. However, we have \nwaited for years as various initiatives to tackle this problem have \nbeen tried.\n  When we are talking about something as serious and life-altering as \nsexual assault, we cannot afford to wait any longer than we already \nhave. The time has come to act decisively to change the military \nculture. We need a clean break from the system where sexual assault \nisn't reported because of a perception that justice won't be done. Our \nmen and women serving this country deserve nothing less, and they \ndeserve it now. They shouldn't have to wait any longer for justice.\n  For those reluctant to take this step, I would say that if the more \nmodest reforms proposed by others prove insufficient and we have to \ncome back and enact our reforms at a later time, how will you justify \nyour vote today?\n  Now is the time for bold action, and I urge my colleagues to join in \nthe effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield to the Senator from Montana, followed by the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I thank Senators Gillibrand and McCaskill \nfor their dedication and commitment to dealing with sexual assault in \nthe military and for bringing a serious problem to the forefront of \nCongress. Their work on the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act \nhelped reform the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But I believe we \nmust do more.\n  My perspective on prosecuting military sexual assault comes from my \n33 years in the Montana National Guard. My view on this is simple: The \ncurrent system is failing the men and women in uniform. And failure is \nunacceptable.\n  While no legislation is perfect, I believe we must fundamentally \nchange how we deal with sexual assault in our military. While I support \nthe reforms that passed last year, we have moved too slowly. Today's \ndebate is about where we go from here.\n  In the Armed Forces today, a military commander is ultimately \nresponsible for the prosecution of these crimes. In the Montana \nNational Guard, except when federalized, we did things differently. If \nthe unimaginable happened, the prosecution of sexual assault would \noccur outside the purview of a military commander. Senator Gillibrand's \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act removes prosecutions from the purview \nof military commanders--much like the Montana National Guard system.\n  One of the arguments I have heard against this bill is that if we \nshift the prosecution of sexual assault outside the chain of command, \nmilitary leaders will somehow lose their authority on other matters. As \na retired military commander, I am confident this is not the case. I \nhave never found myself in a situation with the units I commanded where \ndiscipline and devotion to a mission was jeopardized by compliance with \nthe civilian justice system. I am not talking hypotheticals. The chain \nof command's function is not a mystery to me. I lived it. And it is \nhard to convey how angry you feel when the system fails your fellow \nsoldiers.\n  Today's debate is part of a broader effort to improve our military \nand the lives of those who have served--from the justice system, to the \nVA claims backlog, to ensuring that veterans find jobs when they \ncomplete their service. We have the opportunity to guarantee justice \nfor the men and women within our military and to correct its failures. \nNow it is time to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. William Wilberforce wrote:\n\n       Having heard all this you can choose to look the other way, \n     but you can never again say, ``I did not know.''\n\n  Having heard the stories of sexual assault in the military, we can \nlook away, but we can never say that we have not heard of this problem, \nthat we are going to ignore this problem. I don't think anybody in this \nbody wants to, but the definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same \nthing over and over and\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nexpecting a different result. We have known that sexual assault in the \nmilitary has been a problem decade after decade. I think it is time we \ntried something new.\n  When I heard of a young military recruit from my State--a young woman \nwho was raped, attacked, beaten to a pulp, three nerves pinched in her \nback, her legs and hips bruised such that she couldn't walk, and she \nconsidered suicide--when I heard her rape kit was lost and the case was \ndismissed, I was disheartened. Her assailant is still in the Navy. We \nhave to do something different. We cannot ignore this problem.\n  To me it is as simple as this: Should you have to report your assault \nto your boss? This is what we are talking about. What if your boss goes \ndrinking with the person who assaulted you, who is friends with them? \nWouldn't we want the person you complained to completely outside the \nchain of command? Wouldn't we want to have lawyers involved whose \nspecialty is this type of situation?\n  I am not saying it is easy. Guilt and justice are sometimes hard to \nfind. But we have evidence that people don't trust the system. They say \nthere are 26,000 episodes of unwanted sexual contact. They say 50 \npercent of the victims, though, go unreported. There are a lot of \nreasons for this. Even in the private world, people are afraid or \nashamed or don't feel they can talk about this publicly. But we should \ndo everything possible to make sure it is easy to report this because \nwe don't want this to occur.\n  This doesn't mean, for our men and women who serve, it is a problem \nthat overwhelms the military. It is still a small percentage. But for \nthe 26,000 people having this happen to them, we need to come up with a \nsolution.\n  What Senator Gillibrand has done is an idea whose time has come. It \nis about justice for victims, but it also is about finding due process. \nGetting this out of the arbitrary nature of a commander making a \ndecision and into a court with judges where there will be arguments on \nboth sides I think protects the innocent as well as finds justice for \nthe accused.\n  I overwhelmingly support this bill and this crusade Senator \nGillibrand has led. I suggest to the Senate that we understand the \nproblem goes on, and tweaking this problem or nibbling around the edges \nand saying: Oh, we are just going to wait and see if what we are doing \nis better--we have been doing this for 20 years. I think the time is \nnow to make the change.\n  I stand with Senator Gillibrand, and I wholeheartedly support her \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, there is no doubt that when a sexual \nassault occurs in a military unit, when a servicemember is a victim or \na perpetrator of sexual assault, then we all fail. It is not just the \nmilitary chain of command; it is all of us. That is why the efforts of \nSenator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand have been so critical and \nimportant. They have galvanized this debate. They have forced action \nwhere action needs to be taken. Now the question is, What is the \npathway forward that will achieve what we all want--the reduction of \nsexual assault in the military forces?\n  I have expressed before concerns with the approach Senator Gillibrand \nhas taken because I firmly believe, based on experience in the Active \nmilitary, leadership has to be involved at every stage--recruitment, \ntraining, evaluation, promotion, and retention. When we take the \ncommanders out of any of these steps, we diminish their effectiveness \nin every one of these steps. Removing the commander from these \nresponsibilities, in my view, will weaken his or her effectiveness, and \nthe test of that effectiveness is not in the courtroom, it is on the \nbattlefield, and the consequences of such weakness could be significant \nto the forces of the United States. So we have to continue to maintain \na system that recognizes the need for constant attention to this issue, \nconstant leadership and command focus, on this issue.\n\n  We also have to recognize that the proposal we are putting forward \ntoday--and I think this is critical--is not just about sexual assault; \nit covers a wide range of offenses, offenses like larceny of personal \nequipment in the barracks. It covers a whole host of crimes that are \nnot directly related to sexual assault.\n  As a result of this bifurcated system that would be created, some \ntraditional charges, such as AWOL, have been reserved for the \ncommander, but a significant amount of charges has been referred to \nthis new process. This bifurcated system will cause practical problems \nthat will undercut the effectiveness of units to perform their mission \nand to do what is necessary to protect their soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines.\n  The service JAGs--very experienced legal officers who have served in \nthe uniformed military justice system in the United States--have \npointed out several defects.\n  First, the proposal fails to address the complexity of these cases. \nSome cases will be referred to the special prosecutor, while others \nwill remain with the commander, creating a multiplicity of venues, \nmultiplicity of investigations, and perhaps conflicting decisions; all \nof which not only impose significant costs, but I think interferes with \nthe sense the soldiers should have that they know what the system is.\n  Second, this proposal takes away one of the most significant aspects \nof the military justice system; that is, nonjudicial punishment. For \nexample, as I illustrated before in my remarks, you could have a \nbarracks thief who steals an iPhone and an iPad that accumulates to a \ncertain amount to trigger a charge that has to be referred to a special \nprosecutor. If that special prosecutor declines to prosecute, then it \ngoes back to the company commander. But the company or the battalion \ncommander, given the level of jurisdiction, cannot now impose \nnonjudicial punishment for the simple fact that the accused has to \naccept the punishment, but if there is no way he or she can be court-\nmartialed, that punishment will not be accepted.\n  For offenses that are properly tried or adjudicated through the \nArticle 15 process, those offenses will literally not only go \nunpunished, but the whole climate of command could be significantly \nchanged.\n  Third, there is a constitutional issue, which is that under this \nproposal, you have the creation of a single office--and again I will \nrefer to it generically as special prosecutors--with the authority to \nappoint counsel--defense counsel--and members of courts-martial panels, \nand that raises constitutional problems.\n  Let me conclude by saying that we have had a vigorous debate, and it \nhas been an important debate, but we have had the opportunity since \nthat debate to get the results of the Role of the Commander \nSubcommittee from the Response Systems Panel. These are objective \nmembers--in fact, many of them have for years been in the forefront of \nurging sensible reforms in the military, of being the vanguard in \nprotecting victims in many different forms. They have concluded that \nthe commander should remain within the loop, should remain as Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Fischer proposed, with \ncorrections and with improvements that I think are very appropriate.\n  I would urge that we support strongly the provisions Senators Ayotte, \nMcCaskill, and Fischer have proposed. They strengthen the system. But I \nmust say that to remove the commander as proposed would in the long run \nbe detrimental not only to the effectiveness of the military forces but \ndetrimental to our common goal, which is to reduce sexual assault in \nthe military of the United States. If we do not, if we allow it to \ncontinue--it is a corrosive force that will undermine our forces more \nthan anything else.\n  Committed to that goal, I think we should support Senator McCaskill, \nand I am pleased to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield time to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I thank Senator Gillibrand for her extraordinary leadership.\n  Today you will hear two things: One is to support both bills, which I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\nwe should do, and one is an attack on the Gillibrand bill, which for \nthe life of me I do not understand. I am not going to filibuster \nSenator McCaskill's bill because I think it is important. I am not \ngoing to filibuster Senator Gillibrand's bill because it is the one \nopportunity to bring about the change that the survivors of rape and \nthe survivors of sexual assault are pushing for.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of 45 \norganizations that are supporting the Gillibrand bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Veteran & Women's Groups Supporting the Military Justice Improvement \n                                  Act\n\n       Numerous organizations support the Military Justice \n     Improvement Act, including:\n       Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Vietnam \n     Veterans of America, Service Womens Action Network, Protect \n     Our Defenders, National Women's Law Center, National Task \n     Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, \n     National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, National Research \n     Center for Women & Families, Jacobs Institute of Women's \n     Health, Our Bodies Ourselves, International Federation of \n     Professional and Technical Engineers, Members of the National \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence, 9to5, Baha'is of the United \n     States, Equal Rights Advocates, Evangelical Lutheran Church \n     in America, Federally Employed Women, Feminist Majority, \n     Futures Without Violence, General Federation of Women's \n     Clubs, GetEqual, Girls, Inc.\n       Hindu American Seva Communities, Institute for Science and \n     Human Values, Inc., Jewish Women International, Joyful Heart \n     Foundation, National Capital Union Retirees, National Center \n     on Domestic and Sexual Violence, National Coalition Against \n     Domestic Violence, National Congress of Black Women, Inc, \n     National Council of Churches, National Council of Jewish \n     Women, National Council of Women's Organizations, National \n     Organization for Women, National Women's Health Network, OWL-\n     The Voice of Midlife and Older Women, Peaceful Families \n     Project, Presbyterian Women in the Presbyterian Church \n     (U.S.A.), Inc., Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, \n     SPART*A, an LGBT Military Organization, The National Congress \n     of American Indians, United Church of Christ, Justice and \n     Witness Ministries, V-Day, Woman's National Democratic Club, \n     Women's Research & Education Institute, YWCA USA.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So when people stand here and start attacking that bill \nand saying how awful it is, I want them to remember just a few of the \norganizations that stand with Senator Gillibrand: the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America--do you want to listen to the \nbureaucrats or do you want to listen to the people who know what is \ngoing on--the Vietnam Veterans of America; the Service Women's Action \nNetwork; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; the National \nCongress of Black Women, Inc.; the YWCA. There are 45 organizations.\n  I have a very strong message for colleagues: Do not filibuster \njustice. Do not filibuster the Gillibrand bill. Do not filibuster the \nMcCaskill bill. My goodness, these women deserve an up-or-down vote on \ntheir bills. And the only reason I think some are forcing a filibuster \non the Gillibrand bill is they know we have a majority. Just how strong \nit is we will find out. But what a sad day, when 17 women in the Senate \nsupport both approaches--17 of the 20 women--that we are facing a \nfilibuster on the Gillibrand bill. Do not filibuster justice. It is \npretty simple. You are going to hear a lot of words from politicians \nlike me. Fine. But I think it is important to listen to the words of \nthe victims and find a little humility--stories of victims such as \nAmando Javier, who served in the Marine Corps in 1993. He was brutally \nraped and physically assaulted by a group of fellow marines. Ashamed \nand fearing for his life, he kept his rape a secret for 15 years. Do \nyou know what it is like to keep a secret such as that, to suffer the \npain and humiliation for 15 years.\n  When he finally found the courage to share his story with a friend, \nhe decided to write it down. I want you to listen to his words:\n\n       My experience left me torn apart physically, mentally and \n     spiritually. I was dehumanized and treated with ultimate \n     cruelty by my perpetrators. I was embarrassed. I was ashamed. \n     I didn't know what to do. I was young at the time, and being \n     part of an elite organization that valued brotherhood, \n     integrity and faithfulness made it hard to come forward and \n     reveal what happened.\n\n  Well, here we are two decades later and no one has been held \naccountable for that heinous crime. And it goes on. I appreciate \nSenator Paul reading what happened to one of his constituents. But you \nwill hear the voices of the status quo in this body, and let me tell \nyou, they are in great company, the voices of the status quo, the ones \nwho are filibustering the Gillibrand bill. Let me tell you some of the \nvoices of the status quo--and notice this: They are Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Dick Cheney said in 1992: ``We've got a major effort underway to try \nand educate everybody . . . let them know that we've got a zero-\ntolerance policy.''\n  Secretary Bill Perry: ``For all these reasons, we have zero tolerance \nfor sexual harassment.''\n  This has been going on for 20 years, and that spirit is being \ncontinued right here today from those who want to filibuster the \nGillibrand proposal.\n  Secretary Cohen: ``I intend to enforce a strict policy of zero \ntolerance.''\n  Secretary Rumsfeld: ``Sexual assault will not be tolerated.''\n  Secretary Gates: ``I have zero tolerance.''\n  Secretary Leon Panetta: ``We have no tolerance for this.''\n  Secretary Hagel: ``These crimes have no place in the greatest \nmilitary on earth.''\n  Words are swell. Who can argue with these words? But let's look at \nwhere we are today in terms of what is actually happening on the \nground. I say to the voices who are standing in the way of an up-or-\ndown vote on Kirsten Gillibrand's bill: Look at these facts. There were \n26,000 cases of sexual assault in the military in 2012, and 1.2 percent \nof them have been prosecuted. This white circle represents the 26,000 \ncases. This thin sliver in green that you can barely see represents the \namount that was prosecuted. Do you know what happens to these folks who \nget out? They continue their activities either in the military or on \nthe streets of our cities, our counties, and our States. Yet these \nvoices of the status quo in this Senate will tell you ``oh my goodness, \nwe cannot make this change'' even though 45 organizations, including \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan fighters, are telling us to do so.\n  Here is the deal. This is another way to look at it. There were \n26,000 estimated sexual assaults in 2012. We have a 90-percent \nproblem--90 percent of these cases go unreported. Guess what, folks. \nAre you surprised they are afraid to go to their commander, those of \nyou who are supporting this status quo? Just ask them. Do not listen to \nSenator Gillibrand or to me. We are not in the military. The people who \nare in the military are telling us, begging us, along with every \norganization that stands for the survivors: Please change it.\n  Now I ask you, if there was a rape in your office in the Senate and \nsomebody upstairs yelled and screamed and you went up there as a \nSenator, what would you do? Would you decide whether the case ought to \nbe prosecuted or would you call the police? Would you call the experts?\n  I do not think CEOs ought to determine whether a case of rape should \nbe prosecuted. Do you? I don't think so. Yet that is what you are \nsupporting here with the commander who knows all the players. Suppose \nhe goes out to drink with the perp, knows him well, thinks he is a \ngreat fighter. I know Senator McCaskill is trying to fix these problems \naround the edges--fine--but let's get to the heart of the matter.\n  In summation, we can continue the 20 years of baloney and not make \nthe change that needs to be made under the important Gillibrand bill. \nWhat we do is we say we are keeping this in the military, but we are \nallowing the experts to make the decision. That is fair to the accuser, \nand that is fair to the accused. As a matter of fact, we have people \nsupporting us because they believe it is fair to both sides, not just \nthe accuser.\n  So let's not filibuster justice. Do not stand here and say how you \ncare about this and then filibuster the Gillibrand bill because you \nwill be judged on that vote. If you have problems with the details of \nthe bill, vote against the bill but do not filibuster justice.\n  This is a chance we have, an opportunity we have. Yes, it will be \nrevisited over and over because these problems, if we do not make these \nchanges, are going to continue. Today is an amazing moment in time that \nwe could come together and allow an up-or-down vote on\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nthe Gillibrand proposal. We wouldn't be filibustering justice, and I \nthink we would bring some needed change--needed change, Madam \nPresident, that all the leading named organizations I have put in the \nRecord endorse. I hope we will stand with those victims, stand with \nthose providers, and stand with those advocacy groups and be humble and \nnot say we know better than they.\n  Thank you very much, and I thank Senator Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me thank Senator McCaskill for \nher terrific leadership on this matter and Senator Ayotte and others on \nour committee who worked so hard to strengthen our laws against sexual \nassault and strengthen the ability of our commanders to act, as we did \nin our defense authorization bill and in the second bill we will be \nvoting on today.\n  We will be voting today on two bills regarding sexual assault in our \nmilitary, and I believe the strongest, most effective approach we can \ntake to reduce sexual assault is to hold commanders accountable for \nestablishing and maintaining a command climate that does not tolerate \nsexual assault. In order to do that, we must maintain the important \nauthority to prosecute sexual assaults that our military commanders now \nhave, and we must add greater accountability for those commanders.\n  The evidence shows that removing this authority from our commanders \nwould weaken, not strengthen, our response to this urgent problem. That \nis why I believe the bill offered by Senator Gillibrand and others, \nthough offered in the hope that it would strengthen our efforts against \nsexual assault, will in fact have the opposite effect.\n  In the last year we have learned that in scores of cases during the \nperiod study, commanders prosecuted sexual assault cases that civilian \nattorneys had declined to prosecute. We have learned our military \nallies, whose policies have been cited in support of removing \ncommanders' authority, generally made their changes to protect the \nrights of the accused, not the victim. We have learned there is no \nevidence that their changes resulted in any increase in reporting of \nassaults. So when the allies made the change--not to protect victims \nbut to increase the rights of the accused--it did not lead to any \nincrease in the reporting of assaults.\n  On January 29, we received the conclusions of a report from the \nResponse Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel--an independent \npanel of legal and military experts of diverse backgrounds that was \nestablished by Congress to advise us on how to respond to this issue. A \nsubcommittee of the panel addressed the role of commanders in \nprosecuting sexual assaults, the very issue we will be voting on today.\n  Here is what that subcommittee concluded:\n\n       There is no evidentiary basis at this time supporting a \n     conclusion that removing senior commanders as convening \n     authority will reduce the incidence of sexual assault or \n     increase sexual assault reporting.\n\n  The subcommittee reached that conclusion, despite the fact that many \nmembers began the process sympathetic--if not outright supportive--of \nthe notion that we should remove the commanders' authority.\n  Here is what one member of the subcommittee, former Congresswoman \nElizabeth Holtzman, said:\n\n       I've changed my mind, because I was just listening to what \n     we heard. I started out . . . thinking, why not change it and \n     now I am saying, why change it. . . . Just turning it over to \n     prosecutors doesn't mean you are going to get the results you \n     are looking for. . . .\n\n  Congresswoman Holtzman authored the Federal rape shield law when she \nwas a Member of Congress.\n  Another member of the subcommittee, former Federal Judge Barbara \nJones, said that if you remove this authority from commanders ``there \nis no empirical evidence that reporting is going to increase. . . . If \nI were persuaded that removing the convening authority would encourage \nvictims to report then this would be a different story. But I am not \npersuaded of that.''\n  Listen to Mai Fernandez, the executive director of the National \nCenter for Victims of Crime. She was a member of the panel, and this is \nwhat she said about the proposal to remove commanders' authority to \nprosecute:\n\n       When you hear it at first blush, you go, ``Yeah, I want to \n     go with that.'' But when you hear the facts, like you would \n     in a case, it just doesn't hold up.\n\n  The women making those statements had no stars on their shoulders; \nthey are not Pentagon insiders. They are members of the independent \npanel that we in Congress tasked with reporting to us on these issues.\n  Underlying the crisis of sexual assault in our military is a problem \nof culture, a culture that has been too permissive of sexual \nmisconduct, too unaware that a person who is successful in his \nprofessional life may also be a sexual predator. It is a culture too \nprone to ostracize or even act against those who report sexual \nassaults.\n  The military has unique tools to address those problems. Foremost \namong those tools is the authority of the commander to establish a \ncommand climate by giving orders and enforcing discipline. At every \ntime in our history when our military has faced such cultural \nchallenges--such as the challenge of ending racial discrimination in \nthe 1940s and 1950s or the challenge of ending don't ask, don't tell in \nour time--commanders with the authority to initiate courts-martial have \nbeen essential in achieving change.\n  But we are not going to achieve change if--at the same time we demand \nof our commanders that they change the military culture to take on the \nsexual assault problem--we remove their most powerful tool to achieve \nthat change.\n  Senator Gillibrand's bill creates a new, separate disposition \nauthority to deal with the sexual assault and other serious crimes. Our \nfocus throughout this debate has been, rightly, on how to improve our \napproach to sexual assault. As a matter of fact, sexual assault would \nmake up just a fraction of the cases this new disposition authority \nwould deal with.\n  In a letter to me, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \nReadiness Jessica Wright recently reported in fiscal year 2012, the \nDepartment of Defense estimates it handled more than 5,600 cases that \nwould be referred to this new disposition authority if it were created, \nbut two-thirds of those cases did not involve sexual assault. The \nGillibrand bill would shift dozens of our top military lawyers to a new \nauthority that would spend only one-third of its time dealing with the \nproblem we are trying to solve, the problem of sexual assault.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act, which we enacted just a few \nmonths ago, provides our commanders with additional tools to meet this \nchallenge and important new protections for victims. It provides \nvictims of sexual assault with their own legal counsel specially \ntrained to assist them. It makes retaliation a crime when that \nretaliation is against victims who report a sexual assault. It requires \nthat the inspector general investigate all complaints of retaliation. \nIt requires that any decision by a commander not to prosecute a sexual \nassault complaint will have an automatic review by a higher command \nauthority--in nearly all cases by a general or flag officer and in \ncertain cases by the service Secretary, the highest civilian authority \nin each service.\n  The second bill we are going to vote on today--offered by Senators \nMcCaskill, Ayotte, and others--provides additional protections to those \nwe just added in the National Defense Authorization Act. The McCaskill-\nAyotte bill ensures victims have a voice in deciding whether their \ncases will be prosecuted in the military or civilian justice system. \nIndeed, it requires that special victims' counsel established by the \nNational Defense Authorization Act advise victims on the pros and cons \nof those two approaches. It requires that commanding officers be graded \non their success or failure in creating a climate in which there is no \ntolerance for sexual misconduct and in which victims can come forward \nwithout fear.\n  These additional protections in the McCaskill-Ayotte bill help us \nanswer\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nthe key question of how can we best strengthen our protections against \nmilitary sexual assault. I believe we do so by empowering victims and \nby holding our commanders accountable, but we threaten to weaken those \nprotections if we undermine the authority of the very commanders who \nmust be at the heart of the solution. Powerful evidence should lead us \nto the conclusion that we should not remove the authority of commanders \nto prosecute these cases.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield my time to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nGillibrand's Military Justice Improvement Act. I wish to recognize her \nand all of the Senators who have worked so hard on this legislation and \nall of the groups who have been involved.\n  I was very proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation, and \nafter more than 1 year of meeting with military sexual assault \nsurvivors and bringing attention to this ongoing crisis, I am \nencouraged by the historic opportunity we have today.\n  As Senator Levin said, this is an important debate for us to be \nhaving. I certainly applaud Senators McCaskill and Ayotte and everyone \nwho has been involved in this effort because I think it sends a very \nimportant message to our leaders in the military and to those who would \nperpetrate crimes of sexual violence.\n  Today we not only have the opportunity to make meaningful, \ncommonsense reforms to our military criminal justice system but we also \nhave a chance to send a very powerful message to the tens of thousands \nof victims--many of whom have been suffering quietly for decades--that \nwhat happened to them is not acceptable; it is criminal, and it will no \nlonger be tolerated.\n  Let's be clear: Sexual assault is a crime. It is not an accident. It \nis not a mistake. It is a violent criminal act often perpetrated by \nserial offenders. We can't allow sexual assault perpetrators to escape \njustice in any setting but particularly when these assaults occur \nwithin our Nation's military.\n  Unfortunately, it has been 23 years since the Tailhook scandal, and \ndespite the repeated assurances that the chain of command is committed \nto addressing this issue, we are no closer to a solution. How long will \nwe wait? How many tens of thousands of our sons and daughters will be \nvictims? How many will be victims without reliable access to justice?\n  Today we have a rare opportunity to end one of the fundamental \nstructural biases that persists in our military criminal justice \nsystem. This is not about undermining battlefield command or good order \nand discipline. No one wants to do that. This is about access to \njustice.\n  Survivors overwhelmingly tell us that the reason they don't come \nforward is because they don't trust that chain of command. They don't \ntrust that the chain of command will handle their case objectively, a \nfact that has been repeatedly acknowledged by military leaders during \nArmed Services Committee hearings. Placing the decision on whether to \ngo to trial in the hands of experienced military prosecutors is a \ncommonsense reform that will go a long way toward promoting \ntransparency and accountability within our system.\n  Our military's tradition of honor and respect is too important to \ncontinue to be plagued by the status quo. We strengthen our military \nwhen victims of sexual assault have the confidence to come forward and \nreport crimes and we remove fear and stigma from the process. We \nstrengthen our military when we are able to deliver fair and impartial \njustice on behalf of victims.\n  Victims' eyes are on us today. There is strong bipartisan support \nbehind the Gillibrand bill. It is on full display. I certainly urge all \nof my colleagues to support this measure, and let's make meaningful \nreform to what has happened for too long to victims of sexual assault \nin the military.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise, together with my colleagues \nSenator Graham and Senator Ayotte, and ask that the Chair advise when \nwe have used 20 minutes of time. We are going to engage in a colloquy \nabout this important decision that is in front of the Senate.\n  It is, in fact, with great humility that I come to this policy \ndebate. I don't think anyone in the Senate has spent more time in a \ncourtroom putting perpetrators in prison who have committed sexual \ncrimes. I don't think anybody has spent more time with victims of \nsexual assault. There is an incredible amount of pressure that you feel \nwhen you walk into a courtroom knowing that victim has placed trust in \nyou to bring the evidence forward, and I am forever marked by that \nexperience. It is with that experience that I have become convinced \nthat the policy changes that are being advocated will not work for \nvictims.\n  In fact, it is clear that when these changes have been enacted other \nplaces, reporting has not increased. It is clear that right now we have \nmore cases going to court-martial over the objections of prosecutors \nthan the objections of commanders. Today there is a court-martial \nongoing where a prosecutor walked away from the serious charges and the \ncommander said go forward. There have been almost 100 cases over the \nlast 2 years where prosecutors said this case is too tough and the \ncommanders have said, no, we have to get to the bottom of it. We can't \nlet the commanders walk away. We cannot let the commanders walk away.\n  There is nothing in the Gillibrand proposal that provides additional \nprotection from retaliation.\n  I ask Senator Graham: If someone walks back into their unit after \nbeing victimized and the unit knows the commander has said this case is \ngoing forward, how would that contrast to walking back into his or her \nunit when the unit knows some lawyer in Fort Belvoir--hundreds of miles \naway--has said whether this case should go forward? I am trying to \nfigure out how removing the commander provides any additional \nprotection from retaliation to that victim.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a very good question. The commander in the \nmilitary is just not somebody. The man or woman in charge of that unit \nis the person to whom we give the ultimate authority to decide life-\nand-death decisions for that unit. So if we deal the commander out, we \nhave a rape in the barracks. The worst thing that could happen in a \nunit is for the commander to say, This is no longer my problem. It is \nthe commander's problem. Every commander I have met wants it to \ncontinue to be their problem, because when we have one member of a unit \nassaulting the other, it affects everybody in that unit. And the person \nwe as a nation choose to run the finest military in the world--the \ncommander--has the absolute authority to maintain that unit for \nreadiness. If we don't give that commander the tools and hold them \naccountable, that unit will fall apart right in front of our eyes, \nbecause some lawyer somewhere is no substitute for the commander who is \nthere every day.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I would say to Senator Ayotte, I am also struggling \nwith some of the practical problems in this policy, and one of the \nthings I can't figure out is why the amendment limits the ability to \nadd any additional resources. It strictly prohibits the military from \nbringing additional resources to bear on this problem, which is \ncounterintuitive to me. If the goal here is to do our very best job to \nprotect victims, and the practical problem is we do not have enough of \nthe level of JAG officers right now to set up these offices on a global \nbasis, which means things are going to slow down because we don't have \nenough--I know the Senator from New Hampshire has been a prosecutor. \nCertainly there is nothing harder for a victim than justice delayed.\n  So in addition to it not increasing reporting, in addition to it not \nprotecting from retaliation, in addition to removing commanders from \ntheir accountability, we also have some real practical implications.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator from Missouri for her leadership. She \nis correct. She has prosecuted more of these cases than I think anyone \nin this body, so I appreciate her leadership.\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n  Under the system that is put forward under the Gillibrand proposal--\nlet me thank her for her passion about this issue as well--we know it \nprohibits funding and personnel. How does that work when we are going \nto set up a whole new system? I worry about the deployability of this \nsystem. When someone is in Iraq or Afghanistan and they are a victim, \nwhere are these JAG lawyers going to be? Will they be in Washington \nmaking these decisions? But we won't be able to put any additional \nresources toward it. So is this system still deployable?\n  There are other problems with implementation. There are big concerns \nabout the right to a speedy trial. If that happens, as we know, then \nthe defendant can't be prosecuted.\n  Eliminating the ability to plea bargain--we heard Senator Reid speak \nabout that, because this proposal eliminates two-thirds of the crimes \nfrom the UCMJ out of the authority of the commander, well beyond this \nissue of sexual assault, which we are committed to addressing. It also \ncreates serious due process concerns. So there are serious \nimplementation questions about this.\n  I wish to raise a question that keeps coming up: We need to hold the \ncommanders more accountable. I agree with the Senator from Missouri. We \ncannot allow them off the hook. If we take them out of this equation, \nthen there will be less accountability. Our proposal actually has it as \npart of how a commander is going to be judged, how the commanders \nhandle these cases. That is not the status quo, because we want the \nchain of command to be more accountable. But we keep hearing we want \nvictims to come forward, and the Senator from Missouri knows that from \nher experience as a prosecutor.\n  I would say this: Does the evidence support that more victims will \ncome forward if we actually pass the Gillibrand proposal? Because why \nare we here. We want more victims to come forward. Will more victims \nsee justice if this proposal is passed? Because this is ultimately what \nwe are trying to get at.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. We have hard data on that. In fact, I think that is \none of the reasons, if we look at this quote:\n\n       I went into this thinking Senator Gillibrand's legislation \n     made sense, but when you hear the facts, it doesn't hold up.\n\n  That is an important quote, but even more important when we realize \nwho said it. This is the woman who runs the National Center for Victims \nof Crime for our entire Nation. She heard 150 witnesses, representing \nmany of the groups that have been referenced in this debate. She \nrealized that when they looked at the data, our allies have done this, \nand not in one nation, after years of experience with changing the \nsystem, has the reporting increased.\n  The way we increase reporting is to give the victim a safe harbor, \nwhich we have done, to report outside the chain of command, and to have \ntheir own lawyer, and to make sure they have power and deference in the \nprocess, which we have done, along with the reforms, on which I am very \nproud to have worked with Senator Gillibrand.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if we wanted to find the definition of \nleadership in 2014: McCaskill, Ayotte, and the great Senator from \nNebraska, three women taking on an issue head on. To those of my \nDemocratic colleagues who are going to stick with making reforms \nwithout destroying a commander's role in the military: You deserve a \nlot of credit because people have been on your butt in the donor \ncommunity to vote the other way.\n  To these ladies--and there have been plenty of people helping--they \ndon't know how much it will be appreciated in the military. This is not \na legal debate here. How many of my colleagues have done courts-\nmartial? How many of my colleagues have court-martialed anybody in the \nmilitary? I have done hundreds, as a prosecutor and as a defense \nattorney. This is not some casual event to me.\n  What Senator Gillibrand is doing is way off base. It will not get us \nto the promised land of having a more victim-friendly system to report \nsexual assaults. That is being accomplished because of the people I \nhave just named: Senators Fischer, Ayotte, McCaskill, and Senator \nLevin. They have brought about reforms in terms of how a case is \nreported in the military, allowing a lawyer to be assigned to every \nvictim. I cannot tell my colleagues how proud I am of what they have \nbeen able to accomplish. The U.S. military is going to have the most \nvictim-friendly system of every jurisdiction in the land, including New \nYork and South Carolina.\n\n  But this is about the commander. How many of my colleagues believe we \nhave the finest military in the entire world? Every Member of this body \nwould raise their hand. The question is why. Because we have the best \nlawyers in the world? No. Because we have the best commanders--men and \nwomen who are given the responsibility to defend this Nation and have \npower and responsibility that most of my colleagues could never \nenvision. And if this is about sexual assault, why the hell are we \ntaking barracks theft out of the commander's purview?\n  This is about liberal people wanting to gut the military justice \nsystem--social engineering run amok. I want to help victims, but I also \nwant a fair trial. But the one thing I will not say to our commanders \nwho exist in 2014: You are fired, because you are morally bankrupt. You \ndon't have the ability to render justice in your unit because there is \nsomething wrong with you; your sense of justice is askew, so we are \ngoing to fire you and take away an authority you have had traditionally \nto make sure that your unit is ready to go to war, because we feel as \nthough you are morally bankrupt. What other conclusion can we come to?\n  The next time we see somebody in the military who is a senior member \nof the 3 percent that Senator Gillibrand speaks about--it is only 3 \npercent who make these decisions. Who are these 3 percent? They are our \nwing commanders, our squadron commanders, our fleet commanders, our \nbrigade commanders--the people we entrust and hold accountable for \nfighting and winning the war.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we care about what military lawyers think, \nevery judge advocate general is begging us not to do this. The people \nwe are going to give the power to don't want it because they understand \nthat the commander is different than the lawyer. The first female judge \nadvocate general of the Army has made an impassioned plea: Do not do \nthis.\n  This is not a legal issue alone; this is about how to maintain the \nbest military in the world.\n  I would conclude that if we want to create confusion in the ranks and \nif we want to tell every enlisted person who has to--should be--looking \nup to the commander, the Senate just fired your boss when it comes to \nthese kinds of matters, but you should still respect him, that is a \nvery confusing message.\n  I wish to end my speech with this: We have had some bad commanders. \nHowever, to those who command the military, I have confidence in you. \nYou will take this system to a new level. You have to up your game, but \nI am not going to fire you. Thank you for commanding the finest \nmilitary in the world. I will do nothing to say you are morally \nbankrupt, because I don't believe that.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I have great respect for the Senator's time and for \nworking in the trenches as a military prosecutor in the JAG corps. I \nwill tell my colleagues honestly, I am less concerned about the \ncommanders than I am the victims. The Senator and I maybe don't see it \nexactly the same way in that regard. I believe there are commanders who \ndeserve to be held accountable for their failure to act, for their want \nto sweep this crime under the rug throughout history, but I think we \nare handing the broom to the prosecutors at this point based on the \ndata we have.\n  One of the things I wanted to go over and mention to Senator Ayotte \nis the systems response panel. I think it is important to understand--\nthe DACOWITS panel was mentioned. I want everybody to understand the \ndifference between the DACOWITS panel and the systems response panel. \nThe DACOWITS panel has been in place for years, and they took up this \nmatter and heard no witnesses from the JAG corps. In fact, I think they \nheard two witnesses or three witnesses and two of them were me and \nKirsten Gillibrand. They took no time to really go deeply into this \nvery complex subject.\n  The systems response panel was created by Congress, and it was for \nthe purpose of giving us their clear eye of\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nadvice on the best way to deal with this problem in the military.\n  This is a majority of civilians and a majority of women who made up \nthis panel. They heard 150 witnesses over months. They heard from all \nof the people who are advocating for the Gillibrand proposal. They \nheard from the JAGs. They heard from victim organizations. They came \nout overwhelmingly rejecting this proposal.\n  One of the most interesting members--and I will be honest; when I \nwent to testify in front of this response panel, I was very worried \nthat Elizabeth Holtzman maybe would not agree with me. She has a long \nhistory in Congress. She wrote the Federal rape shield statute. I \nassumed she would begin this process assuming that in the simple \nequation of victims versus commanders, I take victims. If only it were \nthat simple. What the response panel figured out is that it is not that \nsimple.\n  Judge Holtzman, the judge who wrote the decision overturning DOMA, \nsaid:\n\n       Just turning it over to prosecutors doesn't mean you are \n     going to get the results you are looking for.\n\n  And Elizabeth--this is what Elizabeth Holtzman said: ``Just turning \nit over to prosecutors doesn't mean you are going to get the results \nyou are looking for.'' That is what Holtzman said.\n  Judge Jones: ``There is no evidence that removing the convening \nauthority is going to improve any of the parts of the system.''\n  That is startling, this response, from a panel that looked at it over \nmonths, 150 witnesses, majority civilians, majority women. This is not \na bumper sticker. It is not as simple as it sounds. I would never \noppose anything that I thought was going to help victims or put more \nperpetrators in prison--ever. This will have the opposite impact that \nmany of the advocates are indicating that it will.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Let me just say, this panel took on the key question. \nThat is why we are doing this. I am doing this because I believe \nvictims will get justice and there will be more accountability. I want \nto hold commanders more accountable for not only how they handle these \ncrimes but also for that zero tolerance policy within their unit. That \nis why we want them judged on this basis.\n  That panel has looked at this issue of reporting and found that there \nis no evidentiary basis at this time to support a conclusion that \nremoving senior commanders as the convening authority will reduce the \nincidence of sexual assault--which we want them to establish that \nclimate within their unit to do so--or increase reporting of sexual \nassaults.\n  I would also say, if we want justice for victims, what about those 93 \nvictims where the commander said: Bring the case forward, even though \nthe JAG lawyer said no? They would not have gotten justice. So the \nevidence is the opposite. What would we say to those victims? The \nevidence shows that actually commanders are bringing cases more \nfrequently than their JAG's lawyers and over their objections.\n  The panel also found that none of the military justice systems of our \nallies was changed or set up to deal with the problem of sexual \nassault. So for those allies who have taken it out of the chain of \ncommand, this panel said that none of them can attribute any changes in \nthe reporting of sexual assault to changing the role of the commander.\n  We were told from the beginning of this argument that our allies \nchanged this so that more people would come forward. Well, they have \nnot. In fact, what we learned is many of our allies changed it to \nprotect defendants.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Isn't it true that, in fact, our reporting is up?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Our reporting has actually--since 2013, in the Marine \nCorps it is up 80 percent and in the Army it is up 50 percent. That is \neven before the legislation that we have all worked on to have special \nvictims counsels for every single victim that we have already passed in \nthis body.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for just a second?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Why is it nobody seems to think taking the commander out \nof the loop is going to help the problem? Because you cannot solve the \nproblem in the military unless the commander buys in. I cannot think of \nany change in the military that is major and substantial that can \nhappen without the chain of command being held accountable and buying \nin.\n  I would like to say this. To those who believe our military is set up \nwhere a victim's case is never heard because you have some distant \nfigure called the commander and they just put this stuff under the rug, \nO-6 commanders--the O-6 level are special court-martial convening \nauthorities. General court-martial convening authorities are flag \nofficers.\n  It is not rampant in the military, folks, where a JAG will go in to \nthe commander and say: This is a case that needs to be prosecuted, sir, \nmadam; and the commander says: I don't want to fool with this.\n  The opposite is true, where the JAG will say: Tough; and the \ncommander says: Move forward.\n  Well, what have we done here. We have said to the command that if \nyour judge advocate recommends prosecution in the four areas in \nquestion--sexual assault--and the commander refuses to prosecute, that \ndecision is appealed to the Secretary of the service.\n  So if you are wondering about rogue commanders--and there are bad \ncommanders--you are indicting the whole chain of command here, folks. \nThat is why I am so emotional about this. You are indicting a class of \nAmericans who deserve praise and a chance to get their act together \nwhere they failed.\n  But the bottom line is, if a commander refuses to--I ask unanimous \nconsent for 1 minute--2 minutes.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the commander refuses the JAG's recommendation, it \ngoes to the Secretary of the service. If the JAG and the commander both \nsay this is not a case we want to prosecute, when it is in the area of \nsexual assault, it goes to the commander's commander. So there are \nbuilt-in checks and balances.\n  The key to fixing this problem is the commander. The key to \nmaintaining a well-run military is the commander. The key to fighting \nand winning wars is the commander. The key to bringing justice to \nvictims is the court-martial panel, the lawyers, the judge and the \njuries, and the commander. But the key to American military success \nover time has been the commander.\n  Madam President, 800 trials in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11. This \nis a nondeployable military justice system that Senator Gillibrand is \ntrying to create. Please do not change the structure of the military \nbecause of this issue. Fix this issue. Preserve the structure of the \nmilitary that has served us so well, and keep reforming.\n  To the Senators I have named, you have done those in the military--\nvictims--a great service. For God's sake, Members of the Senate, do not \nchange the structure of the military at a time we need it the most. \nHold it more accountable, not less.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I yield my time to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I first would like to thank Senators \nGillibrand, McCaskill, Ayotte, and Fischer for their hard work on this \nissue, and my friend from South Carolina, who has worked passionately \nhard on this issue also.\n  As someone who strongly believes in bipartisanship, I am glad to see \nthe Senate moving forward today on debating and voting on this \nparticular issue.\n  While we may not all agree on how to best solve this particular \nissue, we can all agree that it is too important not to debate and \nultimately vote on ways to address it.\n  Our military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. \nThe freedoms we enjoy as Americans are because men and women continue \nto volunteer to serve and to protect our Nation.\n  The vast majority of these men and women serve with honor and \nintegrity. However, there are a few bad actors in our military who \ncommit crimes against their fellow servicemembers.\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nThe question the Senate faces is whether or not the military justice \nsystem is equipped to properly handle sexual assault within the ranks.\n  After careful consideration, weighing all the facts, I feel the \nmilitary today is not equipped, and that is why I support Senator \nGillibrand's approach.\n  Like everyone else in this Chamber, I am disappointed we ever got to \nthis point. No soldier should have their service degraded due to \ndishonorable conduct in the ranks. But there have been ample \nopportunities for the military to address this issue within its own \nranks, and too much time has passed without this problem being \nresolved.\n  It is Congress's responsibility now to step in to protect the best \nAmerica has to offer. Congress needs to address what is currently \nlacking for victims. Victims need to feel confident in reporting crimes \nof sexual assault. Victims must be protected from retaliation, and \nvictims must be confident that justice will be served.\n  Senator Gillibrand's legislation will accomplish these goals.\n  If the Senate passes this bill today, loopholes in the military \nstructure will no longer be an option to protect sexual assailants. \nThese changes are long overdue and will hold the military to the \nhighest standards that they strive towards.\n  I encourage the rest of my colleagues to join me in supporting her \nefforts and keeping our commitment to protect the men and women who are \nhonorably serving our Nation.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I yield Senator McCaskill's time to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to speak in full support of the \nMcCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer proposal that is before us today. It will only \nstrengthen the historic reforms that have already been passed by this \nbody to combat sexual assault in the military.\n  I also rise to express concerns with the Gillibrand proposal to \nremove commanders from this process because I believe that is going to \nundermine credibility and accountability.\n  I am glad we are having this debate on the floor because every Member \nof this Senate agrees that this is a problem that needs to be \naddressed.\n  Over the past year the members of the Armed Services Committee have \nfocused on this issue. It cuts across ideology, across gender, and \nacross regions. It also cuts across party lines.\n  I was happy to work across the aisle with Senator Shaheen on \nimproving the standards for personnel responsible for sexual assault \nprevention. I was pleased to join with Senator Blumenthal to ensure \nthat victims' rights are protected under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice.\n  I would argue that our efforts to fight sexual assault show Congress \nat its best. It is how we are supposed to work. So although we may \ndisagree, we do share the same goals.\n  Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand have both been real leaders \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee, which held that landmark \nhearing with our top commanders to explore the problem of sexual \nviolence in the ranks last June.\n  The committee received input from all sides, and we, along with our \nHouse colleagues, passed a series of very meaningful reforms when we \npassed the National Defense Authorization Act. Those are reforms of \nwhich we can all be proud.\n  We stripped commanders of the ability to overturn jury convictions. \nWe made retaliation against victims a crime. We required dishonorable \ndischarge or dismissal for those convicted of sexual assault.\n  Now we are trying to strengthen that. We are trying to strengthen \nthose great reforms with the McCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer legislation. I \nbelieve our proposal will do more to strengthen the rights of victims, \nand it will enhance the tools to prosecute the criminals.\n  Specifically, our bill extends the current protections to service \nacademies. That is so important. That is in our bill. It boosts the \nevaluation standards for commanders--also important. It allows the \nvictims increased input--extremely important. So rather than revamping \nthe entire military justice system, which I believe carries massive \nrisk, our proposal improves and updates the current system.\n  Unfortunately, the Gillibrand proposal, I believe, takes radical \nsteps, and it undermines the commander's responsibility for his or her \ntroops. Under that proposal, almost all crimes--from forgery to sexual \nviolence--are removed from a commander's purview. It does not bring \nthat focus to the challenge we are facing. Our proposal does.\n  The other proposal detaches the commander from his or her unit, and \nit removes all responsibility. I do not want to remove the \nresponsibility from a commander. We trust these people to watch our \nbest and our brightest, our children and our grandchildren, as they go \ninto battle. We need to trust them in this as well.\n  Senator McCaskill brings a wealth of experience to bear on this topic \nfrom her days as a prosecutor, and I believe we should all be listening \nto her. She mentioned in November that the other proposal was \n``seductively simple.'' I agree. I agree that its simplicity cloaks a \nhost of very complex policy problems. She has invested a lot of time on \nthis issue. She has explained the technical problems, and I echo her \nconcerns.\n  But I would like to underline one critical point to my colleagues. \nMany of our problems with the other proposal might appear to be minor \nprocedural details. However, experience tells us that it is exactly \nthese sorts of problems that can grind a justice system to a halt, and \nthey can damage a legal system.\n  That was the case in 2007, when Congress, armed with the best of \nintentions, modified the rape statute. Those hasty changes disrupted \nthe judicial process and compelled Congress to rewrite the language. Do \nyou know what happened? It delayed justice.\n  So I urge my colleagues and anyone interested in completely revamping \nthat military justice system, you need to be certain that all the \nquestions are resolved and you need to be certain that the \nimplementation will be bulletproof because anything less means delayed \njustice or no justice at all for the victims.\n  I can go on and talk about the commission that brought forth their \nrecommendations that the justice remain with the commanders. They did \nnot say take it away from the commanders. And the makeup of that \ncommission? Mostly civilian and mostly female.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember these things, look at the facts, \nlook at how we truly can address the needs of the victims, truly find \nthem justice. Support the McCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer proposal, and I \nwould ask that you not support the Gillibrand proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I want to profusely \nthank her and Senator Ayotte and Senator Fischer for their leadership \non this very difficult and emotional issue which obviously is very \nunpleasant and very controversial and understandably so. We are talking \nabout the livelihood, the right to function as members of the military, \nof women in the military.\n  It is a vital issue because there should be no organization that is \nat the level of the United States military for providing an equal \nopportunity and equal protection under the law than the United States \nmilitary. When these young men and women join the military, they do \nsomething very unique; that is, they are willing to put their lives on \nthe line for the defense of this country.\n  Therefore, because of this unique aspect of their lives, that they \nare willing to serve for the benefit of the rest of us, there is also \nthe responsibility of those who command them. That is unique as well. \nThose who command in the military may have to make the toughest \ndecision of all and to send these young people into harm's way. No \nother--no other--person in American society, outside of the President \nof the United States, has that responsibility.\n  So what we are really talking about today here is, will we hold those \ncommanders responsible for anything that\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nhappens within their command or will we take that responsibility and \nshift it over to a lawyer? That is what this is really all about. Right \nnow we have units operating in Afghanistan.\n  Frankly, according to the Gillibrand proposal, if there was a charge, \nwe may have to try to find some way to fly a lawyer in. I do not think \nthat is either likely or agreeable. But the major point here is that we \nhold commanders responsible for what happens under their command. If \nthey do not carry out those duties, then we relieve them of that \ncommand. If they are responsible for egregious conduct, we prosecute \nthem.\n  I have had the great honor of command. I have had the great honor of \ncommanding, at that time, the largest squadron in the U.S. Navy, some \n1,000 people. There were a large number of women in that organization, \neven then, because it was a shore-based squadron. Now we have women \nthroughout--I am happy to say--throughout the military, including \ncombat roles.\n  I can tell you that in those days we had severe racial problems in \nthe United States military. We had race riots on aircraft carriers. We \nheld commanders responsible. We punished those who practiced \ndiscrimination. We had people in our chain of command that alerted and \nwere responsible for the indoctrination and the good conduct of people \nwho in any way showed a taint of discrimination. I am happy to say that \nI believe that the greatest equal opportunity organization in America \ntoday is the United States military.\n  We can do that with this severe and difficult and emotional issue of \nsexual assaults in the military. The exact wrong way to do that is to \nmake the commanding officer less responsible because if you take the \nresponsibility from that commanding officer, then you are eroding his \nability to lead and, I would argue, their ability to fight.\n  We have the finest commanders in our military. We have the finest men \nand women who are serving in the military. We are the best military in \nthe world. There is a reason for it. As we bring people up the ladder \nof promotion to positions of command, they are tested time after time. \nI trust these commanders. I trust them.\n  With the provisions in the McCaskill bill as we have today, we will \npreserve that command authority, but we will also have significant \nincreases in oversight and accountability. But to take away that \nresponsibility from the men and women who command these people, these \noutstanding men and women, and give to it a lawyer is not the way to \ngo.\n  I hope my colleagues understand it. I also would ask one other thing \nbefore this vote. If any of my colleagues knows a member of the \nmilitary whom they respect, call them. Call them and ask them whether \nthey would think this proposal of the Senator from New York is in any \nway helpful to the good functioning of the military and the elimination \nof sexual assaults. We share the same goal. There are vastly different \nways to achieve that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  (Mrs. GILLIBRAND assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Military \nJustice Improvement Act. I commend Senator Gillibrand for her \noutstanding work on this effort and all the survivors of sexual assault \nin the military who have courageously worked with us on this bill.\n  I also appreciate the bipartisan effort to stop military sexual \nassaults from happening. While we all do not agree on how to get there, \nI know that all of us want to stop this terrible scourge in our \nmilitary.\n  Every few years, when interest in this topic picks up, it stays \nrelevant for a while, the military leadership promises to stamp out \nsexual assault in the military, and says that zero tolerance is the \npolicy in place. Unfortunately, despite all of the good faith actions \ntaken by the department as well as Congress, we are still at 26,000 \nincidents of rape, sexual assault, and unwanted sexual contact in the \nmilitary.\n  This bill has nothing to do with telling commanders they are fired or \nthat they are morally bankrupt. They should continue to be held \naccountable for creating a command climate where sexual assaults do not \noccur or certainly not occur by the tens of thousands.\n  This bill is focused on the victims, the survivors of these crimes. \nWhen we listen to them, they are in support of the Gillibrand bill. We \nall agree that commanders are responsible for maintaining good order \nand discipline in their units. This includes creating an atmosphere of \ndignity and respect for everyone under their command.\n  Again, commanders must create an environment where sexual crimes do \nnot occur. Our proposed changes to the military justice system do not \nabsolve a commander of these responsibilities. It is still their job to \nprevent these crimes. It is still their job to maintain good order and \ndiscipline.\n  I have heard opponents of this legislation say that good order and \ndiscipline would be lost if the commander no longer has the court \nmartial disposition authority. I disagree. This is similar to saying, a \ncorporal, a sergeant or a junior officer in a unit would not act in a \nprofessional and orderly manner with respect to their O-6 commander, \nbecause the commander could no longer decide whether to proceed to \ntrial for a rape or other felony-level offense. That does not make \nsense. The commander is still responsible for dolling out punishment \nfor insubordination or other negative behavior. The commander is still \nresponsible for maintaining the kind of good order and discipline and a \ncommand climate where these crimes not occur in the first place. \nHistorically, when changes to the status quo are proposed--these \ninclude the integration of military units, opening military specialties \nto women, and allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly--a familiar \nrefrain from senior military leadership to block such changes was to \nclaim that the proposed changes would destroy good order and \ndiscipline.\n  By all accounts, I would say that these successful changes to \nmilitary policies do not destroy good order and discipline. When these \ncrimes do occur, survivors deserve the ability to seek justice. They \ndeserve a chain of command that will take their claims seriously and \ntake appropriate action. We have data that show that many victims do \nnot come forward because they do not trust that the chain of command \nwithin the current system will act impartially.\n  They feel that they might suffer retaliatory actions and ultimately \ndo not report the crime. This allows the perpetrator to go free and \ncommit additional crimes. The Gillibrand bill will increase trust and \nconfidence in the system and help the survivors seek justice. It is \ntime to make fundamental changes to how sexual assault cases are \nhandled in the military.\n  Senator Gillibrand's bill would be a big step in the right direction. \nHer amendment would take the decision to go forward with a trial out of \nthe chain of command and place it in the hands of an experienced \nmilitary lawyer. This change would improve the traditional process by \nincreasing transparency, by increasing trust. It would also eliminate \npotential bias and conflicts of interest because unlike the commanding \nofficer, the military lawyer would be unconnected to either the \nsurvivor or the accused.\n  I commend our colleagues once again, Senator Gillibrand and Senator \nMcCaskill, for their tireless efforts to help survivors of sexual \nassault in the military. I would also commend Senator Levin, my Armed \nServices Committee colleagues, and many other Senators for working so \nhard on this difficult, painful issue.\n  We have instituted many positive changes in this area, but I urge my \ncolleagues to take the next step and support the Gillibrand Military \nJustice Improvement Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I join my colleagues today in a \ndiscussion about an issue that I think we all would agree is an issue \nthat really tears at the heart, causes great anguish, as we think that \nthose who have volunteered to serve our great Nation, who have agreed \nto put themselves on the front lines, would be in a situation where \nthey would be made a victim--made a victim of military sexual assault \nand be put into a situation where\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nthey do not know where to turn, they do not know if it is safe to speak \nup, and they do not know how to respond.\n  Our military men and women, we are proud to say, are the most \nprofessional, the most highly trained and skilled and qualified. We \nwill match them against any. Yet, when we face these very troubling and \ndifficult issues of military sexual assault, it is an underside of the \nmilitary culture that we have not been able to sufficiently address and \neradicate.\n  The most recent report of the Defense Department Sexual Assault \nPrevention and Response Office, which covers 2012, speaks to the \nstatistics. These statistics have been reported so frequently on the \nfloor of the Senate. We know them. We share them. We really agonize \nover them. An estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact and \nsexual assault occurred in fiscal year 2012, a 37 percent increase from \nfiscal year 2011.\n  Some 25 percent of women and 27 percent of men who received unwanted \nsexual contact indicated that the offender was someone within their \nmilitary chain of command. Then, the statistics that really just go to \nthe heart of what we are talking about here today: Across the services, \n74 percent of females and 60 percent of males perceived one or more \nbarriers to reporting the sexual assault; 50 percent of male victims \nstated that they did not report the crime because they believed nothing \nwould be done.\n  They have been victimized once, and now they do not believe that \nanything will happen if they speak. They do not believe that anything \nwill be done with their report. Some 62 percent of victims who reported \na sexual assault indicated that they perceived some form of \nprofessional, social or administrative retaliation, retaliation from \nthe system that they have been trained to trust, to be there for one \nanother, and yet now fear retaliation.\n  This report was such an eye-opener for many of us. It certainly has \ngalvanized the issue to address where we are today, to truly put on the \nfront burner of this body, the issue of what has happened with military \nsexual assaults and what we can do to address it. It has remained on \nthe front burner, thanks to the persistent efforts of the Senator from \nNew York to keep it there. She has relentlessly pursued the vote that \nwe will take today.\n  Regardless of the outcome, I think that she should take pride, I \nthink we should all take pride in what we have collectively \naccomplished.\n  I also note the very fine work of my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nMcCaskill, and her efforts, along with Senator Ayotte, Senator Fischer, \nand the Presiding Officer, to bring this issue to a level where we have \nseen changes made already, but the question that remains is, is there \nmore that can be done.\n  This Congress has significantly improved the system through \namendments to the military justice system that were included in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. The services have also done their \npart to improve ways to improve their sexual assault and prevention \nprograms, such as making sure that a Naval Academy midshipman need not \nbe driven across the State of Maryland searching for a hospital that \nhas a sexual assault nurse examiner on duty.\n  In my State of Alaska, the headlines over the past year, as they \nrelated to military sexual assault within the ranks of our National \nGuard units, stunned us all. I recently received a further briefing \nfrom our adjutant general and folks within the Alaska National Guard in \nterms of what they too are doing to address, within their own system, \nthe changes that are absolutely necessary.\n  But the question is whether these changes will move the needle on \nthese statistics we have just recited. In my view, it remains to be \nseen. Will they give the victims more confidence in the system? Will \nthey deter offenders by increasing the certainty that there is going to \nbe accountability if these acts are taken?\n  Today the Senate considers the Military Justice Improvement Act, a \nmeasure that provides victims with the certainty they need to have \nconfidence in the system. If they don't believe the system is going to \nbe there for them, if they don't believe it is going to work for them, \nthey are not going to report it. They will not expose themselves again.\n  As I said on the Senate floor before, this is strong medicine. It is \nvery strong medicine to any offender who believes that the ``good old \nboys'' system will permit him to escape the consequence of his actions. \nIn my judgment, enactment of the Military Justice Improvement Act will \nlead to greater consistency in charging decisions. This, again, is a \nvery important aspect. It will ensure that those decisions are based on \nthe facts, the law, and not any external factor. That too offers an \nincrement of protection to victims as well as to the offenders.\n  The current system of military judgment relies upon the individual \ndecisions of commanders as to whether an offense is to be punished and \nwhich charges are to be brought. We recognize we have a complex \nmilitary and there are many commanders. While our code of military \njustice may be uniform, recent history suggests that its implementation \nis, unfortunately, anything but uniform.\n  Some have called the Gillibrand proposal a radical solution and one \nthat will make it impossible to maintain good order and discipline in \nthe military. I don't buy that. These were some of the statements that \nwere made several years back when we were considering don't ask, don't \ntell about 3 years ago.\n  The military is proving it is resilient enough to implement culture \nchange--and that is what this will take, is culture change. I believe \nthey are resilient enough to implement a change of this magnitude, and \nit will be resilient enough to implement the Military Justice \nImprovement Act.\n  It is not a radical and novel solution to a difficult problem. In \nfact, many of our allied modern militaries have moved the decision on \nwhether to prosecute sexual assault outside of the chain of command. \nThey have done it. I believe it is high time we do as well.\n  Again, I commend those who have led so nobly on this effort to make \nsure that when those fine men and women stand to serve our country, \nthere is ensured a level of justice, a level of uniformity of justice, \nand that we no longer see the devastating statistics we have, \nunfortunately, been faced with for far too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask that I be notified when 7 minutes remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified. The Senator has \n4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask to be notified when there is 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  All of the arguments we have heard today are technical arguments, \narguments about why we can't possibly do this. But the victims and the \nsurvivors of sexual assault have been walking this Congress for more \nthan 1 year, asking that we do something to protect them, to give them \na hope for justice.\n  It is not whether anyone in this Chamber trusts the chain of command. \nThe people who do not trust the chain of command are the victims. Even \nGeneral Amos has admitted that. He said the reason why a female marine \ndoes not come forward is because she does not trust the chain of \ncommand, that breach of trust. That fundamental breach of trust has \nbeen broken for victims of sexual assault.\n  Listen to the victims. Retired Marine LCpl Jeremiah Arbogast was \ndrugged. He was raped. He got his perpetrator to tell what happened on \ntape and went through trial. His perpetrator got no jail time. He saw \nno justice.\n  He said: ``I joined the Marines in order to serve my country as an \nhonorable man, instead I was thrown away like a piece of garbage.''\n  He attempted suicide, severed his spine, and now advocates for this \nmeasure from a wheelchair.\n  Those are the stories we are hearing from victims over and over.\n  Sarah Plummer, U.S. Marine Corps, said having someone within your \ndirect\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\nchain of command handling this case doesn't make sense and is like \n``getting raped by your brother and having your father decide the \ncase.''\n  That is the view and the perception of the survivors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I defer my remaining 2 minutes until after the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nSenator Ayotte.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator from Missouri, and I thank the \nSenator from New York for her passionate and important debate. Let's \nnot forget the work we have already done in the Defense authorization, \nensuring that every victim will have his or her own attorney to \nrepresent their interests, taking commanders out of overturning \nverdicts, and making retaliation a crime. So we have done very \nimportant work.\n  But why are we here today? The issue is will more cases be prosecuted \nif we take it out of the chain of command?\n  Actually, no. There would be 93 cases under the current situation \nthat wouldn't have been brought where commanders actually made a \ndifferent decision than their military lawyer. What about those victims \nand those victims having their day in court? I want more victims to \nhave their day in court.\n  As we think about it, why are we doing this? Some of our allies did \nit. We looked at that issue. Our allies haven't seen any greater \nreporting, so there is no evidence that we are going to have reporting. \nMany of them did it to protect defendants. We are here to protect \nvictims today. We certainly want a system with due process, but this is \nabout having more victims coming forward.\n  I also want to make sure people understand that under the system now \nthey do not have to report to their commander. We had people come to \nthe floor and say they shouldn't have to go to their boss. They can go \nto a sexual assault response coordinator, clergy, minister, civilian \nmedical personnel. Already they can come forward if they don't feel \ncomfortable coming forward to the commander.\n  No evidence has been presented that we are going to help victims more \nor that more cases will be prosecuted or more will come forward if we \ntake it out of the chain of command. That is why I want to hold \ncommanders more accountable, not less. That is what Senator McCaskill, \nSenator Fischer, and I do in our proposal. We want to make sure they \nare not let off the hook. We want to make sure the victims can get not \nonly justice but make sure they get swift justice. This proposal risks \ndelaying that justice in the system.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against Senator Gillibrand's proposal. I \nask my colleagues to say what will hold commanders more accountable. \nThat is our proposal. I ask them to say where is the evidence that more \nevidence will be pursued or more cases will come forward. There is no \nevidence. Our proposal is based on the evidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I will take a couple of moments at \nthe close of this very difficult debate to express my deep respect to \nthe Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand.\n  While many aspects of this debate have been hard, perhaps the hardest \npart of this debate has been that this disagreement on policy has \novershadowed the amazing work so many have done this year to enact a \ndifferent day in the U.S. military when it comes to sexual assault and \nvictims of sexual assault.\n  When the Sun sets today, this body will have passed 35 major reforms \nin less than 1 year, making the military the most friendly victims \norganization in the world, giving victims more power, more leverage, \nholding commanders accountable, and holding perpetrators accountable. \nIt will eliminate the ridiculous notion that how well one flies a plane \nshould have anything to do with whether they committed a crime, \nprofessionalizing the process so that victims no longer endure a \nridiculous amount of inappropriate questioning at what should be \nsomething like a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause, as \nopposed to some kind of rendering of questioning, torture to a victim \nwho has come out of the shadows and is willing to go forward.\n  I know I can speak with confidence for Senator Gillibrand that she \nand I have walked lockstep on those 35 reforms. We have disagreed on \none. I know in the future she and I will work very hard together to \nmake sure our military does the right thing by victims and puts \nperpetrators where they belong--in prison--and out of the ranks of the \nmilitary where they stain the good name of the bravest men and women in \nthe world.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their patience during this debate. I \nknow this has been tough for everyone. But I stand with years of \nexperience, holding the hands and crying with victims, with many \nvictims, who have spoken to me and other organizations, knowing that \nwhat we have done is right for victims and right to hold perpetrators \naccountable.\n  I respectfully request that people support our amendment today and \nreject the one area of policy on which the great Senator from New York \nand I disagree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I want the focus where it needs to be. This is not \nan opportunity to congratulate ourselves on the great reforms we have \ndone. All of the reforms we have passed today are meaningful and \nuseful, but this problem isn't even close to being solved. Under the \nbest-case scenario, 2 out of 10 case are being reported today.\n  Let's refocus on what is actually happening in our military today. \nLet's focus on what U.S. Air Force veteran Amn Jessica Hinves said:\n\n       Two days before the court hearing, his commander called me \n     on a conference at the JAG office, and he said he didn't \n     believe that he acted like a gentleman, but there wasn't a \n     reason to prosecute.\n\n  She was speechless. She had been promised a court hearing, and she \nwas told 2 days before the commander had stopped it.\n  Trina McDonald, U.S. Navy veteran, said:\n\n       At one point my attackers threw me in the Bering Sea and \n     left me for dead in the hopes that they silenced me forever. \n     They made it very clear that they would kill me if I ever \n     spoke up or reported what they had done.\n\n  She did not report these attacks.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The people that were involved in my assaults were police \n     personnel, security personnel, higher-ranking officers, the \n     people that I would have to go and report.\n\n  Last but not least is Lt. Ariana Klay, U.S. Marine Corps. Her home \nwas broken into by two colleagues and she was raped brutally. She \nultimately reported the crime and attempted suicide. Her perpetrator \nwas convicted--and convicted of what? Not breaking and entering, not \nrape--calling her a slut.\n  The thing that makes me most angry is not even the rape itself; it's \nthe commanders that were complicit in covering up everything that \nhappened.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1752, a bill to \n     reform procedures for determinations to proceed to trial by \n     court-martial for certain offenses under the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Kirsten E.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1821\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, nearly 4 months ago the most powerful \nstorm on record struck the Philippines, killing 6,000 people and \ninjuring 27,000 people. According to USAID, more than 4 million people \nwere displaced, and one out of six people in the country was affected. \nPhotographs show the immense destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan. In \nsome areas nearly all of the buildings were destroyed.\n  Today, because of the magnitude of the devastation, the Philippines \nhas not yet recovered. It will take them a long time. Relief efforts \ncontinue. These efforts have been aided by direct assistance from the \nU.S. Government to the Philippines, one of our closest allies in Asia. \nRelief efforts have also been funded by charitable donations made by \nindividuals in the United States. Many of these donations come from \nFilipino Americans in this country, part of the extensive diaspora here \nthat is the foundation of the deep connections between the Philippines \nand the United States.\n  I am about to ask unanimous consent to pass legislation that will \nencourage people to continue donating to typhoon relief efforts in the \nPhilippines. It has been 4 months since Typhoon Haiyan but help is \nstill desperately needed. Four months is a virtual eternity of news \ncycles, and other crises in other parts of the world demand our \nattention. But we should not forget the immense human suffering caused \nby Typhoon Haiyan.\n  This legislation, S. 1821, would allow people who make donations \nafter the date of enactment to deduct those donations from last year's \ntaxes. In other words, they can reduce their 2013 tax bill by \ncontributing now. It is a modest step, but it is one we should take.\n  This is bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Heller. This \nlegislation is also cosponsored by Senator Menendez and the majority \nleader, Senator Reid. I thank them for their support.\n  Identical bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representatives Swalwell and Thompson. That bill has \n35 cosponsors, including 9 Republicans: Representatives Calvert, \nFranks, Grimm, Heck, Issa, Miller, Royce, Valadao, and Young. I thank \nthem for their support.\n  After the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Congress passed nearly \nidentical legislation to encourage donations to that country. That \nlegislation passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. The Senate \ncompanion bill, S. 2936, had 40 cosponsors, 15 of whom were \nRepublicans. They included Senators Alexander, Cornyn, Enzi, Grassley, \nHatch, Johanns, Roberts, and Thune. I hope the Senate will provide the \nsame support to the Philippines that it provided to Haiti.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 1821; that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; that the Hirono-Heller \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; further, that upon passage, \nthe bill be held at the desk, and that if the Senate receives from the \nHouse a bill, the text of which is identical to S. 1821, as passed by \nthe Senate, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill \nbe read three times and passed, without any intervening action or \ndebate; finally, that passage of the Senate bill be vitiated and the \nbill be indefinitely postponed, and all motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, first, \nI commend the Senator from Hawaii for her work and her concern over the \nPhilippines. That country has suffered dramatically from this typhoon. \nHaving lived on the gulf coast and walked in the places where 18 feet \nof water from Hurricane Katrina flooded us, washed away whole \nstructures, I can imagine what it was like to have lost 6,000 lives. \nAnd the country is hurting. It is a great country with great people. \nThey are excellent allies of the United States. I am very sympathetic \nto their needs and appreciative of the Senator's efforts in seeking \nthis way to further contributions for their relief.\n  The legislation has an emergency declaration in it. That requires \ngoing through the Budget Committee and requires other findings that I \nam not sure are available here. I think the legislation could be \nperhaps drafted slightly differently, I say to the Senator, that would \navoid the emergency designation part, and maybe we could reach an \naccord to get this done quickly, as I know the Senator wants to move on \nit as soon as possible.\n  So, Madam President, I at this time say I will object. But our staffs \nwill immediately begin to discuss if we can put this in a little \nslightly different way that would accomplish the Senator's goals \nwithout offending some of the budget niceties. Being the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee, I feel very, very strongly that \nwhen we make agreements about how we are going to spend money and how \nit should be processed, the more we erode those agreements and the more \nwe spend above the amount of money we agreed to spend or get around the \nspending limits we ourselves passed into law, the more we place at risk \nthe financial future of the country.\n  This is not the most costly measure. It is a step that would help the \npeople in the Philippines, I know. But with that explanation, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I thank Senator Sessions very much for \nhis agreement regarding the concerns we have for our friends in the \nPhilippines, and I look forward to working\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nwith the Senator to come up with a measure that will accomplish what my \nbill seeks to accomplish.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator, and I respect so \nmuch her effort in this cause and will do what we can to be \ncooperative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I have come to visit with you today \nand the Members of this body with some concerns I have about people who \nare being impacted by the health care law. By ``impacted'' I mean hurt. \nTheir lives are being hurt as a result of the impact of the health care \nlaw. We are seeing it around the country. As people are trying to \ncomply with the law, we are finding that many people are losing their \njobs or part of their jobs if they are working part time--to be held \nunder 30 hours a week because under that criteria, people working less \nthan 30 hours a week do not have to be provided with health insurance.\n  We have seen stories around the country of municipalities, of public \nemployees who are having their hours cut and as a result, obviously, \ntheir take-home pay is cut, their wages are cut as a result of the \nimpact of the health care law, as communities try to comply with all \nthe aspects of the law. We have seen it with police forces, with \nteachers, with coaches, busdrivers, custodians, cafeteria workers, \noffice clerks, sanitation workers, emergency personnel, university \nfaculty--people all around the country who are being hurt as a result \nof the law.\n  Members of the Senate come from my side of the aisle to read letters \nof folks who have been harmed by the health care law. The majority \nleader comes to the floor and says these stories are lies. These are \nstories from people at home to whom I talk on weekends. I will be this \nweekend in Buffalo, WY, at the health fair, having a chance to visit \nwith folks who are from Wyoming who go to a health fair for low-cost \nblood screening; also go to visit booths that are there from the heart \nassociation, the cancer society, the diabetes association, all taking \nefforts to try to improve the quality of their life, the quality of \ntheir care, and the quality of their overall health.\n  It is interesting to hear from these people, because I do not think \nthe President hears from them. When I hear the majority leader say the \npeople who come to the floor to talk about them--that these stories are \nlies, it is calling the people of Wyoming who have honest concerns \nabout the way their lives are being impacted by the health care law as \nbeing untruthful.\n  I have come to the floor with more letters today and to talk about \nsome things. It does make me wonder, when the majority leader comes and \nsays these things are not truthful if he is not hearing the stories \nfrom the police officers and the teachers, the coaches and the bus \ndrivers, the custodians, the cafeteria workers, the office clerks, the \nsanitation workers, the emergency personnel, the university faculty in \nStates all around the country who have their lives impacted by the \nhealth care law.\n  What I do think is that other Senators, Senators who perhaps go home \nmore often than the majority leader, Senators who maybe listen to their \nconstituents more and read the letters, are seeing the damage that is \nbeing done by the health care law because the President is responding \nto their claims, their concerns, and to the point that the President \nhimself has unilaterally delayed many components of the health care \nlaw.\n  These are the delays from 2013. Here is the calendar for the year. \nAll of the X's are different days when there have been different \ndelays. There have been dozens of delays as a result of the health care \nlaw impact on families across the country. I wish to read a couple of \nemails about the impact on lives of people in Wyoming.\n  This is from a gentleman from Casper, my hometown. I was there \nMonday. I will be there again tomorrow.\n  He writes:\n\n       My wife and I just received our new monthly premium \n     information for our health insurance. As of March 1, 2014 it \n     will go from $505 a month to $1,045 a month, an increase of \n     over double. This is for a Bronze level plan with a high \n     deductible and high out of pocket.\n\n  You know, I wish the President would actually kind of understand what \nthe impact of this law has been on American families. I wish people who \nsupported it, campaigned for it, would realize the impact on people's \nlives. He has gotten his premiums going from $505 to over $1,000, \ndouble increase, Bronze level plan, what the President wants people to \nhave. It is the minimum level. It has a high deductible and a high out-\nof-pocket.\n  He said:\n\n       It is also the cheapest plan I have found so far for us \n     that is available in Wyoming and complies with the ACA.\n\n  Because the law says this man needs a lot of insurance. Maybe he does \nnot need it. The President does not know this man, does not know his \nlife, does not know his history, does not know what he actually needs \nin terms of insurance. But the President claims and the Democrats who \nvoted for this health care law believe they know better than this man \nwhat he needs.\n  But you know what we do find out, when he wants to comply with the \nlaw, his insurance premiums more than double, for the cheapest plan \nwhich has the highest deductible and the highest out-of-pocket.\n  He says:\n\n       This increase will mean that money we would probably have \n     spent elsewhere will now need to be budgeted for the \n     insurance increase.\n\n  We go across the State to Moran, WY. Another resident of Wyoming \nwrites:\n\n       I am a resident of Wyoming and about half of my income \n     comes from Social Security. My benefits total $958 a month. \n     In addition to that, I work part time at a ranch. It is a \n     seasonal job from May to October. I make about the same \n     amount there as I do from Social Security. I have recently \n     managed to submit an application for health care through the \n     healthcare.gov Web site. The cost to me with my current \n     income would be a low end of $837 a month with a $4,000 \n     deductible. With the high end, it would be over $1,300 a \n     month with a $1,000 deductible.\n       Neither of those amounts are possible with my income range. \n     I would not be able to afford to live. Now I refigured this \n     with only my Social Security income and found that it would \n     be very affordable, lower deductible, lower premiums, but I \n     wouldn't have the income. I could possibly afford that but \n     would have to live in a very substandard poverty lifestyle by \n     quitting working.\n\n  So he has these options: He can continue what he does, but he cannot \nafford the insurance, or he can get affordable insurance by quitting \nworking but then cannot afford to live. This is what the President of \nthe United States and the Democrats have given the people of America.\n  He said:\n\n       I would like to work and contribute as long as I'm able but \n     things are looking pretty bleak for me.\n\n  This is a man who wants to work. This is a man who wants to work, but \nthe health care law is making it a lot harder for him to do so. He \nsaid:\n\n       I am giving you this information in the hope that it will \n     be of some value in combating the unfairness of the \n     Affordable Care Act.\n\n  The unfairness of the Affordable Care Act. I have to believe that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who actually go home and listen to \ntheir constituents hear about this, hear these stories, hear these \nstories all around the country, of the unfairness of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  He then goes on and says:\n\n       Thank you so much for your service to your country and the \n     great State of Wyoming.\n\n  So here we have dozens of delays--and this is last year. Now it has \nhappened again. Just yesterday the President came up with another \ndelay. It is interesting the way it has made the front page of the New \nYork Times, a paper that has supported the President, supported the \nlaw, front page, above the fold, story by Robert Pear.\n\n       The Obama administration, grappling with continued \n     political fallout over its health care law, said Wednesday \n     that it would allow consumers to renew health insurance \n     policies that did not comply with the new law for two more \n     years--\n\n  This is the New York Times speaking, front page, above the fold. This \nis not me. But they are repeating the kind of things I have been \nsaying.\n\n     pushing the issue well beyond this fall's midterm elections.\n\n  So what is the idea here? Push it out beyond the elections, make \npeople not see the reality and the danger and the damage that is coming \ntheir way until after they vote.\n  The article goes on, front page above the fold, today's New York \nTimes:\n\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\n\n       The reprieve was the latest in a series of waivers, \n     deadline extensions and unilateral actions by the \n     administration--\n\n  Here you have them. This is just in 2013. Now we have more in 2014.\n\n     --unilateral actions by the administration that have drawn \n     criticism from the law's opponents and supporters, many \n     saying President Obama was testing the limits of his powers.\n\n  I believe that. I believe the President has gone way beyond the \nlimits of his powers.\n\n       The action reflects the difficulties Mr. Obama--\n\n  The President of the United States, who told the American people, if \nthey like what they have they can keep it; if they like their doctor, \nthey can keep their doctor; who said insurance premiums would go down--\nall of which are untrue, one called the ``lie of the year.''\n\n       The action reflects the difficulties Mr. Obama has faced in \n     trying to build support for the Affordable Care Act and the \n     uproar over his promise--which he later acknowledged has been \n     overstated--that people who liked their insurance plans could \n     keep them, no matter what.\n\n  Over 5 million Americans got letters of cancellation, 3,500 in the \nState of Wyoming. A woman with a wonderful policy that worked for her, \nworked for her family, lost her insurance because it did not cover \nmaternity care. She writes to me as a doctor and says:\n\n       Dr. Barrasso, please explain to the President of the United \n     States that I have had a hysterectomy. I don't need maternity \n     coverage.\n\n  You would think the President would understand that. You would think \nthe Democrats who shoved this health care law down the throats of the \nAmerican people would understand that as well.\n  This is interesting. Still on the front page of this morning's New \nYork Times:\n\n       Under pressure from Democratic candidates who are \n     struggling to defend the President's signature domestic \n     policy, Mr. Obama in November announced a one-year reprieve \n     for insurance plans that did not meet the minimum coverage \n     requirements of the 2010 health care law.\n       Wednesday's action goes much further, essentially stalling \n     for two more years one of the central tenets of the much-\n     debated law, which was supposed to eliminate what White House \n     officials called substandard insurance and junk policies.\n\n  If this is what the President believes, why is he now coming out and \nhaving a delay announced--not coming to Congress, not saying: Hey, \nlet's try to do something a little differently. Let me propose this. \nLet's have a bipartisan agreement to come up with some solutions to \nactually help people get what they wanted in the beginning with health \ncare reform, the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower \ncosts.\n  The letters I am reading show people not being able to do that. They \nare paying much higher rates for things they do not need, will never \nuse. We are hearing from people all across the country who are losing \ntheir doctor, can't keep their doctor, higher out-of-pocket costs.\n  We hear now the President wants to do some things unilaterally \nbecause a group of Democratic Senators who are up for reelection are \nworried about their political future, not about the future of the \nAmerican people and the health care of the American people. That is why \nthey are doing this.\n\n  You say: No, that seems like an exaggeration.\n  Well, let's go on. This next paragraph in the New York Times this \nmorning:\n\n       The extension could help Democrats in tight midterm \n     election races because it may avoid the cancellation of \n     policies that would otherwise have occurred at the height of \n     the political campaign season this fall.\n\n  So the cancellations are still going to happen, people are still \ngoing to continue to be hurt. We have over 5 million people who have \ngotten letters of cancellation. It is not saying: Oh, the cancellations \nare never going to happen. It is saying: It will push them out until \nafter the election, so people will not be so irritated, angry, and \naggravated at the Democrats who voted for it, in an effort to try to \nsave their elections, try to save their Senate seats, but not to help \nthe American people.\n  This goes on:\n\n       In announcing the new transition policy, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services said it had been devised ``in close \n     consultation with members of Congress,'' and it gave credit \n     to a number of Democrats in competitive races, including \n     Senators Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Jeanne Shaheen of New \n     Hampshire and Mark Udall of Colorado.\n\n  So the reason that the White House goes time after time, all these \ndelays, all this and that, is not to help the American people; it is \nnot to help patients; it is not to help the providers of health care; \nit is not to help the taxpayers; it is to help a couple of Democratic \nSenators whom they name--whom the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices names as recipients of the help because the President is \nworried about Democrats losing elections this fall.\n  The Hill newspaper yesterday. ``New ObamaCare delay to help midterm \nDems.'' Not to help Americans, not to help the people from my State who \nwrite letters about the concerns of their lives, not to help all of \nthose people about whom my colleagues and I continue to come to the \nfloor with letters to tell their stories, to tell about their lives, to \ntell about the pain they are suffering because of the health care law.\n  It is not about the failed Web site. We all know the Web site. The \nPresident said: It will be as easy to use as Amazon, cheaper than your \ncell phone bill. You will be able to keep your doctor--several days \nbefore the Web site opened and crashed. No, it is more than about the \nWeb site. It is about people's lives. It is about if they are able to \nkeep their doctor. It is about cuts to Medicare Advantage and hurting \nour seniors who are having a harder time getting doctors. It is about \npeople paying higher premiums. It is about people having higher out-of-\npocket costs, higher copays, higher deductibles. It is all of those \nthings.\n  It is about hospitals in States that are not part of any of these \nexchanges, people in the communities cannot go there, they have to \ntravel further distances. Nope, the President is not doing this for any \nof those reasons, not to help any of those people, he is doing it to \nhelp midterm Democrats because they are afraid they are going to lose \ntheir States, their majority, afraid they are going to be impacted and \nthrown out of office for absolutely reckless behavior on the part of a \nCongress that did not work in a bipartisan way, shoved the health care \nlaw down the throats of the American people in a way not to improve \ntheir lives, but to say that Congress knows better than people back \nhome.\n  I am going to continue to come to the floor with letters and stories. \nI will be at the health fair in Buffalo, WY, on Saturday morning \ntalking to folks in my community, seeing what they have to say about \ntheir lives, their families, their jobs, their wages, those of them who \nare losing jobs or losing hours as a result of the health care law, \nthose who cannot afford new insurance under the exchanges even though \nthey had insurance they liked--even though they did not like the price, \nit was cheaper than it is now. The President said it wasn't good enough \nfor them.\n\n  I am going to continue to work for solutions to help patients all \nacross this country have patient-centered care--not government-centered \ncare or insurance company-centered care--to help patients get the care \nthey need from a doctor they chose at lower cost--a complete failure by \nthis administration and by this health care law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we now are in about the sixth month of the \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act. We have over 11 million \npeople who have received health care--who previously had not been able \nto receive it--either through the private exchanges, which have signed \nup 4 million people all across the country; through the expansion of \nMedicaid, which has reached millions more; or through all of the young \npeople who are able to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26 \nyears old.\n  Taxpayers are saving money. In fact, CBO has redone their estimates \nfor the 10-year period after the passage of the Affordable Care Act to \nsuggest that we are now going to save $1.2 trillion on Federal health \ncare spending, in large part because of the reforms in the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Across this country millions of Americans who had been kept out of \nthe ranks of the insured because of a preexisting condition now have \naccess to health care, and tens of millions of seniors are paying less \nfor their health care because they get checkups for free and they are \nable to access prescription drugs for 50 percent or less than the \noriginal cost when they reach that doughnut hole. So the Affordable \nCare Act is changing lives.\n  When you reorder one-sixth of the American economy, there are going \nto be bumps along the road. No one should come to the floor--even those \nof us who are the most vocal proponents of the law--and suggest there \nare not going to be some people who are not going to have the perfect \nexperience. Of course there is no excuse for the way in which the Web \nsite operated for the first several months. But it is time for \nproponents of this law to tell the real story, and the real story is \nthat the Affordable Care Act is working. It is working for millions of \nAmericans who now have access to health care. It is working for \ntaxpayers who are spending less than ever before as you look at annual \nrates of growth in Federal health care spending.\n  Today and this week my colleagues and I are focusing on the benefits \nfor one specific group of patients, one specific set of families all \nacross this country, and those are patients and families dealing with \ncancer diagnoses.\n  So I will start this off--I will be joined later by Senator Stabenow \nand some of my other colleagues--and I want to talk first about a \nfamily in Indiana. I will talk about some families in Connecticut as \nwell, but the Treinens have a story that is, frankly, not unique. They \nhad insurance and they thought they had really good insurance. They \ndidn't pay too much attention to the lifetime cap of $1 million that \nwas in their insurance policy because they just figured, as a \nrelatively healthy family, there was no way they were ever going to \nspend $1 million on health care over the course of their time on that \ninsurance plan.\n  But as millions of families across this country know, cancer can \ninterrupt your plans, and that is what happened to the Treinens. Their \ndoctors diagnosed their teenage son Michael in 2007 with an aggressive \nform of leukemia. The treatment called for ten doses of chemotherapy \nthat cost $10,000 per dose. A 56-day stay in an Intensive Care Unit \nalone cost about $400,000. So Michael and his family reached that $1 \nmillion lifetime maximum in less than 1 year, and it was then left to \nthis brave family to go out and raise money in solicitations in their \nneighborhood, in their community and all across the country, which \nmiraculously allowed them to bring in $865,000 in 6 days to keep their \nson's treatment going.\n  Needless to say, that avenue is not available to every family. But \ndue to their ingenuity and their passion, the Treinens were able to \nraise almost $1 million from private donors in order to keep their \nson's treatment going. But the story doesn't end well, however, for the \nTreinens. Even though money came in from all over the United States, \nand as far away as places such as Germany, Michael's cancer eventually \nstopped responding to chemotherapy and he died May 25, before he could \nreceive the transplant they all hoped would save his life.\n  The reality is that insurance companies have been getting away with \nthis practice for years--lifetime or annual limits that for 105 million \nAmericans were preventing them from receiving care when they really got \nsick. That is what insurance really is supposed to be for. For those of \nus who buy insurance, we get it in the hopes that should we get very \nsick, that insurance plan will be there to help us. But with annual and \nlifetime limits, when people got really sick, especially with cancer \ndiagnoses, that help wasn't there.\n  Tom Bocaccio, who is a retired police officer in Newington, CT, is \nstill dealing with the consequences of lifetime caps. His wife past \naway after an 8-year struggle with adrenal cancer. After her death, the \nhusband she left behind was saddled with a $1.5 million bill because \nthe Bocaccios, over that 8-year period of fighting cancer, had exceeded \ntheir lifetime cap. That changes Tom's life in a myriad of ways. He has \nlost his wife, and there is no way to describe the pain that comes with \nthat, especially after that brave, courageous battle of almost a \ndecade, but now his entire life is upended by the fact that he has a \n$1.5 million bill he has to pay, and he doesn't have the resources to \ndo that.\n  So first and foremost, for cancer patients all across this country, \n105 million Americans no longer face lifetime limits on health care \nbenefits. For cancer patients, not only does that deliver financial \nsecurity, but it delivers mental and psychological security as well--to \nknow in the midst of dealing with this diagnosis and all the pain that \ncomes with confronting this disease head on, they do not also have to \nworry about skimping on treatments, about cutting back on hospital \nstays that might harm the recovery or treatment of the patient simply \nbecause they are trying not to get above that annual or lifetime limit.\n  The benefits to cancer patients extend beyond just that protection on \nlifetime and annual limits. In addition, cancer patients are going to \nbe able to keep their health care because of the ban on discrimination \nagainst families and individuals with preexisting conditions.\n  I have spoken about the Berger family many times on this floor. They \nare a family that explains exactly why we need this protection. The \nBergers, from Meriden, CT, had a son who was diagnosed with cancer \nduring the 2-week period in which the husband, through which the family \nhad insurance, didn't have a job. He switched jobs, and during that 2-\nweek period in which he was waiting to get insurance through his new \njob, their son was diagnosed with cancer. The new insurance policy \ndecided it was a preexisting condition. The Bergers had to pay every \ndime of that treatment and they lost everything. They lost their \nsavings, their home. Their lives were transformed because of the \nmisfortune of having a cancer diagnosis at the wrong time.\n\n  No family anywhere in the country dealing with a cancer diagnosis \nwill ever have to go through what the Bergers went through because here \never after the law of this land says that if you have a preexisting \ncondition, you cannot be discriminated against.\n  There are all sorts of other benefits that matter, whether it be the \nfact you don't have to pay for preventive health care any longer so you \ncan get a checkup without cost or clinical trials are now covered which \nmany cancer patients enjoy the benefit of. Life changed for cancer \npatients and families dealing with cancer when the Affordable Care Act \npassed.\n  Senator Stabenow, myself, and others had a press conference earlier \nthis week in which we heard the story of David Weis, a senior at \nGeorgetown University who was diagnosed days before his 19th birthday \nwith thyroid lymphatic cancer. David talks about the difference the \nAffordable Care Act makes for him, not only in financial terms but in \nterms of how he thinks about his future. David now can go out and get a \njob, search for and pursue a career based on what he wants to do with \nhis life rather than based on what job will provide him with adequate \nbenefits to treat his cancer should it reoccur.\n  I have a constituent who talks about it the same way. He was 14 when \nhe was diagnosed with a form of leukemia. He went through treatment for \nover 3 years. His family now knows that with the Affordable Care Act--\nbecause he is only covered on his mom's policy until he is 26--after he \nages out of his mom's plan, he will be able to pursue his dreams no \nmatter what kind of insurance plan his prospective employer has.\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\n  What we have learned over the years is there is a connection between \nthe mind and the body. If you are stressed out about things such as how \nyou are going to pay for treatment of your disease, it does have an \neffect on your body's ability to fight that disease. Unfortunately, for \nmillions of families dealing with cancer, their treatment has been \nrestrained, their body's recovery has been curtailed because they are \nobsessively--and appropriately--always worried about what will happen \nif their insurance runs out.\n  The ACA says never again. No family will have to worry because that \nwill be guaranteed, and discriminatory policies of annual and lifetime \nlimits disappear.\n  I will end with the notion that it is important to remember every \ntime our Republican friends come down to the floor and talk about how \nawful they believe the Affordable Care Act is, their proposal is to \nreturn cancer patients and families dealing with cancer back to the \nreality in which they had lifetime limits which ended their coverage--\nfor this family I talked about from Indiana, after only several \nmonths--and they want to go back to the days in which families such as \nthe Bergers lose everything, their savings, their home, because of a \nmistimed cancer diagnosis.\n  This week the House of Representatives voted for the 50th time to \nrepeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act. I was a Member of that \nbody for 6 years, and I probably participated in about 40 of those \nvotes. Despite the fact I heard lots of my Republican friends come down \nto the floor and say: We are voting to repeal and replace, they never \nvoted once to replace the Affordable Care Act because their agenda is \nnot to replace it. Their agenda is simply to repeal it and go back to \nthe days in which cancer patients were treated with this kind of \ncarelessness.\n  Our colleagues on the Democratic side who voted for the Affordable \nCare Act understand there are places where it can be better. We \nunderstand there is a process of perfecting it. But we understand--\nbecause of families such as the Barrows, because of families such as \nthe Weises, the Treinens, and the Bergers--for cancer patients and the \nfamilies who love them, they know the ACA is working, and they know \nthey never want to go back to the days in which their lives were put in \njeopardy by a health care system which didn't work for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut for his passion and his wonderful advocacy for people who \njust want to know they have health care for themselves and their \nfamilies, which is pretty basic. I thank Senator Murphy for his \nvigilance, for speaking out and being here and talking about what is at \nstake.\n  There is an ad on TV which says something like: New car, $30,000; new \nhouse, $150,000; peace of mind, priceless. What we are talking about in \nterms of access to affordable health care, getting what you are paying \nfor, knowing you can't get dropped just because you get sick, knowing \nyour child with juvenile diabetes can get care even though it would be \nviewed as a preexisting condition, is peace of mind.\n  I can't imagine how scary it must be to sit in a doctor's office and \nhave a doctor come in and say: You have cancer. You have leukemia. You \nhave breast cancer. This is happening to people every single day, and \nthere are many thoughts going through their minds at that time. At some \npoint they will turn to the doctor and want to talk about: What kind of \ntreatment do I need? Is it going to be covered? How do I get it? What \nis going to happen?\n  One in every eight women in America will develop invasive breast \ncancer during their lives. It is not a statistic. These are real women, \nsuch as my sister-in-law, such as many other people I know. They are \nour daughters, our sisters, our mothers. Men as well are being given \ndiagnoses of breast cancer--our friends. They now have the peace of \nmind of knowing they are going to be able to get the care they need at \nan affordable price and they can't be dropped. There is no cap on how \nlong they are going to be able to get treatment, and that is priceless.\n  I will share a true story about a cancer survivor whose life has been \nchanged thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Her name is Chris G.\n  Chris found a lump in her breast. Every woman can imagine the \nthoughts which must have gone through Chris's mind. The fear must have \nbeen unimaginable. It was even worse for Chris because her husband lost \nhis job and they didn't have insurance--the worst of all possible \nsituations. Because she didn't have insurance, she couldn't see a \ndoctor to get the tests she needed. Chris didn't ignore her lump. You \ncan't ignore something like that. It is on your mind every single \nminute of every single day. But at that moment she didn't feel she \ncould do anything about it because without insurance, if Chris went to \na doctor, her breast cancer of course would count as a preexisting \ncondition and then she would never be able to get insurance.\n  But now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Chris and millions of \nwomen like her can get the affordable insurance they need, and \nmarketplaces where insurance companies now have to compete for her \nbusiness give their best price for her business. These are good \npolicies which cover treatment women need to beat cancer and survive. \nBut before the Affordable Care Act, cancer would haunt these women for \nthe rest of their lives as insurance companies labeled their survival a \npreexisting condition--no more.\n  Thanks to the ACA, millions of cancer survivors similar to Chris have \npeace of mind--priceless. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions \nof women have access to mammograms and other preventive services. \nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of women similar to Chris \nwill never have to worry about annual or lifetime limits on their \ncoverage, not being told: OK, cancer. You have eight visits. That is \nit. I hope it works. That is it. No more.\n  In fact, the ACA flips that around. It says cancer patients such as \nChris will never be asked to spend more than a set amount of money in \ntotal on their treatment. Once they hit that number, the insurance \ncompany has to pick up the rest of the cost of the treatments. For \nwomen fighting cancer, this law is a lifesaver.\n  There are 7,000 women in my State of Michigan alone who will be newly \ndiagnosed with breast cancer this year. This is why it is so important \nfor women to get covered, to sign up before March 31, so they can have \nthe health care they need this year. This is literally a lifesaving day \non March 31.\n  Once you are covered, you get no-cost preventive services. So you can \ngo in, get the checkup, get the mammogram, get other cancer screenings, \nand not have out-of-pocket costs. You get again the peace of mind of \nknowing you are not going to go broke because of health care. Even if \nyou get diagnosed with cancer, it is not: Do I get the treatments I \nneed for breast cancer or do I have a home for my family? Do I go \nbankrupt or do I try to survive through treatments? Those are not the \nchoices available to women and families anymore, and there is access to \nyour doctor instead of using the emergency room.\n  One of the fallacies of health care reform is this idea of somehow we \nignore when people get sick and somehow we don't pay for it. Yet we all \nknow people who don't have insurance use emergency rooms. I think it is \ninteresting to note there is a proposal, in Georgia, where the Governor \nhas said: The way to fix the problem with emergency rooms is to say you \ndon't have to treat people. That is one way to do it, to say we are not \ngoing to treat people who are sick, who are in a car accident or have a \nheart attack.\n  The other way is through the Affordable Care Act, where we say: \nInstead of people using emergency rooms without insurance and then \nshifting all the costs onto everybody with insurance--which is what \nhappens now--we pay for it. We all pay for it. Instead of that \nhappening, we will set up a way for people to take personal \nresponsibility for their health care and create a way to make it as \naffordable and competitive as possible. Then people will be able to go \nto their doctor instead of the emergency room and be able to get the \ntreatment they need on an ongoing basis.\n  As women such as Chris can attest, cancer sneaks up on you. You can't \npredict it. You can't avoid it. This is not one of those events where \nyou can\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nsay just buck it up and don't get cancer. We don't want those costs, so \njust don't get sick.\n  We all know how ridiculous that is. Yet in some ways this is sort of \nwhat we keep hearing in some fashion.\n  The reality is you can't predict it. You can't avoid it. The only \nthing you can do is survive it, which millions of women are now doing \nwho have access to the treatments and health care they need. This is \nwhy this new health care reform law is so important.\n  It is two things. It is health insurance reform, making sure those of \nus who have insurance are getting what we are paying for--as we have \nsaid before, can't get dropped, don't put artificial limits on the \nnumber of treatments. So it is insurance reform, so you are getting \nwhat you are paying for--what you thought you were paying for. It is \nalso creating a way for more affordable insurance by creating a \nmarketplace where insurance companies then have to bid for your \nbusiness and provide you the best bed possible. We have competition to \nbring the costs down. I know for Chris, I know for women in my own \nfamily, and I know for people across Michigan, the peace of mind that \ncomes with that is, in fact, priceless.\n\n  The debate on the other side is about taking that all away--not \nmaking it better, not fixing it. Medicare over the year has been \nimproved. Medicaid has been improved. Social Security has been \nimproved. Everything that is worth doing gets started and then has to \nbe worked on to get improved. We are committed to doing that. But there \nare 50 votes now happening in the House to take it all away and to go \nback to saying good luck. If you are a woman, good luck. By the way, \nbeing a woman is probably viewed as being a preexisting condition. \nTrying to find insurance? Good luck. Good luck trying to get what you \nneed from the insurance companies. Peace of mind is worth fighting for, \nand that is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                   Savannah Harbor Expansion Project\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss promises made \nand promises broken, of hypocrisy and politics, of the difference \nbetween the photo op speeches, press releases, and real action.\n  Let me start at the beginning, for those who are just joining us in \nthis decade-and-a-half battle. The Panama Canal is about halfway \nthrough a $5.25 billion expansion which will accommodate the larger \npost-Panamax vessels that are too large to transit the current Panama \nCanal. These new post-Panamax ships are the length of aircraft \ncarriers. From the waterline they are 190 feet tall, or nearly twice \nthe height of the Lincoln Memorial. The ships can carry as many as \n12,000 containers, or translated into TVs, a million flat screen TVs.\n  Thus, the United States must be prepared to accept these larger \nvessels by 2015, when the Panama Canal expansion is complete. The Port \nof Savannah in Savannah, Georgia, is the second busiest U.S. container \nexporter, handling 13.2 million tons in exports in 2012 alone. It is \nthe busiest port on the East Coast. In order to accommodate the new \nlarger ships at the Port of Savannah, the Savannah river must be \ndeepened from its current depth of 42 feet to 47 feet.\n  Georgia has been working on the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for \nwell in excess of a dozen years. Environmental studies have been \ncompleted, permits have been issued, and state funding has been secured \nfor 40 percent of the project. It has the support of every Member of \nthe Georgia congressional delegation and every single leader in our \nState, Republican as well as Democrat. This is a unifying bipartisan \nproject for us, one that will support hundreds of thousands of jobs \neach year while generating billions of dollars in revenue for the \nentire southeastern United States.\n  Until recently we had the support of the Obama administration as \nwell. After all, this is exactly the type of project the President has \nbeen touting as the secret to our economic recovery. He even included \nthe Savannah Harbor Expansion Project as one of the four port projects \nin his 2012 ``We Can't Wait'' initiative.\n  Vice President Biden visited the Port of Savannah along with Senator \nIsakson, myself, and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx last year, \nand in comments while at the Port of Savannah to the public that was \ngathered, he stated: ``We are going to get this done, come hell or high \nwater.''\n  Acting U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank visited the \nport in 2012, calling SHEP a national bipartisan priority for this \nadministration. Former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood visited \nthe Port of Savannah in 2011 promising to find funding for the port \nexpansion. In fact, in every conversation I have had with various \nadministration officials since this project started in 1997, I have \nbeen assured that we would find a way to get this project done.\n  So you can see how confused I was to learn this week that the \nadministration is now stonewalling us on this project by not including \nthe project in its 2015 budget. It is baffling to see this \nadministration choose to ignore a congressional statute passed just 6 \nweeks ago that cleared all remaining obstructions to moving forward \nwith this project.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 gave clear direction to \nthe administration to begin construction on the SHEP project and to \nrequest the necessary funding. The administration's position as \nevidenced by the Office of Management and Budget is that they will \nignore the clear guidance from Congress and will instead request more \nfunding for unnecessary additional studies this year. Apparently the \nadministration would rather pay lip service to Georgians than deliver \non their promises. The State of Georgia has done its part, and I \ncommend Governor Deal and the Georgia legislature, who have committed \n$265 million to start construction. We just need the Federal Government \nto get out of our way so Georgia can begin construction on this very \nvital project.\n  The administration can repair some of the damage that has been done \nby finalizing the agreement between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nand the Georgia Ports Authority so that they can begin construction \nwith State money that under the leadership of Governor Deal is now \ngoing to be available. Without any Federal funding at this point in \ntime, the State is willing to move forward.\n  I urge the administration to move ahead with the securing of that \nagreement between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Ports Authority, \nand let's begin construction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I seek recognition to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, we have now engaged in a debate over the \nlast couple of weeks over whether we should begin to expand a massive \nexportation of American natural gas--our own natural gas--to put it out \nonto the world market as a way of helping Ukraine deal with Russia.\n  This whole notion is constantly being invoked, like an incantation--a \ntalisman--that somehow or other this is some kind of a magic bullet \nthat will help solve the problems in Ukraine. In fact, it really is \nnothing more than another aggregation encyclopedically of discredited \nnotions, nostrums, that have no relationship to the reality of the \nglobal energy marketplace. These are actual arguments being made, false \npremises that do not, in fact, have any likelihood of having any \nsubstantial impact on the totality of the Ukrainian situation.\n  Let me give a few facts as a way of dealing with where we are right \nnow. The United States has already approved five export terminals that \ncould send 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas abroad. How much \nnatural gas is that? Let me tell my colleagues: It is more than twice \nwhat Ukraine uses in a year. The United States has already\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\ncommitted to doing that. More than a quarter of all of the gas Europe \nimports in a year would be ascribable to the amount of natural gas the \nUnited States has already approved. It would be nearly as much as every \nsingle U.S. home uses yearly. That is how much natural gas is part of \nthe already approved export terminals in this country.\n  The Department of Energy found that exporting 4.4 trillion cubic \nfeet--a level we will reach within the next approved export terminal--\ncould raise the price of domestic natural gas up to 54 percent. That \ncould mean that American consumers would pay $2.50 more per thousand \ncubic feet. That translates into--listen to this number, I say to my \ncolleagues--a $62 billion energy tax every year on American consumers \nand businesses.\n  What do I mean by energy tax? I mean that but for that exportation, \nconsumers' bills, corporations' bills, would be $62 billion lower per \nyear over the next 10 years. Can we imagine the debate here in the \nSenate over increasing $62 billion worth of taxes on Americans in one \nyear? We would come to a standstill if we had that kind of debate. But \nbecause it is part of energy policy, people assume it is something that \nis outside the purview of what should be a great national debate which \nwe are having.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, low-cost domestic natural gas has allowed \nthe United States to add--let me say this--530,000 manufacturing jobs \nsince 2010, according to Dow Chemical. If low prices continue, we could \nadd 5 million more jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2020. Who says \nthis? America's Energy Advantage. Who is in that organization? Dow, \nAlcoa, Nucor, and other major corporations. To what do they relate the \nmanufacturing revival in our country? Low prices. Energy that gives \nthem a reason to return the manufacturing jobs from overseas.\n  Except for the cost of labor, what is the single largest component in \na manufacturing job? The cost of energy. The lower it is, the more \nlikely the manufacturing company will have the jobs here in America. If \nwe increase the price by 54 percent or more, which is what many people \nhere are now proposing, we reduce the incentive for a manufacturer to \ncreate those new jobs here in the United States.\n  Let me give my colleagues another fact. Every dollar invested in \ndomestic manufacturing creates $8 in finished products. Manufacturing \nis at the heart of who we are as a country. This is something that \nright now is a discussion we should have in this country--the \nrelationship between low-cost energy and the new manufacturing jobs we \nwant to see. We can generate that economic value here in America, but \nif we send our natural gas overseas, that same kind of manufacturing \nfuture can be constructed in China. Let's have that debate here in our \ncountry.\n  Last month the U.S. chemical industry topped $100 billion in new \ninvestments as a result of low-cost U.S. natural gas. According to the \nAmerican Chemistry Council, those 148 new factories and expanded \nprojects could generate $81 billion per year in new chemical industry \noutput and 637,000 new jobs in manufacturing here in the United States \nby the year 2023.\n  Now let's go to, in my opinion, some of the complete canards that are \nthrown out about where this natural gas will go if it is put out into \nthe free market. First of all, let me say this: We are not Russia. We \nare not Venezuela. We are not a Communist country where the government \ncontrols where energy goes. No. We are a capitalist country. We are \nproud of it. The decision as to where natural gas is going to go is \ngoing to be made by the CEOs of oil and gas companies in our country, \nand they are going to send it to where they can get the highest dollar. \nLet me say this right now: The highest dollar is in China. The highest \ndollar is in South America. The highest dollar is not in Ukraine. So \nanyone who thinks that setting up these export terminals and sending \nour natural gas that could be helping our manufacturing sector overseas \nis going to help Ukraine's geopolitical situation doesn't understand \nthe geo-economics of it, the geology of it, or the geopolitical \nimplications of it. They have not thought through the totality of what \nhappens when we take our precious resource and we start spreading it \naround the world.\n  Some are going to argue that it helps Ukraine. Well, it is going to \nhelp China more than it helps Ukraine. It is going to help South \nAmerica more than it helps Ukraine. It is for sure going to help the \nCEOs of big oil and gas companies. That is what this debate is really \ngoing to be all about. Because we don't captain those ships. ExxonMobil \nhas a tiller for those ships, and those ships are going to steer toward \nwhere the highest price is on the world marketplace. When those LNG \ntankers set sail for Asia or South America, we should know what else we \nare sending abroad on those ships. American jobs will be on those \nships. They will be sailing to other countries. Fighting climate change \nis on those ships, because we will burn more coal here in the United \nStates rather than natural gas, which has half of the pollutants of \ncoal. We will be increasing the greenhouse gases the United States of \nAmerica is sending up into the atmosphere.\n  When we are sending that natural gas overseas, we will be increasing \nthe cost of a conversion of our large bus fleet and our large truck \nfleet over to natural gas as the fuel which makes it possible to drive \nthem around our country. Here are the statistics. It is quite simple. \nIf we move one-third of our fleet off of oil and on to natural gas as a \nway of fueling large buses and large trucks, then we back out 1 million \nbarrels of oil--1 million barrels of oil--per day. That is a signal we \nshould be sending to the Middle East. That is a signal that we are \nserious, that we are tired of exporting young men and women overseas \nand getting nothing in return.\n  So let me summarize by saying this: No. 1, it is a $62 billion \nconsumer tax. No. 2, it slows our conversion from coal over to oil in \nour utility industry. No. 3, it slows the conversion of vehicles over \nto natural gas. No. 4, it slows our manufacturing revolution. No. 5, it \nslows our economic recovery. Our real strength is in our strong economy \nfueled by this low-cost oil and natural gas in our country.\n  We need a huge national debate in our country about the impact on our \neconomy before we start putting it out on the high seas believing, \nerroneously, it is going to have some huge impact on Ukraine.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is one of \nthe most serious breaches of the OSCE principles since the signing of \nthe 1975 Helsinki Final Act. These principles are at the foundation of \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia, as a \nparticipating state, agreed to hold these principles, including \nterritorial integrity of states, inviolability of frontiers, refraining \nfrom the threat of use of force, peaceful settlements of disputes, and \nothers.\n  With this invasion, which is based, as Secretary Kerry has stated, on \na completely trumped-up set of pretexts, Russia has shown its utter \ncontempt for these core principles, indeed, for the entire OSCE \nprocess--not only the OSCE but the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by \nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Ukraine that \nprovides security assurances for Ukraine, the 1997 Ukraine-Russia \nbilateral treaty, and the U.N. charter, and other international \nagreements. Russia's military invasion of Ukraine is also a gross \nviolation of the Vienna Document's confidence and security building \nmechanisms which govern military relations and arms control.\n\n  So let's examine Vladimir Putin's justification for this unprovoked \ninvasion. He claims there is a need to protect Russian interests and \nthe rights of Russian-speaking minorities. They characterize it as a \nhuman rights protection mission that it clearly is not. Russian \nofficials fail to show any real evidence that the rights of ethnic \nRussians in Crimea--where they actually constitute a majority and have \nthe most clout politically--and Ukraine at large have been violated. In \nfact, there is overwhelming evidence that the protests in some \nUkrainian cities is being stoked by the Russians.\n  Putin and other Russian officials make all sorts of unfounded \naccusations, including that masked militia are roaming the streets of \nKiev, although the Ukrainian capital and most\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nof Ukraine has been calm for the last few weeks. Mr. Putin claims there \nis a ``rampage of reactionary forces, nationalist and anti-Semitic \nforces going on in certain parts of Ukraine.'' Yet Kiev's chief rabbi \nand a vice president of the World Jewish Congress on Monday accused \nRussia of staging anti-Semitic provocations in Crimea.\n  Mr. Putin accuses Ukraine's new legitimate transition government--not \nyet 2 weeks old--of threatening ethnic Russians. Yet there is a myriad \nof credible reports to the contrary. Indeed, although there has been \nunrest in some cities, there has been no serious movement in the mostly \nRussian-speaking eastern and southern regions to join with Russia.\n  The clear majority of Ukrainians wants to see their country remain \nunified and do not welcome Russian intervention. All Ukrainian \nreligious groups have come out against the Russian intervention and \nstand in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability \nof its borders, as have minority groups such as the Crimean Tatars and \nthe Roma.\n  I submit that the real threat posed by the new government is that it \nwants to assertively move Ukraine in the direction of political and \neconomic reforms and in the direction of democracy, respect for how \nhuman rights, the rule of law--away from the unbridled corruption of \nthe previous regime and the kind of autocratic rule found in today's \nRussia.\n  As for protecting Russian interests in Crimea, the Russians have not \nproduced one iota of evidence that the Russian Black Sea Fleet, based \nin the Crimean city of Sevastopol, is under any kind of threat. Indeed, \nwhen the Ukrainians reached out to the Russians to try to engage them \npeacefully, they have been rebuffed.\n  Russian authorities need to send their troops back to the barracks \nand instead engage through diplomacy, not the threat or use of force. \nThe Russian actions pose a threat beyond Ukraine and threaten to \ndestabilize neighboring states.\n  I pointed out at a hearing we had this week in the subcommittee of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and in a hearing of the \nHelsinki Commission, that if Russia can use force to try to change \nterritories, what message does that send to the South China Sea, what \nmessage does that send to the Western Balkans?\n  Just as Poland has already invoked article 4 NATO consultations, the \nBaltic States and others in the region are wary of Russian goals.\n  As chairman of the Helsinki Commission and a former vice president of \nthe OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I am encouraged to see active and \nwide-ranging engagement of the OSCE to deescalate tensions and to \nfoster peace and security in Ukraine. The OSCE has the tools to address \nconcerns with regard to security on the ground in Crimea, minority \nrights, and with regard to preparations for this democratic transition \nto lead to free and fair elections.\n  In response to a request by the Ukrainian Government, 18 OSCE \nparticipating states, including the United States, are sending 35 \nunarmed military personnel to Ukraine. This is taking place under the \nVienna Document, which allows for voluntary hosting of visits to dispel \nconcerns about unusual military activities.\n  Various OSCE institutions are activating, at the request of the \nUkrainian Government, including the OSCE's human rights office, known \nas the ODIHR, to provide human rights monitoring as well as election \nobservation for the May 25 Presidential elections. The OSCE High \nCommissioner on National Minorities, Representative on Freedom of the \nMedia, and the head of the Strategic Police Matters Unit, among others, \nare all in Kiev this week conducting factfinding missions. A full-\nscale, long-term OSCE Monitoring Mission is being proposed, and this \nmission needs to go forward.\n  All of these OSCE efforts are aimed at deescalating tensions, \nfostering peace and stability, ensuring the observance of OSCE \nprinciples, including the human dimension, helping Ukraine in its \ntransition, especially in the runup to the May elections.\n  These OSCE on-the-ground efforts are being thwarted by the Russian-\ncontrolled newly installed Crimean authorities. The OSCE Unusual \nMilitary Activities observers have been stopped from entering Crimea by \nunidentified men in military fatigues.\n  Also, the OSCE Media Freedom Representative and her staff were \ntemporarily blocked from leaving a hotel in Crimea where she was \nmeeting with journalists and civil society activists. The U.N. special \nenvoy was accosted by unidentified gunmen after visiting a naval \nheadquarters in the Sevastopol.\n  The blocking of international monitors--who were invited by the \nUkrainian Government and who clearly are trying to seek peaceful \nresolutions to the conflict--is completely unacceptable and we should \nhold Russia responsible for their safety.\n  Russia is a member of the OSCE--one of the founding members--and they \nare openly violating the core principles of the Helsinki Final Act. \nRussia signed on to the institutions that are available under OSCE for \nthis exact type of circumstance--to give independent observation as to \nwhat is happening on the ground. Sending this mission, at the request \nof the host country, into Crimea is exactly the commitments made to \nreduce tensions in OSCE states, and Russia is blocking the use of that \nmechanism.\n  The United States and the international community are deploying wide-\nranging resources to contain and roll back Russia's aggression and to \nassist Ukraine's transition to a democratic, secure, and prosperous \ncountry. Both the Executive and the Congress are working around the \nclock on this. President Obama has taken concrete action and made \nconcrete recommendations.\n  As the author of the Magnitsky Act, I welcome the White House \nsanctions announced today, including visa restrictions on officials and \nindividuals threatening Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity \nand financial sanctions against those ``responsible for activities \nundermining democratic processes or institutions in Ukraine.''\n  It was just a little while ago that we passed the Magnitsky Act. We \ndid that in response to gross human rights violations within Russia \nagainst an individual named Sergei Magnitsky. What we did is say that \nthose who were responsible for these gross violations of \ninternationally recognized rules should be held accountable, and if \nthey are not held accountable, the least we can do in the United States \nis not give them safe haven in our country, not allow the corrupt \ndollars they have earned to be housed in America--no visas, no use of \nour banking system. The President is taking a similar action against \nthose responsible for the invasion and military use against \ninternational rules in Ukraine.\n  These steps are in addition to many other actions, including the \nsuspension of bilateral discussions with Russia on trade and \ninvestment, stopping United States-Russia military-to-military \nengagement, and suspending preparations for the June G8 summit in \nSochi. Both Chambers are working expeditiously on legislation to help \nUkraine in this delicate period of transition. We also need to work \nexpeditiously with our European friends and allies, and I am encouraged \nby the news that the EU is preparing a $15 billion aid package.\n  Ukraine has exercised amazing restraint in not escalating the \nconflict, particularly in Crimea. I applaud their restraint and their \naction. The people of Ukraine have suffered an incredibly difficult \nhistory, and over the last century they have been subjected to two \nWorld Wars, 70 years of Soviet domination, including Stalin's genocidal \nfamine. They certainly do not need another senseless war. Nothing \njustifies Russia's aggression--nothing. Our political and economic \nassistance at this time would be a testament to those who died at the \nMaidan just 2 weeks ago and a concrete manifestation that our words \nmean something and that we do indeed stand by the people of Ukraine as \nthey make their historic choice for freedom, democracy, and a better \nlife.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1357-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1357-S1359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MANUFACTURING INNOVATION HUBS\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I come to the floor once again to talk \nabout good jobs--about manufacturing jobs--and about what we can do \ntogether in this Chamber to strengthen\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nthe vital manufacturing sector of the American economy.\n  Last year, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown and Republican Senator \nRoy Blunt came together in a bipartisan effort to cosponsor an \nimportant bill, S. 1468, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and \nInnovation Act of 2013--an effort to build a national network for \nmanufacturing and innovation, also known as manufacturing innovation \nhubs.\n  This bill, if enacted, would allow us to build institutes across our \ncountry dedicated to discovering the next breakthroughs in technology \nand translating them to the next breakthroughs in manufacturing. I have \nbeen proud to support and fight for this bill, and now, because of my \ncolleagues' leadership and determination, we are close to getting a \nvote.\n  We have heard about the importance of these innovation hubs for \nmanufacturing before. Last year two hubs opened--one in Youngstown, OH, \nand another in Raleigh, NC. Just last week I was thrilled to hear about \ntwo more opening--one in Detroit and another in Chicago.\n  These hubs are good first steps, but they are being done by the \nexecutive branch, without express and explicit authorization for a \nwhole and broader program through this bill, which would extend this \nnational network, would make its life longer and greater, and give more \nspecific details to the process by which they would be authorized going \nforward.\n  It is my hope, having already seen several demonstrations on a more \nmodest scale, this Congress will come together in a bipartisan way and \nenact this legislation to put a framework in place for the long term.\n  These hubs, as I said, are good first steps, but we in Congress can \nand should do more. In my home State of Delaware we are blessed to have \nsome remarkable institutions of higher learning: Delaware State \nUniversity, led by the great President Dr. Harry Williams; the \nUniversity of Delaware--both research institutions which benefit from \nfederally funded research and both of which do work in energy and \nengineering, relevant to manufacturing. We also have Del Tech--Delaware \nTechnical & Community College--which does great workforce training and \npartners with manufacturers. We also have a whole series of \nmanufacturers, large and small; some iconic companies such as DuPont, \nsome unknown outside my State that employ dozens or hundreds.\n  What a manufacturing hub would do is bring together a university that \nis doing cutting-edge research in a new field with companies looking to \nstart manufacturing using that technology, with those community \ncolleges and others who would train the new workforce, creating a \nnetwork that would do the innovative work in an iterative way that \nwould accelerate new manufacturing opportunities.\n  The reason this bill has such a diverse set of bipartisan backers--\nfrom Democrats such as Sherrod Brown, Debbie Stabenow, and myself, to \nRepublicans such as Roy Blunt, Lindsey Graham, and Mark Kirk--is \nbecause these hubs represent a great example of how the Federal \nGovernment can help foster partnerships between businesses, \nuniversities, and communities in a hands-off way.\n  As to these first four hubs I mentioned, in these instances, the \nFederal Government is also getting terrific leverage. There is a more \nthan 1-to-1 match from private, State, and local partnerships in these \nexisting hubs--partnerships, I might add, that have national reach, \ngiving the hubs the potential to benefit not just their immediate \nregions or their immediate communities but the whole country.\n  General Dynamics and Honeywell, for example, are two of the partner \ncompanies in the Youngstown, OH, lab. They have footprints all across \nour country. At the hub in Raleigh, NC, researchers from other \nuniversities--such as Arizona State and Florida State--are \ncollaborators as well, contributing their knowledge to the great work \nof these hubs and then also bringing back to their labs and their \ncommunities what is being learned through this common collaborative \nwork.\n  So the Youngstown and Raleigh hubs--now well established--are about \nmore than just those two cities, and the hubs in Detroit and Chicago \nwill be about more than just Michigan and Illinois, and the hubs we \nwould create, we would authorize, through this bill would be about more \nthan just the cities or States in which they are based.\n  By bringing together such a wide-ranging and diverse set of partners, \nhubs allow many different stakeholders to pool their resources, \nminimizing the risks of investing in the early stage research that is \ncritical to innovation but not feasible for one company alone to invest \nin.\n  It is about the private sector coming together with the university \nand public sectors to solve tough problems without just one firm \nbearing all the risk or the burden. R and development--as \nwe know, is critical to our economic future. These hubs offer an \ninnovative model for increasing our national capacity for invention.\n  The Federal Government acts as a convener for private firms, \nnonprofits, universities, and researchers, creating an environment \nwhere they can all do what they do best and share it. This idea \ntranscends ideology or party. That is why I think Members of both \nparties should feel comfortable getting behind this bill. It has been \nendorsed by folks ranging from the National Association of \nManufacturers to the Bio, which represents the bio and pharmaceutical \ncommunity, and folks in the private sector and public sector in my own \nState and in States across the country.\n  Manufacturing is at the heart of what can and should make this \ncountry competitive and prosperous in this century. At the end of the \nday, this is about creating good jobs. Manufacturing jobs are high-\nquality jobs. It has a significant secondary benefit in the community \nas well as having higher wages and benefits than jobs in any other \nsector.\n  If we are looking for the key to a dynamic innovation economy, we \nneed to look no further than manufacturers. They invest more in R \nthan any other private sector within the country. When we think of \nmanufacturing and innovation today, we often picture researchers in the \nUnited States inventing things and manufacturing factories overseas. \nBut that is not how sophisticated, advanced manufacturing innovation \nworks anymore. The reality is that innovation is just not linear. R \nand manufacturing need to be closer together. It does not just start in \nthe lab and then get sent to a factory and then to a store and your \nhome. More often R results in innovations that improve the products \nalready in our home, that improve the manufacturing process to discover \nbetter ways to make things faster, more safely, more efficiently, and \nthat innovative cycle can speed up the more closely connected and \narticulated it is.\n  By creating these manufacturing innovation hubs, all of which focus \non a specific sector or industry, we can help fuel the discoveries that \nwill make manufacturing a critical part of our long-term economic \nfuture, while ensuring that the discoveries that change our world are \nmade here in America and the products that come out of them are \nmanufactured here in America.\n  These hubs focus on emerging areas where there is enormous potential. \nFor example, the hub in Youngstown, OH, is focused on 3D printing, \nwhich already has the potential to transform how manufacturing, large-\nscale and small-scale, is done not just in the United States but around \nthe world. We believe--I certainly believe we should continue to be at \nthe cutting edge of developing and deploying what 3D printing has to \noffer.\n  The one in Raleigh, NC, is about wide bandgap semiconductors or \nenergy-efficient electronics and will likely dominate much of the next \ngeneration of electronics. Again, why would we not want to be on the \nground for not just the inventing of new technologies but demonstrating \nhow to manufacture them?\n  In Detroit, researchers and businesses and universities and other \nstakeholders in this newest hub will work together on advanced \nlightweight materials, on remarkable metals that are stronger, more \ndurable, more ductile, and more lightweight than other existing \nmaterials, with applications, of course, in automobiles but across a \nvery wide range of products and platforms.\n  Lastly, in Chicago, small businesses, universities, and larger \ncompanies are\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nworking together on some remarkable advances that speed up the whole \nmanufacturing process so new ideas can go from the lab to your home \nfaster than ever before.\n  Hubs such as these are central to our competitiveness because it is \nnot just about the work happening at the lab or the institute itself; \nit is about how they then attract companies with a national reach to an \narea that is capable of building sustainable and dynamic local \neconomies. It is about bringing researchers and manufactures together \nto spur innovation, commercialize R, and create good jobs that do not \ngo somewhere else. It is about the larger impact for our communities \nand our country, as innovation breeds new supply chains and new \nbusinesses locally and across our country.\n  Today's global economy is more competitive than it has ever been. We \nare competing not just with developing countries that have lower labor \nand environmental standards or lower wages but also with developed \nnations that are trying to out-educate, out-research, and out-innovate \nus. Germany, for example, has a well-developed, well-established, well-\ndeployed network of more than 60 manufacturing innovation hubs exactly \nlike the ones I have just described. It also has fairly high labor and \nenvironmental standards but is the manufacturing powerhouse of Europe. \nIt has nearly double the percentage of its GDP in manufacturing as the \nUnited States. How are they able to do this? How can they sustain these \nhigh levels of manufacturing? It is in no small part because of the \nmanufacturing innovation hubs they have developed and deployed.\n  So let's get this done. There is absolutely no reason that the season \nof governing and of legislating here in Washington needs to be over, \nespecially when there is so much important work to do--work that I know \nwe can and should get done on a bipartisan basis. Senators Brown and \nBlunt have done great work and shown strong leadership in developing \nthis bill, refining this bill, and getting it to this point.\n  Let's show that we can come together in areas where we do agree and \nput campaigns and politics aside for now and put American jobs and \nAmerican innovation first.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.)

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, March 8 is International Women's Day--a \nday when we can celebrate the enormous advances women have made while \npledging to continue to work for greater opportunity for all women.\n  Rooted in the long-term struggle for equality, International Women's \nDay has been observed since a time when American women were fighting \nfor basic rights, such as voting or fair employment. Today, we see \nwomen breaking ground and becoming leaders in business, government, and \nthe military--both here in the United States and overseas. While this \nis encouraging, many women around the world continue to face \nsignificant social and economic obstacles.\n  The official United Nations theme for this International Women's Day \nis ``Equality for women is progress for all.'' I couldn't agree more; \nempowering women is one of the most critical tools in our toolbox to \nfight poverty and injustice.\n  According to some reports, women represent nearly 70 percent of the \nworld's poor. In many regions of the world, a woman's ability to earn a \nsustained income is severely limited by cultural norms and a lack of \nopportunity.\n  Economically empowering women is one of the most important tools we \nhave to alleviate poverty. Women around the world participate in the \npolitical, social, and economic life of their communities and play a \npredominate role in providing and caring for their families. Research \nhas shown that men only reinvest 30-40 percent of their income into \ntheir households, while women reinvest 90 percent--choosing to spend \ntheir money on food, clean water, education and health care. Greater \neconomic opportunity and earning capacity also increases equality and \nmutual respect within households, reducing women's vulnerability to \ndomestic abuse.\n  Until women around the world have improved access to economic, \npolitical, and social opportunities, many of the great challenges we \nface today, from pervasive global poverty to violent extremism, will go \nunresolved.\n  We must continue to promote women's leadership and integrate gender \nperspectives in our development and foreign assistance programs. \nAdvancing gender equality and women's empowerment in this realm will \nnot only lead to increased productivity and income for women but can \nhave a positive impact for generations to come.\n  I urge all my colleagues to work together to call attention to the \ninjustices women face around the world and to work to implement laws \nand policies that advance the cause of women both at home and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1360-7", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1360-S1362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEAMONTE DRIVER'S PASSING\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to mark the seventh \nanniversary of Deamonte Driver's death.\n  Deamonte Driver was a 12-year-old child who lived in Prince George's \nCounty, MD, whose border sits only a few miles from the U.S. Capitol \nBuilding. He died 7 years ago at the Children's National Medical Center \nin Washington, DC, from a brain infection caused by an untreated tooth \nabscess.\n  The Driver family, like many other families across the country, \nlacked dental insurance. At one time, the Drivers were covered by the \nMedicaid Program, but they lost that coverage when they moved into a \nshelter and their paperwork fell through the cracks. When advocates for \nthe family tried to help the Drivers locate a dentist to treat \nDeamonte's cavities and tooth pain, it took more than 20 calls to find \na dentist who would see him.\n  Around mid-January in 2007, Deamonte began to complain of severe \nheadaches. A subsequent evaluation at Children's Hospital led beyond \nthe basic dental care that the family had anticipated to emergency \nbrain surgery. Deamonte later experienced seizures, and a second \noperation was required. After additional treatment and\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\ntherapy, Deamonte appeared to be recovering, but medical intervention \nhad come too late. By the end of his treatment, the total cost to our \nhealth care system exceeded one-quarter of a million dollars--more than \n3,000 times the $80 cost of a tooth extraction.\n  Deamonte Driver passed away on Sunday, February 25, 2007. This \nchild's death was a national tragedy because it could have been \nprevented had he received timely and proper basic dental care. It was a \ntragedy because it happened right here in the United States, in a State \nthat is one of the most affluent in the Nation. It happened in the \nState that is home to the first and one of the best dental schools in \nthe Nation, the University of Maryland's dental school. It happened in \nPrince George's County, whose border is less than 6 miles from where we \nare standing in the U.S. Capitol.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor about Deamonte Driver several times \nsince his death, and in the intervening years, both in Maryland and \nnationally, we have made tremendous progress. When Deamonte's story was \nbrought to light, I believe it was a wakeup call for our Nation. It \nbrought home the statement of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop: \n``There is no health without oral health.''\n  Medical research reinforces Dr. Koop's words. Scientists have \ndiscovered the nexus between tooth plaque and heart disease, that \nchewing stimulates brain cell growth, and that gum disease can signal \ndiabetes, liver ailments, and hormone imbalances. They have identified \nthe vital connection between oral health research and advanced \ntreatments like gene therapy, which can help patients with chronic \nrenal failure. They have found that investing in basic dental care for \nchildren and adults can reduce health care expenditures down the road \nfor costly medical interventions related to other diseases.\n  But for all their research findings, we also know that without \ninsurance coverage and adequate access to providers, the needs of \nmillions of children and adults will remain unmet, and the \ncomplications resulting from poor oral health will persist.\n  That is why the progress we have made over the past 7 years is so \nimportant to America's health. I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout what has been achieved and how we can move forward as a nation to \nensure even greater access to oral health care.\n  Since Deamonte's passing, the State of Maryland has emerged as a \nnational leader in oral health--launching a $1.2 million oral health \nliteracy campaign, raising Medicaid reimbursement rates for dentists in \nthe program, and providing allied health professionals and hygienists \nthe opportunity to practice outside clinics. The Deamonte Driver Dental \nProject Van, which was dedicated in front of the U.S. Capitol in May \n2010, provides care in underserved neighborhoods in Prince George's \nCounty, thanks to efforts conceived and launched by members of the \nRobert T. Freeman Dental Society. An arm of the National Dental \nAssociation, the society is named for Dr. Robert Tanner Freeman, who in \n1869 became the first Black graduate of the Harvard School of Dental \nMedicine.\n  It was 2 years after Deamonte's death, in 2009, that Congress \nreauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program. Some of my \ncolleagues recalled the difficulty that Deamonte's mother had finding \nhim care. Hers was not an isolated instance. For varied reasons, it is \ndifficult for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees to find dental providers, and \nworking parents whose children qualify for those programs are likely to \nbe employed at jobs where they can't afford to spend 2 hours a day on \nthe phone searching for a provider. So part of the CHIP Reauthorization \nAct requires HHS to include on its Insure Kids Now Web site a list of \nparticipating dentists and benefit information for all 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Also in 2009, Congress passed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America \nAct, which created the Healthy Futures Corps--a program that provides \ngrants to States and nonprofit organizations so they can fund national \nservice in low-income communities. The law's goal was to put into \naction key tools that can help close the gaps in health status--\nprevention and health promotion. With the help of Senator Mikulski, we \nadded language to that law specifying oral health as an area of focus. \nNow, the Healthy Futures Corps is recruiting young people to work in \nthe dental profession, where severe shortages of providers exist in \nmany urban and rural communities. The law is funding the work of \nindividuals who can help parents find oral health care for themselves \nand their children. It is making a difference in the lives of the \nHealthy Futures Corps members who work in underserved communities and \nin the lives and health of those who can now get care.\n  Then in 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which \nguarantees pediatric dental coverage as part of each State's Essential \nBenefits health care package. The ACA also established an oral health \ncare prevention education campaign at the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, which is targeted toward key populations, including \nchildren and pregnant women, and it created demonstration programs to \nencourage innovation in oral health delivery. The law also \nsignificantly expanded workforce training programs for oral health \nprofessionals.\n  Moving forward, the States have a critical role to play in ensuring \nthat the ACA benefit is designed to incentivize prevention, recognize \nthat some children have greater risk of dental disease than others, and \ndeliver care based on their level of risk.\n  Among the most cost-effective ways to improve children's dental \nhealth are investments in prevention. Dental sealants, clear plastic \ncoatings applied to the chewing surface of molars, have been proven to \nprevent 60 percent of tooth decay at one-third the cost of filling a \ncavity. So it is essential that prevention be part of every State's \nbenefit package.\n  Further, in 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nlaunched its Oral Health Initiative, based on a bill I introduced with \nSenator Susan Collins. The initiative establishes a coordinated \nmultiagency effort to improve access to care across the Nation.\n  One of the most effective organizations in tracking access to care is \nthe Pew Children's Dental Campaign, which produces report cards that \ngrade the States on eight policies that are evidence-based solutions to \nthe problem of tooth decay. In 2011, Maryland received an ``A'' grade \nin both reports for meeting or exceeding these benchmarks, which \ninclude dental sealant programs, community water fluoridation, Medicaid \nreimbursement and enrollment, and collection of data on children's \ndental health. Maryland's grade is significant because in the late \n1990s, my State had one of the worst records in the Nation with respect \nto oral health care for its underserved population. Now it is one of \nthe top-ranked States for oral health care.\n  Our State has just received even more good news. The number of \nchildren in Maryland with untreated tooth decay dropped 41 percent from \n2001 to 2011, and the overall oral health status of Maryland children \nhas dramatically improved, according to a 2014 report conducted by the \nUniversity of Maryland's School of Dentistry. The State assessment \nlooked at 1,723 students in 52 schools from the five regions of the \nState. About 33 percent of the children had at least one dental sealant \non their permanent first molars, and this milestone exceeded Federal \ngoals by 5 percent. About 14 percent of students had untreated dental \ncaries, a drop from 23 percent in 2000, and the State's achievement \nexceeded Federal goals by 12 percent. According to the assessment, 75 \npercent of the children surveyed had a regular dentist.\n  Another key player in our State's effort is the Baltimore Oral Health \nImpact Project, which provides care to children in Baltimore's public \nschools. Since February 2010, its providers have seen more than 3,500 \nchildren and treated more than 1,500 for dental disease. The program \nplaces a high value on delivering comprehensive and compassionate oral \nhealth care.\n  This organization has also launched the Baltimore Oral Health \nAcademy, offering scholarships to students who choose to pursue careers \nas a clinical dental professional including dental assistants and \nhygienists, and who agree to serve in a public health setting.\n  Nationally, HRSA's National Health Service Corps addresses the \nnationwide shortage of primary care oral health\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nproviders in dental health professional shortage areas--HPSA--by \noffering incentives in the form of scholarships and loan repayments to \nprimary care dentists and registered dental hygienists to practice in \nunderserved communities. The Corps has awarded more than 1,100 new loan \nrepayment awards to dentists and nearly 300 new loan repayment awards \nto registered dental hygienists. But this is not nearly enough to erase \nthe shortages. The NHSC has also implemented a part-time service \nprogram for providers who did not wish to make a full-time commitment, \nand I am hopeful that this new option will increase participation in \nthe coming years.\n  Our Nation has made significant progress in improving children's \ndental health in the 7 years since Deamonte died, but there is still \nmuch work to be done. The access problem in some communities has become \nso severe that many people are forced to seek treatment for tooth pain \nin the Nation's emergency rooms, increasing the overall cost of care \nand receiving uncoordinated care in the least cost-efficient setting. \nIn fact, more people seek treatment in emergency rooms for tooth pain \nthan they do for asthma.\n  I will continue to work to increase funding for grants to States and \nexpand training opportunities for dentists. We do not have enough \nprofessionals who are trained and available to treat children and \nadults with dental problems, and it is our responsibility to fix that. \nWe must improve public reimbursement to dental providers in offices and \nclinics so that no one who needs treatment will be turned away.\n  Soon, Congress will turn again to the Reauthorization of the CHIP \nprogram, and I will be once again fighting for the strongest possible \nlanguage we can get to promote children's oral health. For my \ncolleagues who may not be familiar with CHIP's track record on oral \nhealth, I would like to leave you with three facts:\n  First, tooth decay is the single most common chronic disease of \nchildhood, and it is five times more common than asthma. The \ncomplications of dental disease, which we now know can be fatal, are \ncompletely and easily preventable if we give children the care they \nneed. Second, because of Congress's passage of the 2009 Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, in 2013, more than 8 \nmillion American children had comprehensive dental coverage through \nCHIP. Third, CHIP has kept comprehensive coverage affordable. Under \nCHIP, families cannot pay more than 5 percent of their annual income in \nout-of-pocket costs for their children's medical and dental care.\n  What we have been able to achieve for children is due to support in \nCongress and also to the efforts of the many nonprofit organizations, \nuniversities, and providers who are also working across the Nation to \nmake sure that we will never forget Deamonte and never forget our \nresponsibility to improving oral health care for America's children.\n  On this sad anniversary, in Maryland and throughout the Nation there \nare signs of hope for the future of oral health care. I thank my \ncolleagues for the role they have played in this process and look \nforward to working with them in the months to come to strengthen oral \nhealth care access for our Nation's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1362-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANTONIA FERRIER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Antonia Ferrier on \nmy staff. After 4 years of trying to keep this tough old bird in line, \nshe'll be leaving my office in the coming days. She will most certainly \nbe missed.\n  Antonia first came to Capitol Hill to work for the former \ndistinguished majority leader and my good friend, Bill Frist from \nTennessee. After that, she went on to serve on the staff of another one \nof our former colleagues, Olympia Snowe. Now, Maine is pretty different \nfrom Tennessee, but I'm sure it felt like a bit of a homecoming for \nAntonia, who is from Massachusetts. After more than 3 years with \nSenator Snowe, Antonia made her way across the Capitol Rotunda to work \nfor Senator Roy Blunt during his time as the House Republican Whip.\n  For a Senate purist like Antonia, one House Member probably felt like \nenough, but she then went on to serve John Boehner during his time as \nthe House Republican leader. Finally, we were able to woo her back on \nthis side of the Capitol to come be a member of our team.\n  As I said, Antonia is a Senate purist. She understands the Senate's \nrole in our system of government, she appreciates the personalities and \ncomplexities of those that are honored to serve here, and she knows how \nmuch the work we do here impacts the lives of Americans from Tennessee \nto Maine, and Ohio to Utah. And, given her experience, she understands \nthe House very much as well.\n  I'll deeply miss having Antonia around, not only for her sage advice \nand counsel, but also for her wit and sense of humor, and her \nwillingness for straight-talk. I think she would say that the hardest \npart of her job is protecting me from myself. That's a tough job for \nanyone. And, I have to say that she's been up to the task, even during \nthose times when I've made it particularly difficult.\n  I want to thank Antonia for her service to me, to Utah, and to the \nSenate over these last several years. She has been an amazing asset, \nand I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1362-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JOHN S. WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I am grateful for the opportunity to pay \ntribute to a truly extraordinary public servant, father, grandfather, \nand neighbor--Mr. John S. Williams. Sadly, John passed away this week \nleaving behind a legacy of dedication and service.\n  John worked for an unprecedented 27\\1/2\\ years as the executive \ndirector of the Five County Association of Governments, AOG; only the \nthird person to serve in that position since the association's \ninception. This association was formed to address the needs and \nchallenges facing the southwest region of Utah--Beaver, Garfield, Iron, \nKane, and Washington Counties. As the director, John set a tone of hard \nwork, commitment, and a belief in the greatness of southwest Utah. He \nwas comfortable not only in the director's chair--but rolling up his \nsleeves and getting the hard work done.\n  He was a key figure in promoting economic development in southwest \nUtah, as well as the whole State. He helped formulate policy and \naddress issues facing an increasingly expanding region including: \ninfrastructure, public lands issues, population growth, and quality of \nlife. The Five County AOG has a reputation throughout Utah as an \nassociation that makes a difference and helps forge the way, largely in \npart because of the strength of John's leadership for almost three \ndecades.\n  While working with John on many occasions throughout my Senate \nservice I have always found him as someone who deeply cared about those \nhe served, and had ideas and solutions to address the challenges facing \na very important region of Utah. The example he set will be felt for \ngenerations to come; and the five counties he served are better \nprepared for the future challenges and triumphs they will face in the \ncoming years.\n  Elaine and I convey our deepest sympathies to John's wife Jamie, his \nfive children, and many grandchildren. May our Heavenly Father bless \nthem with peace and comfort at this time. The contributions and impact \nJohn made on his family, his community, and our State will be felt and \nappreciated for generations to come. Utah is a better State because of \nthe service John rendered throughout his life and his strong advocacy \nof southwest Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1362-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1362-S1363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FREEDOM FOR BOB LEVINSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

At a time when our governments are talking to one \nanother after more than 30 years, I ask that they talk about locating \nBob and bringing him home to Florida. This case transcends any \ndifferences between the United States and Iran.\n  I continue to believe our two countries share the same goal: as a \nhumanitarian matter both governments can readily support bringing a \nfather home to his children and grandchildren.\n  I have said as much to officials in the Iranian Government, and I \nrise today to reiterate this same message. I will also continue to call \non the U.S. Government to raise Bob's case with Iranian officials at \nevery opportunity and do all they can to end this ordeal.\n  Bob and his wife Christine have seven children and four \ngrandchildren.\n  For their sake, after 7 heart-wrenching years, we must all redouble \nour efforts to bring Bob home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1363-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AROOSTOOK COUNTY, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this year marks the 175th anniversary of \nthe incorporation of Aroostook County, ME. As one who was born and \nraised in that wonderful place, I wish to celebrate its fascinating \npast, energetic present, and bright future.\n  If the story of Aroostook County could be summed up in one thought, \nit would be this: We are the largest county east of the Mississippi \nRiver, yet we are all neighbors. From the frontier to the front lines \nof innovation, the people of ``The County,'' as it is known throughout \nMaine, have always worked hard and worked together.\n  The story of Aroostook County begins long before its incorporation in \n1839. For thousands of years, it has been the home of the Micmac and \nMaliseet; the name Aroostook comes from the Native American word for \n``beautiful river.''\n  French explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area \nin 1604. The settlements that followed laid the foundation for the \nvibrant Acadian culture that is so important in Maine, New Brunswick, \nNova Scotia, and as far away as Louisiana. Under French, and later, \nEnglish rule, Aroostook's rich natural resources drew hardy lumberjacks \nand trappers to the area.\n  For decades after the American Revolution, Maine's northernmost \nregion was the site of a protracted and tense border dispute between \nour new Nation and British Canada. As negotiations, led by the great \nAmerican statesman Daniel Webster, to end what is now called the \nBloodless Aroostook War neared completion, families and entrepreneurs \nsettled in the area, and Aroostook County was incorporated. Among those \nearly settlers was my ancestor, Samuel W. Collins, who built a lumber \nmill in Caribou in 1844 that was the beginning of our fifth-generation \nfamily business still in operation today.\n  People were drawn to Aroostook County in search of liberty and \nopportunity, and they have always worked and sacrificed to extend those \nblessings to others. In the years before emancipation, Aroostook County \nwas the last stop on the Underground Railroad that took slaves to \nfreedom. The Friends Quaker Church in Fort Fairfield stands today as a \npowerful memorial to that time of courage and compassion. Civil War \nmonuments in villages throughout Aroostook County stand in honor of the \nmany heroes who gave their lives so that all could be free.\n  Throughout the 19th century, the people of Aroostook County connected \ntheir remote region to the world with their own hands. Town by town, \nthey built roads and railroads with pick, shovel, and wheelbarrow. \nThese transportation networks, combined with the region's rich soil, \nmade Aroostook County an agricultural powerhouse. The potato industry \nremains an essential part of the Maine economy.\n  During World War II, Presque Isle and Houlton both had U.S. Army \nbases. Houlton had a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers. Presque \nIsle's base was used to launch P-38s, C-47s, and B-17s to the European \ntheater. During the cold war, Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, due \nits proximity to Northern Europe, became a crucial forward post in \nAmerica's defense.\n  The closure of Loring Air Force base in 1994 was a difficult \nchallenge. But the people of Aroostook County responded with the \nqualities that wrote their history: strength, a strong work ethic, and \ndetermination. They are building a new economy with new jobs and \nopportunities. Back then, biathlon was little-known, yet today \nAroostook County is a world-class center for winter sports and Olympic \ntraining and the home to an Olympian in the biathlon.\n  Aroostook's hospitals have become national models for expert and \ncompassionate care in rural regions, particularly for our veterans. \nEducational institutions and industry have joined together to lead the \nway in the development of renewable energy sources. The closed bases in \nHoulton and Presque Isle, and Loring Air Force Base have evolved into \nhubs of commerce and industry.\n  Through the years, Aroostook County has gone by many names--the Crown \nof Maine, the Garden County, the Last Frontier of the East, and, of \ncourse, The County. A more recent addition is the motto of the \nUniversity of Maine at Presque Isle--``North of Ordinary'' is the \nperfect way to describe a place that is truly extraordinary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1363-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1363-S1364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SHAUNA JEAN RINGEL\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding \nwork of Shauna Jean Hill Ringel, who is retiring after 22 years of \nemployment with Madison County, ID.\n  Shauna is a native of St. Anthony, ID. She moved to Rexburg with her \nhusband, Brad, in 1970, and she raised three children, Ryan, Shelli and \nTracy, in Rexburg. After the death of her husband in 1987, Shauna \nworked at Madison School District's Burton Elementary School as the \nschool's secretary. She began working for Madison County in 1992, and \nshe served as a clerk of district court, 7th Judicial District. She \nmoved to the Madison County Clerk's office in 1996, and she worked both \nas deputy county clerk and as Madison County's elections clerk. In \n2004, she joined the planning and zoning office. She has participated \nin emergency management training and helped develop emergency plans for \nMadison County.\n  The community and our State have been fortunate to have benefited \nfrom her devoted assistance that includes significant public service \nand volunteer work. She served as the co-chair of the Madison County \nCentennial Committee and coordinated a year of festivities recognizing \nthe pioneer spirit of current and former residents of Madison County. \nShe is also active in the local chapter of the American Red Cross \nthrough which she has assisted her friends and neighbors in Red Cross \nevacuation centers for flooding and wildfire emergencies. She assists \nfamilies in the Upper Snake River Valley whose lives are disrupted by \nhouse fires. Shauna was also deployed to New Jersey to assist with the \nrecovery after Hurricane Sandy, and she assisted with recovery efforts \nin Montana after devastating wildfires.\n  Shauna is viewed as someone who can be counted on to go the extra \nmile and put the team ahead of herself. She is respected for her \nsteady, loyal and reliable efforts. Madison County Commissioner Kimber \nRicks characterized Shauna as ``a go to' team player. She's always been \nhard working and reliable; always counted on for good judgment and good \nnature; and always that sense of humor that helps so much in tough \nsituations . . . Shauna will be missed, but never forgotten.''\n  Thank you, Shauna, for your outstanding and dedicated service. I hope \nthat retirement affords you more well-deserved time with your friends \nand family, including your children and three grandsons, and \nopportunities to do all the activities you love the most. I \ncongratulate you on your retirement and wish you all the best.\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1364-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING A \nNATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT \nTO THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES POSED \n                 BY THE SITUATION IN THE UKRAINE--PM 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.)

The railroad industry played a \n     vital role in building and developing the United States. This \n     role should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas, Durand, Michigan, is at the historic crossroads of \n     three major railroads and is home to one of the largest \n     surviving train stations in the United States. The existing \n     statuary, structures, and historic railroad equipment at \n     Diamond District Park in Durand make it an ideal location for \n     a National Railroad Memorial; and\n       Whereas, Congressional House Concurrent Resolution No. 50 \n     would designate a National Railroad Monument located in \n     Diamond District Park in historic downtown Durand, Michigan, \n     as the National Railroad Memorial. This recognition would \n     help draw visitors from around the world to the educational \n     programming and exhibits in Durand.

Pueblo was originally launched as a \n     United States Army cargo ship in 1944 but was transferred to \n     the United States Navy and renamed the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1966; \n     and\n       Whereas, The U.S.S. Pueblo was named for the city of \n     Pueblo, Colorado, and the county of Pueblo, Colorado, and was \n     the third ship in the naval fleet to bear the name Pueblo; \n     and\n       Whereas, After leaving Japan in early January 1968 on an \n     intelligence mission, the U.S.S. Pueblo was attacked by the \n     North Korean military on January 23, 1968; and\n       Whereas, According to United States Naval authorities and \n     the crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo, the ship was in international \n     waters at the time of the attack; and\n       Whereas, One crew member of the U.S.S.

Pueblo and her crew; and\n       Whereas, The U.S.S. Pueblo is still in commission in the \n     United States Navy but continues to be held by the North \n     Korean government and is currently a museum in Pyongyang, \n     North Korea: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-ninth \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein: \n       (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly, recognize \n     the bravery and sacrifice of the crew of the U.S.S.

A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of New Mexico requesting the New Mexico Congressional \n     Delegation in Washington, D.C., to vote to support \n     legislation that would remove the deadline for ratification \n     of the Equal Rights Amendment; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                         Senate Memorial No. 2\n\n       Whereas, equal rights for women are not specifically \n     included in the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the rights of women in the United States to \n     receive equal pay for equal work, be protected against \n     domestic violence and have fair work-leave policies and \n     access to the reproductive health care services of their \n     choice, among others, are daily being questioned and \n     restricted; and\n       Whereas, protection of women's rights at present is through \n     a patchwork of existing laws, executive actions and judicial \n     decisions that address individual cases of discrimination one \n     by one as they arise; and\n       Whereas, each or all of these individual existing laws, \n     executive actions and judicial decisions may be ignored, \n     eroded or overturned; and\n       Whereas, an Amendment that would guarantee rights for women \n     that are equal to those of men would provide a fundamental \n     legal remedy against all cases of discrimination based on \n     gender; and\n       Whereas, Resolutions to pass an Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution that would guarantee equal rights for \n     women and men have been introduced into Congress each year \n     since 1923; and\n       Whereas, thirty-five of the thirty-eight states required \n     for the Amendment to become part of the Constitution ratified \n     the Equal Rights Amendment by the deadline of 1982; and\n       Whereas, the deadline for ratification is not in the \n     binding text of the document itself and, in fact, was later \n     extended by another Congress for an additional three years, \n     thus establishing the precedent that Congress has the power \n     to do so; and\n       Whereas, in the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Senate Joint \n     Resolution 39, introduced by Senator Ben Cardin, and House \n     Joint Resolution 47, introduced by Representative Tammy \n     Baldwin, would remove the deadline for ratification of the \n     Amendment so that an additional three States may ratify it; \n     and\n       Whereas, New Mexicans feel justly proud that New Mexico was \n     one of the first states in the union to ratify the Equal \n     Rights Amendment in 1973, and it passed its own Equal Rights \n     Amendment to the Constitution of New Mexico in 1972: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Mexico, That it \n     call upon the New Mexico Congressional Delegation in \n     Washington, D.C., to vote in favor of Legislation that would \n     remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights \n     Amendment so that efforts can proceed to get ratification by \n     the necessary additional three states so that, finally, the \n     guarantee of equal rights for women and men in the United \n     States will become the Law of the Land; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     each member of the New Mexico Congressional Delegation and to \n     the Chief Clerks of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-201.

Res. 376\n\n       Whereas there are more than 3,500,000,000 women in the \n     world today;\n       Whereas women around the world participate in the \n     political, social, and economic life of their communities, \n     play a critical role in providing and caring for their \n     families, contribute substantially to the growth of economies \n     and the prevention of conflict, and, as both farmers and \n     caregivers, play an important role in advancing food security \n     for their communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas on November 15, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry \n     stated: ``Creating opportunities for women is not just the \n     right thing to do. It's also a strategic necessity. Societies \n     where women are safe, where women are empowered to exercise \n     their rights and to move their communities forward--these \n     societies are more prosperous and more stable--not \n     occasionally, but always.'';\n       Whereas on December 19, 2011, the Obama Administration \n     launched the first United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security (referred to in this preamble as \n     the ``National Action Plan'') that included a comprehensive \n     set of national commitments to advance the active \n     participation of women in decision making relating to matters \n     of war and peace;\n       Whereas the National Action Plan states: ``Deadly conflicts \n     can be more effectively avoided, and peace can be best forged \n     and sustained, when women become equal partners in all \n     aspects of peace-building and conflict prevention, when their \n     lives are protected, their experiences considered, and their \n     voices heard.'';\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite proven \n     successes by women in conflict-affected regions in moderating \n     violent extremism, countering terrorism, resolving disputes \n     through non-violent mediation and negotiation, and \n     stabilizing their societies by improving access to peace and \n     security services, institutions, and decision-making venues;\n       Whereas the ability of women to realize their full \n     potential is critical to the ability of a country to achieve \n     strong and lasting economic growth and political and social \n     stability;\n       Whereas according to the International Monetary Fund, \n     ``focusing on the needs and empowerment of women is one of \n     the keys to human development'';\n       Whereas according to the Global Gender Gap Report 2013 \n     published by the World Economic Forum, ``reducing gender \n     inequality enhances productivity and economic growth'';\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific and Cultural Organization, two-thirds of the \n     774,000,000 illiterate people in the world are female;\n       Whereas according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, ``educated women are less likely \n     to marry early and more likely to have smaller and healthier \n     families. They are also more likely to get a job and earn a \n     higher wage.'';\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Children Fund, \n     ``adolescent girls that attend school [are more likely to] \n     delay marriage and childbearing, are less vulnerable to \n     disease including HIV and AIDS, and [are more likely to] \n     acquire information and skills that lead to increased earning \n     power. Evidence shows that the return to a year of secondary \n     education for girls correlates to a 25 percent increase in \n     wages later in life.'';\n       Whereas according to the Food and Agriculture Organization \n     of the United Nations, the majority of women living in rural \n     areas of the developing world are heavily engaged in \n     agricultural labor, yet they receive less credit, land, \n     agricultural inputs, and training than their male \n     counterparts;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank, women own or partly \n     own over one-third of small and medium-sized enterprises in \n     developing countries, and 40 percent of the global workforce \n     is female, yet, women entrepreneurs and employers have \n     disproportionately less access to capital and other financial \n     services;\n       Whereas despite strides in recent decades, women around the \n     world continue to face significant obstacles in all aspects \n     of their lives, including underrepresentation in all aspects \n     of public life, denial of basic human rights, and \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas despite achievements by individual female leaders, \n     women around the world are still vastly underrepresented in \n     high-level positions and in national and local legislatures \n     and governments and, according to the Inter-Parliamentary \n     Union, women account for only 21.4 percent of national \n     parliamentarians;\n       Whereas 1 in 3 women around the world has experienced some \n     form of gender-based violence, and 1 in 4 women has suffered \n     abuse during pregnancy;\n       Whereas according to UN Women, violence against women \n     causes more death and disability for women and girls between \n     the ages of 15 and 44 than cancer, war, traffic accidents, \n     and malaria combined;\n       Whereas on August 10, 2012, President Obama announced the \n     first interagency Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-\n     Based Violence Globally;\n       Whereas violence against women and girls impedes progress \n     in meeting many international global development goals, \n     including efforts to stem maternal mortality and the spread \n     of HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas on October 11, 2013, President Obama stated that \n     the practice of child marriage was a ``threat to fundamental \n     human rights'';\n       Whereas according to the International Center for Research \n     on Women, one-third of girls worldwide are married before the \n     age of 18 and 1 in 9 girls are married before the age of 15;\n       Whereas according to Save the Children, pregnancy-related \n     complications are a leading cause of death among girls \n     between the ages of 15 and 19 in developing countries;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Population Fund, \n     women have access to fewer income-earning opportunities and \n     tend to manage the household and partake in agricultural \n     work, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural \n     disasters and long-term changes in weather patterns;\n       Whereas it is imperative to alleviate violence and \n     discrimination against women and afford women every \n     opportunity to be full and productive members of their \n     communities; and\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future, and a day to recognize the obstacles that women \n     still face in the struggle for equal rights and \n     opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of International Women's Day;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of countries to generate \n     economic growth, sustainable democracy, and inclusive \n     security;\n       (3) recognizes and honors the women in the United States \n     and around the world who have worked throughout history to \n     ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human \n     rights;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic human rights of women\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n     and girls worldwide, and to promoting meaningful and \n     significant participation of women in all aspects of their \n     societies and communities; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/06/senate-section/article/S1368-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2805.

PREVENTING REGULATORY OVERREACH TO ENHANCE CARE \n                   TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (A) The mobile health and mobile application economy was \n     created in the United States and is now being exported \n     globally, with the market expected to exceed $26,000,000,000 \n     by 2017.\n       (B) The United States mobile application economy is \n     responsible for nearly 500,000 new jobs in the United States.\n       (C) Consumer health information technologies, including \n     smart phones and tablets, have the potential to transform \n     health care delivery through reduced systemic costs, improved \n     patient safety, and better clinical outcomes.\n       (D) Clinical and health software innovation cycles evolve \n     and move faster than the existing regulatory approval \n     processes.\n       (E) Consumers and innovators need a new risk-based \n     framework for the oversight of clinical and health software \n     that improves on the framework of the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       (F) A working group convened jointly by the Food and Drug \n     Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and \n     the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information \n     Technology identified in a report that there are several \n     major barriers to the effective regulation of health \n     information technology that cannot be alleviated without \n     changes to existing law.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the President and Congress must intervene to facilitate \n     interagency coordination across regulators that focuses \n     agency efforts on fostering health information technology and \n     mobile health innovation while better protecting patient \n     safety, improving health care, and creating jobs in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the President and the Congress should work together to \n     develop and enact legislation that establishes a risk-based \n     regulatory framework for such clinical software and health \n     software that reduces regulatory burdens, fosters innovation, \n     and, most importantly, improves patient safety;\n       (C) The National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     should be the Federal agency that has oversight over \n     technical standards used by clinical software; and\n       (D) The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in \n     collaboration with the Federal Communications Commission, the \n     National Patient Safety Foundation, and the Office of the \n     National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, \n     should work on next steps, beyond current oversight efforts, \n     regarding health information technology, such as \n     collaborating with nongovernmental entities to develop \n     certification processes and to promote best practice \n     standards.\n       (b) Clinical Software and Health Software.--\n       (1) Definitions.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(ss)(1) The term `clinical software' means clinical \n     decision support software or other software (including any \n     associated hardware and process dependencies) intended for \n     human or animal use that--\n       ``(A) captures, analyzes, changes, or presents patient or \n     population clinical data or information and may recommend \n     courses of clinical action, but does not directly change the \n     structure or any function of the body of man or other \n     animals;
