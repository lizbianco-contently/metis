Mr. President, yesterday I made the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives John Boehner an offer I thought he could not refuse, \nbut he did. House Republican leaders have demanded the Senate join them \nin a conference committee to work out budget differences. That seemed \nlike a good idea to me. That is why Democrats yesterday asked consent \nto do exactly that, go to conference--on anything. You want to talk \nabout spending; you want to talk about health care; you want to talk \nabout agriculture; you want to talk about the post office, it does not \nmatter. We are happy to do so. Our agreement that we proposed to them: \nwhatever you want to talk about.\n  So I formally offered that, first in a letter to the Speaker. I \ntalked to him. Then I came to the floor here and reiterated the offer. \nMy only condition: that the conferees negotiate in the light of day \nwhile the government is open for business. That did not seem too \nunreasonable.\n  To my surprise, the Speaker refused and the Senate Republicans \nobjected. House Republicans truly do not know what they want. They \ncannot take yes for an answer. We have agreed to their budget number, \nwhich we thought should be higher. We agreed to that. They want to go \nto conference. We agreed to that. But they have had trouble agreeing to \nanything for quite some time now.\n  This spring, after years of Republicans loudly longing for a budget \npassed by the Senate, despite already having a budget with the force of \nlaw, we decided: Let's give them their way. We worked hard, led by \nSenator Murray, to have a budget that we completed after 5 o'clock in \nthe morning.\n  We voted on over 100 amendments. Then Senate Democrats, following \nwhat they said--they, the Republicans said they wanted, regular order. \nThey said: Let's go to conference to work out the differences. They \npassed their budget; we passed ours. Guess what. After all of this \nharanguing about having a budget and regular order, they decided they \ndid not like that so well.\n  It was really very difficult to comprehend. When Republicans finally \ngot what they said they wanted, it turned out they did not want it \nafter all. Yesterday, the same story. Republicans asked to go to \nconference on a budget. Democrats agreed. Republicans objected. Those \ntactics truly are back to\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nOrwellian. They believe that if you go east, you are really going west. \nIf you are going north, you are really going south. You are not going \ndown, you are going up. Whatever, obviously, they say does not really \nmean anything in reality.\n  But maybe they really do not know what they want. Maybe they do not \nhave a game plan. It is becoming more apparent every day. One of the \nHouse Republican tea party leaders, a Congressman from Indiana by the \nname of Stutzman, admitted this to one of the Washington newspapers \nyesterday. Here is what he said. Listen to this:\n\n       We are not going to be disrespected. We have to get \n     something out of this.\n\n  Now listen to this, the last phrase of his statement:\n\n       But I don't know what that is.\n       If there is any way I disrespected him, or we disrespected \n     him, we do not want that to happen. We apologize. They want \n     to get something out of this. Well, let's consider that. \n     Except they do not know what they want. It is a little hard \n     to make a deal there.\n\n  Republicans should come to their senses and realize there is more \nthan wounded pride on the line. The longer this Republican government \nshutdown persists, the harder it will be on our economy. I hope they \ncan figure out what it is they want, before the damage to the economic \nrecovery is even more irreversible than they have already created.\n  It is obvious the strain of the self-inflicted shutdown is beginning \nto wear on many Republicans. Pick up the papers today. Listen to the \nnews. There were reports of vicious infighting from yesterday's \nRepublican caucus meeting. This is what one Republican said after the \nmeeting:\n\n       It was very evident to everyone in the room that the junior \n     Senator from Texas does not have a strategy. He never had a \n     strategy and could never answer questions about what the end \n     game was. Just like Stutzman from Indiana--that is the danger \n     of following the tea party, because you are following and you \n     are headed off the cliff. That is where we have been and that \n     is where we already are, trying to get off the cliff that \n     they put us over.\n\n  Tea party Republicans do not really want a way out of the government \nshutdown. I read here direct statements yesterday from one of their \ncandidates--she is a Congressman. She ran for President. She said: \nFinally we've gotten what we want. We've shut down government.\n  So I think the statements I have made about their being anarchists \nare pretty valid. They are glad the government is shut down. They do \nnot believe in government. A government shutdown is the end game for \nthem, obviously. Tea party Republicans do not really want a way out of \nthis government shutdown. They like it the way it is.\n  But in addition to the statement coming from the Republican Senate \ncaucus, there are some rumblings over in the House. More than 20 \nreasonable Republicans in the House have said on the record that they \nare ready to pass a way to fund this government right now.\n  I was not a math major--far from it. But I can count. If those 20 \nreasonable Republicans unite with 200 House Democrats, that is a \nmajority in the House of Representatives. That would end the shutdown \nnow. So I have a message for my mainstream Republican colleagues: If \nyou ever hope to get out of this mess to end this Republican government \nshutdown, get rid of the tea party direction. Work with us. Help us \nreopen the government. We can start negotiations today.\n  As everyone knows, I think, I had a meeting with Leader McConnell, \nSpeaker Boehner, and Leader Pelosi last night at the White House. The \nSpeaker said after the meeting--of course it was obvious during the \nmeeting--the only thing that he cares about is ObamaCare. That is what \nthis is all about. They do not care about anything else.\n  We know what this government shutdown has done to our country \nalready. General Clapper, one of the leaders in our intelligence \ngathering information around the world, has stated that 72 percent of \npeople who work in our intelligence agencies are home watching TV, \nreading a book. They are not at work, protecting us from the bad people \naround the world--and there are lots of them.\n  We have talked about our national parks here. It has really been bad \nfor people coming to Nevada who want to recreate in our parks. But not \nonly for them. It has hurt business in Nevada, as it has around the \ncountry.\n  NIH. We all understand how important it is that people who are sick \nand ill have the ability to have the best care in the world. If you are \nat the end of the line and you are fortunate enough to be able to say: \nWell, maybe there is still another chance; they are doing something \nback in Washington at one of the National Institutes of Health; maybe \nthey can help.\n  Not now. They cannot do it now because of the Republicans.\n  The Centers for Disease Control is not a very glamorous sounding \nname, but that is what it is about, controlling disease. Most of them \nare furloughed. Senator Harkin came on the floor yesterday and talked \nabout a real serious problem. They could not figure out what it was. \nPeople were sick and dying. The Centers for Disease Control figured it \nout. It was because of pomegranate seeds coming from some other \ncountry. They work on these scourges every day because things come up \nthat make people sick. We are in flu season now. They are not working \non that.\n  The second in command in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nCantor, said yesterday: Well, that's okay. We know that there's a lot \nof problems around our country with the shutdown. But we are going to, \none by one, reopen those agencies.\n  It is so obvious. It is so obvious. This is all directed toward \nPresident Obama's signature legislation, ObamaCare. They want to \npiecemeal this and wind up trying to hurt ObamaCare. Even Dr. Coburn \nwho is a medical doctor, never known for being a shrinking violet, has \nsaid: This is not the way to go. ObamaCare is funded, except for maybe \n10 percent.\n  We are willing to sit down and talk about anything they want to talk \nabout in conference. But the government has to open first. It is time \nfor my Republican friends to defy their tea party overlords.\n  Every day that passes the idea of shutting down the government in \norder to repeal ObamaCare is becoming so transparent and so bad for the \ncountry. No one--I mean, it was not very popular for them to do it \nanyway. Every day that goes by it is less popular. Considering that \nonly a handful of Americans supported the strategy, as I said, to begin \nwith, it is a bad sign for them, the Republicans.\n  Millions of Americans have visited Federal marketplace exchanges over \nthe last 3 days. The demand is so high that on some of the Web sites, \nthey crash. This is not unprecedented. Google, when they first started, \nthey experienced the same challenges. State-based exchanges have \nflourished virtually everywhere. Take, for example, my friend the \nRepublican leader's State of Kentucky. More than 100,000 people have \nalready visited the State's health care exchange and Web site. More \nthan 10,000 people have filled out applications for health coverage, \nand more than 3,000 Kentucky families have already enrolled in new \ncoverage. This shows the hunger the American people have to sign up for \naffordable health care.\n\n  We have had Republicans come here and say: Oh, it is so bad for the \njob market. Throughout the press today--and I will only pick a few of \nthem--for example, one out of the New York Times. Speaker Boehner said \nit is job killing; Ted Cruz, it is hurting the American people; Senator \nMcConnell, it is a big reason we are turning into a nation of part-time \nworkers.\n  I am not going to go through all the economists, but they all say the \nsame thing--it doesn't hurt jobs at all. Mark Zandi, of Moody's \nAnalytics--who, by the way, was John McCain's chief economic adviser \nwhen he ran for President--said: I don't see ObamaCare as impacting the \njob market. A man by the name of Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist \nwho worked for President George W. Bush, when asked about how it \naffected the economy: Not a whole lot.\n  There are many more quotes, but we get the picture. When the history \nbooks are written--and they will be written--ObamaCare will be seen as \nthe greatest single step since Medicare to provide fairness to all \nAmericans. The more America learns about the affordable care provided \nin ObamaCare, the more they like it. And the Republicans\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nwould be wise to abandon their impractical request to repeal it. It has \nbeen the law for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7145-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to start this morning with a \npoint that is obvious to me but I think bears repeating: Nobody wants \nthe shutdown. Democrats say they do not want it; Republicans certainly \ndon't want it. We all can agree on at least that. The question at this \npoint is: How do we resolve the issues that truly divide us--that \nreally divide us. The point I have been making all week is simply this: \nThe only thing keeping the government from opening back up is the \nDemocrats' refusal to apply a very simple principle of fairness when it \ncomes to ObamaCare: Let's treat everybody the same. Let's treat \neverybody the same. Basically, all the House is asking for at this \npoint--they wanted a lot more, but all they are asking for at this \npoint--is a level playing field when it comes to ObamaCare. That is \nabout the only thing standing in the way of the government's opening \nback up, and it is a pretty reasonable request. If Washington Democrats \ncan't agree to that, then can they at least join us in making sure that \nveterans programs are funded; that the Honor Flight veterans can visit \nthe World War II Memorial, and that the National Institutes of Health \ncan continue its research? Can we at least agree on that? That is just \nthe right thing to do.\n  Those issues respond directly to the concerns a number of our \nDemocratic colleagues have raised and it is the same thing this \nCongress voted to do a couple of days ago with the brave men and women \nof our military. I hope my friends across the aisle will reflect on the \nefforts of Republicans in the House and allow the Senate to quickly \nvote on all the bills the House sent us last night so we can get the \ngovernment reopened as soon as possible.\n  That said, yesterday's meeting at the White House, frankly, wasn't \nparticularly encouraging. The President basically called us all down \nthere to tell us he is not interested in negotiating. It was \nessentially a negotiation about not negotiating. Now we hear he is off \ncampaigning today in Rockville rather than sitting down to get this \nthing solved, which is certainly disappointing.\n  But here is the good news. A solution isn't that far from reach. As I \nsaid, nobody wants a shutdown, so that is a good start. And it is hard \nto argue with what Republicans are asking for, especially after the \nembarrassing--embarrassing--rollout of the ObamaCare exchanges on \nTuesday. I mean, one of the folks the President had standing behind him \nat the White House tried to log on and sign up for ObamaCare, and after \na couple of unsuccessful attempts, the Post reports she gave up--\nliterally gave up. And here is the quote she gave afterwards: It is not \nso great.\n  Not so great? Some Americans might call that an understatement. You \nwould think the administration would be begging for a delay after \nstories like that. So this should be easy. Congress gets treated the \nsame way as everybody else on the ObamaCare exchanges and individuals \nget the same break the President already handed out to employers, the \nsame break the President has already unilaterally given to employers. \nIt is time for Democrats to start acting responsibly. It is time to \nwork with us and find our way out of this mess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7145-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

RES. 72\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, many of us were stunned this week to \nsee the administration blocking the World War II Memorial. It was a \nreminder to all of us how much we owe the ``greatest generation.'' Last \nweek the Senate unanimously agreed to ensure our troops are paid during \nthe shutdown, and the President correctly signed it into law \nimmediately.\n  Today the House will pass a bill to ensure our veterans--in fact, \nthey have done that--continue to get the services and benefits they so \nrichly deserve. If Democrats are unwilling to fund other parts of the \ngovernment, at the very least they can agree to support our veterans.\n  As the Senator from Texas and the majority leader were just \ndiscussing, I have the first of these unanimous consent requests to \npropound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives H.J. Res. 72, \nmaking continuing appropriations for veterans' benefits for fiscal year \n2014, the measure be read three times and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, my friend \nnotes that no one wants to shut down the government. Obviously, he \ndidn't listen to my statement. We have people who have been saying for \ndays now--Republicans saying--they are glad the government has shut \ndown; they have been waiting for this for years. I have quoted the \nCongresswoman from Minnesota who said that. Congressman Marlin Stutzman \nof Indiana tells us where the tea party is when he said: ``We're not \ngoing to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I \ndon't know what that even is.''\n  So Republicans are throwing one crazy idea or another at the wall in \nthe hope one will stick. They throw out one idea, then come up with \nanother one. And then, I repeat, they hope something will stick on that \nwall, and they do not even know which wall they are throwing it on.\n  The latest plan came from the junior Senator from Texas, which is to \ncherry-pick parts of the government he likes. House Republican Leader \nCantor admitted this strategy. According to the New York Times, this is \nwhat he said when asked: What about those cancer patients who need some \nhelp; what about the disadvantaged kids who want to return to their \nHead Start classes?\n\n       That's coming as well. We are going to take every issue \n     that has come up and put it on the floor.\n\n  He is following Senator Cruz's idea specifically. Senator Cruz is now \njoint Speaker. He lectures the House on occasion, as he does people \nover here.\n  We support veterans and parks and NIH and all these different \nelements of government that are closed, but we also are not going to \nchoose between veterans, cancer research, disease control, highway \nsafety, or the FBI, and we are not going to give a blank check\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\nto the junior Senator from Texas to pick his favorite parts of the \ngovernment on a daily basis. Today it is parks, tomorrow it is NIH, \nmaybe later it will be something else.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I simply wanted to follow up on what he said.\n  If we were to go along with these individual UC requests----\n  Mr. CORNYN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, here is the \nsituation. The junior Senator from Texas wants to fund everything else, \njust not ObamaCare. Here is what one columnist said today--Dana Milbank \nfrom the Washington Post--and I will be quick; I know Senators have a \nlot to talk about here:\n\n       House Republicans continued what might be called the \n     lifeboat strategy: deciding which government functions are \n     worth saving. In: veterans, the troops and tourist \n     attractions. Out: Poor children, pregnant women, and just \n     about every government function that regulates business or \n     requires people to pay taxes. Here are some of the functions \n     not boarding--\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is that an objection?\n  Mr. REID. I will use leader time then, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. So if they are afraid to listen to the things I have to \nsay, they should listen, because the government is closed, and it is \nclosed because they have helped close it. So let's not try to be \ntechnical here. I want to say something and I am going to say it.\n  Continuing the Milbank quote:\n\n       Here are some of the functions not boarding the GOP \n     lifeboats: market regulation, chemical spill investigations, \n     antitrust enforcement, work site immigration checks, \n     workplace safety inspections, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency . . . communications and trade regulation, nutrition \n     for 9 million children and pregnant women, flu monitoring and \n     other functions of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, and housing rental assistance for the poor.\n\n  Here is what else he wrote:\n\n       And that's quite a list that the Tea Party is throwing out \n     of the boat. We need to end the Government shutdown.\n\n  I say, without any reservation, that the key to opening the \ngovernment still remains with the Senate-passed funding resolution that \nwill open the government. We will talk about anything they want to talk \nabout. We have said that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their request be modified as follows: \nThat an amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the joint \nresolution, as amended, be read a third time and passed and the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate and is the clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government. It is something that \nis already over in the House and reportedly has the support of the \nmajority of the Members of the House of Representatives, including at \nleast 20 Republicans, and some report as many as 100.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I object to the previous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend \nthe majority leader, he was speaking about the junior Senator from \nTexas, whom I don't see on the floor at the moment. The request was \nmade by the minority leader, the Republican leader of the Senate, and \nit dealt, quite appropriately, with veterans' benefits. That was the \nwhole purpose of the consent request.\n  I would repeat that I was the one who requested consent that we \nprovide relief for veterans during this shutdown, and the person to \nwhom his speech seems to be directed I don't see on the floor at the \nmoment. But with that, I know we are in the middle of a colloquy here, \nand the Republican whip has the podium now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to raise as a preliminary matter \nunder rule XIX of the Senate Rules, no Senator shall in debate directly \nor indirectly by any form of words impute to another Senator or to \nother Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n  I want to remind all our colleagues that when they talk about Members \nof the Senate who are not on the floor and not here or able to defend \nthemselves, I think if not the letter of the rule, certainly the spirit \nis in jeopardy of being transgressed, and I think we don't want to head \ndown that path.\n  I would point out that we have witnessed, with some dismay, many of \nour World War II veterans being turned away at the World War II \nMemorial here in Washington, DC.\n  A number of these Honor Flights come from my State. There will be one \nthat comes here tomorrow afternoon. I intend to meet them and welcome \nthem to Washington and visit the World War II Memorial with them.\n  These gentlemen and ladies are quite advanced in years, and for many \nof them--like, for example, my father-in-law who landed on Utah Beach \non the second day of the Normandy invasion, his physical health is not \nsuch that he could come. But he would love to come to the Memorial.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will not yield for a question at this time. I will at a \nlater time.\n  He would love to visit the World War II Memorial. Unfortunately, his \nhealth is not such that he can. But those who can are coming to \nWashington. There will be one from Fort Worth coming on Tuesday, and I \nintend to meet them and to welcome them. They should not be turned back \nbecause of this politically concocted government shutdown--one that the \nPresident and the majority leader seem to be enjoying but which is \ncausing a lot of hardship and inconvenience.\n  The House of Representatives has passed a separate piece of \nlegislation that would open the World War II Memorial, along with other \nnational park services. I would note it got 252 votes in the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday, including 23 Democrats. I hope it would \nenjoy the same sort of bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 70, making continuing appropriations for \nNational Park Service operations, which was received from the House; \nthat the measure be read three times and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

RES. 73\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I recognize my colleagues from Missouri \nand South Dakota, who I know also have unanimous consents, and I yield \nto them for those.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.\n  On Monday morning, I was scheduled to be at Washington University in \nSt.\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nLouis, MO, to look at some of their research. A lot of the research NIH \ndoes has been done in our State; one-third of the research for the \nhuman genome project was done in our State.\n  Then, on Tuesday evening, for the fifth year in a row, I was at the \nfundraising event for the Children's Inn at the National Institutes of \nHealth, where families and children can stay while they are there for \ntreatment. This is a private sector event. In spite of everything else \nthat was going on, it was a great event where lots of money was raised \nfor those kids.\n  I said at that event that somebody told me years ago that if \neverybody in your family is well, you have lots of problems. If \nsomebody in your family is sick, you have one problem. The Children's \nInn is one of the places where people help families deal with the one \nproblem they have.\n  But as virtually every Member of this Senate at one time or another \nhas said, the work of the NIH is important. It is important that it \ncontinue. The House yesterday passed a House joint resolution that \nwould continue that work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 73, making continuing appropriations for the \nNational Institutes of Health for the fiscal year 2014; that the \nmeasure be read three times and passed; and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am going \nto make a counteroffer to the Senator from Missouri which is even \nbetter. It is going to open the National Institutes of Health, the \nCenters for Disease Control, and all of the medical research at the \nDepartment of Defense. We are going to make sure all of the medical \nresearch and medical services of the Federal Government in every agency \nat every level are open for business immediately, and the Senator from \nMissouri, by agreeing to this modification, will go way beyond the \nNational Institutes of Health. He is going to be opening all of these \nmedical services.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified as \nfollows: that an amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; that the \njoint resolution, as amended, then be read a third time and passed; and \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate, is a clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government, including the National \nInstitutes of Health, and is something that is already over in the \nHouse and reportedly has the support of a majority of the Members of \nthe House of Representatives. This is an opportunity for the Senator \nfrom Missouri to finally break down this government shutdown and put \nall the medical services of the Federal Government back in business \nimmediately.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest?\n  Mr. BLUNT. Reserving the right to object, I would remind my good \nfriend from Illinois that there was a time when in the Senate we dealt \nwith all of these issues individually--as we should have last year and \ndidn't. There were no appropriations bills on the floor.\n  A continuing resolution is not the best way to do the business of the \ncountry, and I would object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the men and women who serve our Nation in \nthe Guard and Reserve shouldn't be impacted by a partial government \nshutdown.\n  Recently, the House and Senate unanimously passed the pay our \nmilitary first act, which was signed into law by the President this \npast Monday. That bill ensures that Active-Duty military and those who \nsupport them stay on the job regardless of the dysfunction in \nWashington. Congress was right and passed the legislation, and \nPresident Obama was right to immediately sign it into law.\n  Today, the House of Representatives is going to pass H.R. 3230, the \nPay Our Guard and Reserve Act. This bill provides funding to pay Guard \nand Reserve troops who are not currently on Active Duty. Although these \nmen and women currently don't have Active-Duty status, they have \nregularly scheduled training requirements. They stand ready to serve in \noverseas conflicts and to respond to domestic disasters if called upon \nby their country.\n  These men and women proudly serve this country, and they should not \nbe impacted by spending disagreements in Washington. Today the Senate \nhas a chance to give these individuals and their families greater \ncertainty by passing H.R. 3220, as soon as it is received from the \nHouse.\n  I am sorry to hear that the majority and the President have already \nindicated they are going to oppose this and that the President has \nthreatened to veto this legislation. I can't imagine that we would not \ndo for our Guard and Reserve troops what we have already done for our \nActive-Duty troops. I think that is a big mistake.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives H.R. 3230, \nmaking continuing appropriations during a government shutdown to \nprovide pay allowances to members of the Reserve components of the \nArmed Forces; that the measure be read three times and passed; and the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Illinois and \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am going \nto offer to the Senator from South Dakota an even better deal. Not only \nwill we help the reservists, not only will we open the Veterans' \nAdministration, but out of the two million federal workers, 800,000 \nhave been furloughed. There are over a half a million veterans in the \nfederal workforce and a fourth of them are disabled. Now I am going to \ngive the Senator from South Dakota an opportunity to put them all back \nto work immediately, including paying the reservists and everything he \nsuggested.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request of the Senator from South \nDakota be modified as follows: that the amendment which is at the desk \nbe agreed to; that the bill as amended then be read a third time and \npassed; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate. It is a clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government and will put thousands \nof disabled veterans back to work. It is something already in the House \nand reportedly has the support of a majority of the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as the \nSenator from Illinois has already pointed out, that has already passed \nin the Senate. What he is suggesting is already in the House, not being \nacted on.\n  What the Senate can act on is legislation that is being sent from the \nHouse that would ensure that our National Guard and Reserve troops are \ntreated the same way as our Active troops are treated. I think that is \nonly fair and only fitting. These are people who not only respond to \ndomestic disasters but are also involved in conflicts overseas on a \nregular basis.\n  So I would object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard to the \nmodification requested.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the one-half million veteran \nFederal employees, one-fourth of whom are disabled, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining \nin our allocated time?\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I grew up in an Air Force family. My dad \nserved in World War II in the Army Air Corps, and as I have mentioned \non this floor many times, he continued to serve for 31 years in the \nU.S. Air Force.\n  As fate would have it, he was transferred to Tachikawa Air Force Base \nin Japan right after my junior year in high school. So I graduated from \nhigh school in Japan, and I became acquainted with this 17th century \nstylized form of drama and dancing called kabuki.\n  The thing about kabuki is that the audience oohs and aahs as the \nactors demonstrate their great skill at carrying out this stylized form \nof drama and dance. What we have seen on this government shutdown, \ncontrived as it is, is a form of kabuki. We know exactly what is \nhappening.\n  The Senate, under the majority leader, has turned down at least \nfour--and now here today four more--proposals from the House of \nRepresentatives to try to mitigate some of the hardship as a result of \ntheir determination to protect the special congressional carve-out from \nObamaCare--which was tabled the other day at the instance of the \nmajority leader--as well as to deny average Americans the same \nopportunity the President has unilaterally given to employers to delay \nthe implementation of ObamaCare for 1 year when it comes to the \nindividual mandate.\n  That is what the majority has objected to. That is what the majority \nleader in a party-line vote has tabled, and that is the only reason we \nare engaged in a government shutdown--because of their refusal to \naccept those reasonable conditions from the House of Representatives.\n  So this is kabuki as we in America understand it. We all understand \nthe dance. We understand this is a form of drama. But the problem is \nthe American people are suffering either hardship or great \ninconvenience as a result of the unwillingness of the President of the \nUnited States to negotiate and the hard-line ``my way or the highway'' \nposition of the majority party.\n  I ask my colleagues who are on the floor--both of whom served with \ngreat distinction in the House of Representatives--whether they believe \nthe House has acted in good faith, whether they have tried to resolve \nthis impasse by sending over to the Senate reasonable pieces of \nlegislation which, if accepted by the majority, could break this \nimpasse and reopen the Federal Government.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri to respond first.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Let me say to my friend from Texas that until the \nleadership in the Senate changed to the current leadership 7 years ago, \nwe always did appropriations by debating and advancing individual \nthings.\n  The idea that we don't want to debate anything if we don't debate \neverything makes no sense. It is not the way the government should run.\n  I think the House is not only well intended but that their goal is a \nworthy goal. The House of Representatives, led by Republicans beginning \nin 1995, doubled NIH funding in 10 years. My good friend from South \nDakota and I were there for the majority of that 10-year doubling of \nNIH funding.\n  Last year in the Appropriations Committee markup I voted for a bill \nthat would add $1 billion extra to NIH funding. It was defeated in the \ncommittee. This year I voted for a bill that would add almost $1.5 \nbillion of additional NIH funding.\n  This makes a difference in the lives of people. Dr. Francis Collins, \nthe Director of NIH, has estimated that each week there is a shutdown \nhis agency's research hospital would have to turn away an estimated 200 \npatients. He estimated 30 of those patients would be children.\n  I know they took the children and individuals who were coming Monday \nand Tuesday but are now beginning to notify people: If you were \nscheduled to come, we have 4,000 people working and 14,000 people not \nworking. We can't accept you right now.\n  I think this is the right thing to do. It is an easy thing to do, if \nwe would just stand and do it.\n  If we do not oppose NIH--and I do not believe there is a Senator who \ndoes--why don't we continue their funding and do it right now?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I heard the assistant leader on the \nDemocratic side, the majority side, yesterday make what I thought was a \nvery impassioned speech on behalf of access to research that is \nprovided by the NIH for children who are suffering from cancer. I ask \nthe Senator from Missouri, would the bill the House has passed and the \nSenator asked consent the Senate consider address the very same sort of \ncancer research for children the assistant majority leader was arguing \nfor yesterday?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I was impressed by the comments of my friend from Illinois \nyesterday about NIH funding. I am for NIH funding. I have never failed \nto vote for NIH funding. Frankly, I have never failed to vote for an \namendment that would increase NIH funding, as far as I know. I have \nseen it increase dramatically.\n  Opening the doors of that research facility is the right thing to do. \nWe could do it today. I cannot imagine the President would not sign a \nbill that let three-quarters of that workforce go back to work and let \nthe 200 people who will be turned away in the next 7 days be told \ninstead: Come on, be part of this process. We are waiting for you. We \nare here. We are doing the kinds of things your family critically needs \nus to do.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, I know South Dakota \nhas a lot of uniformed military. The Senator has already addressed a \npiece of legislation that has passed the House and come over here. Is \nit the Senator's impression that the House is trying to address some of \nthe hardships--inconvenience in some cases, hardships in others--that \nare caused by the government shutdown? In his experience, are they \nbeing reasonable in demonstrating good faith in trying to break this \nimpasse?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to the distinguished whip, the Senator from Texas, \nhe is exactly correct. The House of Representatives has moved several \npieces of legislation--and will this morning--that address some of what \nwe think are the real needs out there in the midst of a very \nunnecessary government shutdown. Some of those have been mentioned here \non the floor this morning. I would point out two in addition: taking \ncare of our Guard and Reserve troops as we have our Active-Duty \ntroops--it is really important. All of us have Guard units with \nfamilies that have been impacted. The House of Representatives has \ngiven us an opportunity to do that.\n  The other thing I would mention, I spoke yesterday about President \nObama's refusal to open the World War II Memorial for veterans on their \nHonor Flight. He rejected their appeal to visit the memorial dedicated \nto their service, an opportunity to honor their brothers in arms, many \nof whom died in that great war. I am pleased that the veterans--not \nones to be defeated--breached the barricades and took their memorial.\n  I have had the opportunity--my father is a World War II Navy fighter \npilot--to be able to show him some of these memorials we have, \nmonuments here in Washington, DC, particularly the one that was erected \nin honor of his generation.\n  They should not be denied the honor of visiting these monuments to \ntheir service.\n  When we are thinking about that generation of Americans, we had \nSenator McConnell put forward an opportunity today to address the needs \nof our veterans. We found out that even though the veterans budget is \nadvance-funded by a year, there are certain elements of that budget \nthat are going to run out of money. We want to make sure those of the \ngreat generation that served our country, defended our country around \nthe world, have access to the programs and the benefits that have been \nassured and promised to them.\n  I think it is unconscionable, unacceptable that we not agree to allow \nthose services to continue to be funded. I am very disappointed to see \nour colleagues on the Democratic side resist and object to that motion \nhere this morning. If anything, if any group of people in this country \ndeserves to have the respect and also the promises honored, the \npromises we made to them, it is those American veterans.\n  If we look at the last shutdown in 1995 and 1996, President Bill \nClinton\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\ncame to the table and supported legislation to protect veterans \nprograms. I hope we could get some cooperation from our colleagues on \nthe other side to do that today, I say to my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I ask how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senators from South Dakota and from Missouri \nfor making very important points. I know the leaders--bicameral \nleadership of the House and the Senate--were called to the White House \nlast night, at which time Senator McConnell, the distinguished \nRepublican leader, reported here on the floor, the President announced \nhe was not going to negotiate. Bizarre. Why would the President call \nthe Republican and the Democratic leadership to the White House to say: \nI am not going to negotiate. Is it for a photo opportunity? Is it to \ngive sort of some false impression that he is actually rolling up his \nsleeves and is engaged in the business of government to which he was \nelected?\n  I hope the President reconsiders leaving town while the government is \nshut down, in the words of the majority leader, and leaving for a trip \nto Asia while, as our distinguished Democratic colleagues just pointed \nout, many federal employees are furloughed during this government \nshutdown. My hope would be that the President would cancel his trip and \nthat he would stay here in Washington, as we are, trying to solve this \nproblem and break this impasse.\n  These proposals we have made here today, many of which have been \nvoted on by the House of Representatives in a bipartisan fashion, are \ndesigned to do exactly that--to break this impasse. Yet what is the \nresponse of the White House to some earlier proposals? They sent out a \nStatement of Administration Policy saying: If it is passed, I would \nveto it. That is President Barack Obama. How is that rolling up your \nsleeves and being engaged in the job you got elected to? He earned it. \nHe was elected twice as President of the United States. But it is not \nleadership to convene a meeting of Republican and Democratic leadership \nat the White House and say: I am not going to negotiate. And by the \nway, I am leaving town on Saturday. Good luck.\n  That leads me to conclude that the President and his party are \nactually enjoying this shutdown because they see this as partisan \npolitical gain. They read the public opinion polls, just as we do, but \nI do not think the American people should be fooled and they are not \nbeing fooled. House Republicans and Republicans in the Senate have made \nmany reasonable proposals, only to be given the Heisman, and the \nPresident is not negotiating and the government remains shut down.\n  The President needs to stay here, demonstrate leadership, continue to \nmeet with leaders on both sides of the Capitol, and we can break \nthrough this impasse, get the money for children's cancer research, get \nthe money for the troops, and open the World War II Memorial to the \nHonor Flights coming from Texas and around the country. We can do this. \nThey call it self-government for a reason. We all ought to be working \ntogether toward that end.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Before \nhe leaves the floor, I would like to say to my friend from Texas--and \nhe is my friend--I was at the World War II Memorial yesterday with an \nHonor Flight from Illinois. There were no barricades stopping them from \ngoing to the memorial, so the characterization on the floor that the \nveterans were stopped is not true, it is not accurate. I hope the \nrecord will reflect that.\n  The reason there is any question about access relates to the shutdown \nof the U.S. Federal Government, the shutdown of this government. We \nhave passed a continuing resolution, which is a spending bill, to allow \nthe government to function for 6 weeks. We passed it here in the \nSenate. The House Speaker, Mr. Boehner, refuses to call it for a vote.\n  There is a majority, Democratic and Republican, ready to vote for it, \nready to reopen the government, no questions asked about the NIH, about \nthe barricades at the World War II Memorial which were there \noriginally. All these questions will be resolved. Three times this \nmorning the Republicans have objected to bringing that measure up for \nanother vote in the Senate. That worries me.\n  Let me say one other thing about the Affordable Care Act, the \ninsurance exchanges. This morning--I am sorry he has left the floor--\nthis morning, this is what the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, said \nabout the insurance exchanges:\n\n       Embarrassing, embarrassing rollout over ObamaCare exchanges \n     on Tuesday. I mean, one of the folks the President had \n     standing behind him at the White House tried to log on and \n     sign on to ObamaCare, and after a couple of unsuccessful \n     attempts, the Post reports, she gave up.\n\n  I have good news for the Senator from Kentucky. When you look across \nthe United States of America at the exchanges that have been opened, he \nshould hold as a matter of pride the fact that the Commonwealth of \nKentucky is one of the most successful insurance exchanges in America. \nListen to the report we just received this morning from the secretary \nof the Governor's Cabinet for Health, Audrey Haynes, in Kentucky. The \nKentucky insurance exchange, which the Republicans want to close down, \nhas had 117,000 unique visitors, 109,000 prescreenings to determine \nqualifications for health insurance, and 13,000 Kentuckians--already, \nin 2 days--already 13,000 have applied for health coverage and 8,000 \nare now complete.\n  This is great news. They are leading the country. Kentucky should be \nso proud. Mr. President, 122 small businesses have begun applications, \n3,500 new families have been enrolled, and there have been 15,000 calls \nto the call center.\n  Apologize that we have not been able to process these as quickly in \nany State, but the overwhelming positive public response across America \nto what they call ObamaCare is an indication of pent-up demand in \nKentucky, Illinois, and every State for people to finally get access to \nhealth insurance.\n  I see others are on the floor to speak. I want to say to my friends \non the other side of the aisle, please reopen this government. We can \nsit down and negotiate--we should--about important issues, the issues \nthe Senator from Washington addressed in the budget. Let's address all \nthese issues. Let's do it in a bipartisan, thoughtful, adult manner. \nTelling 800,000 Federal employees to go home is really unfair to them. \nIt is unfair to this Nation. It doesn't speak well of us.\n  The last point I will make is this. I left the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing this morning. Wendy Sherman is Assistant \nSecretary of State. She is widely respected. We were talking about the \nthreat of Iran as a nuclear power. She said to us--and she said it with \nsome regret--that the government shutdown is hurting our efforts to \nstop the development of nuclear weapons in Iran. How? Ninety percent of \nthe employees at the Department of Treasury office responsible for \nmonitoring Iran so that the sanctions are there and tough and bring \nthem to the bargaining table--90 percent of those Federal employees \nhave been furloughed at the Department of Treasury because the \ngovernment shut down; and 72 percent--almost three-fourths--of all the \nmen and women at our intelligence agencies in a civilian capacity have \nbeen laid off as well because of the government shutdown. These are men \nand women charged with watching the enemy every minute of every day so \nwe never have another 9/11. This is one of the aspects of the \ngovernment shutdown that literally jeopardize the security of the \nUnited States of America.\n  For goodness' sake, let's put this government back in business before \nthe end of this day.\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nreminding all of us of the many people and communities and the economy \nin this country that are being hurt today because of the tea party's \ninsistence, in the House of Representatives, that this government \nremain shut until ObamaCare is defunded or eliminated. I am frustrated, \nas is every American today, thinking why can't our government work? Why \ncan't people come together?\n  As chair of the Budget Committee, I have been out here 19 times since \nlast March saying: Let's go to conference committee and resolve our \ndifferences, and 19 times Members of the Republican Party have said no. \nThey have not allowed us to go talk.\n  Now we find ourselves in a mess. The government is shut down. \nFamilies are hurting and communities are hurting and our economy is \nhurting. What is the response now of the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives and here on the floor? Oops, we didn't mean to hurt \neverybody. We have a few friends we are going to take care of.\n  I have listened to the debate this morning where our Republican \ncolleagues came out and asked unanimous consent to take care of a few \nof their favorite parts of government so that they can say they helped. \nI am as passionate as anyone about our veterans. There is not one \nMember of this Senate who does not fully support our military and our \nveterans. No one questions that, but I take a backseat to no one in \nadvocating for our veterans--as the former chair of the veterans' \ncommittee, as the daughter of a World War II veteran who earned a \nPurple Heart and was one of the first soldiers in Okinawa.\n\n  As a young woman myself during the Vietnam war, I worked in the \nSeattle veterans hospital with men and women my age who were coming \nhome from the Vietnam war. I have done so much work on this floor, as \nwell as worked with hundreds of thousands of our veterans who are \ncoming home from the current conflicts, and helped to pass legislation \nto make sure they have what they need, so we don't just say thank you, \nbut we serve them well.\n  I take a backseat to no one on veterans. I can tell you one thing \nabout our military and our veterans that everyone here knows: They are \nthe least selfish among us. They have volunteered to serve our country. \nThey have given up for every American, and they have a motto that they \nleave no one behind. I can't imagine that our veterans are out there \ntoday saying: Take care of me with this small amendment and leave \nbehind the children who are in our Head Start programs or the moms and \ndads who are dependent on nutrition programs in this country or the \n800,000 employees who are sitting at home today scared to death about \nhow they are going to pay their bills because this government is shut \ndown.\n  We have an obligation and a responsibility to solve the problems in \nfront of us. They are widespread in terms of our differences with our \nRepublican colleagues, but we don't do them any favors by shutting off, \nclosing our arms and saying: We are not going to talk about it. We do \nit by going to conference, and we do it by working together. We don't \ndo it by shutting out the lights across this country on our government.\n  In front of the House today is a solution. It is the Senate-passed \nbill that is supported by a majority in the House and a majority in the \nSenate as well and would pass today if it were brought up. With that \nvote, we could open our government, put people back to work, and then \nwe would go to conference, work out our agreements in the way our \nchildren expect us to do.\n  Let's be an example as adults to families and young people across \nthis country that when there is a disagreement, all parties involved \nwork together at a conference table and set aside their differences and \nfind a solution for the country. It cannot be done by saying: I'm not \ngoing to let anybody go to work until I get my way, which is what the \nHouse of Representatives is doing.\n  We can get this done. As I talked about yesterday, I am a former \npreschool teacher, and I have seen this kind of activity before. We \nhave all seen our kids make a mess in their room, and then say: Gosh. \nHow did that happen? That is what we are hearing from the other side \ntoday: Well, gee, how come we haven't passed any appropriations bills? \nWow, if we had a budget done, we wouldn't be here.\n  Why has that happened? Because time after time--and the chairwoman of \nthe Appropriations Committee is here--when we have tried to get our \nwork done, we have been blocked by the very same tea party Republicans \nwho today have put us into this shutdown and said: My way or the \nhighway; either repeal ObamaCare or this country hurts.\n  That is not what we should be doing. Let's tell our veterans, our \nmilitary, our Head Start moms, our 800,000 employees, and everybody in \nthis country: We are a country that can work. We are at work. Let's \nopen our doors, pass legislation in the House, and then we will work \nout our disagreements. As hard as it is, we can do that.\n  I hope that is the focus we have today. I say to Speaker Boehner: \nBring up the bill, pass it, and allow us to get back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nineteen minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in a twofold role. No. 1, I \nam here under my constitutionally designated responsibility as the \nSenator from Maryland, duly elected and duly certified. I love \nrepresenting Maryland. We have 5\\1/2\\ million of the most wonderful, \npatriotic, hard-working, philanthropic, community-oriented people you \ncan have.\n  I also love representing Maryland because in my State we have one of \nthe largest concentrations of civilian agencies in America. They have \nwonderful names such as the National Institutes of Health, and the \nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology that helps to set the \nstandards that enable the private sector to be able to develop the \nproducts they can sell around the world. We are home to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. We are home to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission that looks at a variety of things from children's toys to \nthe safety of our mattresses to make sure they are not flammable. I \ncould go on listing those agencies: the Census Bureau, the National \nWeather Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, which helps to keep the \nseafood industry safe and operational.\n  I have a lot of Federal employees, and they are asking me: What are \nthey doing? What I am telling them is that the other side--one faction \nin one party in one House of government--is prohibiting a reopening of \nour government because of their failure to take up the Senate \ncontinuing funding resolution, which would reopen government for 6 \nweeks while we work out our fiscal problems.\n  Their solution is to do this piecemeal. Piecemeal does not work. We \ncannot do this one agency at a time.\n  Weren't we proud of our World War II veterans and how plucky and \nspunky they were when they essentially broke the line to be able to see \na memorial in their honor? Absolutely. When the National Park Service \nput that ban up around it, they were operating under the orders of what \na shutdown is. Now, unofficially, that World War II museum is open. But \nwhile we say, aren't we proud of our veterans--Yes. Don't blame the \nNational Park Service for closing the World War II memorial. Blame the \nothers for shutting down government. Our veterans--who wanted to see \nthe memorial which salutes them, the greatest generation who fought \nWorld War II--should not have to worry about their own government.\n  Then the other side says: Well, we are going to fund veterans' \nbenefits. We cannot fund veterans' benefits without reopening Social \nSecurity and the IRS. I have looked and investigated and worked with my \ncommittee on why the veterans had a backlog for disability benefits. \nOne of the ways claims are processed is they not only have to get what \nthe veteran says, but they have to get paperwork from the Social \nSecurity Administration and from the Internal Revenue Service to be \nable to process the claim.\n  They can beat the drum, raise the flag, sound the bugle all that they\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nwant, to say they want to fund veterans' benefits, but unless the \nSocial Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service are \nreopened, they are still placing our veterans at a disadvantage. We \nneed to reopen the whole government.\n  While they are doing their piecemeal approach, they are so busy \nshowing off and trying to show their pro-defending America stance--they \npassed a bill to make sure the military gets paid. Sure, what American \nwould not want our troops in harm's way to get paid? We are for that. \nBut they were so fast and so facile and so showbiz, they forgot the \nNational Guard.\n  Now they are coming up with a piecemeal approach to add the National \nGuard. I love the National Guard. We are the home of the fighting 29th. \nThey were heroes in World War II, and they have been heroes in every \nwar since then. I want to see the National Guard helped, but they are \nkind of Johnny-come-latelies to the piecemeal approach because in their \nfast-track, showbiz, showoff approach, they forgot the National Guard. \nOh, wasn't that a cool thing to do.\n  I support what Senator Reid just did on each and every one of those \npiecemeal bills, to add the continuing funding resolution to open all \nof government. Over the last few days we have shamed them into thinking \nabout the National Institutes of Health. I love the National Institutes \nof Health. It is in my State. Every day people go to work there to find \ncures for the dread diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism, not only \nfor the American people here but also around the world. In a few weeks \nwe will be racing for the cure. Let's race to open government.\n  In their disdain for civilian agencies, NIH was closed down, but now \nthey are coming up with a piecemeal approach to reopen NIH. Do I want \nNIH open? Absolutely. Over 70 percent of the people who work there have \nbeen laid off. Last year NIH announced--because of its research and \nwork with wonderful academic centers and our private sector to develop \nbiotech and pharmaceutical products--that cancer rates in the United \nStates were reduced by 15 percent. With all of that work, they have now \nbeen furloughed.\n  Some might say: Senator Barb, do the piecemeal. I would love to. But \nif NIH workers were here, they would say: If you reopen us, it is a \nhollow opportunity unless you open the FDA. We do the basic research at \nour institutes, but somebody has to take that research and make use of \nit in other medical devices, biotech products, or pharmaceuticals. They \nthen go through clinical trials because in this country we want to be \nsure that whatever you put on your body or in your mouth to help you is \nsafe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration does that.\n  We can do lots of research, and have brilliant ideas that could lead \nto new and credible solutions for people in pain, agony, and suffering, \nbut unless we can put it into clinical trials and have it go to the \nFDA, it is a hollow opportunity. If we're going to reopen NIH, we have \nto reopen the FDA. And guess what. The Food and Drug Administration is \nfurloughed. We pay a good part of the FDA through fees, such as \npharmaceutical fees and medical device fees. But guess what. During the \nshutdown, the government is prohibited from collecting the fees that it \nis owed.\n  What is this? This is showbiz politics. This is not pragmatic \nsolutions.\n  We need to reopen government--reopen the entire government--so it can \ndo the job we have authorized them to do, and have the men and women \nwho do that job be able to come back to work. That is why Senator Reid \nhas--instead of cherry-picking individual items--offered the \ncomprehensive solution that would reopen our government.\n  This is not only affecting government workers because government \nworkers actually affect the economy. Right this very minute, the \nPresident has been in Rockville, MD. I would have loved to have joined \nhim this morning, but I wanted to be here at my duty station. The \nPresident was at Rockville Pike, which is a road in Montgomery County \nthat has some of the greatest civilian agencies in the world clustered \naround it.\n  He was going to visit the Luis family. They are a minority, woman-\nowned asphalt contractor. They are a wonderful family and an American \nsuccess story. They came to this country with just a little money in \ntheir pocket but with big dreams in their hearts to have freedom and \nthe opportunity to open a business. They opened an asphalt contracting \nbusiness which gets most of its business from local, State, and the \ngovernment for roads. They are the infrastructure people. Not coming up \nwith a way to keep our government open, cancel sequester, and move \nlegislation to fund our physical infrastructure is dramatically \naffecting them.\n  Around Rockville Pike, there are several agencies, and I have already \nsaid their names: The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. That is affecting businesses up and down Rockville Pike. \nPeople aren't buying their groceries, they are not buying gas. I am \ngoing to say more about that in a little while.\n\n  Remember that Social Security agency I talked about? It is in a \nneighborhood called Woodlawn in Baltimore. Nine thousand--nine \nthousand--Social Security workers in Baltimore and around the country \nhave been furloughed. Right near them is the CMS agency which also \nlooks out for our Medicare.\n  A few blocks from Social Security is the FBI field office. Those FBI \nagents are on the job--on the job--but they are being paid with IOUs. \nDo my colleagues know that because of what we have had to do with our \nbudget they don't even have gas for the FBI cars? In a recent book \ncalled ``Voices From The Field,'' the FBI agents have spoken out about \nwhat is happening to them; that when they get in their car to chase a \nbad guy or gal, they have to pay for their own gas. What kind of \ngovernment is this, with all that pomp and strut, the ridicule of our \nFederal employees? Now this shutdown is humiliating our country and \nhumiliating the people who work for our government, and so on.\n  Across this Nation and in my own State, because of thousands of \nFederal employees being furloughed or paid in IOUs, businesses are \nhurting. I am the daughter of a small business owner. My father owned a \nsmall grocery store. I am the granddaughter of a woman entrepreneur--a \nwonderful woman of Polish heritage who opened a Polish bakery to be \nable to help her family. Every day they said, ``Good morning, can I \nhelp you?'' I know what it is like to be in the retail food business, \nand I understand what it is like when your customers are facing the \nfact that they are unemployed. All of these, mom-and-pop stores to the \nlarger agencies, are being affected.\n  The government shutdown threatens our progress. We know in 1995 and \nin 1996, it cut our gross domestic product. The shutdown can cost our \neconomy as much as $10 billion a week.\n  Every week the Small Business Administration, because it is shut \ndown, can't process loans or give technical assistance to small \nbusinesses. The International Trade Association, which helps our people \nsell products around the world--and what is left of our manufacturing \nsector in Maryland has told me how important our foreign commercial \nservice officers are--is shut down.\n  The Department of Labor processes applications for visas, for farms, \nfor seafood processors as in my own State. Businesses typically file \nfor visas 2 or 3 months in advance. Because of the shutdown, it is \ngoing to affect everybody from citrus farmers in the South to those \npeople who have New England ski resorts. People might say, Oh, that is \na Gucci job. A Gucci job in a New England ski resort? I don't think so. \nIt is very important to Vermont and New Hampshire and the citrus \nfarmers down South.\n  We have to reopen the government. The way we reopen the government is \nnot by a piecemeal approach but by the House taking up the Senate \nresolution.\n  I have a lot more to say, and I will say it during the day today. I \nknow my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, is on the floor. He \nis a member of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Defense \nauthorization committee. He is a staunch defender of people. He has \nbeen so outspoken on the need for student loans. He has also been so \noutspoken on the need for energy assistance for poor people with the \ncoming winter. He is a defender of America, a graduate of West Point, \nand he has been a defender of the little guy\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\nand the little gal who should have a government on their side. I want \nto make sure he has a chance to speak, and I will be back later on to \nspeak on the floor again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me commend the chairwoman for her \nextraordinary leadership in so many different ways, including her \narticulate explanation of the crisis we face at the moment and her \ncompelling argument that a piecemeal approach to resolving the \ngovernment shutdown will not work, since the pieces are so critically \ninterrelated.\n  I rise to speak about this government shutdown as well. Today is day \nthree of the Republican government shutdown, and it seems increasingly \nclear that Speaker Boehner is trying to drag this out long enough to \nmerge the shutdown with brinkmanship over whether to pay our Nation's \nbills. This attempt to gut existing law and put the full faith and \ncredit of the United States at risk is no way to run a country. If we \nare dragged into the commingling of the Republican government shutdown \nand the Republican proposals to default on our debt, we could be facing \na catastrophic financial situation that would affect not just \ngovernment operations but markets worldwide, and that is not something \nwe should even contemplate. So we have to move very quickly to a \nresolution of this manufactured crisis.\n  When I hear a discussion of what is going on, the words I hear used \nare words such as ``reckless,'' ``irresponsible,'' and, indeed, words \nmuch worse than these all across this country. The bottom line is the \naverage American is fed up. They expect government to open, to serve \nthem, to perform its basic function--not selective functions but its \nfull range of functions.\n  Survey after survey notes two simple things: No. 1, the government \nshould be reopened for business. No. 2, the effort by some to connect \nthe Affordable Care Act to funding the government should be ceased. \nThese aren't the views of one particular political party; they are the \nviews of a very, very large majority of Americans, and I share their \nsentiment. The government should not be closed. The Affordable Care Act \nshould not be tied to reopening the government.\n  There is a very simple solution here: Pass the short-term, continuing \nresolution at current levels of spending so then we can begin the \nprocess of resolving the budget impasse. Let me say that again: Pass \nthe bill that funds the government at the current level of spending. \nDoing so means keeping, in effect, the sequester--something that many \non the other side of the aisle have demanded. Frankly, I would hope \nthat having done that, we could then seriously get into discussions \nwith the leader and with the chairwoman on our side about how we create \na budget for 2014 that does away with the sequester. This was inherent \nin the budget resolution which I supported last March.\n  Regrettably, the tea party has refused to allow negotiations on the \nbudget, even though we heard day in and day out complaints by our \ncolleagues in a previous session of Congress that we need a budget, we \nneed a budget, we need a budget. Well, we produced a budget, and now we \nare being blocked.\n  What is happening instead of moving to meaningful, comprehensive \nbudget negotiations is that we are in a government shutdown, and now \nthe Republicans are trying to extricate themselves from this \nmanufactured crisis, created by their own hands, by sending over \npiecemeal bills to fund preferred and selected agencies of the \ngovernment. As the chairwoman pointed out, it doesn't work, because the \ngovernment is related. NIH can make discoveries, but if the FDA is not \nauthorized and operating so they can approve their use by people, it \ndoesn't work. We can't disassociate these things.\n  We saw today in Rhode Island about 26,500 women and children might \nlose their WIC benefits, their nutrition benefits, their support. \nIgnoring them and helping others is not going to benefit this country. \nIn fact, it will contribute, I think, to decline.\n  We have looked at the National Guard, veterans' benefits, and \nnational parks. Those are all worthy elements, but they are not the \nentire range of elements we must perform. I believe the other side is \ntrying to come up with some type of coherent argument for their \nactions. Is this about the debt? We have made progress in reducing our \ndeficit. Because of actions we have taken, we have reduced projected \ndeficits over 10 years by $2.4 trillion. Do we have to do more? Yes. \nBut we have to do it in a current, thoughtful way.\n  Is it about the sequester? Well, let's talk about the sequester. \nLet's talk about it in the context of a budget and appropriations bills \nfor 2014.\n  Is it about the Affordable Care Act? Well, it has begun. There has \nbeen a huge demand in the first few days and it is working through \nproblems. And there will be problems. There is no major initiative of \nthis kind that is rolled out by any business or any government that \ndoesn't have issues, and those issues will be dealt with.\n  What is very clear, though, is closing the government and then, in \nsort of an ad hoc way, opening up parts is no way to operate. It is \nunfair to the American people who aren't getting services they expect \nand deserve. Also, it's unfair to furloughed Federal employees at the \nDefense Department and elsewhere--not just the Defense Department but \nall Departments--some of them are working without the certainty that \nthey indeed will be paid.\n  There is a simple way to avoid this situation. The House should stop \npreventing an up-or-down vote on the Senate's continuing resolution and \nopen the government. The Speaker can call up that vote in less than an \nhour, get it on the floor, and go ahead and reopen our government. Then \nreopen the thoughtful, careful, collaborative discussions about where \nwe are going in terms of our budget, in terms of our deficit, in terms \nof serving the American people.\n  I have heard a lot of talk such as: Oh, we have to have a lot of \nnegotiations and compromise, et cetera. I have supported legislation I \nbelieve in strongly. I have opposed legislation, but I don't think I \nhave ever stood up and said it is either my way or nothing happens. \nThat is not the way to responsibly represent the people of America. It \nis the give-and-take of principled compromise. Sometimes there is \nlegislation that reaches this floor that I can't support, but I think \nin a democracy it is the majority, ultimately--after we go through our \nprocedural convolutions--it is the majority ultimately that prevails.\n  There is a strong sense, as reflected in the newspapers, that the \nmajority of the House of Representatives wants this situation resolved. \nThey want all government agencies opened. And through the procedural \nvotes on this side, it is very clear that our colleagues were willing \nto allow a majority vote to come to this floor, which carried. So the \nmajority of the House and the Senate are with the American people. We \njust have to get the leadership of the House to get with the American \npeople.\n  We have to talk about some of these serious issues, but I think the \nbest place to do so, in my view, is in the context of budget \nnegotiations, and we have been repeatedly blocked from bringing the \nbudget to conference. In fact, many of our Republican colleagues--and I \nwill give them credit; many of them have stood up and said we have to \ngo to the budget negotiations in the conference. Senator McCain said, \nfor example, ``It's not the regular order for a number of Senators, a \nsmall number, a minority within a minority here, to say they will not \nagree to go to conference.'' That is what is happening. It is happening \nin terms of a minority of Republican Members in the House who are \ndemanding that this Speaker not relent on this government shutdown, and \nit is happening here to a degree with respect to the conference \ncommittee on the budget. We have to go ahead and do our job.\n  We have had colleagues on the other side talk about how the closure \nhas detrimental effects. The Member who represents Yosemite National \nPark was very sad it was closed. I am also distressed that it is \nclosed. I chair the subcommittee that appropriates funding for our \nnational parks. We do our best to maintain the parks, to make sure we \nsupport those individuals who work for the Park Service. I understand \nthe impact is not just within the confines of the park, it is the \nbusinesses all around the park. That is\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\nwhat we said a week ago. That is what I said a week ago, asking, in \nterms of our deliberations, that we pass a continuing resolution. So \nthis should come as no surprise to those people who voted against \nkeeping the government open.\n  But this is not just about the value of a national park. It is about \nall the functions the government performs. It is about those women and \nchildren who receive benefits through the WIC Program. It is about \nthose Federal workers who are furloughed who cannot perform their \nduties. We have to go ahead and open up our government. We have to \nrecognize what a democracy ultimately is all about: It is the will of \nthe American people--the majority of the American people--that has to \nbe reflected, ultimately, by the Representatives and the Senators.\n  Again, I think it is very clear, except for the bottleneck at the \nHouse leadership, that the majority of the House and the majority of \nthe Senate want this government to open up. Let's do it. We need a \nvote. We have to stop relitigating the Affordable Care Act. It passed. \nIt was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. It is open for \nbusiness starting on October 1, with significant interest by the \npublic. There were 3,000 page-hits per minute in Rhode Island as it \nopened up on October 1, which I am told by the technologists is an \namazing number. There were 2,000 calls to our call center--people who \nwere looking for insurance, to buy it in a private marketplace, which \nis the core of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So we have to move forward. If we do not move forward, SBA lending is \neffectively cut off, so small business men and women, who are \nstruggling to get their businesses going, to keep them going, and hire \nAmericans, will not have that ability to receive support from the SBA.\n  We need, as they say--and everyone has become familiar with this \nterm--a clean CR that opens everything up. If we do not, then we know \nthe impact is going to be dramatic.\n  In 2011, economists estimated that a shutdown would cost the economy \n0.2 percent of GDP each week. And it accumulates.\n  Looking back to 1995 and 1996, when a Republican House also shut down \nthe government for 27 days, it reduced GDP growth by roughly 0.5 \npercent. Those are jobs, not just statistics. Those are lots of jobs \nand confidence in our economy. If we do not have jobs and confidence, \nthen we are not doing our job and we are not fulfilling what we were \nsent here by the people to do: grow the economy, give us work, give us \nconfidence that you can at least perform the basic functions of \ngovernment.\n  Now we have to move forward. I am uncertain as to how long this will \ncontinue to fester. We should do this immediately. As I said, \nprocedurally the House--and I had the privilege to serve there for 6 \nyears--can bring this continuing resolution up on very short notice and \nget, which I believe they have, the majority votes they need to pass \nit. That should be done. Then we can sit down and work again--work hard \non those issues that face us in the context of budget negotiations and \na conference and also recognize that while we are here involved in this \nmanufactured crisis, the world is moving. The world is moving in ways \nin which we cannot be so preoccupied that we do not sense: foreign \naffairs issues in Syria, foreign affairs issues across the globe; \ninternational economic issues; future competitive issues with other \neconomies. While we are fixated and focused on this manufactured \ncrisis, which is completely unnecessary, we are not doing the important \nwork, we are not anticipating the problems that are developing right \nnow in the world or in our economy, we are not investing in jobs and in \njob creation, we are not looking ahead. We have to do that also.\n  I would urge a quick, decisive vote on a continuing resolution so we \ncan get back to the business of leading America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, let me second the very powerful and \neloquent remarks just made by my colleague from Rhode Island: that we \nmust vote, we need to have a vote in the House of Representatives to \ngive moderate Republicans the opportunity to put the Federal Government \nback to work in the service of Americans and keep America--in the \nprivate as well as public sector--at work so they can meet the \nobligations of their families.\n  We have developing a situation in America where more and more the \nripple effects of this shutdown will affect private employees, not just \nthe Federal and government workers who are told to go home and told \nthey cannot do their jobs.\n  As I have said repeatedly, we need to end the hostage-taking tactics \nby one small faction of one party in one House of this branch of \ngovernment. The ripple effects of this shutdown are beginning to grow \nacross America.\n  Last night, United Technologies, the largest employer in Connecticut, \nannounced it has been forced to furlough thousands of employees, \nstarting initially with more than 1,500 at its Sikorsky facility in \nStratford, which makes Black Hawk helicopters for our Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines, and Special Forces. Thousands of other jobs may be at \nrisk at Pratt & Whitney and at defense manufacturers all cross the \nNation.\n  This political gamesmanship and budget brinkmanship has stopped \nproduction of the Black Hawk helicopters, an iconic symbol to all our \nservicemembers that help is on the way. They are the ones that \ntransport troops into combat, rescue the wounded, and deliver supplies \nto the most inaccessible and inhospitable parts of the Earth. Black \nHawk helicopters are vital to our national defense. Why is the \nproduction line at Sikorsky being shut down? Because 45 Federal \nemployees who work for the Defense Contract Management Agency have been \nsent home as a result of this shutdown--sent home by one small group of \nrightwing extremist ideologues in the House of Representatives, one \npart of this Congress, one branch of the government--and those 45 \nemployees who work for the Defense Contract Management Agency cannot \ncertify and inspect the work of the Sikorsky employees. So there is no \nway the U.S. military can take delivery of those helicopters.\n  My hope is this situation can be resolved quickly and that we can \nfind a way to get these DCMA employees back doing their vital jobs that \ncontribute so directly and importantly to the success of our military \noperations. They are civilian employees. They should be back at \nwork certifying and inspecting and making sure those helicopters are \nthe best in the world, as they have always been, and that they can be \ndelivered to our military; that the military can pay Sikorsky, and \nSikorsky can keep its people at work rather than furlough them, and so \nthat those Sikorsky helicopters are available to help our troops in the \ntoughest challenges they face all across the globe. They need and \ndeserve those helicopters.\n\n  But even if we put those Sikorsky workers back at their jobs \ntomorrow, the needless chaos and confusion caused by the shutdown is an \noutrageous and inexcusable dereliction by those small, rightwing \nextremists who have insisted on ideology over country and fearmongering \nover job creation.\n  The ripple effects of Sikorsky shutting down its assembly line will \nbe felt by the suppliers who provide parts and components used in those \nhelicopters. I have visited them, and I have seen those parts and \ncomponents used on those assembly lines by those Sikorsky workers. If \nSikorsky is not using those parts and components, workers in those \nsuppliers will be furloughed as well, or worse.\n  We are talking about men and women who live--many of them--paycheck \nto paycheck. They do not have huge savings. They may well, in fact, \nprobably will not be paid for the time they are furloughed. The ripple \neffect on consumer demand will be felt across Connecticut and, as a \nresult of similar situations, across the country.\n  All too often, we tend to think of the Federal workforce as a \nnameless and faceless group, but this shutdown is bringing home what \nthe real impact of their work is--from the NIH employees who do cancer \nresearch and provide treatment to people who need it and now will go \nwithout it; to the Head Start workers and programs across the country \nthat provide for educational readiness to children who now will go\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nwithout it; to the Social Security recipients who encounter problems \nwith their check or payment and need someone to guide them or help them \nreceive those checks that they need to survive and now will go without \nthose checks; and resolving veterans' benefits, other kinds of issues \nall across the country. The chaos and confusion will ripple and \naccumulate. These effects are cumulative, and they will multiply.\n  The damage done by these wounds to our workforce are, tragically, \nself-inflicted and they dramatize how that cumulative effect will, in \nfact, increase exponentially.\n  I warned of the effects on job creation and economic growth \nrepeatedly before and after the shutdown occurred. In addition to the \nvital services that are imperiled and impacted, these economic effects \non job creation and recovery are irreparable. They affect people's \nlives. They are real consequences to real people.\n  I have called on this body to let compromise and cooler heads prevail \nand end those ripple effects, end the shutdown, end this self-inflicted \nwound before it becomes an economic tsunami.\n  I hope everyone in this body, everyone in this Congress, will use \nevery ounce of their energy, every minute of this day and the days to \ncome to cause this inexcusable shutdown to end, to fix the train wreck \nbefore it leads to other wrecks of other trains that may collide.\n  We have spent a lot of time in this body talking, and it is time we \nstarted listening. We ought to be listening to the American people, who \nare telling us: Get the job done. Get back to work. We ought to be \nlistening to voices of our local communities which are seeing the harm \nof this shutdown.\n  Jim Finley, for example, the CEO of the Connecticut Conference of \nMunicipalities, said yesterday:\n\n       Our poorest communities. They're the ones who are going to \n     feel the hit first.\n\n  That is because the Women, Infants and Children's Program and housing \nvouchers for low-income families are just two of the programs that make \nthe social safety net work and help people most in need. The WIC \nProgram provides food assistance to more than 58,000 low-income \npregnant women, mothers, and children in Connecticut.\n  Listen to Mayor Pedro Segarra of Hartford, who said:\n\n       After 30 days it becomes very difficult. We've already been \n     under pressure from the feds because of sequestration to \n     reduce expenses in several categories.\n\n  Recently, Newtown and Monroe, along with other Connecticut \ncommunities, received Federal grants to hire local police officers. So \nlisten to Monroe First Selectman Steve Vavrek, who said he has no idea \nwhether that money will ever arrive, and he has no way of checking on \nit, and, of course, he has no way of planning for future law \nenforcement in his community.\n  Students from Sandy Hook Elementary School were relocated to a school \nin his town of Monroe. Let's listen to those kids. Let's listen to \ntheir parents. They have no one to speak for them here, unless we \nlisten to them.\n  Similar to children across the country, they need those Federal \ngrants for their schools. If we listen to our local leaders, if we \nlisten to America, we will put the Federal Government back to work. We \nwill avoid that train wreck and tsunami that will result from the \nspreading ramifications and ripple effects of the loss of income and \nservice that results from this shutdown.\n  Finally, let me just emphasize one of the very important unintended \nconsequences of actions that we have taken or failed to take. When \nCongress passed the resolution to pay our troops, we intended to cover \nall of the men and women who wear the uniform, all who serve in our \nmilitary forces, including all categories of National Guard service.\n  Unfortunately, some are not covered in actual practice. I am \ncommitted to ensuring that everyone in uniform is paid for their \nservice and sacrifice. Regardless of the numerous diverse categories of \nservice that may exist in the National Guard or in other branches of \nservice, every man and woman who wears the uniform, every man and woman \nwho serves in our military should be paid and paid on time now.\n  I am committed to making sure our Department of Defense and our \ngovernment recognizes that obligation. So let's think about them. Let's \nkeep in mind the brave men and women who are serving and sacrificing to \nkeep us free, to make sure our democracy functions in the service of \npeople. Let's keep faith with them as well as with the American people. \nLet's do our work by making sure we put the American Government back to \nwork and make sure the country is at work. Let the House vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7154-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7154-S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.J. RES. 72\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate receives H.J. Res. 72, making continuing appropriations for \nveterans' benefits for fiscal year 2014, the measure be read three \ntimes and passed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, my \nunderstanding is that the Senator is proposing to allow for \nappropriations to move forward for a portion of veterans funding. Let \nme just say a few things. It is clearly a hardship that the shutdown is \ngoing to result in a diminution of benefits to our veterans. I \nappreciate the Senator coming to the floor to try to address that \ntoday.\n  But as my colleague from Connecticut just mentioned, it is also an \nunacceptable hardship that there is about to be 4,000 workers at \nSikorsky Aircraft who are going to be furloughed on Friday because of \nthis shutdown. It is also an unacceptable hardship that thousands of \nHead Start children are going to show up to their preschool being \nclosed. It is an unacceptable hardship to millions of frail elderly who \nare going to have their nutritional benefits compromised.\n  So I think we can all agree that the consequences of the shutdown are \nunacceptable to our veterans. They are unacceptable, though, to a \npanoply of other families and individuals across the country.\n  I would note also that I believe the resolution the Senator is \noffering and suggested be passed provides only partial funding for the \nVA. There is no funding here to operate the national cemeteries. There \nis no funding for the Board of Veterans' Appeals. There is no funding \nfor constructing VA hospitals and their clinics. There is no funding, \nactually, to operate the IT system that the entire VA needs in order to \ncontinue going forward.\n  So I would actually offer and ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's request be modified; that an amendment which is at the desk \nbe agreed to, that the joint resolution, as amended, then be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate. It is a clean \ncontinuing resolution for the entire government and something that is \nalready over in the House and reportedly has the majority support of \nthe Members of the House of Representatives. This would solve the \nproblems I am sure the Senator is going to talk about with respect to \ncertain veterans but would also solve all of those other problems and \nwould make sure we continue to have funding for the national \ncemeteries, continue to build hospitals that need to be built for \nveterans, continue to service the IT needs that underlay the foundation \nof our veterans systems, and also make sure Head Start kids do not get \nturned away from their classrooms, make sure Sikorsky Aircraft workers \nget to go back to work, make sure our food still gets inspected, we get \nmeals to our frail elderly.\n  The CR is in front of the Senate. If the Senator would agree, I \npropose we move forward with this modification to his request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Utah so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEE. I object to the proposed modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I just want to say I so \nstrongly support my colleague from Connecticut. I so oppose what is \ngoing on here with the Republicans. Time and time again they have had a \nchance to\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nopen this government, and they say no. We have the votes in the House. \nThe Senate passed it. We sent it over there. Let's make sure we do what \nis right for the people. That means opening this government. We show up \nto work. We have two things to do to earn our pay; one is keep the \ngovernment open. Just because people are going to get health insurance \nand it bothers some Republicans, sorry you lost that battle 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago and then in the election.\n  So we have to keep the government running, and we have to pay the \nbills that we all incurred. They are threatening chaos. I am so \nappreciative the Senator from Connecticut came down and gave another \nchance to our Republican friends to let them join us and do our job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Again, the Senator having rejected my offer to modify his \nconsent--we have an opportunity to pass a continuing resolution which \nenjoys the support of the Senate, which reportedly enjoys the support \nof the majority of Members of the House of Representatives should the \nSpeaker simply call it. We could solve the problems the Senator is \nabout to talk about, as well as all of the other problems presented to \nthe people being affected today by the shutdown, if we would just move \nforward with a clean continuing resolution with no political riders \nattached to it.\n  For that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, what we are being told by the majority is \nthat we have to vote for everything in order to fund anything. Moments \nago, I proposed a unanimous consent request that if approved would \nprovide for the immediate availability of mandatory funds generally \ncontrolled through the annual appropriations process for the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  I thank the Republican leader for making similar requests earlier \ntoday and other Republican colleagues for joining him. I look forward \nto making other similar requests in the coming hours. Frankly, I am a \nlittle stunned at some of the things we are hearing from the other side \nof the aisle. It is difficult for me to understand the objection to \nbills the House passed last night and the ones Senate Republicans are \ntrying to pass today.\n  First, this legislation does not fund anything that is controversial. \nNone of the pieces of legislation being worked on and passed by the \nHouse right now and last night can be considered controversial. These \nbills provide funding for things such as veterans' disability benefits, \nthe GI bill, and cancer research. These bills keep our national parks \nopen and they make sure our National Guard personnel get paid.\n  There are many things on which Republicans and Democrats do not \nagree, but whether to take care of our veterans should not be among \nthose things. Second, the President himself has asked Congress to do \nthis. I remind my friends exactly what he said a few days ago, speaking \nto what might happen during a government shutdown.\n  He said:\n\n       Office buildings would close, paychecks would be delayed. \n     Vital services for seniors and veterans, women and children, \n     businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung . . . \n     Veterans who've sacrificed for their country, will find their \n     support centers unstaffed . . . Tourists will find every one \n     of America's national parks and monuments, from Yosemite to \n     the Smithsonian to the Statue of Liberty, immediately closed. \n     And of course the communities and small businesses that rely \n     on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out \n     of customers and out of luck.\n\n  The Republicans in the House of Representatives took the President of \nthe United States at his word and started acting immediately to draft \nbills that would make sure these priorities received funding. In \nresponse, Senate Democrats have said this plan to fund things such as \nveterans, national parks, and others was fundamentally unserious. They \nsaid Republicans were playing games. The biggest head-scratcher of them \nall, the President issued a veto threat for bills that fund the very \nthings he said he wanted to fund, that he would like Congress to fund.\n  It makes me wonder, why is it that the President of the United States \nand the Democrats in the Senate are having such a hard time taking yes \nfor an answer. The fundamental objection, as I understand it, has been \nthat because these bills, passed by the House of Representatives last \nnight, and those being passed today, within the next couple of hours, \nbecause those bills do not fund everything, they are objectionable; in \nother words, we have to fund everything or we may fund nothing.\n  I have to remind my colleagues that normally, under regular order, \nCongress will vote on and ultimately approve a dozen or so separate \nsegmented appropriations measures, making sure we address each year \nwithin our Federal Government what it is that we are spending money on. \nThis is a big government, one that expends between $3.5 and $4 trillion \na year. It is appropriate that we break this up into pieces.\n  But over the last 4\\1/2\\ years or so, we have been operating on the \nbasis of back-to-back continuing resolutions, measures that basically \nrequire us to fund everything or fund nothing. So what this proposal \ndoes, what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are quite \nwisely doing is saying let's start with those areas as to which there \nis the most broad-based bipartisan consensus, and let's keep government \nfunded at current levels, as the continuing resolution would do within \nthose areas, and let's build consensus and let's start funding the \ngovernment in those areas where there is not significant objection.\n  What I do not hear from my colleagues is a substantive objection to \nwhat it does fund. What I hear is they are objecting to what it does \nnot fund. So let's pass those things we can agree should be funded, and \nlet's move forward. I think we can get most of this resolved fairly \nquickly.\n  Two of the bills in the House of Representatives that have been \npassed in this fashion have, quite significantly, received substantial \nbipartisan support. I expect that the rest of them will receive \nbipartisan support as well. In the middle of an unfortunate government \nshutdown, surrounded by all of this diverse rhetoric, Republicans and \nDemocrats came together in the House, overwhelmingly, to approve these \nbills. I think we owe it to the country to show we can do the same in \nthe Senate, acting upon the advice of our better angels and acting in \nthe spirit of bipartisan cooperation to keep our government funded.\n  Fourth, this is a path forward that was first introduced by none \nother than the distinguished majority leader himself. On Monday \nafternoon, Senator Harry Reid from Nevada, the Senate majority leader, \nasked for unanimous consent to pass a bill that ensured our Active-Duty \nmilitary would be paid in the event of a shutdown. In a matter of \nminutes it was done.\n  So I ask my friends across the aisle: Was Senator Reid playing games? \nWas that unserious? We did that then. Monday, just a few days ago, we \npassed something that did not fund everything, but it did fund \nsomething. It funded the government to the extent necessary to allow us \nto continue paying our Active-Duty military personnel.\n  Was that unserious? Well, of course not. Why is it unserious when we \ntry to fund veterans' disability payments, cancer research, or our \nNational Guard?\n  Why is it all of a sudden trying to play games trying to keep our \nnational parks open?\n  What exactly has changed since Monday? Why can we come together to \npass a bill funding military pay but not to fund veterans' benefits?\n  Finally, none of these bills has any connection to the implementation \nof ObamaCare.\n  I understand that my friends across the aisle support that law \ndespite its numerous failings and indications that it is harming the \nAmerican people and the economy, that it is hurting jobs and \nthreatening the affordability of health insurance.\n  I understand that some of my friends across the aisle want to protect \nthat law.\n  We are going to continue to have that debate about that law, \nespecially in light of all of the problems people are having signing up \nwith the exchanges, not to mention the ongoing problems of job losses, \nwage reductions, hours lost, and people losing their health coverage \nbecause of ObamaCare. Especially in light of all of those problems, we \nshould continue\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nhaving that debate, but that debate isn't essential to every aspect of \nour government's funding.\n  Let me be clear. We will do everything in our power to protect the \nAmerican people from the harmful effects of ObamaCare. That fight will \nmost certainly continue.\n  My friends across the aisle are welcome to join that debate, as I am \nsure they will. But none of these bills, none of the bills that we are \nconsidering today relate in any way to the implementation of ObamaCare.\n  For this moment, at the very least, we should focus on keeping our \npromise to the people, those who have sacrificed the most to keep this \ncountry free.\n  I applaud the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. \nI applaud the Republicans and the Democrats who have supported \nlegislation to help keep our government funded in these critical areas. \nWe can come together if we act in a step-by-step process, if we pursue \na step-by-step process for funding our government.\n  It more closely resembles the way we should have been appropriating \nin the first place. This is the best way forward. It is the way to help \nminimize the pain that Americans are experiencing as a result of this \nunfortunate shutdown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to talk about the need to reopen \ngovernment--and not to reopen government in a piecemeal way, one bit \nthis week and then another bit next week, which seems to be the newest \ngambit on the table. We need to reopen the government because the \ngovernment of this country should have never shut down in the first \nplace.\n  Few States are feeling the impact of the shutdown more than Virginia. \nI wish to tell two stories, a personal one and then a story about one \ncommunity in my State.\n  In my State many Federal employees live in Virginia. About 150,000 \nFederal employees are jeopardized currently by the shutdown, and 70,000 \nof them are DOD civilians who were already furloughed earlier this \nyear. One of the employees who is jeopardized is a major in the Air \nForce Reserve by the name of Eric Ryan. He lives in northern Virginia, \nis married, and has four children.\n  Eric had a distinguished career in the Air Force, retired, became a \ncivilian, rejoined the Air Force Reserve, and is currently working at \nthe Pentagon. At the Pentagon as a civilian, he is currently furloughed \nwith a wife and four children to support.\n  Eric is a Presidential Management Fellow and has been loaned to my \noffice for a period of time. He showed up at the Pentagon Tuesday to \nget furloughed, and then he came to my office to hear me deliver my \nfurlough speech to all of my employees. He got the double dose that \nday.\n  This afternoon I have the honor of going and participating in the \npromotion ceremony for Eric Ryan from major to lieutenant colonel. I am \ngoing to talk about him and his qualifications, but it is going to be a \nbitter moment for all of us as I engage in that promotion for this \nwonderful person. He first served this Nation by flying dozens of \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan and now serves the Nation in a new \nway, but has now been furloughed twice this year, once because of the \nsequester and next because of the shutdown. We have tens of thousands \nof veterans such as Eric Ryan who are going through the furlough \nexperience.\n  The second is a community story. If you were to ask where in Virginia \nwould you feel the impact of the sequester, I think most people might \nthink the neighborhoods around the Pentagon or Hampton Roads, where \nthere is naval power. But the effects are being felt everywhere.\n  I wish to speak about one community, Chincoteague, the barrier island \noff the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the subject of the famous children's \nbook, ``Misty of Chincoteague.'' It is beautiful community, a tiny \nsmall town.\n  Chincoteague's economy is fundamentally about visits to the national \nseashore, Assateague and Chincoteague Islands. But those parks and \nnational resources have been closed.\n  I got a call Tuesday morning right away from friends in Chincoteague \nsaying: Chincoteague is motels, restaurants, grocery stores, gas \nstations, and people who sell suntan lotion and sunglasses. Because of \nthe closure, the entire economy has had its guts pulled out during the \nFederal shutdown.\n  Moreover, there is a historic lighthouse at the wildlife refuge that \nhas been restored. It has taken 6 years to restore. This week was the \nopening and celebration of the lighthouse. They expected visitors to \ncome from everywhere. That has been cancelled.\n  Chincoteague has one other industry that is very important. They \ndidn't only want to be about tourism, so over the last 15 to 20 years \nthey have worked to build up the capacity of NASA at Wallops Island, \nwhich is 5 miles from Chincoteague Island.\n  Kids who graduate from high school and are interested in science and \nmath don't have to move away and never come home. They can get a \nscience and math degree, come back, and work as rocket scientists. \nEighty percent of the NASA employees at Wallops near Chincoteague have \nbeen furloughed as a result of this shutdown.\n  The experience of Col. Eric Ryan, who works in my office, and the \nexperience of this small community on the Eastern Shore of Virginia \ndemonstrates how serious these effects are.\n  The good news is we can solve this if Speaker Boehner would only \nallow a vote to reopen government.\n  The Presiding Officer knows this because we sat through it together. \nIt bears a little bit of repetition.\n  The Senate passed a budget on March 23 that funds all of these issues \nat the level that the Senate thinks is right. The same week the House \npassed a budget funding government at levels they think is right.\n  Under the Budget Control Act of 1974, the right strategy at that \npoint was to put the two budgets in conference and let conferees figure \nit out. For folks who aren't familiar with it--and there may be some \nwho are listening--a budget conference is a pretty simple thing.\n  When I was Governor of Virginia, we had them all the time. The two \nHouses would pass different budgets. Each House takes their budget, \ngoes into the negotiating room, sits down, and compares. One side wins \non this issue, one side wins on the other, and on a third issue they \nmight split it 50-50. The House budget and the Senate budget are very \ndifferent.\n\n  But that is what we do. We sit down, listen, dialogue, compromise, \nand we solve the problems of the country. Nineteen times since March 23 \nwe have stood on the floor of this body and said we want to go to \nconference with the House on this budget. Nineteen times, the last of \nwhich was yesterday, a small handful of Senators--and that was the \nphrase that the Senator from Utah used once on the floor in blocking \nthis: We are a small handful of Senators--and the House Republicans \nhave blocked a budget compromise.\n  For the last 6\\1/2\\ months we have not had the opportunity to sit \ndown and dialogue. For folks who don't know how a budget conference \nworks, if, in a conference a compromise is reached, it doesn't just \nbecome law like that. The compromise has to come back to both Houses. \nBoth Houses debate the compromise, both Houses vote on the compromise, \nand everyone's interests are protected. They can look at the compromise \nand decide whether they like it or don't.\n  For 6\\1/2\\ months we have been blocked in an effort to go to budget \nconference. Imagine our amazement. In this body on Monday night, after \nthe House shut down government, 3 hours later they passed a bill and \nsaid: We have an idea. Let's have a conference. Finally, 6\\1/2\\ months \nafter they shut down government. But let's have it be a really \nparticular kind of conference, not a conference about the budget of the \nUnited States. Let's have a conference about whether the Government of \nthe United States should be open or closed.\n  I know I can speak for my colleagues who are here. Our view is we \nwill negotiate, compromise, and listen to any policy issue. Budget \nnegotiation is exactly how you do this or policy debates are how you do \nit. But what none of us in this body or in the House should ever \nnegotiate is whether the United States exists or not, whether it is \nfunded or not, whether it is open or closed.\n  I believe it has to be open. That is essentially what our oath of \noffice says we have to do when we say we will\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\nfaithfully discharge all the duties of the office to which we have been \nelected.\n  We also won't negotiate whether the United States should pay its \nbills because the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in Section 5 makes \nvery plain that the public debt of the United States and its validity \nshall not be questioned.\n  There is a way forward here, and it is such a simple way forward: \nthat is, Speaker Boehner needs to allow a vote in the House. It is \nsimple. Allow a vote and not only allow a vote, but allow a vote on a \nbudget number that he has already agreed to.\n  The continuing resolution the Senator from Connecticut talked about \nthat is currently pending, funds government for an interim period of \ntime at a budget level that was the House's number. It is not a number \nI liked. We had a different number in the Senate, a higher number we \nwant to fund it to. But we accepted the House's number for the short-\nterm spending bill out of a spirit of compromise.\n  We sent it back to the House and we said: We are compromising. We are \nnot even going 50-50. We are compromising by accepting your budget \nnumber. This is not as if the Senator from Utah said we want to fund \neverything or nothing, no. We have other things we would like to fund \nthat we are not funding in this bill because we accepted everything the \nHouse wants to fund in their CR.\n  They only need to accept yes for an answer. The good news is this is \nnot a partisan issue because many Senate Republicans want to do exactly \nwhat I am suggesting.\n  Based on current reports in the House, there are numerous House \nRepublicans--four of whom are from Virginia--who are publicly on the \nrecord. They wish to do exactly as we are suggesting.\n  Speaker Boehner, bring your own spending bill up for a vote. If you \ndo it will pass. If it passes, government will reopen. Once government \nhas reopened, we can have a budget conference and talk about any issue \nthe House wants to talk about, any issue that we want to talk about. \nBut it is time to end hostage politics and reopen the doors.\n  The Speaker has it in his hands to do that, simply and immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, people all around this country--and \nMontana is no exception--are looking at the actions in Washington, DC, \nand they are shaking their heads in disbelief. They are shaking their \nheads in disbelief because the government has shut down, but yet a bill \nhas passed the Senate. If the Speaker of the House would offer it on \nthe House floor, it would pass the House and the government wouldn't \nhave to be shut down.\n  Then all the resolutions put forth on the other side, and some on \nthis side, quite frankly, about opening different areas of the \ngovernment, would all be settled because government would be open.\n  A previous speaker this morning said: We shouldn't be dealing with \noverall government. We should be dealing with this in piecemeal \nfashion.\n  Really? Who determines who gets help and who determines who doesn't? \nThe fact is the government provides some pretty essential services to \nfolks across the board. To stand on this floor and cherry-pick certain \npieces of the government to fund and not to fund is totally unfair. \nQuite frankly, those groups know they are being used as political pawns \nin this process.\n  We started out these negotiations with a CR that was at $1.58 \ntrillion. We compromised that down to a point of $986 billion, \nsomewhere around a $70 billion reduction. This is real money, a \nsignificant compromise.\n  The House came back and said: No, that is really not good enough. We \nwant that $986 billion figure, and then we also want to defund the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Why? Because, my goodness, it is the most terrible thing. There are \nall sorts of reasons given on the floor why the Affordable Care Act is \nso terrible.\n  For example, I had a flat tire on my truck last week--it was the \nAffordable Care Act. I ran out of fuel in my fuel tank--that doggone \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Let's get the Affordable Care Act implemented and all of these bogus \nexcuses about why it is so bad will go away. People will get the \nadvantage of affordable insurance once again, not government health \ncare, but affordable insurance so they can afford to get sick.\n  Aside from that, the repeal of it was turned back. Then they came \nback with a delay of 1 year and said: Oh, by the way, if you work for \nCongress or you are a Member of Congress, we are going to take away any \nsort of insurance benefits you get whatsoever.\n  This was interesting. Because, quite frankly, if Members of Congress \ndon't want that benefit, they will turn it back, and I anticipate some \nwill after the Affordable Care Act is put into place. I doubt that very \nmuch.\n\n  Instead, what happened was we turned that back, and now we are in a \nsituation where we sent back a clean continuing resolution at $986 \nbillion. In the House, if the Speaker would put that bill on the floor, \nit would pass and we could start doing the business of this country \nonce again rather than sitting here in a government shutdown where \nthings aren't working and we are not addressing the issues that need to \nbe addressed.\n  But when we take a look at whether we are going to fund certain \nprograms, I want to talk about a few very briefly before I kick it over \nto the Senator from Colorado.\n  We have intelligence folks who are not on the ground, but we have \nfolks fighting in theater right now who need that intelligence. Whether \nthey get it is up in the air. The folks who protect our clean water and \nair are off the job. Clean water is our most important resource, and \nthey are not there to make sure it remains clean. Kids on Head Start, \nfood inspectors, research into energy so we can have a 21st-century \neconomy and affordable energy in that 21st century--they are all off \nthe job. Domestic violence and folks who are impacted by domestic \nviolence--there are shelters that are determining right now whether \nthey will turn away those victims of domestic violence.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Whether we are talking about the \nCenters for Disease Control or we are talking about logging and salvage \nsales or talking about allowing wells to be drilled in the Bakken--that \nhas all stopped. Why? Because of a Speaker of the House--who, by the \nway, a previous speaker just said they were very proud of. But why has \nit stopped? It is because of a Speaker of the House who doesn't have \nthe internal guts to put this on the floor and let it pass the House of \nRepresentatives. That would put this country back to work so we could \nstart doing the things we need to do in the halls of the Senate and the \nhalls of the House that are important for this country, whether it is \nthe farm bill or housing reform or a defense authorization bill--the \nlist goes on and on. Instead, we are dealing with a totally self-\ninflicted crisis supported by people who want to shut this government \ndown. Regardless of what they say on this floor, they are very happy \nbecause this government is shut down.\n  It is time, Members of the House of Representatives, that you demand \nthat the Speaker put that bill up so you can vote on it and we can get \nback to doing the business of this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I would like to first say how much I \nappreciate the words of the Senator from Virginia and the words of the \nSenator from Montana. They are known to be commonsense people, to work \nin a bipartisan way day after day in this Congress, against all odds, \nto actually try to make something work around this place. So I thank \nthem for their leadership and their comments this morning.\n  For 4 years I have come to this floor at about this time of the year \nand talked about how Washington has become the land of flickering \nlights where the standard of success is not how we are imagining the \nfuture and what we are doing for the next generation of Americans but \nthat we are managing, after a little bit of aggravation and hostility, \nto keep the lights on for 1 more month or for 6 more months. Well, this \ntime we are not the land of flickering lights. The lights are out in \nWashington. They have managed to shut down the government.\n  No mayor, no school superintendent, no city council in Colorado would\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nthreaten the shutdown of their government over politics. Whether they \nare a Democratic mayor or a Republican mayor or a tea party mayor, we \nwouldn't stand for it in Colorado. They certainly would never threaten \nthe credit rating of their community over politics. In fact, it is \nexactly the opposite. We just had these terrible floods in our State, \nand people are struggling to do everything they can to keep their \ngovernments open to provide people who have been displaced by the \nflood, who have lost everything they own, the services they need.\n  This shutdown is already hurting the U.S. economy and Colorado's \neconomy, and it is not surprising why. There is a lot of rhetoric \naround this place about uncertainty and the damage it does to our \neconomy. Nothing could create more uncertainty than shutting this \ngovernment down and threatening the credit rating of the United States \nby saying: We are not going to pay our bills. We have an ideology that \nis so far outside the mainstream of American political thought that we \ncan't find a way to actually win elections that align with our \nideology, so we are going to use these kinds of tactics to bring this \ngovernment to its knees.\n  The AP reported that the U.S. and European stock markets fell \nyesterday as investors and world leaders worried about the threat to \nthe global economy. According to the Denver Post, the shutdown may cost \nthe United States at least $300 million a day in lost output during a \n1-week shutdown. What good is that doing anybody? How is that helping \nany American? Economists have estimated that a 3-week closing would cut \neconomic production by 1 percent. It would cut our GDP by 1 percent. \nHow does this self-inflicted wound help anybody?\n  In Colorado, to be clear, just as in the other States we have heard \nabout today, it is not just the families who rely on Federal programs \nor Federal workers who are suffering because of this shutdown. The \nDenver Post reported that in a neighborhood near the Denver Federal \nCenter, Rick Koerner, who owns Stack Subs sandwich shop in Lakewood, \nestimates he has lost about 5 percent of his normal business since the \nshutdown began on Thursday. He says he can't afford to lose any \ncustomers because, in his words, ``it's a thin-margin business to begin \nwith.'' How are we helping him? In the same story, Deborah Giovingo, \nwho owns a restaurant called Paradise Cove on West Alameda Avenue, just \neast of the Federal Center, said she is also witnessing a loss. ``We're \nnot getting our regular lunchers. I think they're really trying to \nconserve their money.'' Right now, how are we helping these people?\n  One city perhaps hardest hit in our State is Colorado Springs in El \nPaso County. According to the Colorado Springs Gazette, the furloughs \nat our military bases include more than 1,000 workers at the Air Force \nAcademy, 400 workers at Schriever Air Force Base, 2,200 at Peterson Air \nForce Base, and 700 at U.S. Northern Command. At Fort Carson another \n1,000 workers are off the job. Is our job more important than their \njob? Is the job they do to protect this country, to defend this \ncountry, less important than the job of these elected representatives \nin Washington who are still taking a salary? I don't think so. Are \nthese jobs less important than the people who are actually in theater \nright now in Afghanistan? I don't think so.\n  After 1 week of shutdown, the WIC Program--the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program--will have no funds for clinical services, food \nbenefits, and administrative costs. Roughly 100,000 women and children \nin Colorado participated in the WIC Program last year and will lose \ntheir benefits.\n  The shutdown will delay SBA loans for Colorado's small businesses. \nLast year SBA processed 1,300 applications, for a total of $559 million \nin loans, and they are on the ground right now, thank goodness, working \nwith people who have suffered through these floods.\n  Our national parks, wildlife refuges, and recreational lands--major \ndrivers of Colorado's economy--are closed. They are shut down. \nApproximately 13,000 people visiting national parks in Colorado will be \nturned away each day this government is closed. It will result in \nnearly $800,000 of revenue a day for our local communities, which are \nalready suffering because of the floods. Estes Park is one of the towns \nthat have been terribly affected, and this is one of their peak times \nof the year for tourism because of the changing leaves. They are losing \nthat opportunity, and we are making it worse because the government is \nshut down.\n  Thousands of Federal employees are out of work during this economic \nrecovery. There is a delay in Social Security services. There will be a \ndelay in veterans' benefits by the end of October. Colorado is home to \nalmost 400,000 veterans. That is almost 10 percent of our State's \npopulation.\n  At risk is the funding for Head Start agencies and the Export-Import \nBank's support for small companies.\n  But what is just so insulting at this moment is that we are trying to \nrecover from this flood. The recent flooding damaged at least 17,000 \nhomes and other structures, several thousand of which were outright \ndestroyed. Millions of dollars' worth of public infrastructure has \nliterally been swept away. More than 200 miles of Colorado roads and at \nleast 50 bridges have been damaged or destroyed. Nine Coloradans lost \ntheir lives in the floods. The floods consumed an area of Colorado that \nis twice the size of Rhode Island. The devastation defies belief. \nHouses have been leveled and reduced to piles of debris, and some of \nthese communities lie in ruins.\n  FEMA has pledged to go to great lengths, and they are working very \nhard to ensure that crucial disaster response and recovery services are \nnot interrupted. To be clear, so far, emergency funds are still flowing \nand emergency workers are still in place. They are doing a phenomenal \njob, and I want to say on this floor, on behalf of everybody in \nColorado, how grateful we are for their work. FEMA is going to make \nsure this work gets done, but nevertheless a number of FEMA employees--\nboth based in Washington and at the FEMA Region VIII office \nheadquartered in Denver--are vulnerable to furloughs if this shutdown \ncontinues.\n  Our economy is recovering in Colorado, and we are being led by \ninnovative businesses that have been growing jobs despite the \ndysfunction in Washington. This year I visited many of them--companies \nthat, in the depths of the worst recession since the Great Depression, \nwere actually creating jobs by inventing our future. That is what \ninnovators do, and that is what Coloradans do. We are letting them down \nprofoundly here by failing to exercise our most basic responsibilities \nas legislators, as people who receive a salary from the taxpayer. They \ndo not send us here to shut it down, they send us here to improve it. \nThey send us here to come to agreement and to compromise and to imagine \na better future for our children and for our grandchildren. That is \nwhat we are here to do.\n  Instead, a very radical faction in the House and some of their \ncolleagues here in the Senate have shut this government down in support \nof an ideology that, as I mentioned earlier, is far outside the \nmainstream of American political thought. They are entitled to their \nopinion. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. But they are not \nentitled to shut the government down if they don't get what they want, \nand that is where we find ourselves.\n  It has been a privilege for me to work in this place, and the moments \nI have enjoyed the most have been the ones where we have worked in a \nbipartisan way, with colleagues on the other side, to dramatically \nimprove the way the Food and Drug Administration works so that new \ndrugs could be approved more quickly and so that the 600 bioscience \nfirms in Colorado that came to me and said they could no longer raise \nventure capital because it was all going to Europe and Asia because of \nuncertainty with the FDA and to please help them fix that--with \nRepublican colleagues, we were able to get that done.\n  In working the immigration bill we passed, with the Gang of 8--four \nDemocrats and four Republicans--we solved each other's political \nproblems to bring a product to the floor that actually could pass with \nnearly 70 votes--a supermajority of the Senate--and we still need to \npass that bill in the House.\n  That bill, in stark contrast to the government shutdown we are going \nthrough right now, actually will drive GDP growth. The Congressional \nBudget Office tells us that immigration bill adds 3 points of GDP \ngrowth in the first 10 years and 5 points in the second 10 years.\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\n  By the way, at a moment when these people are saying they are \nshutting the government down, mostly because of the health care bill \nbut also because of their concern about a growing government and \nwidening deficits, the immigration bill reduces the deficit by $900 \nbillion over a 20-year period. That is real money even in Washington, \nDC. They could be passing that bill over there. Instead, the government \nis shut down, and it has been a catastrophic failure of leadership that \nhas brought us to this place.\n  I have absolutely no doubt, from all the press reports I have read \nand what I hear from my Republican colleagues in the Senate, my friends \nin the Senate who are Republicans, that if Speaker Boehner put on the \nfloor of the House the Senate version of the so-called continuing \nresolution, it would pass with a broad majority of Democrats and \nRepublicans, and the American people would cheer because that is what \nthey want. They want us working together. And the standard of success \nneeds to be something greater than that we kept the lights on, which in \nthis instance we haven't. We haven't even done that. What is the signal \nwe are trying to send to this complicated world in which we live by \nshutting this government down? Why is it that people here get away with \nthings that no local elected official would ever get away with?\n\n  So we have to continue to fight to get this government open. We are \ngoing to have another fight to make sure that, for the first time in \nthe United States, we don't fail to pay our bills and blow up the full \nfaith and credit of the United States--which is one of our most \nimportant assets, right up there with the rule of law, right up there \nwith our capitalist economy. From our founding, the full faith and \ncredit of the United States has been a bulwark for us.\n  But once we get past that, what we need to fight for is the next \ngeneration of Americans. That is why we have been sent here. Whether we \nare Democrats or Republicans, that is why we are here. And they are \nwaiting to see whether we are willing to be the first generation of \nAmerican leadership to provide less opportunity--not more--to the \npeople that are coming after us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7159-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7159-S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the period of \nmorning business for debate only be extended to 5 p.m., with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the Founding Fathers set up a system of \ngovernment which intentionally made social change in this country hard \nto achieve. They set up a pretty complicated legislative process with \nan innovative bicameral legislature in which you have to get the exact \nsame bill with the exact same text passed through two different \nChambers. They set up courts that could overturn those laws if they \ndidn't abide by the Constitution. They set up an office down the street \nin the White House with a veto power that could cancel out actions of \nthe majoritarian legislature. Then they built in pretty frequent \nelections so that if people didn't like what happened here, they could \nchange the composition of the legislature to try to get something \ndifferent to happen. So I imagine that is why it took 100 years since \nTeddy Roosevelt first proposed that this country make a commitment to \nuniversal health care that we actually got here. All the while, we \nwatched as every other industrialized nation in the world decided that \nthe compassionate thing to do was to make sure people didn't die \nbecause they didn't have enough money to get into the health care \nsystem, and they committed themselves to universal health care while \nthe United States sat on the sideline.\n  What happened is a couple years ago when, after 100 years of debate \nand consternation and gridlock, we finally made a decision as a nation \nto move forward with a health care reform bill that finally puts us on \nthe road to guaranteeing that everybody in this country at least gets \nsome basic access to health care, no matter how much money you have in \nyour wallet or pocketbook. What happened is the system was literally \ncrashing down around us. We finally woke up to the reality that we were \npaying twice as much for health care as any other country in the world \nand getting so much less--not only in that there were tens of millions \nof people who were sitting on the sidelines, but also in that the \noutcomes we were getting weren't good enough for the amount of money we \nwere paying.\n  Finally the American public sent Members of the House of \nRepresentatives to make a change. They elected Senators determined to \nmake a change. They elected a President who campaigned on making a \nchange. So in 2010, we overcame the barriers that had been set up by \nthe Founding Fathers to major social change. Both Congresses passed \nthat health care law. Two years later, it was upheld by the Supreme \nCourt as constitutional. Later that year, in 2012, President Obama ran \non his support of the law and his promise to implement it and was \nelected by a wide margin. I would note, every single Senator here who \nvoted for it and stood for election got returned to the Senate.\n  But despite all of this--despite the fact that after 100 years of \ndebate, the democratic process produced a health care reform bill that \nexpands coverage to millions of Americans and lowers the cost of \ninsurance for them, despite the fact that it withstood all of the \nchallenges that can come to a major reform like that--including a \nconstitutional challenge, including the question being put to the \nelectorate again after the law was passed in 2010 and 2012--despite all \nthat, Republicans have been coming to the floor of the Senate and the \nfloor of the House saying we have got to shut down the government \nbecause the people don't want this health care law to be implemented.\n  And that is why they are doing this right now--because they know this \nis their last chance to try to get this law repealed. This law, which \nhas already saved millions of seniors money, which right now as we \nspeak is saving families thousands of dollars as they sign up for these \nexchanges, they know this is their last chance to get this bill \nrepealed because it is about to go into effect, and all of their \nridiculous arguments about how the sky is going to fall once this \nreform is implemented will be proven untrue. So Republicans come down \nhere and say the American public wants this delayed.\n  First, let me make the point that my colleagues have been making all \nday: This is not the place to have that conversation. The people of \nthis country do not support the government being shut down over \nRepublicans' objection to the healthcare bill. There is no way this \nplace can work if every single person adopts a ``my way or the \nhighway'' approach, if it is a condition of running the government for \njust 6 weeks--which is essentially what we are arguing over here--that \nwe have to get everybody's particular political points solved.\n  I get it the Republicans don't like the health care bill. But I come \nfrom Newtown, CT. I don't understand why we can't agree that before you \nbuy a weapon, everybody should get a simple criminal background check. \nThat is as important as anything in the world to me, coming from where \nI do. But I am not conditioning my support for the operation of the \nFederal Government upon Republicans agreeing to support me on \nbackground checks. And I bet I feel just as strongly about background \nchecks, coming from a State which witnessed that kind of slaughter, as \nany Republican believes in the repeal of the health care law. But that \nis not how I am going to operate, nor is it how any other Democrat is \noperating.\n  When I listen to people say, well, neither side is willing to \nnegotiate, we don't have anything to negotiate over,\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nbecause all we want is for the government to be operational. We are not \nattaching any conditions--no conditions, zero conditions--to the \ngovernment coming back and operating. The only party attaching \nconditions to the operation of the Federal Government is Republicans. \nThis isn't a negotiation. We just want the government to be back open \nfor business, with no extras.\n  But I am OK to have a debate on what the people think about the \nhealth care law. I don't think it should be: Well, we have the \ngovernment shut down. I don't think there should be a gun to our head \ninvolving the paychecks of thousands of both government and civilian \nemployees as well as the safety of our Nation and of our food and of \nour water and of our air. But let's have that debate. Polls are going \nto tell you people are still kind of divided as to whether they like \nthe particulars of the law that we passed to reform our health care \nsystem, but they do not want it repealed. In fact, one of the most \nrecent polls I looked at, which has been consistent with most \neverything I have seen, said that only 33 percent of Americans, just 1 \nout of 3, want the law repealed or delayed or defunded. By a 2-to-1 \nmargin, people want the health care law implemented because they get \nthat the current system is totally broken and they want a chance to try \nto fix it.\n\n  Second, by absolutely astounding, overwhelming margins the American \npeople oppose the tea party's attempt to shut down the government \nunless the health care bill is repealed. Those numbers are even bigger. \nIt is not 2-to-1, it is more like 3-to-1 or 4-to-1. The most recent \nQuinnipiac University poll said the American public opposes Republican \nefforts to shut down the Government over the defunding of the health \ncare law by a 72-to-22 margin. And of course the next hostage that \nRepublicans are going to take is the full faith and credit of the \nAmerican government because they are not going to raise the debt \nceiling unless they get a whole other set of conditions agreed to, and \nguess what. The American public does not want that either. By a \nslightly smaller margin of 64-to-27 percent the American public says \npay your bills. Don't put a bunch of conditions, a bunch of political \nriders on just paying your bills.\n  When Americans fill the gas tank, they put their credit card in and \npay the bill. They don't fill the tank and drive away, which is \nessentially what we would be doing if we agreed to a budget and then \nrefused to pay the bills we incurred.\n  Third, beyond the polling on the specific repeal or delay, beyond the \npolling on the shutdown tactics that Republicans are using, do you want \nto know what people think of this health care law? Then just look at \nwhat happened over the last 48 hours after these exchanges opened. The \nvolume at healthcare.gov continues to be astronomical. Even today on I \nthink the third day of implementation, 6.1 million unique visits in the \nfirst 24 hours; 190,000 calls into the HHS call center; 104,000 Web \nchats were requested.\n  I think the estimate is that about 15 million people are going to \nsign up for either the expanded Medicaid portion of the law or private \ninsurance through the exchanges in the first year or so; 15 million are \ngoing to sign up over the entirety of the first year. On the first day, \n6.1 million people went to check out whether they are going to get a \nbetter product. It is going to take a little while for all those people \nto sign up, but if 6 million people are just showing up on the Web site \non day 1, admittedly shutting the thing down for a little while and \nmaking the Web site slow down significantly, that tells you people out \nthere are desperate for cheaper insurance. And they are going to get \nit.\n  I saw someone who was quoted in the paper who looked at the rate they \nwere going to get in the exchange versus what they were paying and they \ncalled it a ``pocketbook changer.'' This changes people's lives. Not \nonly will they get insurance for the first time but to the extent that \ntoday people are paying 20, 30, 40 percent more than they may have to \npay on the exchange, that helps them and helps our economy because that \nmoney goes right back out into Main Street.\n  Mr. President, 6.1 million people went on the site in the first 24 \nhours because all of these sick people or parents with sick kids who \nhave been waiting their entire lives to be able to get health care \nfinally get it, because on the exchanges insurance companies cannot \ntell you ``no'' just because you are sick. I hate to tell my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle but there is an enormous amount of really \nsick people out there who have been getting sicker because they cannot \nafford to go to a doctor. Why are there 6 million people showing up on \nthe Web site on day 1? It is because there are a lot of people in \ntrouble, in dire straits, who want insurance.\n  The reason there is a flood of interest in these exchanges is because \npeople want cheaper and better health care and they are sick and tired \nof waiting around for it. But what they are even more sick and more \ntired of is this place playing games with life and death, because that \nis what this is to people out there. If they get access to health care, \nthen they have a chance at a quality life. If they do not, they are \ngoing to get sick and a lot of people are not going to make it.\n  We should fund the Government, get it back up and operating. Speaker \nBoehner has the votes to pass a clean continuing resolution in the \nHouse tonight, today. He should call it up for a vote. He can pass it. \nWe can pass it. The government can get back up and operating and then \nwe can have a debate about whether people in this country want the \nhealth care law implemented. It may be that people from a certain \nSenator's State or a certain congressional district may have different \nfeelings. But the people of this country, both in the polling and in \ntheir response to the first 3 days of its implementation, have made it \nperfectly clear: They don't want this place to play games with the \noperation of the Federal Government. They do not support the tea party \nshutting down the Federal Government over their political beliefs and \nthey want access--for the first time in many of their lives--to \naffordable health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we under a 10-\nminute time limit? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7160-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7160-S7161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ERIK FATEMI\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Erik Fatemi, the clerk of my \nappropriations subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, is leaving the Senate this week after 12 years of sterling \nservice. On behalf of Senators from both sides of the aisle who have \nhad the good fortune to work with Erik over the years, I would like to \ntake a few minutes to express our gratitude.\n  Knute Rockne was probably the alltime great coach at Notre Dame, and \nhe knew that the Almighty had a special feeling for that team. But \nRockne was fond of saying: ``I've found that prayers work best when you \nhave big players.''\n  Successful committee chairs in the Senate have the same approach. We \nknow that it is not enough to be on the side of the angels; we have got \nto have big players. Here in the Senate, that means big intellect, big \nheart, big work ethic. And those are qualities that Erik Fatemi \npossesses in superabundance.\n  Erik joined my Appropriations staff in early 2001, a few months \nbefore Senator Jim Jeffords switched from Republican to Independent, \ngiving Democrats back the majority in the Senate. So Erik has been in \nthe minority with me, then the majority, then back to the minority, and \nnow in the majority again.\n  Over the years, Erik has acquired a profound knowledge of the \nappropriations and legislative processes that is widely respected not \njust by Members and staff in this Chamber, but also in the \nadministration. And with Erik, it's not only a matter of know-how, it \nis also a matter of know-who. Over the years, Erik developed important \nrelationship of trust and respect, especially\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nwith top researchers and institute directors at the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health \nsince 2009, recently said about Erik: ``Erik Fatemi stands out in my \nmind as one of the most effective staff members I have worked with on \nCapitol Hill. Erik is the exemplar of an effective appropriations \nstaffer: he has always mastered any of the issues he's been involved in \nand he has always demonstrated the 'passion for anonymity' of a loyal \nstaff member. An expert on NIH, Erik has always been tough, fair and \ncompassionate. He always asked the tough questions and would not give \nup until he got straight answers--wether it was from the NIH or the \nbroader biomedical research community. And in all of his dealings with \nNIH and me, he has always kept uppermost in his mind the millions of \npatients and their families who count on the treatments, cures, and \npreventive measures that publicly-funded biomedical research makes \npossible. Throughout his career, in his dedication to his boss, Tom \nHarkin, and in his commitment to patients and their families, Erik \nFatemi has been a superb Appropriations staffer and a model public \nservant.''\n  As notable as Dr. Collins praise is, I long ago lost track of the \nnumber of times people have thanked me for things that Erik played a \nhuge role in getting done. Let me mention a few of his many \naccomplishments.\n  One signal achievement of my time as chair of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee was collaborating with Senator Arlen Specter to double \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health over a 5-year period. \nErik played a very significant role in making that possible in 2001, \n2002, and 2003--and that is something that he can be very proud of.\n  In the late 2000s, I was chief Senate sponsor of the Stem Cell \nEnhancement Act, to remove the administration's arbitrary restrictions \non stem cell research and Erik was my lead staffer on the bill. With \nErik's invaluable assistance, we passed the Stem Cell Enhancement Act \ntwice in Congress with large bipartisan majorities. Unfortunately, the \nbill was also vetoed twice by President Bush. And do you know what. \nThat is about the only thing that can stop Erik Fatemi: A veto by the \nPresident of the United States. The good news, of course, is that we \nultimately prevailed, with President Obama's executive order in early \n2009.\n  During and after the great recession, Erik took the lead in \nidentifying and responding to the impact the downturn could have on our \nNation's education system. He illustrated for me and other Members of \nCongress the devastating impact educator layoffs would have on our \nchildren's education and our Nation's future. The historic Recovery Act \nand the later Education Jobs Act kept hundreds of thousands of teachers \nand other educators in our schools, and Erik helped me shape the debate \nand passage of those critical laws.\n  Erik played a key role in the creation of the National Center for \nAdvancing Translational Sciences at NIH, which is accelerating the pace \nof getting new cures and therapies to the patients who need them.\n  He also oversaw production of the 2012 report ``Under Threat: \nSequestration's Impact on Nondefense Jobs and Services.'' This was the \nfirst comprehensive State-by-State projections of the destructive \nimpacts of sequestration on nondefense discretionary programs.\n  All of these accomplishments amply demonstrate Erik's skills and \ntalents as a top Senate staffer. But Erik is more than that. He is the \nquintessential humble public servant who works long hours on behalf of \nthis institution and the people of the United States.\n  Let me cite just one aspect of that humble service. Over the years, \nErik has spent countless hours explaining to thousands of constituents \nand advocates what was happening on Capitol Hill at any given moment. I \ncan't imagine how many times and to how many audiences he has patiently \nexplained how the legislative process works, especially the arcane and \nsometimes bizarre workings of appropriations.\n  As a Senator, I have always appreciated that when Erik couldn't tell \nmy constituents the answer they wanted to hear--which, unfortunately is \nmost of the time, especially these last few years--he would respond to \nevery question and e-mail promptly and honestly. In dealings with Erik, \npeople always know that he is listening and taking their concerns \nseriously.\n  Finally, I also want to express my appreciation to Erik's family \nmembers, especially his wife Alisann and their beloved daughters, \nCaroline, Kathryn, and Anna Christina. They, too, have sacrificed as \nErik has spent many late nights and weekends toiling in the Dirksen \nBuilding. It was not easy to experience those absences, but I hope you \nrealize that Erik's work has made a powerful difference for the \nAmerican people.\n  Erik, I join with the entire Senate family in thanking you for your \noutstanding service. We wish you, Alisann, Caroline, Kathryn and Anna \nChristina much happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7161-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7161-S7165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, more and more interesting figures are \ncoming in to my health committee from around the country with regard to \nwhat is happening around the Nation in terms of the health care \nmarketplace, ObamaCare. The Republicans said it was going to be a \nfailure and all that kind of stuff and how it was going to cost so much \nmore money. I do not have it for every State. It is starting to come \nin. But I have it for some States and I want to give this body and \npeople watching some of the initial figures that have come in on the \nsavings to families. For example, in Alabama, $2,013 premiums for a \nfamily of four--median premium for month. This is just the average, \ntake the median. In Alabama, for a family of four this year the premium \nwas $557.58 a month. We now know the marketplace premium, family of \nfour making $50,000 a year with the tax credits, their monthly premium \nwill be $112 a month, a savings of $445.58 a month for a family of four \nmaking $50,000 year in the State of Alabama.\n  In my State of Iowa, that median premium per month for a family of \nfour this year was $549.58. The marketplace premium for that family of \nfour at $50,000 with tax credits is now $103 a month, for a savings of \n$446.58 per month for that family of four.\n  I was looking at Oklahoma. Their median premium this year was $684 a \nmonth. The marketplace premium for that family of four--again, $50,000 \na year--with their tax credits, believe it or not, is $63 per month. \nThey will go from $684 to $63 a month. Those families will have a \nsavings of $621 a month in the State of Oklahoma.\n  The median premium per month for a family of four in Texas this year \nis $504.50. Their marketplace premium for a family of four making \n$50,000 a year, after the tax credits, $57 a month, for a savings of \n$447.50 a month. It is an amazing savings.\n  Many of these people are getting insurance for the first time. Many \nof these people may have had a preexisting condition or perhaps they \nworked in a job that did not give them health care coverage or perhaps \nthey simply couldn't afford $500 a month in Texas, but now they can \nafford $57 a month and get coverage for their family of four, and they \nwill get a subsidy for buying that marketplace insurance.\n  Is this what the Republicans want to stop? Is this what they want so \ndesperately to stop that they are willing to shut down government? They \nought to talk to some of these families in Texas, Iowa, Alabama, \nOklahoma, and Michigan.\n  The premium for a family of four in Michigan is $381 a month this \nyear. In the marketplace it will be $80 a month.\n  Georgia's premium for a family of four is $448 a month this year and \nwill go down to $132 a month under the marketplace. That is what the \nRepublicans want to stop? Well, I think we are seeing that what the \nRepublicans really wanted to do was to keep the same old system we have \nwhere health insurance companies call the tune, you pay the price, and \nif you couldn't afford it, tough luck, go to the emergency room. Now we \nare going to cover all Americans.\n  More and more information will come in, and as it comes in, I will \ntake the floor to give more and more information about the call \ncenters. Right now--in the last 2 days--over 7 million Americans have \nvisited healthcare.gov\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\nto get more information on what they can do to sign up. Again, the \nmarketplace call center--these are calls, not the Web site--received \nover 295,000 calls since midnight on October 1. The wait time has been \ncut in half so now the wait time is only 2 minutes. The wait time is \nonly 2 minutes if you call in to the call center.\n  Again, I want to repeat what I said yesterday--and I know the \nmajority leader said it this morning--about the dangers of continuing \nthis government shutdown. I quoted a Congressman from Iowa who said in \nPolitico:\n\n       We passed the witching hour at midnight last night and the \n     sky didn't fall and the roof didn't cave in.\n\n  Is that what has to happen? Does the sky have to fall and the roof \nhave to cave in before we do something? I pointed it out yesterday, and \nI will point it out again today: The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention is closed down. Why is that important? Well, we are now in \nthe flu season. More than 200,000 Americans are hospitalized due to the \nflu each year. In a mild year 3,000 people will die from the flu, and \nin a severe year that number could rise to 50,000.\n  The CDC monitors which strains are circulating around the country and \nwhich communities are being hit the hardest. They are the ones who look \nat how to contain it and keep it from spreading. They are not doing \nthat now because they are shut down.\n  Food safety: Twelve days ago, 162 people in 10 States became ill with \nhepatitis A because of eating frozen berries. Right away the CDC got on \nthe job, sent their epidemiologists out there, tracked it down, \nisolated it, recalled it, and found out it was pomegranate berries from \nTurkey. Well, 162 people got Hepatitis A, but nobody else did. CDC is \nnot out there doing this now because they are shut down. That was just \n12 days ago.\n  What if we have another outbreak of food poisoning? How fast will it \nspread? How many people have to get sick? Is that what this Congressman \nfrom Iowa is saying, that we have to have more people get sick? Is that \nwhat he means when he says the sky hasn't fallen or the roof hasn't \ncaved in?\n  In August, cyclosporine infected 643 people from a salad mix. It \nstarted in my home State of Iowa. They immediately called the Centers \nfor Disease Control. The CDC got on it right away and found that this \nsalad mix was sent to 25 States. They recalled it all, traced it to \nsalad that had come from Mexico, and they stopped it.\n  How many people have to get sick? Do we have to have a West Nile \nvirus, hepatitis, e. coli, or a vast outbreak of the flu virus before \nthey say: Well, that is enough, I guess we can start the government up \nagain. It is totally irresponsible to say: Well, we can shut down the \ngovernment because the sky hasn't fallen and the roof hasn't caved in.\n  Members of Congress are getting their paycheck. They are coming to \nwork every day. We are here and we are getting our pay. How about all \nof those government workers who work on our staffs, on our committees, \nand run the Senate? They are good, hard-working public servants, and \nthey are out of work and not getting a paycheck.\n  I have staff people who don't make a lot of money. They have \nfamilies, a mortgage, and maybe a car payment to make, but they don't \nhave any money coming in. If they wanted to go to the credit union here \nto get a bridge loan to get them through the crisis, they can't because \nthe credit union is shut down. Now where do they go? Do they get the \nmoney from their credit card? I say to the Congressman from Iowa that \nfor these people the roof has caved in and the sky has fallen.\n  There are thousands of Head Start kids who will be sent home from \nHead Start this month and working parents will have to find something \nelse for them. What are they going to do? For them the sky has fallen \nand the roof has caved in. Don't we care about them?\n  I mentioned Social Security too. Social Security will still take your \nclaims and your application for a Social Security card, but that is it. \nYou won't get it because the backlog is backing up. They will take it, \nbut they won't process it.\n  I mentioned that 445,000 people call their Social Security office \nevery day in this country. They will not get an answer now. There are \n180,000 people who visit a Social Security office every day in this \ncountry, but they can't now because they are closed. They lost their \nMedicare card or Social Security card or they need a new Medicaid card.\n  There are 22,000 Americans who file for retirement benefits every day \nand 12,000 apply for disability benefits. They can still apply, but \nthey are not going to get any help. For them the sky has fallen and the \nroof has caved in.\n  What is this Congressman saying, that the sky has to fall on him and \nthe roof has to cave in on him before he will do something to help open \nthe government? And to hear them talk about it--a representative said \n``this is about the happiest'' she has been. This is a Congresswoman \nfrom Minnesota. ``This is about the happiest I've seen members in a \nlong time,'' she said.\n\n       ``We are very excited,'' said Representative Michele \n     Bachmann. ``It's exactly what we wanted, and we got it.''\n\n  Shutting down the government is exactly what they wanted and they got \nit.\n\n       ``It's wonderful,'' said Representative John Abney \n     Culberson of Texas, clapping his hands to emphasize his \n     point. ``We are 100 percent united.''\n\n  So this is where we are. The tea party group in the House is happy to \nshut down the government. It is the happiest they have been, they said. \nThey want this discord, disunity, chaos, and confusion. The American \npeople don't want that.\n  The American people don't want to turn their back on ObamaCare either \nbecause they see that now they are able to get coverage. Even if they \nhave a preexisting condition, they can get a good rate for themselves \nand their families which they could not get before.\n  Now it is time to open the government again, put people back to work \nso we can meet our responsibilities to the American people.\n  I call upon Speaker Boehner to take the continuing resolution that is \nsitting over in the House now--it is a continuing resolution that will \nopen the government. He says we wouldn't negotiate. We already \nnegotiated because before that we had one level of spending in the \nbill, they had a lower level of spending, and we agreed with them. We \ntook the lower level. We took the Republicans' level.\n  All he has to do is bring that to the House floor and it will pass in \nthe next 10 to 30 minutes. It will pass, and then we can open the \ngovernment so people can get back to work. The Centers for Disease \nControl can get their people back out in the field. The National \nInstitutes of Health will open once again. Head Start kids will be able \nto stay in their Head Start Programs. The Women, Infants, and Children \nfeeding program will be able to get the necessary nutritious food for \npoor kids and kids who are homeless.\n  All Speaker Boehner has to do to end this is to bring that bill on \nthe floor. He doesn't even have to vote for it. Congressman Boehner \ndoesn't have to vote for it. Just throw it out, and I will bet that \nenough moderate Republicans and Democrats will vote to pass it. I \nchallenge him to bring it out. Let's see what happens. That is the way \nto end this debacle right now.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been informed that I spoke \nincorrectly a few minutes ago when I said the credit union was closed. \nI guess one office is closed someplace, but another office is open and \nthey will take calls. So I guess the office in the Hart Building is \nstill open. I guess another office someplace else is closed. So I spoke \nincorrectly.\n  But I will continue to make this point: Isn't it a shame that our \nstaffs, who work hard, have to go to a credit union to borrow money to \nget them through this period of time, to meet a mortgage payment or a \ncar payment or whatever it is? We don't have to do that; we continue to \nget paid while we are here.\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\n  Again, in response to the remarks that, well, the sky hasn't fallen \nand the roof hasn't caved in, according to this Congressman from Iowa, \nfor someone who now has to borrow money, even from a credit union--I \nbelong to the credit union--for someone who has to borrow money from \nthe credit union, it is just not right. This is simply not right and \nanother reason why we have to call off this government shutdown, which, \nas I said, we could do in the next few minutes if Mr. Boehner would \njust put on the floor the continuing resolution he has over there and \nlet his people vote on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, we are now 3 days into a completely \nunnecessary, completely avoidable Republican shutdown, and there is \nmore talk than ever about the inability of our leaders to find common \nground on central, economic, and fiscal issues of our time.\n  This government shutdown is throwing a major wrench into a fragile \neconomic recovery. Nearly 1 million Federal employees are sitting at \nhome for no reason, and other public servants are working but not \nearning a paycheck. Cancer patients are being turned away from clinical \ntrials at the NIH. Veterans' benefits are at risk. Basic nutrition \nservices for pregnant women and new moms will be disrupted. Small \nbusinesses won't be able to get Federal loan guarantees. And all this \nis happening on top of the idiotic sequester--drastic, across-the-board \nspending cuts that have crippled Meals On Wheels, Head Start, and \ninvestments in medical research.\n  We all know how we got here. For years now we have heard a small \nminority in this country rail against government. When I hear the \nlatest tirades from some of the extremists in the House, I am struck by \nhow vague these complaints are. From their rhetoric, one would think \nthey believed that anytime we, the people, come together to improve our \nlives, the Nation is committing some terrible wrong. From their \nrhetoric, one would think they believe that the government that \nfunctions best is a government that doesn't function at all. So far, \nthey haven't ended government, but they have achieved the next best \nthing--shutting the government down.\n  But behind all the slogans of the tea party and all the thinly veiled \ncalls for anarchy in Washington, behind all that there is a reality. \nThe American people don't want the extremist Republicans' bizarre \nvision of a future without government. They don't support it. Why? \nBecause the American people know that without government, we would no \nlonger be a great nation with a bright future. The American people know \nthat government matters.\n  The anarchy gang is quick to malign government, but when was the last \ntime anyone called for regulators to go easier on companies that put \nlead in children's toys or for food inspectors to stop checking whether \nthe meat in our grocery stores is crawling with deadly bacteria or for \nthe FDA to ignore whether morning sickness drugs will cause horrible \ndeformities in little babies? We never hear that--not from political \nleaders in Washington and not from the American people. In fact, \nwhenever the anarchy gang makes headway in their efforts to damage our \ngovernment, the opposite happens. After the sequester kicked in, \nRepublicans immediately turned around and called on the technical \nfunding for our national defense and to keep the air traffic \ncontrollers on the job.\n  Now that the House Republicans have shut down the government, holding \nthe country hostage because of some imaginary health care bogeyman, \nRepublicans almost immediately turned around and called on us to start \nreopening parts of our government. Why did they do this? Because the \nbogeyman ``government'' is like the bogeyman under the bed. It is not \nreal. It doesn't exist.\n  What is real and what does exist are all the important work we as \nAmericans have chosen to do together through our government. In our \ndemocracy, government is not some make-believe thing that has an \nindependent will of its own. In our democracy, government is just how \nwe describe what we, the people, have already decided to do together. \nIt is not complicated. Our government has three basic functions: \nprovide for the national defense; put in place rules of the road, such \nas speed limits, and bank regulations that are fair and transparent; \nand build that which none of us can build alone--roads, power grids, \nschools--that which gives everyone a chance to succeed.\n\n  We are a nation of innovators and entrepreneurs, growing small \nbusinesses and thriving big businesses. But our people succeed, our \ncountry succeeds because we have all come together to put public \ninstitutions and infrastructure together. We all decided to pass laws \nand put cops on the beat so that no one steals a purse on Main Street \nor a pension on Wall Street. We all decided to invest in public \neducation so that businesses have skilled workers and a kid with an \nidea can create the next breakthrough company. We all decided to invest \nin basic science so there is a great pipeline of ideas to create our \nfuture. These achievements aren't magic. They didn't simply occur on \ntheir own or through dumb luck. In each instance we made a choice as a \npeople to come together.\n  The Food and Drug Administration makes sure the white pills we take \nare antibiotics and not baking soda. The National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration oversees crash tests to make sure all new cars \nhave effective brakes. The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes \nsure babies' car seats don't collapse in a crash and toasters don't \nexplode. We don't know who they are, but there is no question that \nthere are Americans alive today, Americans who are healthier, Americans \nwho are stronger, because of these and countless other government \nefforts--alive, healthier, stronger because of what we did together.\n  The anarchy gang in the House can dump on their make-believe version \nof government all they want, but when the real government fails to live \nup to the high expectations we have all set for it, politicians in both \nparties rush to outrage. Why? Because the American people know \ngovernment can work and believe government should work.\n  Today--that is right, today--marks the fifth anniversary of President \nBush signing the bank bailout into law. That financial crisis cost us \nupwards of $14 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t.'' That is \n$120,000 for every American household--more than 2 years' worth of \nincome for the average family. Billions of dollars in retirement \nsavings have disappeared, millions of workers lost their jobs, and \nmillions more families lost their homes.\n  In April 2011, after a 2-year bipartisan inquiry, the Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 635-page report \nthat made it plain: Regulators could have and should have used their \nexisting tools to prevent the crisis. Republicans and Democrats, a \nbipartisan group, found strong agreement that--we better believe it--\ngovernment matters.\n  The attacks on government are abstract, but the consequences of this \nshutdown are real: less accountability for cheaters and rule-breakers, \nless opportunity for our children, cracks in the foundations that \nbusinesses need to succeed, and a tilted playing field that limits \nopportunities for all of our people.\n  We know that government doesn't always work. We know no institution \nis infallible. People make mistakes, ideas fail, and sometimes we get \nit wrong. But our response isn't to give up. Our response isn't to sit \nback and say: I told you so. We are not a nation of quitters. Our \nresponse, the American response, is to fix it, to make government work \nbetter.\n  Our democracy is an experiment, and it is always evolving. We \nconstantly redesign and reimagine and improve on what we do together. \nBut time and time again throughout our history we have reaffirmed the \nsimple truth that government matters. Right now, right at this moment, \nif we look closely, we will see that we are reaffirming it once again. \nIt is not an accident that the desire to shut down government is \nconfined to one extremist faction of one political party of one Chamber \nof Congress of one branch of government. It is not an accident that \nthis extremist faction must resort to absurd hostage tactics--threats \nto turn off the government, threats to default on our debt, threats to \ntank the economy--to force their views on everyone else. It is not an \naccident that this faction is doing everything in its power to make \ngovernment appear dysfunctional.\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n  In a democracy, these hostage tactics are the last resort for those \nwho can't win their fights through elections, can't win their fights \nthrough Congress, can't win their fights for the Presidency, and can't \nwin their fights in courts. But these threats are not working and they \nwill never work because this is a democracy, and for more than 200 \nyears our democracy has defeated extremists and rejected the idea that \ngovernment does not matter.\n\n  So to those who have forced us to the brink, to those who rail \nagainst a make-believe government, to those who seem to rejoice in \nanarchy, to those who have salivated at the chance to shut down our \ngovernment because their extremist views have left them disconnected \nfrom the experiences of the American people, it is time to hear a \nsimple message:\n  You can do your best to make government look like it does not work \nwhen you stop it from working, you can do your best to make government \nlook paralyzed when you paralyze it, you can do your best to make \ngovernment look incompetent through your incompetence and through your \nineffectiveness, but sooner or later the government will reopen because \nthis is a democracy and this democracy has already rejected your views.\n  We have already chosen to work together because we all know we are \nstronger when we come together. And when this government reopens, when \nour markets are safe again, when our scientists can return to their \nresearch, when our small businesses can borrow, when our veterans can \nbe respected for their service, when our flu shots resume and our Head \nStart programs get back to teaching our kids, we will have rejected \nyour views once again.\n  We are not a country of anarchists. We are not a country of \npessimists and ideologues whose motto is ``I got mine. The rest of you \nare on your own.'' We are not a country that tolerates dangerous drugs, \nunsafe meat, dirty air, or toxic mortgages. We are not that nation, we \nhave never been that nation, and we will never be that nation.\n  Today, a political minority in the House that condemns government and \nbegged for this shutdown has had its day. But like all the reckless and \nextremist factions that have come before it, their day will pass and \nour democracy will return to the important work we have already chosen \nto do together.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I did not really expect to come down \nhere and speak. I was just checking on a judge vote, which I understand \nhas been postponed. But I do say this: It appears to me that the CR \ndiscussion and the debt ceiling discussion are going to be combined \nmaybe into one effort, and I just want to say that I think that is a \ngreat opportunity for all of us. I was down here yesterday talking \nabout the same.\n  Typically, when we have dealt with issues such as this, what we have \ntried to do together is figure out a way to strengthen our country \nthrough making those kinds of reforms that lessen the amount of \ndeficits we are going to have in the future. That is typically what \ndebates such as this have been about.\n  So I think the realization that people have right now--that we could \nwell try to deal with the CR and the debt ceiling at the same time--\ncould move us back into the kind of constructive conversation we have \nhad for so long around mandatory spending reforms, figuring out a way \nto keep spending reductions where they are but build upon them, but do \nit in a way that is more sensible than what we have done in the past.\n  So, again, I was beginning to get worried. And I will stop in a \nminute. It looks as if the senior Senator----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will my friend from Tennessee yield for \na question?\n  Mr. CORKER. I would be tremendously honored to take a question from \nthe distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator seen the polls of American public opinion \nabout what we are doing here? Has the Senator had a chance to see that?\n  Mr. CORKER. I do not pay as much attention to polls possibly as I \nshould. My understanding, in listening to the senior Senator from \nArizona, is they are not particularly favorable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. To all of us. To all of us.\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes. I did not mean to individuals.\n  Mr. McCAIN. To both sides of the aisle. And they do not understand, \nisn't it true, why we have not been able to come to some conclusion?\n  As the Senator from Tennessee just said, we now are going to have \nthis merged into the debt limit.\n  Mr. CORKER. Right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Tennessee has an extensive background in \nfinance. Isn't it true that the world markets would react in a very, \nvery severe fashion if we allowed the debt limit to expire?\n  Mr. CORKER. I think everyone understands that is very problematic for \nmarkets. Actually, we are beginning to see some volatility now that we \nhave not seen in the past.\n  I would like to respond, if I could, a little more fully to say that \nI think we have an opportunity--look, we have been in a place that I \nthink people have known. We have known exactly where the discussions in \nthe past were going to lead; that is, to this box canyon.\n  I think the fact that we have ended up in a place now where these two \nthings may merge--and I know the senior Senator from Arizona has been \ninvolved in multiple conversations about this--I think we have an \nopportunity now to begin talking again about those things that \nstrengthen our Nation and looking at some reforms, not to do so in a \nchicken way, in a way where you have two cars heading at each other, \nbut to use this like previous debt ceilings have been used where adults \nsit down, they look at the problems our Nation is facing, and we do \nsome things that, candidly, in a bipartisan way, people have been \ntrying to do for a long time.\n  I would like to mention one more time--I know I did this yesterday, \nand I know the senior Senator from Arizona and myself have spent a lot \nof time together on this issue--the President, in his budget in April, \nput forth some mandatory reforms. Many of those are pretty good. I \nwould like to make them better, but they are a pretty good start. We \nhave a few days--a week, 2 weeks--here where we could actually sit down \nmaybe and cobble something together that would mean that while all this \nacrimony has existed for some time, we might get back on target and \nback to focusing on making our country stronger.\n\n  I know today we were in this incredible hearing on Iran, and I \ncertainly appreciated the comments of the senior Senator from Arizona \nabout our concerns there. One of the biggest issues we have around the \nworld right now is just people look at us--as the Senator was alluding \nto a minute ago--as unable to deal with our fiscal issues.\n  So I look at what has happened. I know it can be viewed in whichever \nway you want to view it. I look at it as being a glass half full. We \nhave an opportunity over the next short period of time to do some good \npolicy, put some good policy in place, to pass a CR, to pass the debt \nceiling, and again move our country ahead toward being stronger.\n  I am sorry to respond with such a long answer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask just one more question of my friend from \nTennessee.\n  We know that sooner or later the government will begin to function \nagain--sooner or later.\n  Mr. CORKER. It will function again.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sooner or later we will address the debt ceiling because \nthe United States is not going to renege on its debts.\n  Mr. CORKER. That is right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is going to meet its obligations. So we know those are \nfacts. We know that at some point there is going to have to be a \nresolution. It is not going to go on forever. Nothing does. So if it \nargues for a solution, shouldn't we ask all parties to sit down and \nstart discussions that the Senator and I and others have had kind of on \nan ad hoc basis, sort of, with people here and there and then \nconversations here and there, to start laying the groundwork?\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\n  I also want to point out that I think it is important that the \nPresident of the United States, rather than saying ``I will not \nnegotiate with anybody under any circumstances,'' say ``I am willing to \nsit down and negotiate. I am willing to join with all parties in trying \nto find a way through this.''\n  We will sooner or later. The question is not whether we will solve \nthese issues. The question really is--and I ask my friend from \nTennessee--how much damage will be done before we solve it. Right now, \nthere are people beginning to hurt all over America, and maybe it is \nnot so bad right now, but it is going to get worse every single day \nthat goes by. Frankly, I think we owe the American people more than \nthat. Now, if somebody wants to blame me, fine. I will take the blame. \nIf they want to blame the Senator from Tennessee, put the blame on \nhim--on the President, on anybody. But shouldn't we remember what our \nduties are here?\n  Mr. CORKER. Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I am just looking down \nto see what the date is, but it seems to me that we have 2 weeks here, \nand to get to the Senator's comments, hopefully a week. In other words, \nthe quicker we resolve these issues, the better it is for our Nation, \nthe better it is for the world, because at the end of the day, let's \nface it, what we care about most is the well-being of our citizens back \nhome. We know that uncertainty creates uncertainty in the economy. It \naffects people's jobs. I would agree.\n  Look, we are at that moment in time where we have all realized the CR \nand the debt ceiling are probably going to be linked together. They are \nlinked together in essence, and, as the senior Senator from Arizona \njust mentioned, there is no question we are going to resolve those. So \nwhat we ought to do is sit down right now, the President of the United \nStates, the appropriate leadership here in the House and Senate--and \nwhether it is they or their proxies--but to sit down, and let's figure \nout if there are some reforms we can put in place to make our country \nstronger and to again get back on the right topic, which is our \nfinancial strength. I think we could do that.\n  The fact is that there are no new issues. Every single issue has been \nlitigated. There is legislative language. They are scored. There is not \na new issue for us to talk about relative to putting some good policy \nin place to move ahead.\n  The Senator from Arizona has been so involved in these issues. I just \ncould not agree more. I know the junior Senator from Arizona is sitting \nin the back, and I know he has been incredibly responsible fiscally.\n  I think we have an opportunity. I think this body should take \nadvantage of it. I think the President should come to the table, take \nadvantage of it, the leadership of the House. Let's do something good \nfor our country. Let's do it in an appropriate amount of time. Let's \nput this behind us and move on--move on as a nation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. CORKER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to thank my friend from \nTennessee, whose commitment to achieving solutions and resolution of \nthis bitter environment in which we find ourselves is admirable. I am \ngrateful for his participation and his leadership. I also thank my \nyoung, handsome colleague from Arizona, who also has had a many \nyearlong commitment to fiscal sanity and balance. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7165-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7165-S7166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk for a short \nperiod of time about Syria, which is, although not dominating our \nconversation here--lead stories in both the Washington Post and the \nWall Street Journal are deeply disturbing.\n  First, I would like to point out that on the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal today there is an article titled ``Syrian Regime Chokes \nOff Food To Town That Was Gassed.'' I repeat: ``Syrian Regime Chokes \nOff Food To Town That Was Gassed.''\n\n       Government forces are tightening the noose around one of \n     the suburbs gassed by chemical weapons in August, raising \n     concerns of a fresh humanitarian crisis as residents forage \n     for olives, grapevine leaves and other basic foods.\n       Pro-regime fighters--\n\n  That is Bashar al-Assad's killers--\n\n       have encircled about 12,000 people, mostly civilians but \n     also including some rebel fighters, in the town of \n     Moadhamiya, according to local and international aid workers, \n     opposition activists and people interviewed on Monday in a \n     government-controlled section of the town.\n\n  This is a town that is strategically important to both sides because \nthe flow of humanitarian and military aid flows through this particular \narea for those who are fighting in Aleppo and in Damascus.\n  The story goes on:\n\n       ``We won't allow them to be nourished in order to kill \n     us,'' said a 24-year-old pro-regime paramilitary in the \n     government-controlled section. . . . ``Let them starve for a \n     bit, surrender and then be put on trial.''\n\n  These are the same people, apparently government forces, that are \n``cooperating'' with us on chemical weapons, that are allowing \ninspectors to come in to gather the chemical weapons. So they have \n12,000 people encircled, that they have already gassed, 1,400 of them, \n400 children in the same town. So now they are going to starve them. \nLike the fighters said, ``Let them starve for a bit, surrender and then \nbe put on trial.''\n  It is remarkable. An opposition activist inside the rebel-held side \nof the town who was reached by Skype said the situation is so dire now \nin the rebel-controlled area that people are subsisting on whatever \nthey can forage locally, including olives, grapevine leaves, fresh \nmint, and figs.\n  So here we have the latest result of our wonderful and much heralded \nagreement on chemical weapons. They killed, in this town, 1,400 people, \n400 of them children, with gas. Now they are going to kill 12,000 more \nwith conventional weapons: bombs, guns, tanks, knives. Brutality and \ntorture has characterized their behavior for a long period of time.\n  It seems to me it is a little bizarre. It is a little bizarre that we \nare hailing this cooperation from Bashar Assad on chemical weapons, and \nmeanwhile the slaughter goes on: 110,000 dead, 1 million children \nrefugees, the surrounding countries being destabilized, and, of course, \nthe refugee camps are terrible situations to which we have not given \nthe assistance that we should.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, if they had the opportunity, to visit \none of these refugee camps and hear the stories of the murder, the gang \nrapes, the torture that is the official doctrine of Bashar Assad, not \nrandom acts of violence. The defectors from Bashar Assad's military \nwill tell you that is their training and indoctrination and \ninstructions.\n  So the second article today is from the Washington Post. ``CIA \nramping up covert training program for moderate Syrian rebels.''\n\n       The CIA is expanding a clandestine effort to train \n     opposition fighters in Syria amid concern that moderate U.S.-\n     backed militias are rapidly losing ground in the country's \n     civil war.\n       But the CIA program is so miniscule that it is expected to \n     produce only a few hundred trained fighters each month even \n     after it is enlarged, a level that officials said will do \n     little to bolster rebel forces that are being eclipsed by \n     radical Islamists in the fight against the government of \n     Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n  Here is the interesting part.\n\n       The CIA's mission, officials said, has been defined by the \n     White Houses's desire to seek a political settlement, a \n     scenario that relies on an eventual stalemate among the \n     warring factions rather than a clear victor. As a result, \n     officials said, limits on the agency's authorities enable it \n     to provide enough support to help ensure that politically \n     moderate, U.S.-supported militias don't lose but not enough \n     for them to win.\n\n  Picture these young people who are fighting in Syria today. The \nofficial U.S. policy is that they will provide weapons but only enough \nso they cannot win. Those people are being slaughtered. They are being \nmurdered. They are dying. Some 110,000 have died. I am not sure how \nmany of them were actual fighters. The official U.S. policy, according \nto the Washington Post, is that they want them not to win.\n  It is hard to motivate people to fight for a cause that we are not \nwilling to help them win.\n\n       The agency has trained fewer than 1,000 rebel fighters this \n     year, current and former U.S. officials said. By contrast, \n     U.S. intelligence analysts estimate that more than 20,000 \n     have been trained to fight for government-backed militias by \n     Assad's ally Iran\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\n     and the Hezbollah militant network it sponsors.\n\n  So we have trained 1,000. We are going to do about 100 a week, I \nguess, something like that. More than 20,000 have been trained by the \nIranians, who are all in, and we expect them to be able to continue \nfighting.\n\n       The CIA is ramping up its effort . . . it was clear that \n     the opposition was losing, and not only losing tactically but \n     on a more strategic level.\n\n  Congressman Mike Rogers, whom I respect a lot, Chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, said there is a--\n\n       . . . high degree of frustration . . . with the Syrian \n     strategy. The situation in Syria is changing faster than the \n     administration can keep up. U.S. support for moderate \n     opposition groups is less than robust and has been hobbled by \n     inconsistent resource allocation with stated goals.\n       CIA veterans expressed skepticism that the training and \n     weapons deliveries will have any meaningful effect. In \n     Jordan, operatives involved in training and arming rebels \n     lament that we're being asked to do something with nothing.\n\n  I would like to quote some articles:\n  ``Al-Qaeda expands in Syria via Islamic State.''\n\n       A rebranded vision of Iraq's al-Qaeda affiliate is surging \n     onto the front lines of the war in neighboring Syria, \n     expanding into territory seized by other rebel groups and \n     carving out the kind of sanctuaries that the U.S. military \n     spent more than a decade fighting to prevent in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  We left Iraq. Iraq is now deteriorating. Thousands of people are \nbeing killed literally every month. Now we see Al Qaeda coming from \nIraq in larger and larger numbers.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the Wall Street Journal article from \nsome time ago:\n  ``Iranians Dial Up Presence in Syria. Shiite Militiamen From Across \nthe Arab World Train at a Base Near Tehran to Do Battle in Syria.''\n\n       At a base near Tehran, Iranian forces are training Shiite \n     militiamen from across the Arab world to do battle in Syria--\n     showing the widening role of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps in Syria's bloody war.\n       The busloads of Shiite militiamen from Iraq, Syria and \n     other Arab states have been arriving at the Iranian base in \n     recent weeks, under cover of darkness, for instruction in \n     urban warfare and the teaching of Iran's clerics, according \n     to Iranian military figures and residents in the area. The \n     fighters' mission: Fortify the Syrian regime of President \n     Bashar al-Assad against Sunni rebels, the U.S. and Israel.\n\n  So here is what we should take away from all this recent reporting: \nDespite the recent agreement on chemical weapons, that agreement does \nnothing to address the underlying conflict in Syria, which not only \ncontinues but is getting worse and worse.\n  So, my friends, as the administration trumpets this deal of chemical \nweapons, the fact is that the slaughter goes on. It is clear to these \npeople whom I have spoken with personally, tragically their morale is \nbadly damaged. They believe they have been abandoned. The ongoing \ntragedy and massacre continues in Syria. The United States will pay a \nvery heavy price in the future unless we do something rather dramatic.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncongratulate Bob Herbert on his recent promotion to Brigadier General \nin the United States Army National Guard. Today I had the honor to \npreside over his promotion ceremony in the Mansfield Room. Bob has been \na loyal member of my staff for the past 14 years. But he had also given \n38 years of loyal military service to Nevada and our Nation.\n  Bob Herbert grew up the son of a military man, retired MSG Robert W. \nHerbert. From an early age Bob had a great fascination with military \naviation. Before he graduated from high school in Slinger, WI, Bob \njoined the Army to fly in a unique program known as ``High School to \nFlight School.'' Once he completed flight school, Bob was posted in \nGermany, where he flew patrols along the borders between East and West \nGermany during the Cold War era. After a successful 3-year tour in \nGermany, Bob completed his undergraduate work at Embry-Riddle \nAeronautical University. Shortly after graduation, he attended test \npilot school and earned the title of Army test pilot.\n  As a test pilot, he flew both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, \nincluding helicopters, which we all know are important to both modern \nmilitary missions and for fighting fires and responding to emergencies \nin the civilian world.\n  After 6 years of active duty with the Army, Bob moved to Reno, where \nhe transitioned to the Nevada Army National Guard. As a member of the \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee, I had the opportunity to meet with \nBob Herbert about the needs of the Nevada Guard. I quickly found that \nBob was not only an outstanding military officer but was excellent with \nnumbers and figures surrounding the Military's budget and equipment.\n  At my request, Bob arranged to come to Washington where he worked as \na fellow with the Brookings Institution. During that time, he was \nassigned to me, and worked closely with my staff on Nevada military \nissues as well as national defense policy and appropriations. During \nhis time as a fellow, Bob was promoted by the military and I had the \nprivilege of pinning Bob with his Lieutenant Colonel insignia.\n  When his fellowship concluded, I asked Bob to join my staff here in \nWashington, D.C. Bob had become an important part of my office and his \nexpertise would have been hard to replace. Over the years I have grown \nto depend on his judgment and advice, not just about military matters \nbut about many other issues. He has always made sound decisions and is \nable to bring simple common sense to complex issues.\n  I was pleased when Bob decided to work for me full time on military \nand veterans' affairs, as well as transportation and technology issues. \nThroughout his time on my staff, Bob has also remained committed to the \nArmy and continued to serve his National Guard unit in Nevada. While \nworking full-time on my staff, Bob earned a master's degree in public \nadministration from George Washington University, my alma mater.\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\n  After working in Washington D.C. for 4 years, I asked Bob to return \nto Nevada to work in one of my district offices. Bob had a nice home in \nReno and I think he was excited to return to his house and his \nmotorcycle. Little did he know, I needed him to work out of my Las \nVegas office. But Bob never flinched and moved from Reno to Las Vegas.\n  After my elevation to the position of Democratic Leader, I once again \nasked Bob to return to Washington to help with my defense and military \nportfolio. I know that Bob was disappointed to leave Nevada, but he has \nmore than made up for that disappointment by purchasing three \nadditional motorcycles while working here in Washington, for a total of \nfour motorcycles. His most recent motorcycle is a Harley-Davidson \ncustom softail. Like a good parent he ensures that he spends quality \ntime with each bike and enjoys riding nearly every weekend on the \nbackroads of West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. He ultimately \nplans to have one BMW and one Harley-Davidson on each coast to optimize \nhis motorcycle adventures.\n  For almost 38 years, Brigadier General Herbert has honorably served \nour Nation in the enlisted, warrant officer, and officer ranks. As \nBrigadier General he is currently assigned as the Assistant to the \nAdjutant General for the Nevada Army National Guard. And he has flown \nmore than 7,000 hours as a pilot, splitting time between helicopters \nand fixed-wing aircraft.\n  I am very so grateful for Bob's service--for his service to his \ncountry, to the state of Nevada and to me. I appreciate his loyalty so \nmuch. Congratulations, General Herbert, on this well-deserved \npromotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7167-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING SUZANNE SCOTT\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Stephanie and I wish to pay \ntribute to the life and legacy of Suzanne ``Sue'' Scott. Sue passed \naway on September 9, 2013. Her husband, Walter, and the entire Scott \nand Singer families remain in our thoughts and prayers during this sad \ntime. Her loving family, special circle of friends, and many admirers \nthroughout the State of Nebraska and this great Nation are mourning her \npassing and reflecting on her remarkable life of service.\n  Sue truly embodied compassion in action, lending her time and talents \nto many community organizations. She leaves behind a wonderful legacy. \nOne could list the many brick and mortar improvements attributed to Sue \nand identify them as her legacy. This is true and itself worthy of \nacknowledgement. But, there is a much more profound aspect of her \nlegacy. It is the remarkable example of selfless and tireless service \nto others, which will inspire generations to come. She gave of herself: \nnot only in name, but in genuine service to others. Sue was not afraid \nto roll up her sleeves and do the real work of volunteering. Her \nremarkable leadership extended to: Children's Hospital & Medical \nCenter, Children's Hospital & Medical Center Foundation, Boys & Girls \nClubs of the Midlands, Omaha Zoological Society, and Joslyn Art Museum, \namong others. With Walter, she delighted in supporting the Kingdoms of \nthe Seas Aquarium at the Henry Doorly Zoo and the Recital Hall at the \nHolland Performing Arts Center, bearing their names, in addition to \nnumerous other philanthropic contributions. I am confident I speak for \nall Nebraskans in thanking the Scotts--indeed, Sue and Walter made an \noutstanding team--for their commitment to the community and willingness \nto help neighbors in need.\n  Thanks to the Scotts, ``The Good Life'' in Nebraska has been made \neven better and will surely remain vibrant for years to come. Sue's \nvolunteerism and her can-do attitude will continue to serve as a worthy \nexample for others to follow. Though Sue is no longer with us, her \nspirit will surely live on through those who follow her example and \nanswer the call to community service and share their time, talents and \ntreasure with fellow citizens.\n  We are saddened by her passing and wish to again extend our heartfelt \nsympathy to Walter and the Singer and Scott families. May God bless \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/03/senate-section/article/S7167-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolutions, without amendment:\n\n       H.R. 3233.

A resolution adopted by the City Council of South \n     Bend, Indiana petitioning for use of the Vice-Presidential \n     Seal; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n       POM-151. A resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of \n     the State of West Virginia urging the United States Congress \n     to protect the Social Security benefits that aid our most \n     vulnerable citizens; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Social Security cost of living adjustments are \n     currently based on the Consumer Price Index released annually \n     by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The United \n     States Congress is considering changing the annual cost of \n     living adjustments calculated for Social Security recipients; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Chained Consumer Price Index finds smaller \n     increases in consumer prices than the traditional Consumer \n     Price Index by estimating how consumers may change their \n     buying habits as prices change; and\n       Whereas, According to the Center for Economic and Policy \n     Research, changing to the Chained Consumer Price Index would \n     result in significant cuts to Social Security benefits: a cut \n     of roughly three percent after 10 years, about six percent \n     after 20 years, and close to nine percent over 30 years. For \n     the average worker retiring at age 65, this would mean a cut \n     of about $650 each year by age 75 and a cut of roughly $1,130 \n     each year at age 85; and\n       Whereas, AARP estimates that this change would cut Social \n     Security benefits by $112 billion over the next 10 years, \n     leaving seniors struggling to keep up with the rising cost of \n     utilities, health care and prescription drugs. Cuts would \n     start now and get bigger every year; and\n       Whereas, The AARP estimates that ninety-two percent of West \n     Virginians 65 or older, approximately 277,734 people, receive \n     Social Security benefits. The average annual benefit is \n     $13,500. Social Security makes up 70 percent of the annual \n     income for a typical older West Virginian and 77 percent of \n     annual incomes for low- and middle-income seniors: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the West Virginia House of Delegates, That the \n     West Virginia House of Delegates urges the United States \n     Congress to protect the Social Security benefits that aid our \n     most vulnerable citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the West Virginia House of Delegates \n     requests that the West Virginia Congressional Delegation \n     support protecting Social Security for West Virginia seniors \n     and vulnerable residents by voting against any legislation \n     that would base cost of living adjustments to the Chained \n     Consumer Price Index; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the West Virginia House of \n     Delegates mail a copy of this resolution to the Vice \n     President of the United States and the President pro tempore \n     of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority and Minority Leaders of both \n     Houses of Congress, and to each United States Senator and \n     Member of the House of Representatives from West Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-152.
