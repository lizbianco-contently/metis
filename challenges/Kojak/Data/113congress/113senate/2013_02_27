Thank you, Senator Reid.\n  I rise today to thank Chaplain Ronald L. Derrick for joining us today \nto offer the Senate's opening prayer. I am honored to have the \nprivilege of welcoming this esteemed Idahoan to the U.S. Senate to \nserve as our guest chaplain.\n  Chaplain Derrick, who is joining us from Rigby, ID, has many years of \nservice to our community and our Nation. He served our Nation in the \nU.S. Army from 1966 to 1968. He retired from his Bonneville County, ID, \njob after 23 years as a printer and mail clerk and he is also a former \ncounty coroner, Driggs Chamber of Commerce president, and volunteer EMT \nfirefighter. In 1987, the American Legion recognized Chaplain Derrick \nas Idaho's firefighter of the year.\n  Chaplain Derrick was ordained into the ministry in 1979 through the \nSolid Rock Pentecostal Church, and he continues to serve in various \naspects of ministry. Reflecting his long spiritual contributions to the \ncommunity, he was given the high honor of serving as National Chaplain \nof the American Legion for the 2012-2013 term. Through this position, \nhe performs and oversees services and provides prayers and guidance for \nthe Legion's 2.4 million members. As a 40-year member of the American \nLegion, he has a strong connection with his fellow veterans, \nservicemembers, and the communities he serves. In addition to serving \nas National Chaplain, he has served at a number of other leadership \npositions in the American Legion. Truly, his devotion to those in his \ncommunity and his Nation has touched the lives of many in civic and \nspiritual ways.\n  Chaplain Derrick has been married for 45 years to his wife Bird, who \nserves as the Department of Idaho Auxiliary Chaplain. They have three \nchildren: Tim, Andrew, and Dana Sue, and nine grandchildren.\n  Chaplain Derrick, thank you for your dedication and service and the \nblessing you are bringing to the Senate today.\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nThis Congress and our Nation have considerable challenges ahead. These \nchallenges require fortitude and understanding. I join you in praying \nfor our country, and greatly value your prayer today and your service.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week, Speaker Boehner made some harsh \naccusations. I will not repeat them here on the Senate floor. Suffice \nit to say he thinks the Senate isn't moving quickly enough to avert the \nsequester--the across-the-board-cuts that will cost 750,000 Americans \ntheir jobs unless Congress acts and acts quickly.\n  The Speaker's charge is really weak sauce, considering that House \nRepublicans spent 2 months refining the art of doing nothing. The \nallegation is stranger still given the Speaker doesn't even have his \nown proposal to prevent the deep cuts that will strike within 2 days. \nIn fact, the House Republicans' entire strategy for the Congress is to \nsit on the sidelines.\n  And Republicans won't work with Democrats. The Republicans have \nfailed to make their own proposals and refuse to compromise on a \nbalanced plan to avoid harsh austerity measures. Democrats, on the \nother hand, have proposed a balanced solution to this sequester--a \nproposal to reduce the deficit by making smart spending cuts, closing \nwasteful tax loopholes, and asking multimillionaires to pay a little \nbit more.\n  We will vote this week on our plan--a plan supported by three-\nquarters of Americans and almost 60 percent of Republicans. But once \nagain, Republicans are too busy fighting amongst themselves to unite \nbehind a course of action. They are, instead, doing nothing--zero.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said:\n\n       The man who achieves makes many mistakes, but he never \n     makes the biggest mistake of all--doing nothing.\n\n  Republicans appear poised to make the biggest mistake of all. They \nare prepared to let the sequester's painful arbitrary cuts take effect.\n  Across the country, meat inspectors, air traffic controllers, FBI \nagents, and Border Patrol agents will be furloughed and 70,000 boys and \ngirls will be kicked out of Head Start.\n  These cuts will not be felt in the next few days, but they will start \nquickly, Lord knows. The notices that go out in 90 days will cut off \nall contractual payments to whoever gets a warning notice. So within a \nmatter of weeks, we are going to feel these cuts and feel them really \npainfully.\n  As I said, 70,000 boys and girls will be kicked out of Head Start, \nthousands of researchers working to cure diseases such as cancer, \nAlzheimer's, and other dread diseases will be laid off, hundreds of \nthousands of Defense Department employees will take forced furloughs, \ncreating hardship for their families and threatening national security.\n  To make sure everyone understands, this is not President Obama's \nsequester, because 174 House Republicans voted for this and 28 \nRepublican Senators voted for this. That is 60 percent of Republican \nSenators and 75 percent of the House Republicans Members who voted for \nthis. Congress has the power to avoid these self-inflicted wounds, but \nDemocrats can't do it alone. Republicans must do their part. Compromise \nis never easy, but surely it is better than doing nothing at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S882-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for months now I have been coming to \nthe floor to urge my colleagues on the other side to help us replace \nthe President's sequester proposal. Yet here we are, just 2 days to go \nuntil the cuts hit, and the Democrats who control Washington still \nhaven't put forward a serious bipartisan plan--not the President and \nnot his allies in Congress. They prefer to keep it alive as a political \nissue instead. Now, less than 48 hours before the clock runs out, all \nwe are offered is a gimmicky tax hike that is designed to fail.\n  Look, I hope they are not expecting a round of applause for this \nparticular act of political bravery. Is it any wonder the American \npeople are so fed up with Washington? The American people didn't send \nus here to play games, they sent us here to solve problems. That means \ngetting spending under control and putting the economy back on track.\n  The American people are clearly tired of the gimmicks. I can't tell \nyou how many letters and e-mails and phone calls I have received about \nthis sequester issue in particular, and the messages my constituents \nkeep sending are simply this: Replacing spending cuts that both parties \nalready agreed to, and to which the President already signed into law, \nwith tax hikes is simply unacceptable.\n  One Kentuckian from Springfield put it this way:\n\n       Hold strong and do not give in to more spending . . . \n     Normal folks must adjust their budgets . . . so must the \n     government.\n\n  Another constituent said it was important to stand firm in the face \nof the President's endless campaigning. ``Make him keep his promise of \na balanced approach,'' she wrote, and that means one thing: ``Cut \nspending.''\n  A woman from Bowling Green urged me to ``hold firm against spending \nand kicking the can down the road.''\n  She wants me to hold firm against that--spending and kicking the can \ndown the road. She said:\n\n       I have had to cut, cut, cut. The least our government \n     should do is seriously make cuts.\n\n  And, of course, she is entirely right. It is absurd to think the \ngovernment cannot get by with a little more than a 2-percent reduction \nin spending when every working American had to figure out how to make \ndo with 2 percent less in their paychecks just last month.\n  Some have raised concerns about a proposal that would give agency \nheads more discretion in prioritizing these cuts. I understand those \nconcerns, but let's be clear about the goal here. The goal isn't to \nhand over congressional authority, it is to make sure these cuts \nactually happen and that we don't cut a penny less than we promised the \nAmerican people we would cut a year and a half ago.\n  Look, we know most Americans think Washington's spending problem \nshould be addressed by cutting spending. So when the President goes off \non a campaign for higher taxes instead of working with Republicans to \nreplace the sequester with smarter cuts, and when Senate Democrats put \nforward tax hike gimmicks instead of negotiating serious spending-cut \nsolutions, Americans feel as though they are not being listened to.\n  And they have reason to be upset. They sent a divided government here \nto Washington, but they expect it to work. The President may not like \nthat fact. He may wish things were different. But he wasn't elected to \nwork with the Congress he wants, he was elected to work with the \nCongress he has, and that means working with both parties to get things \ndone. It means leaving the gimmicks behind and working with us to \nhammer out a smarter solution to his sequester.\n  Republicans have been calling for Democrats to work with us on the \nsequester over and over. We are still ready to work with them to get \nsomething responsible passed, but we can't do it alone. The President's \nparty runs Washington. It is time they got off the campaign trail and \nstarted working with us to govern for a change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S882-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the impact of \nsequester on the American people, on their safety, their security, our \neconomy, and the way local and State governments can use wise resources \nto protect their people.\n  I know we have each been assigned 10 minutes. I have a robust number \nof Appropriations Committee members who want to speak. I will ask the \nChair to let me know when I have used 5 minutes, and if Senator \nLandrieu arrives, I will then yield to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I come today not only as the chair of the entire \nAppropriations Committee but as the chair of the subcommittee that \nfunds the Commerce Department, Justice Department, and the majority of \nour science agencies.\n  I wish to talk about the impact on public safety and our future, but \nyou have to know I come with a heavy heart.\n  I note and bring to the attention of my colleagues that a guard was \nkilled in a Federal prison on Monday. This guard worked at the Federal \npenitentiary in Canaan, PA. He was stabbed and attacked by a prisoner \nwith homemade weapons. The entire Justice Department, the Office of \nPrisons, the union people who represent them, all mourn at Mr. Eric \nWilliams' death. We don't know the full extent, and I will be asking \nfor a report on the investigation on how this happened. But one of the \nthings I do know as the chair of the committee, we face prison \novercrowding. We have Federal prisons, some we don't even open because \nwe refuse to put the money in.\n  You can say: Well, Senator Barb, you are on the committee. Why don't \nyou put the money in? We are in gridlock, deadlock, hammerlock on not \nbeing able to move our bills in regular order with due diligence and \noversight. That is why we are at this crisis of sequester: Oh, boy. \nCan't we just cut 2 percent like American families?\n  American families don't run prisons. They don't build their own \nroads. They don't have to put out their own local police department. \nThey depend on their government to do that. They are willing to expend \nrevenue, pay taxes so they are protected. There are reasons people are \nin Federal prison. They were bad guys and gals who did bad things, and \nwhen they are in prison, they still want to do bad things, such as \nattack a prison guard. Do you know what sequester will mean? Across-\nthe-board cuts. It will have a direct impact on America's prisons.\n  Oh, sure. The prisoners will still have their food. They will still \nhave their hour to be able to do their exercise. But the prison guards \nwill face furloughs, layoffs, and even reductions in the workforce. We \nare placing them at risk while they protect us from risk. Where are our \nnational priorities?\n  One of the ways we can honor this man is to get serious about our \nappropriations process. I wish to cancel the sequester and come up with \na balanced solution of revenues and strategic, targeted cuts, not \nacross-the-board cuts to 1,300 correctional guards who might face \nlayoffs.\n  About our Federal prosecutors. We in Maryland have one of the best \nU.S. attorneys going after violent gangs, drug cartels, child \npredators, mortgage frauds. But we are going to say to those smart \nlawyers who can make megabucks in law firms, stick with us. But when \nyou do, you can be laid off and furloughed. Why is it that the \ncriminals are able to hire the lawyers, but the Federal Government \ndoesn't want to pay for them? Priorities.\n  We need to be able to have the right law enforcement at the Federal \nand State level to catch the bad guys, whether it is white-collar \ncrime, such as mortgage fraud, or street crime, or despicable crimes \nsuch as trafficking in women and children.\n  We have to look out for our FBI, our major force in counterterrorism. \nThey face, again, layoffs, and it will go to our local law enforcement. \nWe will be cutting the funds for things such as the Byrne grants, which \nenable local law enforcement to put cops on the beat and buy the \nequipment they need to protect themselves. There is a program here that \nwe have a line item. It is not the biggest thing in the Federal budget, \nbut it is the biggest thing to cops. Why? Because it buys bulletproof \nvests.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I advise the Senator she has \nconsumed 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I could talk another 55. I could talk another 505. But \nI want everyone to get the point that cuts have consequences. So things \nsuch as, oh, why don't we cut the budget as families do--well, let's do \nwhat families do. They, first of all, make plans and stick to them. I \nthink it is time we have a regular order.\n  I want to deal with this sequester now. I want to look at this thing \ncalled the continuing resolution so it resolves the funding for fiscal \n2013, for fiscal 2014, to work on a bipartisan basis across the aisle \nand across the dome. Let's look at our spending, how we protect the \nAmerican people, and make public investments that help create jobs \ntoday and jobs tomorrow.\n  In conclusion, before I turn to my most able subcommittee chair on \nHomeland Security, Senator Landrieu, I just wish to say to the family \nof Officer Eric Williams, the entire Senate wishes to express its \ncondolences to the family. I believe we can show our deepest sympathy \nby making sure it doesn't happen in our Federal prisons. Let's get on \nand solve the problem of sequester. Let's work together and get the job \ndone.\n  I yield to Senator Landrieu, the chair of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, a very crucial committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate--and we all do--all the \nSenators, even Senators on the other side of the aisle I think admire \nher tenacity and her leadership and, most importantly, her knowledge \nand understanding of the importance of the Federal budget on the \nprivate sector economy. Obviously, the Senator from Maryland \nunderstands its impacts on Maryland, but she also understands the \nimpacts to our Nation.\n  No one speaks more passionately and more knowledgeably about the \nchallenges before families than Senator Barbara Mikulski from Maryland, \nfrom a working-class family herself. Her parents and grandparents, \nimmigrants to this country, operating a small business, a bakery--a \nwonderful business--not only understanding how to run their own \nbusiness themselves but for all the neighbors who came in every day to \ntalk about their problems.\n  When the Senator says she knows what families do in tight budget \ntimes, she is correct. Families do cut back, but they plan their \nreductions. They don't pull the rug out from underneath the college \ntuition for their kids. They don't kick grandma out on the street and \nput her in a homeless shelter. They make smart decisions about budgets. \nLet me say to my colleagues on the other side who fail to understand \nthe other part of the equation, they also try to bring in more revenue \nto the family base. Either the wife gets a job or the husband gets a \njob or the wife goes back to school to get a nursing degree so instead \nof making $6 an hour, she can bring in $16 or $18 an hour.\n  Families work on both sides of the equation. But for some reason, we \nhave half this Chamber that only wants to work on one side of the \nequation. It is only about cuts, cuts, and more cuts, even though they \nare senseless, they are dangerous, they do not make sense for our \ncountry, and they most certainly don't just impact the government--of \ncourse, which is the enemy of the other side--they impact our economy. \nThey impact our ability to grow this economy. Every cut that comes down \nin a senseless way, and even cuts that are planned, are harmful to the \nprivate sector.\n  I know this not only as a Senator from Louisiana and chair of the \nHomeland Security Committee but particularly as chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee. Our phone has been ringing off the hook with small \nbusinesses--not government workers but private sector workers and \ncontractors--that are afraid, and have every reason to be, about the \nresults of this sequester to their bottom line because they are \nproviding the government a good service or a product the government \nneeds, whether it is in health care, whether it is in education or \nwhether it is in homeland security. But I digress a little bit. So let \nme get back to the central message as chair of Homeland Security.\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\n  I rise to speak in opposition to the damaging sequester that is \nscheduled to take effect this Friday. There is no question Congress \nmust act to reduce our annual deficits--must continue to act. Let me \nunderline ``continue.'' We have been reducing spending. We have set \ntargets of spending lower than what would have normally been set \nbecause we are tightening our belts. We were trying to tighten our \nbelts even at a time when the economy was shrinking. Most economists \nwill tell us that in times of economic constriction, governments need \nto spend more money to try to prime the pump to get the country moving \nin the right direction. The President has led in this direction. We \nhave helped to follow his lead; therefore, avoiding the worsening of a \ndepression and a recession.\n  But contrary to the evidence all over the place that this is working, \nthe other side is going to ratchet it down with these senseless \nreductions--and even well-planned reductions at this point are very \ndifficult--and rejecting a balanced approach which Democrats have \ncalled for. Most independent observers understand we have to have an \nincrease of revenues coming in because we are at the lowest level to \nthe GDP since Eisenhower was President and some continued reductions. \nBut they are rejecting that and going cuts only, cuts only. They said: \nWe raised revenues. That is it. We raised $600 billion. We can't go any \nmore. I am here to tell you, we have to go a little bit more, and the \nsooner we do that, the better we are going to be.\n  There are people who make over $1 million in this country or \ncompanies that are enjoying loopholes they shouldn't be enjoying at the \nexpense of the middle class and at the expense of the economic growth \npotential of this country, which is substantial, contrary to the \nlaments on the other side of this aisle that the sky is falling.\n  Every businessperson I talk to says: You know what, Senator. There is \nsuch promise out there. This energy industry is getting ready to boom. \nNatural gas is a great blessing to our Nation. But we may not \nexperience any of that because we can't get 5 cents to invest in an \nairport or dredge one of the bayous or rivers in my State because of \nthe tightening down of these spending cuts.\n  The other side of the aisle, despite the mounting evidence, continues \nto argue against any revenues. Their cuts-only approach, cut it all, \ncut it now; don't worry about what you cut, just cut it, is not going \nto lead this country to economic prosperity.\n  The reality is our deficit reduction so far has been completely \nlopsided: 72 percent has come from spending cuts, only 28 percent from \nrevenues. It is not balanced, and we have to find a balance. We have \nalready cut $1.5 trillion from discretionary spending over 10 years. In \nrecent years, revenues coming in to the Federal Government as a \npercentage of GDP were at the lowest levels since Eisenhower. I said 16 \npercent. My notes say 15.1 percent. So let me correct myself. I didn't \nrealize it was that low. I thought it was 16.7.\n  So while I support cuts--and have supported them in the past and \ncontinue to try to find them in my own budget, $42 billion for Homeland \nSecurity--we must have a balance.\n  This sequester that is going to go into effect in Louisiana will cost \nus $15.8 million in funding for primary and secondary education. Early \nHead Start services will be cut to over 1,400 children who desperately \nneed a better start in life. Our ability to develop oil and gas will \nslow down due to Interior Department cuts. Louisiana's Department of \nDefense civilian employees--over 7,000--will be furloughed, costing \nLouisiana residents $36 million in gross pay.\n  As chairman of the committee, I am asking for the Senate to consider \nthe impacts of these cuts on securing our homeland. We have made a \ntremendous amount of progress. We have avoided attacks, and some have \nbeen very close calls. This is not done because of a wish and a prayer. \nThis is done because of smart research, investing in border security, \ninvesting in cybersecurity, investing in training of local police \nofficers who can identify threats on the ground, whether it is in New \nYork or Baton Rouge or New Orleans. We have avoided some attacks. As \nthe Senator from Washington State knows, this does not just happen by \nmagic. This happens because we are making investments in people, in \ntheir training. This is at risk today.\n  The sequester would effectively decrease the number of Border Patrol \nagents by 5,000.\n  I wish to make a statement and ask for 2 more minutes. I understand \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from South \nCarolina, Lindsey Graham, met with the President to talk about \nimmigration reform. I am very glad we may make some progress on \nbipartisan support for immigration reform. Clearly, the country is \nasking for it, the business community needs it, our agricultural sector \nneeds it, and the Latino population deserves it. But are we going to \ntry to do education reform on a reduced budget in Homeland Security? \nWhat do they expect us to do in a Homeland Security budget without \ngiving us some additional resources to hire the additional judges who \nare going to be needed, the additional patrols, et cetera? So I ask \nSenator McCain, how are we going to afford this in the Homeland \nSecurity budget? I look forward to having that discussion with him. On \ncyber security, the sequester would delay for a year the ability of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to deploy technology to protect our \nFederal computer systems from attack.\n\n  In the last minute I have, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter we received this morning from Secretary Napolitano, \nwho is preparing her agency for difficult tasks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Department of\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 26,2013.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu, Chairman,\n     Subcommittee on Homeland Security Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Landrieu: Thank you for your comments during \n     the Senate Appropriations Committee's February 14, 2013, \n     hearing on sequestration. I share your deep concerns and \n     wanted to follow up on your request to identify impacts to \n     our Nation's economy and international trade activities that \n     this unprecedented budget reduction to the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) would have.\n       Sequestration would have significant impacts on our \n     economy, including travel, tourism and trade. Reductions \n     mandated under sequestration would require furloughs and \n     reduced staffing at our Nation's ports of entry and airport \n     security checkpoints, which would have serious consequences \n     to the flow of trade and travel throughout the country.\n       Trade and travel is absolutely essential to our economy. \n     According to the U.S. Travel Association, one new American \n     job is created for every 33 travelers arriving from overseas. \n     DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staff and \n     operate 329 ports of entry across the country, welcoming \n     travelers and facilitating the flow of goods essential to our \n     economy. Each day, almost one million people arrive at these \n     ports of entry by land, sea, and air. In Fiscal Year 2012 \n     alone, DHS processed more than 350 million travelers, \n     including more than 98 million international air travelers as \n     well as $2.3 trillion worth of trade.\n       The automatic budget reductions that could be implemented \n     on March 1, 2013 would be disruptive and destructive to our \n     Nation's security and economy. At major gateway airports \n     average wait times will increase by 30-50%. At our busiest \n     airports, such as John F. Kennedy International, Los Angeles \n     International, and Chicago O'Hare, peak wait times could grow \n     to over four hours or more during the summer travel season. \n     Such delays would affect air travel significantly, \n     potentially causing thousands of passengers to miss flights \n     with economic consequences at the local, national, and \n     international levels. New flights that bring in hundreds of \n     millions of dollars to the U.S. economy would be delayed or \n     potentially denied due to reduced staffing.\n       Sequestration will also impact our Nation's land borders. \n     For example, daily peak wait times at the El Paso Bridge of \n     the Americas would increase from one hour to over three \n     hours. Peak wait times at the Port of Buffalo Lewiston Bridge \n     would increase by nearly six hours, significantly slowing \n     travel across the northern border. Midsize and smaller ports \n     would experience constrained hours of operation, affecting \n     local cross-border communities.\n       At our seaports, delays in container examinations would \n     increase to up to five days, resulting in increased costs to \n     the trade community and reduced availability of consumer \n     goods and raw materials. At cruise terminals, processing \n     times could increase to up to six hours, causing passengers \n     to miss connecting flights, delaying trips, and increasing \n     costs.\n       Last year, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \n     screened approximately 640 million people and their carry-on \n     items at checkpoints, and more than 426 million\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n     checked bags. DHS also screened over 629 million pounds of \n     cargo with TSA proprietary canine teams. Sequestration would \n     require TSA to reduce overtime and not backfill vacant \n     Transportation Security Officer positions, leading to \n     increases in airline passenger wait times by as much as an \n     hour during peak travel periods at our Nation's largest and \n     busiest airports.\n       Additional effects of sequestration would be felt by the \n     American public from reductions to U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) \n     fisheries law enforcement, aids to navigation, and other \n     important activities that help ensure the safe flow of \n     commerce along U.S. waterways and the protection of natural \n     resources. These reductions will impact the Coast Guard's \n     ability to respond to issues impacting the U.S. Marine \n     Transportation System that generates more than $3.2 trillion \n     of total economic activity, moves 78% of foreign trade, and \n     sustains over 13 million jobs each year. USCG also will have \n     to reduce its patrols of the 3.4 million square mile U.S. \n     Exclusive Economic Zone--impacting fisheries enforcement and \n     resulting in more incursions by foreign vessels, exploiting \n     our natural resources. Reduced Coast Guard presence \n     protecting the U.S. fishing industry would impact an industry \n     which generates $32 billion in income and supports over one \n     million jobs annually.\n       The Department appreciates the strong support it has \n     received from Congress over the past 10 years. As we approach \n     March 1, I urge Congress to act to prevent sequestration and \n     ensure that DHS can continue to meet evolving threats and \n     maintain the security of our Nation and citizens. Should you \n     have any questions or concerns at any time, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me at (202) 282-8203.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                 Janet Napolitano.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask for 30 seconds to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. One of the issues I have been very focused on is \ninternational travel. I do not have the time to go into the details. It \nis an important industry for our country, not just for Louisiana and \nNew Orleans, which are way up on the list of places people want to \ncome. The travel industry is important.\n  Last week Roger Dow said:\n\n       Travel has led the nation's economic recovery--generating \n     more than 50 percent of all jobs created since the beginning \n     of the recession. The indiscriminate sequester cuts threaten \n     to derail travel-led recovery. These across-the-board cuts \n     may punish travelers with flight delays, long security lines \n     at [TSA] checkpoints and multi-hour waits to clear Customs \n     and Border Protection.\n\n  This is not a time to cut back on investments we have made in \nincreasing travel, 10 years after 9/11 ground this industry to a halt. \nNow is not the time to put up a yellow light or a red light, and that \nis what the sequester is going to do--it is going to be blinking yellow \nat a time when we need green all the way.\n  We need to find a way to break through. This Senator is willing to \ncompromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise as chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee to highlight the urgency and importance of \naddressing sequestration. These imminent cuts will have real impacts on \nthe environment and on thousands of jobs related to infrastructure \ninvestment and environmental protection.\n  The reductions required by sequestration will also come on top of \nother deep cuts these programs have already absorbed over the last 2 \nyears. Even though Interior bill programs make up less than 3 percent \nof total Federal discretionary spending, we have already seen more than \n$2 billion in cuts to environmental programs over the past 2 years. If \nsequestration moves forward, it will mean an additional $1.6 billion in \nacross-the-board cuts to the Interior bill.\n  We have already been forced to take $1 billion out of water \ninfrastructure funding. Under sequestration, EPA's State Clean Water \nand Drinking Water Revolving Fund Programs will lose another $130 \nmillion. In addition to potential public health impacts, these cuts \nwill mean 7,000 fewer construction jobs at a time we need to put more \npeople to work. These cuts will be made worse by more than $50 million \nin additional reductions to grants that help States run their \nenvironmental agencies, including supporting clean water programs. The \nconsequences will fall squarely on communities such as those in my home \nState of Rhode Island that are already struggling to keep pace with \ntheir infrastructure needs.\n  Just as we cannot place the burden of our Nation's growing financial \ndebt on our children, we cannot place the burden of repairing our \nfailing infrastructure on the next generation also. We have immediate \nneeds that require immediate investment.\n  I am also concerned about cuts to our Nation's land management \nagencies, including the National Park Service, which is slated for $130 \nmillion in cuts. Sequestration will affect all 398 of our national \nparks, from the largest to the smallest. It means fewer seasonal \npersonnel to assist visitors, which means fewer jobs. It also means \nfewer visitor services, more facility closures, and less upkeep and \nmaintenance of our Nation's premier public lands.\n  These cuts are obviously bad news for the millions of people who \nvisit our national parks every year, but it is worth pointing out that \nthese cuts are also bad news for local economies that depend on \nnational parks. Nationwide, parks support more than 250,000 private \nsector jobs and contribute almost $13 billion annually to local \neconomies. Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home State of \nRhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with nonlocal \nvisitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy. The Roger \nWilliams National Memorial is one of the smallest of our national \nparks. Even this small park is a major factor in my community. These \nclosures and cutbacks will certainly affect the bottom line of \ncommunities across this Nation if fewer families are able to visit and \nenjoy our Federal lands and our national forests.\n  Sequestration will also impact programs that generate revenue for the \nFederal Government. The Interior Department oversees onshore and \noffshore energy development and expects those activities will be slowed \ndramatically.\n  The trial for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill--and my colleague \nfrom Louisiana was so effective and so critical to the response of the \nFederal Government for her home State of Louisiana and the whole gulf \ncoast--that started on Monday is an important reminder of how critical \nthese activities are to preventing these disasters rather than somehow \ntry to recoup losses after the fact. Yet the Department will be forced \nto furlough employees who conduct lease sales, issue permits for new \ndevelopment, conduct environmental reviews, and inspect operations. \nThat is no way to run a railroad or a national Department of Interior.\n  These cuts could result in 300 fewer onshore oil and gas leases in \nWestern States and processing delays for the 550 offshore exploration \nand development plans expected this year. Companies may decide that \ndevelopment is not worth it because of the uncertainty, which will lead \nto less production and smaller royalties for the Treasury. In other \nwords, the cuts required by sequestration could actually end up costing \nthe government money rather than saving money and could take away from \nthe developing ability of the United States to become more and more \nenergy independent through production within the country rather than \nbuying petrochemicals and petroleum products from overseas.\n  The sequester is a real problem for environmental programs in the \nInterior bill and throughout nearly all government programs. But there \nare ways to prevent this meat-ax approach to addressing the budget. \nIndeed, Democrats have put forward a specific and clear plan--half cuts \nand half revenue--to replace the sequester. Simply, we have put a plan \nforward that puts jobs first by cutting specific wasteful spending and \nclosing dubious tax loopholes. This bill gives the economy more \nbreathing room by offsetting the sequester with smart policies that \nshould be enacted even if there were no threat of sequester.\n\n  Let's be clear what is at stake. The Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office recently testified that the 2013 sequester \nwill result in 750,000 lost jobs and a 0.6-percent reduction in GDP for \n2013. Lost jobs and lower growth--that is what sequester is going to \nproduce. I don't think the people of Rhode Island or anyone else in the \nUnited States wants to have Congress support policies that mean fewer \njobs. We have a crisis in Rhode Island, a jobs crisis that should be \naddressed before anything else.\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n  We hear from the other side of the Capitol that we must have a \nsequester to address the budget. But over the last few years, as my \ncolleagues have pointed out, we have slashed the deficit by $2.4 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. The bulk of that reduction, $1.7 \ntrillion, has come through spending cuts. We have been cutting. Indeed, \nmy Republican colleagues have repeatedly held the economy hostage in \norder to cut spending that benefits the vast majority of Americans and \nprotect tax cuts that benefit the wealthy few. That is not economically \nefficient, and that is not fair.\n  We see the results in my home State of Rhode Island--a 10.2-percent \nunemployment rate. That is unacceptably high. And 12.3 million \nAmericans across the country are still unemployed. This Republican \nagenda of protecting the wealthiest and not investing in job creation \nis out of step with the majority of Americans. Most Americans would \nprefer right now that we address the jobs crisis. And by the way, more \npeople working means we also address the deficit. They pay taxes, they \ndon't qualify for unemployment insurance, and they don't apply for \nother programs. That is the smart way and the way we should deal, at \nleast in part, with our deficit problem.\n  We should not be jeopardizing our economy. We should not be allowing \nthese loopholes to exist that allow multinational corporations to ship \nour jobs overseas. We should not let these loopholes that give benefits \nto oil and gas companies that are recording historic profits linger, \nall ultimately at the expense of investing in programs like those that \nwill put Americans to work in the parks and rebuilding our \ninfrastructure across America. More austerity--and that is what this \nsequester is all about, especially in the form of these reckless cuts--\nwill hurt the economy. We should instead be working to create jobs.\n  We should also recall that we are here today as a legacy of the \nRepublican brinkmanship of threatening to allow the United States to \ndefault on its national debt. That is why we are here. Let's not forget \nthat. The sequester was a means to avoid what would have been a \ncatastrophic default.\n  Now we have the opportunity to change course, to invest in our people \nand invest in growth and do it in a balanced way. We cannot cut our way \nto prosperity. The President said that. These contractionary policies--\nthis austerity the Republicans are urging upon us--will reduce economic \ngrowth at a time we need to expand economic growth, not only to create \njobs but to truly address the deficit in a responsible, reasonable way. \nWe have come through the threat of default on the debt with severe and \nunbalanced spending cuts. Now is the time to have a balanced approach. \nI urge that this balanced approach be adopted quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have come today to join the other \nAppropriations subcommittee chairs to really implore the Senate and \nthis country to take a look at what will happen if sequestration \noccurs.\n  In just one day, unless Republicans drop their opposition to our \ncompromise bill, sequestration will be a reality.\n  Now, we have heard from a wide range of economists and other experts \nabout how harmful these cuts will be to our economy. They will hurt job \ncreation, reduce our economic growth, and impact the most vulnerable \namong us.\n  According to HUD, the cuts required under sequestration would put \n125,000 tenants at immediate risk of losing their housing vouchers, \nleaving low-income residents facing higher rents, eviction or \nhomelessness.\n  At the same time, communities would be left with fewer ways to help \nthe homeless.\n  In fact, the cuts would place formerly homeless people back on the \nstreets, since HUD estimates that the cuts would threaten housing or \naccess to emergency shelter for 100,000 people.\n  Sequestration will also disrupt some of the most fundamental work of \nour government, such as its management of the air transportation \nsystem.\n  Every year, U.S. airlines carry hundreds of millions of passengers, \nmany of them travelling for business or tourism. And our aviation \nsystem carries freight valued at hundreds of millions of dollars every \nyear.\n  This is possible because the FAA is a world leader in managing air \ntraffic and protecting the safety of our skies.\n  These cuts will force them to furlough their entire workforce, \nincluding each and every air traffic controller and safety inspector.\n  With these furloughs, we can expect that every FAA facility and every \nair traffic control tower will be short-staffed every day of the week \nthrough the rest of this fiscal year.\n  In order to protect the safety of our skies, they will be forced to \nreduce the level of air traffic.\n  For these reasons and so many more, sequestration is the wrong answer \nto the fiscal challenges facing the country.\n  The cuts will hurt the most vulnerable in our society, and it will \nhurt our ability to compete in the global economy.\n  There is no question that we must address our deficit, but we must be \nsmart about how we do it.\n  That is why Democrats have put forward a credible, responsible plan \nto replace sequestration.\n  Our legislation builds on the precedent set in the year-end deal, and \nit is in line with the balanced approach the American people favor.\n  It would replace half of the first year of sequestration with \nresponsible spending cuts, and half of it with revenue from those who \ncan afford it most.\n  Our bill calls on the wealthiest Americans to pay at least the same \nmarginal tax rate on their income as middle-class families pay, and \nwould eliminate needless tax breaks for oil and gas companies and \ncompanies shipping jobs overseas.\n  At the same time, it would make responsible cuts.\n  Our bill would eliminate direct payments to farmers that have been \npaid out even during good times, and for crops farmers were not even \ngrowing.\n  And as the drawdown from Afghanistan is completed, our bill will make \nadjustments to our military that are in line with a strong 21st century \nstrategy.\n  This legislation meets Republicans halfway.\n  It would protect the families and communities we represent from \nslower economic growth, fewer jobs, and weakened national defense.\n  And it would allow us to move past sequestration, towards working on \na fair, comprehensive budget deal that provides certainty for American \nfamilies and businesses.\n  So I would like to ask my Republican colleagues to seriously consider \nour proposal.\n  The American people want a balanced deal. Let's deliver.\n  We have heard people talk about job creation being impacted, reducing \nour economic growth, impacting the most vulnerable among us. In my \nsubcommittee that oversees transportation and housing, we are going to \nsee incredible impacts. HUD housing would have to put 125,000 tenants \nat immediate risk of losing their housing vouchers and putting them \nback on the streets at a time when we are just starting to really focus \non our veterans and that growing number of veterans who are on our \nstreets and making an impact across the spectrum. We will see a huge \nimpact on housing.\n  On the transportation side, every sector we oversee will be impacted. \nWe have heard a lot of talk about our U.S. airlines. They carry \nhundreds of millions of passengers every year. It is a huge impact on \nour economy. Our FAA is a world leader in managing air traffic and \nprotecting the safety of our skies. These cuts will force the FAA to \nliterally furlough every single employee and impact our air traffic \ncontrol and safety systems.\n  It does not have to be this way. The Senate majority has put forward \na very balanced approach to replace sequester, and in the longer term, \nas budget chair, we are working now to bring to the Senate a 10-year \nbudget plan that will replace sequestration in a responsible way, work \nus to a manageable debt and deficit, and invest in our country again so \nwe can grow. Let's get out of this crisis-management mode, pass a \nreplacement to sequestration in the short term that we have offered,\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nand get back to the regular order in the Senate. That means our country \ncan get back to managing their families and their businesses and \ncommunities in a responsible way. We can do that by voting to put in \nplace our replacement. I urge our colleagues to do that tomorrow \nmorning when we have a chance to vote on that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland \nand commend the very energetic way she has taken on her new \nresponsibilities as Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. She has \nplayed a leading role in educating other Senators and the American \npeople about the real impacts of sequestration.\n  While most of the media has focused on the projected consequences for \nprograms and jobs here at home, there are also consequences for the \nbudget of the Department of State and foreign operations, which is \ndirectly related to the national security of the United States.\n  It might interest people to know that the entire Department of State \nand foreign operations budget amounts to one percent of the Federal \nbudget, not the 15 or 20 percent many mistakenly believe.\n  That one percent is what we have to operate our embassies and \nconsulates in over 290 countries, to process visas, carry out \ndiplomacy, respond to humanitarian crises, and build alliances with \nsecurity and trading partners. There are dozens of examples of how \nsequestration would harm these efforts, but I will mention just three:\n  Cuts in diplomatic security at a time when everyone agrees we need to \ndo more to protect our Foreign Service Officers overseas. Funding for \nlocal guards, diplomatic security personnel, and embassy security would \nbe reduced by $181 million from the current level.\n  This would force the Department of State to choose between reducing \nthe number of local guards at overseas posts, delaying maintenance at \nexisting facilities, or postponing construction of secure facilities to \nreplace those that do not meet current safety standards at a time of \nincreasing attacks against U.S. overseas diplomatic posts.\n  Global Health programs that prevent the spread of AIDS and pay for \nvaccines for children, women's health, and to combat malaria and \ntuberculosis, would be cut by $468 million from the current level.\n  A reduction of this size would end life-saving drugs to more than \n165,000 people infected with the AIDS virus. It would result in \nthousands more deaths from malaria. Tens of thousands of people \ninfected with TB will not receive treatment. And the health of millions \nof Americans who travel, study, work, and serve in our Armed Forces \naround the world would be put at greater risk.\n  Funding for disaster and refugee aid would be cut by $156 million \nfrom the current levels. With 750,000 Syrian refugees and 5,000 fleeing \nthe country each day, now is not the time to cut these programs. Other \nfunds to help victims of drought, famine, and extremist violence in \nMali, Somalia, and Sudan, and to prevent those crises from getting \nworse, will also be cut.\n  These are just a few examples of the real world consequences, not \nonly for the people of those countries but for the security of the \nUnited States. People need to know what is at stake.\n  As has been pointed out repeatedly, sequestration was included in the \nBudget Control Act as an incentive to negotiate. The idea was that it \nwould have such catastrophic consequences that rational minds would \nreplace it with a thoughtful and balanced approach to deficit \nreduction.\n  That has not happened. To the contrary, just days before the \nsequester is to take effect our friends in the minority party whose \nonly answer is to slash government programs and particularly those that \nhelp the neediest, have apparently decided that sequestration is not so \nbad after all.\n\n\n              Military Construction and Veterans Programs\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Chairwoman Mikulski for \norganizing this colloquy among Appropriations Subcommittee Chairs \nregarding the real consequences of the upcoming sequester on this \nNation.\n  Fortunately, America's veterans are spared from the direct impact of \nthe sequester, as all programs funded through the Department of \nVeterans Affairs are exempt. Veterans hospitals and clinics will \ncontinue to operate normally, veterans benefits will be processed and \npaid, and other veterans services will continue uninterrupted.\n  But make no mistake about it; veterans are no more immune than any \nother American from the collateral damage that these senseless \nautomatic spending cuts will inflict. Bear in mind that veterans are \nparents and teachers, firefighters and law enforcement officers, border \npatrol agents and small business owners. A large number of civilian \njobs at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, among other \nfederal agencies, are held by veterans. In fact, veterans comprise 44 \npercent of the Defense Department's civilian workforce. Veterans are \nsubject to the same risk as any other government employee of being \nfurloughed or laid off because of the sequester, and veteran-owned \nbusinesses face the same risk as any other small business of losing \ncrucial government contracts.\n  This is not some abstract inside-the beltway issue. Eighty-six \npercent of the Defense Department's civilian workforce resides outside \nof the Washington metropolitan area. In my home state of South Dakota, \napproximately 1,000 Defense Department civilian employees are slated to \nbe furloughed, reducing gross pay by about $6.3 million. This loss in \nincome will surely reverberate throughout the local economy.\n  The ripple effect of the sequester on the economy and job market \nnationwide is particularly worrisome for veterans of the Iraq and \nAfghanistan wars, who already face higher unemployment rates than the \ngeneral population. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nveterans of these two wars are dealing with an unemployment rate of \n11.7 percent, compared to a national unemployment rate of 7.9 percent. \nThe employment picture for Iraq and Afghanistan-era women veterans is \neven bleaker: 17.1 percent compared to a national unemployment rate for \nwomen of 7.4 percent. Furloughs, layoffs, and civilian hiring freezes \nhave the potential to make a bad problem far worse for these veterans.\n  So yes, the VA is spared a direct hit from the budget axe triggered \nby the sequester, but veterans are not.\n  Another impact of the sequester that will be felt across this country \nis funding for military construction, which is poised to lose more than \n$1 billion as a result of sequestration. Like other agencies, the \nDefense Department does not have the flexibility to choose where to cut \nmilitary construction every single project planned for construction in \nfiscal year 2013 will be forced to take a funding cut of approximately \n9 percent.\n  The fiscal year 2013 program comprises more than 250 military \nconstruction projects in 42 states, the District of Columbia and \noverseas. As a result of sequestration, every one of those projects \nwill have to be reassessed to determine if it can be executed at the \nlower funding level, or if it will need to be delayed or cancelled. The \nDefense Department can shift funding from one project to another \nthrough a congressional reprogramming, but that means the Department \nwill be the sole arbiter of choosing winners and losers among the \nprojects that Congress has already authorized. Moreover, reprogramming \nactions are time consuming and labor intensive, and at a time when the \nDepartment will be understaffed due to furloughs and a hiring freeze, \nthe likelihood of delays or deferrals of military construction projects \nis high. Not only does this affect mission critical and quality of life \nprojects on military installations, but it also impacts the local \nconstruction industry, and thus the local economy, in hundreds of \ncommunities throughout the Nation.\n  Carpet bombing the federal budget with across-the-board spending cuts \nis neither wise nor prudent. It's about as smart as a surgeon \nperforming heart surgery with an axe. There will be casualties, and \nveterans and military families will be among those casualties.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota, \nthe Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nSubcommittee, for presenting a stark and compelling explanation of the \nimpact of sequestration on veterans and military installations, and the \nconsequences these ill-advised budget cuts will have on local \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\n  I am particularly troubled by the impact these cuts could have on \nIraq and Afghanistan war veterans who are already struggling to find \njobs, many of whom are also coping with combat-related physical and \nmental health issues. The unemployment rate among women veterans is \ntruly shocking. These brave Americans have served on the frontlines of \nour war on terrorism, and they should not be subject on their return \nhome to a manufactured budget meltdown that could further complicate \ntheir job prospects and job security.\n  Of course we need to rein in the federal debt, but we need to do so \nin a thoughtful, constructive way that brings both reasoned budget cuts \nand additional revenue to the table. The President has called for, and \nSenate Democrats are proposing, a balanced way forward.\n\n\n                              NNSA and CCE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As the Chairman of the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I would ask the Senator from California to \ndescribe the impact of sequestration on the Department of Energy and \nthe Corps of Engineers.\n  Please provide specific examples that would help Members of Congress \nand the American people understand the consequences of sequestration on \nbasic and applied research for future energy technologies, nuclear \nweapons modernization and nonproliferation activities, and maintaining \ncritical water infrastructure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for her leadership on bringing \nmuch needed attention to the arbitrary and damaging cuts of \nsequestration on important government programs.\n  I would like to start by highlighting the impact of sequestration on \nnational security activities. A semi-autonomous agency within the \nDepartment of Energy, known as the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, or NNSA, is responsible for safeguarding the country's \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  NNSA has recently embarked on a major modernization effort. The \npurpose is to upgrade aging infrastructure and replace aging components \nin nuclear weapons. These investments are being made so that NNSA can \nreduce the size of the stockpile, consistent with New START Treaty \nobligations, and certify each year that nuclear weapons remain safe, \nsecure, and effective without underground nuclear testing.\n  Sequestration would cut close to $600 million from the nuclear \nweapons program, essentially freezing and reversing modernization \nefforts. Specifically, cuts in funding would put at risk NNSA's ability \nto refurbish nuclear weapons that are needed by the Air Force and Navy \nto meet nuclear deterrence missions, delay construction of facilities \nneeded to replace old facilities that do not meet modern health and \nsafety standards but are necessary to manufacture critical nuclear \nweapons components, result in furloughs and/or lay-offs of up to 5,000 \ncontractors at the eight NNSA sites across the country, and reduce \noversight of NNSA nuclear facilities resulting in less frequent and \nthorough audits and evaluations of security at the sites. This would \ncome at a time when security lapses have occurred at a major site \nstoring nuclear weapons materials.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is my understanding that NNSA also funds \nnonproliferation activities. Would sequestration undermine the 4 year \ngoal of securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world by \nthe end of December 2013?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. NNSA has sufficient funding to meet the 4 year goal, \nbut securing materials is not the same as permanently removing and \ndisposing of them. Even with the 4 year goal nearly complete, thousands \nof kilograms of highly enriched uranium and plutonium enough materials \nfor dozens of nuclear weapons still present a terrorism risk. \nTerrorists are indifferent to sequestration.\n  The sequester would impose cuts of nearly $200 million from the \nnonproliferation program. Efforts to remove additional nuclear \nmaterials would be delayed In addition, NNSA would not be able to \ndeploy additional radiation detection equipment at border crossings \nthat are most vulnerable to nuclear and radiological smuggling. Of \nparticular concern is NNSA missing the deadline to build and deploy \nnew, more accurate sensors that can detect other countries' nuclear \nweapons tests. NNSA would not be able to build the sensors before the \nAir Force is scheduled to launch its satellites.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Equally important to our national security are efforts \nto reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil and mitigating the effects of \nglobal warming. What impact will sequestration have on basic research \nneeded to accelerate future energy technologies?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Department of Energy maintains U.S. leadership in \nscientific and technological innovation by supporting basic research \nthrough its Office of Science. The goal is to advance energy \ntechnologies and operate world-leading facilities to accelerate \nscientific discoveries.\n  Sequestration would cut about $250 million from the Office of \nScience. Specifically, these cuts would result in hundreds of layoffs \nat national labs, universities, research facilities, and private sector \ncompanies that rely on Office of Science funding grants for energy \nresearch, reduce operations of major scientific facilities, meaning \nless research and development in one of the highest priority research \nareas designing novel materials which is critical to advancing energy \ntechnologies, stop almost all construction projects that are replacing \naging infrastructure at the national labs that are needed to support \nscience missions and attract the best scientists from around the \ncountry and the world, and allow no, or very few, new awards to advance \nhigh performance computing to stay ahead of Chinese competition and \ndevelop the next generation system, known as exascale, before the U.S. \nreaches the limits of current technology.\n  These cuts would come at a time when many other countries are making \nsignificant investments in energy research and development. Many \nexperts are already warning that current investments are not sufficient \nto maintain U.S. competitiveness in energy technologies.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before our time is up, let's also discuss the impact of \nsequestration on water infrastructure. What will be the impact on the \nCivil Corps of Engineers?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. With sequestration, the Corps would likely have to \nclose 57 recreation areas and partially close 186 recreation sites. \nThere would also be no funding for 52 ongoing studies that were funded \nin FY 2012, 65 construction projects that were funded in FY 2012, and \n43 dredging projects that were funded in FY 2012.\n  As the studies and construction projects are cost shared with non-\nFederal sponsors, over 115 local sponsors would be left with no Federal \nshare to match their contributions for these studies and projects, \nfurther delaying completion of these studies and projects. In addition, \nonly the bare minimum funding for dredging of ports and harbors will be \navailable. This will lead to inefficiencies in transportation due to \nrequired light-loading which will ultimately lead to increases in \nconsumer costs.\n  The long term effect of these delays is increasing the costs of \nconstruction projects. More money needed to complete current \nconstruction projects means less or no funding for future projects \nalready planned.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for the colloquy today on this issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Feinstein for her sobering assessment \nof the impacts of sequestration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S888-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S888-S889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       AUTHORIZING THE REPORTING OF COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I want to start with some numbers that \nhelp put our spending budget debate in perspective.\n  Since President Obama became President of the United States, our \ngross national debt has gone up by 56 percent--56 percent. Over the \nnext decade, unless we act responsibly, it is projected to rise by \nanother 57 percent and reach a staggering $26.1 trillion. I don't know \nanyone who can actually comprehend numbers that big, but that is what \nit is.\n  By comparison, the sequester--the much-dread sequester that is \nsupposed to go into effect on Friday--would cut only 2.4 percent out of \nFederal spending for this next year. It would authorize $85 billion in \ncuts for the current fiscal year, which, as I said, is only 2.4 percent \nof the total Federal budget--2.4 percent. Yet the President is now \ntraveling around the country on Air Force One, telling us that a 2.4-\npercent spending cut will have a catastrophic effect on our economy and \non jobs. Of course, this part is predictable: The only solution he \nseems to offer is raising taxes once again.\n  We saw in December during the debate over the fiscal cliff--and I \nknow the American people must be getting nauseated with us lurching \nfrom one financial crisis to another, with the fiscal cliffs, \nsequestrations, debt ceiling, government shutdown threats. It is no \nwonder the American people look at Washington and wonder: Can't you \nguys get your act together? But the solution is not to keep on keeping \non and spending money we don't have and racking up more debt and \ndeficits, nor is the solution to continue to raise taxes on the very \npeople we are depending upon to invest in new jobs and grow their \ncurrent businesses to create jobs and opportunities for middle-class \nfamilies.\n  Rather than the nightmare scenario the President likes to talk about, \nRepublicans and Democrats would be happy to give the President and the \nadministration some flexibility in how it implements these 2.4-percent \ncuts. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be what the President is \nlooking for. He doesn't seem to want to figure out how to manage these \ncuts as every family and every small business in America who is left \nwith less income coming in the front door would have to do. He doesn't \nseem to want to manage it; he seems to want to use this to scare people \nin order to grow the size of government by raising more taxes. He seems \nto believe that only Washington and only the Federal Government can \nrevive strong economic growth by steadily raising our levels of \ntaxation and spending. That is sheer fantasy. The President either \ndoesn't realize or he doesn't care that Federal spending levels are \nalready unsustainable. Everybody knows this. This is not a mystery to \nanyone who has been paying attention.\n  For example, a single Federal program, Medicare, which our seniors \nrely upon to provide them the health care they need, already has $37 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities; again, an astronomical number that I \ndoubt any of us can fully comprehend. But $37 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities is big. America's total unfunded liabilities--this is all \nthe promises we have made which we have no current ability to pay for--\nexceed $100 trillion. Meanwhile, the national debt keeps going up. It \nis now roughly $16.5 trillion.\n  We are fortunate enough to now see interest rates that we have to pay \non that debt at a historically low figure, but each additional \npercentage point of interest we would have to pay--if interest rates \nwere simply to go up to their historic norms--would increase the cost \nof our service on that debt by trillions of dollars. Simply put, we \ncannot spend our way back into prosperity.\n  There are things the Federal Government can and should do to boost \neconomic growth. We all understand this. The fact is the government is \nnot what creates jobs. It is the private sector, small businesses in \nAmerica, entrepreneurs, and the people who take a risk to start a new \nrestaurant or open a hardware store. Actually, those small businesses \nare the ones that actually create many more jobs on a percentage basis \nthan do the large Fortune 500 companies.\n  All we have to do is look around the country, and I know the \nPresiding Officer understands what is happening. We see some parts of \nthe country that are growing fast and where jobs are plentiful. One of \nthose is Texas, another one is North Dakota. There are some common \nelements in our story that I will talk about in a minute, but for the \npast 8 years ``Chief Executive'' magazine has ranked the best States in \nthe country to do business. I would not have brought it up if it were \nnot true, but the No. 1 State is the State of Texas. This week Forbes \nranked the 10 best cities for good jobs, and half of those cities were \nin Texas--including Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San \nAntonio.\n  Texas has nearly 32 percent more jobs today than it did in 1995--32 \npercent. Over the same period the total number of jobs nationwide \nincreased by only 12 percent. I would think curious people would wonder \nwhy. Our State accounts for 8 percent of the U.S. population, but we \naccounted for almost one-third of all private sector jobs in high-\npaying industries between 2002 and 2011. Let me say that again so \neveryone is clear. Our State accounts for 8 percent of the national \npopulation, but we accounted for almost one-third of all private sector \njob growth in high-paying industries between 2002 and 2011. That is \nremarkable.\n  Some might wonder what the secret is, and thank goodness the States \nstill are the laboratories of democracy where we can demonstrate the \npolicies that actually work rather than trying to mandate a one-size-\nfits-all policy from Washington, DC, that doesn't work.\n  The secret in my State is that we have, for example, no State income \ntaxes. We are a relatively low income tax State, although people still \npay sales and property taxes. We have minimal and sensible regulations \nbecause we know that not only do taxes depress economic growth, we know \ngovernment--either State government, local government, or Federal \nGovernment--that issues punitive regulations can actually dampen \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  We also have a relatively low level of per capita government \nspending. People don't come to Texas because they want handouts. They \ncome to Texas because they want an opportunity to work, to achieve, and \nto live their dreams and in the process creating a lot of jobs and \nopportunity for other people. We are also--and I know this is where the \nPresiding Officer can identify with this statement--unapologetic about \nharvesting our State's abundant oil and gas reserves. Indeed, Texas oil \nproduction increased by 94 percent between September 2008 and September \n2012. Shale gas is natural gas that is produced by hydraulic fracturing \nand horizontal drilling. It has been around--actually fracking--for \nroughly 60 years now. When done properly, it is safe and does not \ndamage the water supply. The shale gas now available due to horizontal \ndrilling and hydraulic fracturing has produced a shale gas revolution \nin this country.\n\n  The truth is that if we get out of the way and sensibly regulate this \nindustry, open the Keystone XL Pipeline--which the President could do, \nbut he has not yet done--it would not only create thousands of new \njobs, it would create the potential for North American energy \nindependence. Imagine how that would change the geopolitics of the \nplanet. In instances where the Iranian regime threatens to shut down \nthe Strait of Hormuz and block 20 percent of the world's oil supply, it \nwould not have nearly the impact because our country would be North \nAmerican energy independent within a decade or so.\n  Well, I should also footnote the fact that down in Eagle Ford Shale--\nwhich\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nis south of San Antonio, and where I am from--they had some of the \nhighest unemployment rates in our State. Much like the Bakken Shale, \nanybody who can get a commercial driver's license and pass a drug test \ncan earn a lot of money. As a matter of fact, commercial truckdrivers \nin south Texas now can earn over $100,000 a year, and it is hard to \nfind workers. They were suffering a shortage of workers because of the \neconomic activity caused by natural gas exploration production.\n  The President should also reject misguided policies by the Federal \nGovernment that are killing jobs and threatening to put many oil and \ngas producers and refiners out of business. He should loosen \nrestrictions on Federal lands and offshore drilling, and he should \ncertainly issue more drilling permits. Expanding domestic energy \nproduction and eliminating harmful regulations would promote job \ncreation and reduce unemployment, just as it has in my State.\n  In a larger sense, embracing this model would help the United States \ngain much of its economic competitiveness and fiscal credibility that \nwe have recently lost. It would send a clear message that we are \nserious about rejuvenating our economy and reducing our long-term debt \nburden. Above all, embracing this model would show that Washington has \ndiscovered our founding principles of limited government, individual \nfreedom, and personal responsibility.\n  I will close on this and say that I have not heard the President talk \nrecently about 7.9-percent unemployment in this country, nor have I \nheard the President talk about the reduced number of people who are \nactually still looking for jobs. That number would be much higher \nbecause there are people who have lost their jobs and are still \nactively seeking jobs. Notwithstanding that, we know from the \nCongressional Budget Office that the unemployment rate will actually \nget worse by the end of the year. This is very urgent. It is not just \nabout statistics; it is not just about numbers; it is about people who \nare hurting because they are out of work and unable to provide for \ntheir families.\n  One would think this would be a cause we could all come together on \nand address to the best of our ability using some of the powerful \nexamples in States such as North Dakota and Texas.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we are hearing a lot of discussion here \nin Washington and around the country this week about the so-called \nsequester, which I think bears some explanation. Oftentimes we talk in \nterms and in such a way that I think ordinary Americans have a hard \ntime understanding the arcane world and arcane lexicon we have here in \nWashington, DC. Basically we are talking about these spending cuts--\nacross-the-board cuts--that will take effect at the end of this week. \nIt was a process that was put in place many months ago. In fact, if we \ngo back to the Budget Control Act, which passed in August of 2011, we \nwon't find very many people now who will claim paternity of that idea.\n  In fact, there is a big debate and a lot of finger pointing about \nwhose idea this was and whose fault it was that we are where we are. I \nwould simply point out that I think there are a lot of Republicans and \nDemocrats who voted for the Budget Control Act, so clearly many of us \nvoted in support of that as a last resort. Many of us didn't want that \nto happen. We wanted to see a deal worked out where we would actually \naddress the major problems facing this country with regard to our \nspending and debt. But since that couldn't be negotiated between the \nPresident and the leadership of Congress, we ended up with this process \nwhere we had some immediate spending cuts taking effect--about $900 \nbillion, with another $1.2 trillion to follow--hopefully achieved \nthrough reforms, including tax reform, entitlement reform, by a so-\ncalled supercommittee that met and convened for a while. However, when \nthat committee failed to reach a conclusion, it set in process, set in \nmotion, what we know today as sequester.\n\n  It was actually built to go until the 1st of January, in which case \nall of these things would take effect if nothing had happened. Clearly, \nnothing had happened. So when January rolled around, we ended up with \nthis process we now know as sequester.\n  I wish to point out that the President has been running away from \nthis; somehow this just imaginarily appeared, this idea of sequester. \nBut if we go back and look at the origin of this, we see it was clearly \nsomething the President and his people put forward. Fine points have \nbeen laid out by Bob Woodward in his book and subsequent op-ed this \nlast weekend in which he stated very clearly this was an idea that \noriginated with the White House. In fact, Jack Lew, in his confirmation \nhearing before the Senate Finance Committee, actually mentioned the \nfact that when they were looking at something they could use--a \ntrigger, if you will--they drew upon the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nagreement that was agreed to back in 1985 by the Congress, and that \nincorporated this idea of a sequester, which included an across-the-\nboard spending cut. So, basically, it came from the White House. It \ncame from the President and his people. That is where the idea of \nsequester originated. So to suggest now that somehow they didn't know \nabout this or they didn't have anything to do with it, that it isn't \ntheir responsibility, is completely contradictory to the facts, as has \nbeen delineated by Bob Woodward in his book and many others who are \nfamiliar with those discussions.\n  The point, very simply, is we have a process that was put in place a \nlong time ago. We can go back to August 2011 when the Budget Control \nAct was passed to find out why we are where we are today.\n  The other thing that is interesting to me, which I think has now \nadded to the narrative of trying to reconstruct the history of all \nthis, is the idea that somehow there should have been taxes \nincorporated in this, that we needed to have a ``balanced approach'' in \nthe sequester. That was never contemplated. This was all on the \nspending side. If we look at the history of this and we actually listen \nto, again, the people who are familiar with those discussions--and Bob \nWoodward, this weekend in his op-ed said: The President is moving the \ngoalpost. The revenues and taxes were not a part of this. But now, all \nof a sudden, the White House is insisting upon: We want taxes to be a \npart of this.\n  What is ironic about that is they got taxes. They got a big fat tax \nincrease on January 1 of this year. That wasn't balanced. There were no \nspending cuts. That was all taxes: $620 billion. So from our \nperspective, the tax issue has been dealt with. The President got \nrevenues--revenues that weren't contemplated by the sequester in the \nfirst place. Yet, today, he gets up and argues that this needs to be a \n``balanced'' plan, which is a euphemism around here for: We want more \nof your tax dollars. We want more taxpayers' money to come to \nWashington, DC. We want higher taxes. That is what that message is \nessentially saying.\n  When the President and many of his allies on Capitol Hill say: We \nwant a balanced plan, that means they want tax increases--on top of the \n$620 billion in new taxes the President got on January 1 of this year.\n  Now, what is interesting to me about this whole process is it was \nreported this morning that the President has called a meeting on \nFriday. He now wants to convene a meeting on Friday to talk about these \nDraconian cuts that are going to go into effect, and he has been \ntraveling all over the country picking the most high-profile, highly \nvisible items he can that would suggest this is going to have this \nprofoundly dramatic impact on people around this country. So now he is \ncoming back to Washington. When? March 1. When is that? It is the day \nthe cuts are designed to go into effect.\n  Where has the President been for the last year and a half? Where is \nthe leadership in waiting until the very day these cuts are supposed to \ngo into effect to say: Oh, let's have a meeting to talk about what we \nmight be able to do to avoid the impact of these across-the-board \nspending reductions.\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n  So March 1. OK, here we are, eleventh hour, once again, at the last \nminute, the President sweeps in and says he wants to do something to \ntry to avert this sequester. But, again, remember: We have known about \nthis for a year and a half. This is not a new revelation. We have known \nthis was coming for a very long time.\n  The supercommittee failed to produce a result in November 2011. So it \nis almost a year and a half now we have known the sequester is coming. \nIn fact, last summer we passed legislation in Congress that asked the \nadministration to give us some detail and some specificity about where \nthese cuts were going to take place, and we got some vague outline \nabout that. We didn't get any report from the President that enumerated \nthese because, frankly, I don't think they had gone through the process \nof trying to figure out what they were going to do with it.\n  So here we are now 18 months later, at the eleventh hour, and the \nPresident all of a sudden says: Let's have a meeting and talk about \nwhat we might be able to do to avoid the impact of these across-the-\nboard spending reductions. Where is the leadership in that? Why weren't \nwe doing that 12 months ago, 11 months ago, 10 months ago, 1 month ago, \nlast week? Why weren't we talking about this earlier? Why do we have to \nwait until the very last day to have a discussion about this?\n  Well, evidently, the President is better at campaigning than he is at \ngoverning because he has been driving all over the country--I shouldn't \nsay driving, flying all over the country, over 5,000 miles--over 5,000 \nmiles--campaigning on this issue to try to scare people into believing \nthat an $85 billion across-the-board spending reduction, which \nrepresents 2.4 percent of Federal spending this next year, is somehow \ngoing to be disastrous for our economy and for our country.\n  Frankly, I am not in any way diminishing the impact of spending \nreductions. Spending reductions will have some impact--there is no \nquestion about that--for sure. But to go out and say we are going to \nhave 90-minute lines at airports, and we are not going to have meat \ninspectors, and all these things they are trying to put out there to \nscare the American people, to dramatize and, frankly, to traumatize the \nAmerican people about a 2.4-percent reduction in overall Federal \nspending?\n\n  Now, if a person is a member of an average American family or an \nAmerican business or anybody in this country, and they know they are \ngoing to have 2.4 percent less to work with next year, what do they do? \nThey sit down around their kitchen table and figure out what those \nthings are they spend money on that they can live without. It is a \nfairly simple exercise. In most cases, people are going to pick the \nlow-priority items. They are going to pick the things they can probably \nlive without. They are not going to pick the things they really need \nand rely upon and depend upon. But I think most Americans would agree \nthey could find a 2.4-percent reduction in their annual spending if \nthey had to. I think that is something ordinary, average Americans have \nto deal with all the time: Let's just tighten our belts a little bit; \nlet's figure out how we can get along with 2.4 percent less spending.\n  Well, we are talking about 2.4 percent less spending on a $3.6 \ntrillion annual Federal budget. What does that represent? So $85 \nbillion is a lot of money. It is a lot of money anywhere. It is a lot \nof money in my State of South Dakota. In the small town I grew up in, \nthose are dimensions we didn't even contemplate in most cases.\n  But we think about it this way: $85 billion, the amount of money we \nare asked to reduce in terms of the overall Federal spending this next \nyear, is the equivalent of how much our country borrows every single \nmonth. Every 28 days, we borrow $85 billion. So every single month, we \nborrow--we put on the backs of our children and grandchildren--as much \nmoney as the Federal Government is being asked to live without for an \nentire year: 2.4 percent of annual Federal spending.\n  To be fair, people will say: Wait a minute. It is not 2.4 percent \nbecause it is just affecting a certain area of the budget, and they are \nright. It will represent a bigger percentage simply because so much of \nthe budget has been walled off from this, the area where the real \nFederal spending is; where three-fifths to two-thirds of all Federal \nspending has essentially, for all intents and purposes, been protected \nor insulated from this. There is a small 2-percent cut that would occur \nin some of the mandatory areas of the budget, but for all intents and \npurposes, what really drives Federal spending year in and year out and \nwhat is going to represent, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, about 91 percent of all Federal spending 10 years from now--\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps; mandatory Federal \nspending entitlement programs--that is pretty much walled off.\n  So we are increasingly shrinking the discretionary part of the budget \nwhich represents a smaller and smaller portion of Federal spending each \nand every year. But the reality is it still is 2.4 percent out of a \n$3.6 trillion annual budget that we are talking about. So it seems to \nme, at least, that all the hand-wringing that is going on in Washington \nright now and all the drama the President is trying to create by flying \nover 5,000 miles across the country, campaigning about the effects of \nthis sequester, really gets lost in what I think every American has to \ndeal with every single day and every single week and every single month \nand every single year; that is, sometimes they have to make do with a \nlittle bit less, and maybe Washington, DC, can figure out how to do \nthat.\n  But we have to ask the question again: Where is the leadership? The \nPresident, on Friday, March 1--the day this happens--decides to have a \nmeeting when we have known about this for 18 months. The Senate, under \nthe leadership of the majority--the Democrats in the Senate--hasn't \npassed a budget now for 1,400 days. We have gone 1,400 days without a \nbudget. We are going on 4 years without a budget. We spend $3.5 \ntrillion, $3.6 trillion of the American taxpayers' money every single \nyear, and we haven't had a budget that suggests how we are going to \nspend it now for going on 4 years. Where is the leadership?\n  The President of the United States submits a budget--which he will do \nsometime soon. He has missed the deadline already, but we assume it is \ncoming in the next few weeks. But over the last couple of years when he \nsubmitted a budget to Congress, when it was voted on in the House and \nin the Senate, it didn't receive a single vote.\n  Now, it perhaps is not surprising it didn't receive a Republican vote \nbecause it had a lot of tax increases in it, but it didn't get a \nDemocrat vote--zero, zilch--in the House or Senate. There wasn't a \nRepublican or a Democrat who voted for the President's budget. Why? \nBecause it wasn't serious. The President is not doing anything to \nmeaningfully address out-of-control spending and out-of-control debt.\n  So here we are. The Budget Control Act finally did put in place some \nspending reductions, and now everybody is hyperventilating about what \nwe can do to avoid them. How can we turn this off? How can we shut off \nthe sequester?\n  I, frankly, believe we could do this in a much better way, a more \nresponsible way when it comes to the spending reductions. We ought to \ndo it in a way that doesn't put a disproportionate burden on the \ndefense budget. National security represents 20 percent of total \nFederal spending, but it gets 50 percent of the cuts under the \nsequester. That is not the way it ought to happen. I am all for--and \nplans have been offered and twice passed by the House Republicans--to \nreplace this sequester with other--what we believe are more responsible \nspending reductions. But that passed the House of Representatives; it \ncan't pass in the Senate.\n  The President has had no interest in looking at some alternative. The \nonly alternative he is interested in is the one that would do the most \nharm and the most damage to the American economy; that is, more taxes. \nIf he gets taxes on this, if he gets taxes to turn off the sequester \nlike the taxes he got on January 1, it will not be enough because it is \nnever enough.\n  People who believe in big government and believe the way to solve \ndeficits is to raise taxes are never going to raise enough revenue. If \nyou do not address what is really afflicting our country--and that is \nout-of-control spending--you have not done anything to solve the \nproblem, which the $620 billion tax increase on January 1 demonstrated. \nThe amount of money, the\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\namount of revenue generated from that tax increase January 1 will fund \nthe government this year for less than a week--less than a single week.\n  This is not a revenue problem. This is not a tax problem. This is a \nspending problem. It is time for some leadership. It is time for the \nPresident to quit campaigning, to come back here, and to start \ngoverning. But here we are--Friday, the day it is all set to take \neffect--we have a $16 trillion debt. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays at the end of the next 10 years it is going to be $26 trillion. We \nare adding $1 trillion a year. We are borrowing 40 cents out of every \n$1 we spend. Revenues coming into the Treasury, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, are going up, actually; and by 2015 they \nare going to be 19.1 percent of our entire economy, which is more than \na percentage point higher than the 40-year historical average.\n  Revenues are going up, and for the next decade, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, revenues will exceed, by about a \npercentage point, the 40-year historical average. So revenues are \ncoming up to above historical averages, and yet we continue to run \ntrillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  Well, we have to get our spending under control. We have to get the \neconomy going again. The Republican staff on the Joint Economic \nCommittee put out a study that suggested if we had revenue growth like \nwe have had--average revenue growth--for the past 60 years, if we had \nthat in the past 4 years, the deficits today would be half of what they \nare. That is the impact of economic growth. That is why growing at 1\\1/\n2\\ to 2 percent is not enough. We have to grow at 3 to 4 percent. But \nto grow at 3 to 4 percent, we have to have policies that promote \ngrowth, that allow the economy to expand. We cannot keep piling on new \ntaxes and new regulations and making it more difficult and more \nexpensive for people who create jobs in this country to create those \njobs.\n  So the economy will continue to grow at a sluggish, anemic rate. We \nwill continue to have these high deficits, particularly if we do not \nget our spending under control. It is about exercising fiscal \ndiscipline and responsibility when it comes to our spending. It is \nabout putting policies in place that promote job creation and growth in \nthis country. That is what it is going to take to get this country back \non track. Yet the President is out campaigning around the country. He \ncomes back now at the eleventh hour, and on March 1 he decides to have \na meeting at the White House to talk about something we have known was \ngoing to happen now for 18 months--18 months.\n  We have the most predictable crisis, according to the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission, we have ever seen--the spending and debt crisis that is in \nfront of us. We have known about it for a long time. You can see it. It \nis like a slow-moving train wreck out there. You are just watching it. \nYou just know it is going to happen, and yet nobody is doing anything \nto turn off the engines.\n  It is high time we did that. I hope the President will engage. I hope \nwe will get for the first time now in almost 4 years, 1,400 days, a \nbudget in the Senate that puts a plan in place--a real plan, not a fake \nplan, not a phony plan, not a plan that has a bunch of tax increases, \nbut a plan that actually addresses what drives Federal spending and \ndebt in a way that will put us on a more sustainable fiscal path and \nensure that future generations of Americans have a higher standard of \nliving, a higher quality of life than what previous generations have \nhad, not a lower and a less one. That is the path we are headed on \ntoday if we do not change course.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LEW TO BE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Jacob J. Lew, of New York, to \nbe Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 8 \nhours of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, America's first Treasury Secretary, \nAlexander Hamilton, once said:\n\n       The confidence of the people will easily be gained by a \n     good administration. This is the true touchstone.\n\n  Hamilton's words take on new prominence today as we task our next \nTreasury Secretary to gain the trust of the American people and restore \nconfidence in our Nation's economy.\n  Nineteen of twenty-four Senators on the Senate Finance Committee \nvoted yesterday on a bipartisan basis in favor of Jack Lew's \nnomination. Senators on both sides of the aisle spoke to his character \nand to his integrity. He is well qualified to be the Nation's next \nTreasury Secretary and will work to build the people's confidence and \nrestore trust and certainty in both our government and in our economy. \nThat will be his touchstone.\n  I am certainly not alone in supporting Mr. Lew for the crucial role \nas the administration's top adviser on economic policy. Yesterday's \noverwhelming support for Mr. Lew came after one of the most thorough \nreviews of any candidate for the position--a process that included \nhours of interviews with Mr. Lew, the examination of 6 years' of tax \nrecords, and more than 700 questions for the record.\n  In comparison, the committee asked Secretary Geithner 289 questions, \nSecretary Paulson 81 questions, and Secretary Snowe 75 questions. Mr. \nLew has met personally with more than 40 Senators since being nominated \nfor Treasury Secretary last month, answering questions and addressing \nany concerns. Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Lew has been \nopen and transparent. And, as I hope a vote in the Senate will soon \nshow, he has gained the trust and the confidence of many in this \nChamber.\n  Mr. Lew has a long and distinguished career focused on public \nservice, with experience in both academia and on Wall Street. Most \nrecently, he was the White House Chief of Staff. He has also served as \nBudget Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the current \nadministration and under President Clinton, where, I will note, he \nhelped guide our Nation through one of the greatest periods of economic \ngrowth in America's history.\n  Mr. Lew has also served in the U.S. Department of State as Deputy \nSecretary for Management and Resources. Mr. Lew has demonstrated time \nand again that he has the experience and knowledge to help get the \nNation's economy back on track.\n  We need a strong man at the helm to help tackle the many fiscal \nchallenges facing our Nation, and I believe Jack Lew is that man. Just \n2 days from now, on March 1, across-the-board budget cuts known as the \nsequester will hit. Madam President, $85 billion in Federal spending \nwill be sliced from thousands of programs, including Medicare, rural \ndevelopment, and early education. The nonpartisan Congressional\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\nBudget Office predicts the cuts could slow the economic recovery and \nresult in another year of sluggish growth and high unemployment.\n  I firmly believe we need to cut our debt and get our fiscal house in \norder. We know there are places to trim the fat. The American public \nknows that, certainly. But we need to take a scalpel to waste and \ninefficiency, not allow a hatchet to hack into American jobs.\n  Our economy will be put to the test again in just weeks when the \ncontinuing resolution expires on March 27. We face the threat of a \ngovernment shutdown. And on the horizon, the Federal borrowing limit \nwill be reached in late May. That will require another extension of the \ndebt ceiling.\n  This is no way to run a country. Congress has been lurching from one \nfiscal showdown to the next, leaving the Nation with uncertainty. The \nonly way we will be able to get past these budget battles is by working \ntogether. We all know that; we just have to start doing it--Republicans \nand Democrats, Members of the House and the Senate. We need to work \ntogether to put in place policies that create more jobs and spark \neconomic growth.\n  It is deeds, not words. We have enough words about working together. \nWe have to actually start performing the deeds and working together.\n  We will need to work with Mr. Lew and with the administration to put \nthe Nation's economy back on track. We need to get off this roller \ncoaster ride. It is like a yo-yo. There is no stability. There is no \ncertainty. Going from one fiscal crisis to the next is undermining our \neconomy.\n  To give families and businesses certainty, we must agree on a \nbalanced comprehensive plan to cut the debt that includes both revenue \nand spending cuts. The math will not work any other way. A long-term \nbalanced plan will bridge the budget battles and make real progress \ntoward solving our deficit problem. A balanced plan will also encourage \nbusinesses to invest, enable investors to return to the markets with \nconfidence and, most importantly, put Americans back to work in a \ngrowing economy. That is the bottom line, more jobs, more good-paying \njobs. We need more certainty and predictability so businesses may hire, \nexpand, and people are able to get those good-paying jobs.\n  Over the past 2 years I had a standing weekly call with Treasury \nSecretary Geithner. Every week we would go to the phone at 9:45 on \nWednesdays, and about once a month we personally visited, would get \ntogether to go over issues. No matter where we were, what we were \ndoing, we would always try to pick up the phone once a week to check \nin. I will tell you, it was on the minute, 9:45. Each of us knew the \nother was going to be there.\n  Secretary Geithner and I grew to become friends and trust each other. \nOur families started to have dinner together, do things together. It is \nthat trust and confidence that is so necessary and which is necessary \nto work together to make things happen. The conversations proved \ninvaluable as we worked to overcome numerous economic challenges.\n  I continue the outreach with Mr. Lew. I have been having a standing \nweekly call with him in anticipation he will soon be Treasury \nSecretary, and I am going to keep it up. I know he wants to also. It is \nvery heartening, frankly. He has been very open and receptive and is \neager to work with all of us here in the Congress to strengthen \nAmerica's economy and create more jobs. He wants to do a good job. He \nknows he must talk with us and communicate with us in order to do that. \nWorking together will be key to promoting economic growth and \nstability.\n  If confirmed by the Senate, one of Mr. Lew's first acts as Treasury \nSecretary will be affixing his signature to all new Federal Reserve \nnotes. I am not sure if people will be able to read his loopy \nsignature. It is an inside joke that sometimes people have a hard time \nreading his handwriting. His signature will be on the Federal Reserve \nnotes, and that loopy signature is described as looking more like a \nscratched-out slinky than a name. That is Mr. Lew. That is the way he \nsigns. Mr. Lew promised the President that if confirmed he will work to \nmake at least one letter legible in order to not deface America's \ncurrency, and we will hold him to that promise.\n  In addition to the signature of America's Treasury Secretary, the \nfront of every U.S. dollar bill has the seal of the United States \nTreasury. Look closely and you will see the symbols of balancing the \nscales to represent justice. There is a chevron containing 13 stars \nwhich represents the 13 original colonies. Underneath the emblem is a \nkey which notes Treasury's official authority.\n  If confirmed, we will be trusting Mr. Lew with the authority to \noversee America's financial system and economic policy. He will play a \ncritical role in the upcoming debates on priorities and spending cuts. \nWe will be relying on him to ensure our government and finances are \nsound. We will be asking him to work with us to return some stability \nand confidence to our economy. We will be asking him to work with us to \nensure the United States remains a great world power in this \ncompetitive global economy. It is a great responsibility he has, one \nwhich I believe Mr. Lew will live up to.\n  Two hundred twenty-four years ago, this body, the U.S. Senate, \napproved the first Cabinet position for this young Nation when it \nunanimously approved Alexander Hamilton to become first Secretary of \nthe Treasury. I ask my colleagues to confirm Mr. Lew today to be our \nNation's 76th Treasury Secretary, to enable him to begin work helping \nto strengthen our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Mr. Jacob Lew to be Secretary of the Treasury. This is an important \nnomination. With our still-struggling economy and our growing fiscal \nproblems, the next Treasury Secretary is going to have a lot on his \nplate. That being the case, we have worked on the Finance Committee to \nvet Mr. Lew, to examine his background credentials, and provide a \ncomplete picture of his qualifications for this post.\n  I wish to offer a few comments about our review process, what we have \nlearned, and the reservations about the nominee that remain with me now \nthat this process is complete.\n  Let me begin by saying a few words about the process itself. For well \nover a decade, the Finance Committee has followed a specified procedure \nwhen considering executive branch nominations. Sadly, that procedure \nwas not followed in the case of Mr. Lew.\n  After publicly announcing Mr. Lew's nomination, the White House \nwaited 16 days before submitting any of his paperwork. That was an \natypically long delay and, in addition to slowing the vetting process, \nit ensured Mr. Lew would not be confirmed in time to prevent a vacancy \nat the Treasury Department. A nomination hearing was scheduled to be \nheld only 12 calendar days after the paperwork was received, even \nthough the nominee had not answered all of the questions submitted to \nhim.\n  That is simply not the way our process has worked in the past, and \nthe undue haste seriously hampered our ability to thoroughly examine \nMr. Lew's background and his qualifications.\n  Once the hearing was completed, as is customary, members of the \nFinance Committee submitted written questions for the record. Since \nthat time, anonymous administration sources have decried the very \nnotion that members of the Finance Committee had the audacity to ask \nhundreds of questions of Mr. Lew as part of their constitutional \nadvice-and-consent responsibilities.\n\n  Let me be clear. I will vigorously defend the right of any Member of \nCongress, regardless of party, to ask questions of nominees until they \nare satisfied they have obtained all the relevant information, and \nespecially in the case of the Treasury Secretary, which is one of the \nmost important assignments in our government today and always has been. \nIf we go all the way back to the time of Alexander Hamilton, we know \nwhat he meant to this country by establishing the financial system of \nthis country as the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  In the case of Mr. Lew, there were several reasons why he ended up \nbeing asked numerous questions. First, the nomination process, as I \nmentioned, was abbreviated due to the haste of the administration. That \nmeant the questions which through the course of ordinary business could \nhave been resolved\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nthrough discussion had to be asked in written form.\n  Second, due to the general unresponsiveness of the administration to \nrequests for information over the last few years, there is a pent-up \ndemand for information and any semblance of responsiveness from the \nexecutive branch.\n  Third, Mr. Lew's responses to many questions have been opaque. He has \ndissembled often. That being the case, it seemed the only way to get \nanswers to straightforward questions was to continue to ask for \nclarifications in an attempt to break through the wall of obfuscation \nMr. Lew had constructed. I have no doubt he could have answered most of \nthese questions in much less numerical form than he did.\n  Even after extensive questioning, there remain several serious \nconcerns with Mr. Lew's background, his lack of responsiveness, and the \nevasive manner in which he answered many questions which were posed to \nhim. Unfortunately, many of these concerns will go unaddressed, as Mr. \nLew seems to be following the standard stonewalling strategy used by so \nmany officials in the Obama administration.\n  For years now administration officials have gone out of their way to \nbe unresponsive to information requests from Congress, and that is \nsimply unacceptable. Far too often, legitimate inquiries submitted to \nthe executive branch go unanswered for months at a time. Requested \ndeadlines are discarded. Indeed, in some instances information requests \nare ignored entirely. When responses are given, substantive and direct \nquestions are given meaningless political answers. This has gone on far \ntoo long and it needs to stop.\n  Mr. Lew, for his part, has promised me that he would be responsive to \ninquiries submitted by Members of Congress. While his answers to \nquestions throughout the confirmation process give me reason to doubt \nhis commitment to being responsive, I intend to hold him to that \nprocess moving forward. I believe he is an honorable man and I believe \nhe will try to do this.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to address some additional substantive \nconcerns I have about Mr. Lew, his background, and his qualifications \nfor this post.\n  Let's consider Mr. Lew's Citigroup years. At Citigroup Mr. Lew was \nmanaging director and chief operating officer of two units, Global \nWealth Management and Citigroup Alternative Investments. Mr. Lew \nclaimed repeatedly while managing, directing, and operating those \nCitigroup units he essentially undertook back-room operations such as \nfiring people, moving office space, integrating computer systems, \neliminating redundancies, and things of that nature.\n  Mr. Lew has also repeatedly stated he did not design financial \nproducts at Citigroup, make portfolio decisions or, in his words, opine \non investments. In fact, when asked about investment products which \nwere marketed and sold by the Citigroup units he oversaw, he could not \nremember any specific details.\n  It needs to be noted some of those investments ended up generating \nenormous losses for investors. For example, funds called MAT, ASTA and \nFalcon, which were marketed, sold, and managed by the Citigroup units \nMr. Lew oversaw ended up being the subject of lawsuits and successful \narbitration claims, where success was based on investors convincing \narbitrators the funds were misrepresented and mismanaged by Citigroup. \nThe losses to investors from these funds numbered in the billions. In \nfact, some financial advisers at Citigroup protested internally the \nmisrepresented securities caused enormous damage to Citi's reputation.\n  One of Mr. Lew's bosses at Citigroup argued on behalf of the \ninvestors and against Citi's stock price and bottom line by saying the \ninvestors had been wronged and should be made whole. She was \nsubsequently fired.\n  From all information I have seen, Mr. Lew did not similarly stand up \nfor wronged investors while on Wall Street. Perhaps it is because he \ndid not know what was going on in the firm or at his firm. We don't \nreally know. Despite the fact the funds in question led to probably the \nlargest losses in the history of the units Mr. Lew oversaw, Mr. Lew \nclaims that he cannot recall anything about them. If you ask anyone \nfamiliar with the funds and controversies surrounding them, they will \nsay you would need to have been away on a desert island to not have \nheard about the problems that these funds faced. Yet, once again, Mr. \nLew continues to deny having any memory of them.\n  At the same time Mr. Lew claims while he was at Citigroup he learned \na lot about financial markets and the dangers of risk. Indeed, he cited \nhis experience at Citi as a qualification to be Treasury Secretary, \neven though he appears to have little recollection about any of the \nactual details of his work at that time, or at least his financial \ndetails.\n  The question remains: How could Mr. Lew operate, manage, direct units \nand also be in charge of staffing decisions without having any \nknowledge of the financial products that were marketed, sold, and \nmanaged by these very same units? It remains unclear.\n  Had there been a traditional vetting process, perhaps we could have \ngotten to the bottom of this mystery. As it is we are only left to \nspeculate, as you can see.\n  In addition to Mr. Lew's lack of knowledge about some of the high-\nprofile failures of the units he was overseeing, there are legitimate \nconcerns relating to his compensation while at Citigroup.\n  On January 29, 2009, President Obama made remarks about Wall Street, \nsaying that institutions were ``teetering on collapse and they are \nasking for taxpayers to help sustain them.''\n  The President also remarked on Wall Street bonuses at the time, \nsaying:\n\n       That is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful.\n\n  About Wall Street executives, he said:\n\n       There will be a time for them to get bonuses. . . . Now is \n     not the time.\n\n  Elsewhere he referred to Wall Street bonuses as ``obscene.''\n  In late 2008 and early 2009, American taxpayers provided over $45 \nbillion--that is with a ``B''--in direct assistance to Citigroup and \nbacked hundreds of billions of Citigroup assets. At the same time, in \nJanuary 2009, Mr. Lew reportedly received over $940,000 in \ncompensation, most of which was a bonus for work performed in 2008 when \nCiti was on the verge of collapse. The bonus came a day before Citi \nreceived yet another infusion of billions of dollars of taxpayer money \nto prop up the company. That was the day before Citigroup received the \ninfusion of billions of dollars that he got that bonus.\n  There is, at the very least, a contradiction between the President's \nrhetoric with regard to Wall Street and his decision to appoint Mr. Lew \nto be Treasury Secretary. However, rather than acknowledging any such \ncontradiction, Mr. Lew has simply repeatedly told us all that his \ncompensation was in line with what other similarly situated executives \nreceived.\n  As I have said before, that justification seems a bit like saying: \nGee, Dad, everyone was doing it. Unfortunately, that type of reasoning \nis exactly what led to the financial crisis.\n  In addition, an employment agreement Mr. Lew had with Citigroup had a \nclause stating that his guaranteed incentive and retention award would \nnot be paid upon his exit from Citigroup. However, there was an \nexception indicating that he would receive that compensation ``as a \nresult of his acceptance of a full-time high-level position with the \nUnited States government or regulatory body.'' It remains unclear how \nthis exception is consistent with President Obama's efforts to, in his \nown words, ``close the revolving door that carries special interest \ninfluence in and out of the government.''\n  Of course, as has been widely reported during the course of our \nvetting process, we found that while he was at Citigroup, Mr. Lew \nactively chose to invest in a hedge fund that served as a venture \ncapital-like fund that invested primarily overseas. The fund Mr. Lew \ninvested in was based in the Cayman Islands at the infamous Ugland \nHouse that so many Democrats have viciously decried as a tax haven. In \nfact, in 2008, while campaigning for President, then-Senator Obama said \nthat the Ugland House was ``either the biggest building in the world or \nthe biggest tax scam in the world.''\n  Throughout the 2012 campaign, President Obama repeatedly attacked \nMitt Romney for having funds invested in the Caymans. If I recall it \ncorrectly, Mitt Romney's funds were in a trust he\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nhad no control over. In making such investments, Governor Romney was, \nin the words of the Obama campaign, betting against America. One can \nonly wonder whether while serving as White House Chief of Staff for \nPresident Obama, Mr. Lew supported this line of attack.\n  Once again, Mr. Lew has repeatedly refused to acknowledge any \ncontradiction or hypocrisy between the President's rhetoric and his own \nactions, defending himself only by saying that this investment was done \nlegally and transparently. I think the same probably could have been \nsaid about Governor Romney's investments as well, which were in a blind \ntrust.\n  The contrast between the President's past vilification of certain \nfinancial activities and individuals and Mr. Lew's very participation \nin those activities is striking. Yet we are now essentially being told \nthat people should do as administration officials say, not as they did.\n  In addition to concerns about Mr. Lew's record, I have serious \ndisagreements with him when it comes to policy. For example, in \nresponse to written questions, Mr. Lew backtracked from the \nadministration's previous positions on the need for entitlement reform. \nAt one time, commonsense reforms, such as raising the Medicare \neligibility age, were on the table for the Obama administration. Such \nideas have apparently been discarded by the President, and Mr. Lew has \nmade it clear he shares that discarding position.\n  As a Social Security and Medicare trustee, the Treasury Secretary \ncannot simply wish away the problems with our entitlement programs. If \nhe is confirmed, and I believe he will be, Mr. Lew will be tasked with \naddressing these problems. Sadly, it appears he will be just another \nvoice in the Obama administration against taking meaningful action on \nentitlements and in favor of higher taxes--a repetitive theme at least \nall of us Republicans are getting very sick of. The use of the word \n``balance''--my gosh, what a perversion.\n  I think I have made my concerns about the Lew nomination very soundly \nand very clear. That being said, I have always believed that whoever is \nPresident, including our current President, whom I like--any President, \nregardless of party--is owed a certain degree of deference when \nchoosing people to work in his administration. Therefore, though I \npersonally would have chosen a different person for this position, I \nintend to vote in favor of Mr. Lew's confirmation.\n  Obviously, my vote in favor of Mr. Lew comes with no small amount of \nreservation, and I don't fault any of my colleagues for choosing to \nvote against him. Indeed, I share many of their same concerns. As I \nmentioned earlier, Mr. Lew has promised to be responsive to Members of \nCongress and their requests for information. I expect him to be \nresponsive to the Senate Finance Committee and to the Republicans on \nthe Senate Finance Committee as well as the Democrats.\n  He has also promised to work in a bipartisan manner to address the \nproblems facing our Nation. I believe Mr. Lew can, and hopefully will, \ndo that. My hope is he does not view these promises as merely boxes \nchecked off on the way to confirmation.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Lew will be the Secretary of the Treasury of the \nUnited States and not the Secretary of the ``Obama treasury,'' although \nindirectly he will be. His first job is to the United States of \nAmerica, and he might have to argue strenuously against some of the \nWhite House positions on financial matters and Treasury matters. He has \nto work for all the American people and not simply one political party.\n\n  If he does those things, I will be willing to work with him all the \nway, and I have to say I expect him to. I expect him to be the \nhonorable man he has told me he is and that I believe him to be; \notherwise, I couldn't vote for him, especially under these \ncircumstances.\n  However, I have to say, if he fails to live up to the promises he has \nmade, if he becomes just another Obama acolyte using his high-powered \nposition in the administration to attack political opponents, I will \npersonally be sorely disappointed and hurt by it. If that ends up being \nthe case, he will have no greater adversary in the Senate. I don't want \nto be an adversary. I want to help him turn this country around. I want \nto be an asset to him up here, and I want him to be an asset to our \ncountry down there--and up here when he comes.\n  Given my many reservations and concerns about Mr. Lew, I hope he and \nthe President take note that I am bending over backward to display \ndeference to the President's choice of Treasury Secretary. This \ngesture, I hope, will not be in vain.\n  I can contrast Mr. Lew's positions when he worked in the Clinton \nadministration. Many Republicans felt he was a straight-up guy, and I \nwas one of them. I have suggested to him that we would like to see that \ntype of person manage our Treasury rather than the partisan person we \nhave seen in the last couple years. True, the position he had at the \nWhite House was a partisan position, and I make a great allowance for \nthat.\n  I personally like this man. I personally believe he is a good man. \nBut I also believe sometimes we can get so caught up in politics that \nwe don't do what we know we should do. I am hoping he will. I believe \nhe will. If he does, he is going to have a lot of support from me.\n  I wish to thank my chairman of the committee. He has always been very \nhonorable and very straightforward. I understand a lot of the pressures \nhe has had throughout this process, having been chairman a number of \ntimes myself in the Senate and experienced that stress. I want \neverybody to know this is an important position, this is an important \nhuman being, and I hope he lives up to all he has the capacity to live \nup to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Veterans Unemployment\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to speak \non a topic that is very important to me, to Montana, and our Nation; \nthat is, our veterans.\n  The Veterans Jobs Caucus has organized a day of action today to draw \nattention to veterans unemployment, and I am very proud to help shine a \nlight on that.\n  Jobs must be our No. 1 priority. There is no better place to start \nthan with our veterans. With the war in Iraq coming to an end and \nAfghanistan winding down, we have a responsibility to make sure every \nsingle one of these men and women returns home to a paycheck, not an \nunemployment check.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in declaring war on veterans \nunemployment. Let us work together to make sure every American veteran \nhas the good-paying job they deserve.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have made it clear that I oppose the \nconfirmation of Jack Lew to the most serious Cabinet position of \nSecretary of the Treasury. The President's Cabinet nominees should be \ngiven substantial deference; that is not in doubt. But our Constitution \nmakes clear that appointments to high government office may only be \nmade by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Certainly, the \nSenate is not a rubberstamp or a potted plant.\n  I believe a decent respect for the seriousness of this occasion, for \nmy colleagues and for their opinions, for the President and for the \nnominee, requires, in this case, that I set forth my objections to the \nappointment. They are serious, and I believe what I say is important; \nimportant for the institution of the Senate and important for our \ncountry.\n  I have not had a personal relationship or extended meetings with Mr. \nLew. My objections arise primarily and first from his performance as \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. It is, in many ways, a \nkey position in our government. That is the office through which the \nPresident controls all the departments and Agencies of our government \nwhich he is required to supervise.\n  Normally and necessarily, the OMB Director is the single office that \ndrives efficiency and demands accountability on behalf of the President \nand the American people throughout our great\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nbureaucracy. In that aspect of his job I have seen little leadership, \nand at this time of surging debt, I would rate that performance as an \nF. I have never seen a consistent, determined effort from Director Lew \nto reform and make more productive the government of the U.S. Indeed, \nhis primary effort consistently has seemed to be to defend any program \nunder attack, scrutiny, or question rather than examining vigorously to \nsave every single dollar that can be saved for the taxpayers of the \ncountry.\n  If the OMB Director will not insist on efficiency and good \ngovernment, who will? The Secretary of Energy, pushing out failed \nSolyndra programs? Is that whom we look to? Or the GSA leaders who host \nhot tub parties in Las Vegas? This government of ours has never been \nmore poorly managed. It has never had, for a number of years, the \nserious oversight and management from the top supervisory agencies.\n  Congress is not empowered to daily manage the agencies of America. \nThat is the Chief Executive's job, and the primary person in his \nadministration, President Obama's administration, charged with this \nduty is the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. At least, \nhistorically, that has been the case.\n  But, my concerns go even deeper. I believe every public official in \nthis Nation owes an absolute loyalty to the United States, to the \nbetterment of this country and its government, and to the institutional \nprocesses that lead to the governing of America. There can be no doubt \nthat every government official, from the President on down, is \naccountable to the institutions of our government and to the people \nultimately.\n  Without doubt, the Director of OMB has such a duty. He is required to \nmeet that duty with honor, honesty, efficiency, and responsiveness. He \nserves us; we don't serve him. He serves the American people.\n  The American people send their money to Washington, and they expect \nit will be honestly and openly managed--accountable. They have every \nright to demand high performance from all officials, but particularly \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Surely, there can be no higher duty for such an important official \nthan to periodically report to the people truthfully on the important \naffairs of state--specifically to report the financial condition of the \nNation and to produce a budget plan that will fix it. Without doubt, \nthe great challenge of our time is how to confront effectively the \nunsustainable debt course we are now on. That is clearly the greatest \nthreat to our Republic.\n  Admiral Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has \nsaid debt is the greatest threat to our national security. We are \nheading toward a financial crisis if we do not change. All have told us \nthat, including Simpson and Bowles of the President's debt commission. \nThey said this Nation has never faced a more predictable financial \ncrisis. They jointly gave that statement to us in the Budget Committee.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, when asked to make comments about \nsome of the long, great projections of debt out into the future, said: \nThat will never happen. You will never get that. In effect he said: You \nwill have a crisis before that ever happens. We are on an unsustainable \ndebt path.\n  Even the most current Secretary of Treasury, Secretary Geithner, made \nthe same comments about Director Lew's budget. He acknowledged that \nthat budget left the country on an unsustainable financial path. \nTherefore, the report of the Nation's top management official on budget \nand management to Congress on these issues must be absolutely accurate. \nIt must be true. His budget that he would set forth as director of the \nbudget each year, as required by law--the President submits a budget--\nmust put the Nation on a sound and sustainable course, not keep us on \nan unsustainable course.\n\n  If changes in the operating methods of the country are needed, he \nshould say so and help lead that reform effort. He is the one who keeps \nthe books. He is the one who must, along with the President, rally the \nNation, as mayors and county commissioners and Governors have done all \nover America to rein in reckless spending and unacceptable debt in \ntheir jurisdictions. Why is it not happening here, now, at this time of \nnational crisis?\n  In February 2011, as Director of OMB, Mr. Lew produced a budget for \nthe President, and he presented it to the people and to the Congress. \nThat was February, 2 years ago. He was the budget director.\n  The budget he prepared utterly failed to meet the needs of the \nNation. It just did. As Mr. Bowles said right after the budget was \nannounced by Mr. Lew--he said with great disappointment, the White \nHouse budget request ``goes nowhere near where they will have to go to \nresolve our fiscal nightmare.'' This is the man President Obama \nappointed to head the debt commission, and he said this budget came \nnowhere near where they will have to go to avoid our fiscal nightmare. \nThis budget was a disaster.\n  Instead of making our debt problem better, it made it worse. It taxed \nmore and spent more. I was shocked and amazed.\n  Please remember, this was in February 2011, not long after the \nmidterm congressional elections in which the American people rose up \nand shellacked a lot of big spenders and demanded that we get our \nfinancial house in order. The American people were shocked by the \nexplosion of debt and the surge of big government, and they demanded \nmore accountability. They insisted on it. Presenting a budget that did \nnot do what the public demanded, control spending and debt, would not \nhave been popular.\n  Imagine what went on in the White House. I am just a Member of the \nSenate. I observe these things like all of us. The question was, Would \nthe President of the United States now, after the midterm elections \nthat gave the majority to the House of Representatives--would at that \npoint a policy, a budget, set forth a sound, sustainable path for \nAmerica that could lead the country out of this fix?\n  I know they discussed it. Surely, they did. It was the most important \nissue they faced. Would they back down from spending and investment and \ntaxes? Would they opt for a more limited growth in spending in America?\n  They made their decision. Actually, it is pretty clear two decisions \nwere made. I do not think this is unfair to analyze it in this way. \nFirst, they decided that despite the election, they would not curtail \nspending or lay out a plan that would alter the debt course of America; \nthat they would not fix and save and strengthen our entitlement \nprograms, such as Social Security; and they would lie in wait, I guess, \nfor anybody in the House of Representatives, particularly, and \ncriticize their plan. They would not lay out any plan in their budget, \nwhich is the time that you would normally lay out your plan. They would \nset up a method to attack the Republicans when they produced their \nbudget, as required by law, and their budget would have to deal with \nthese things and propose real cuts in spending, and they would \ncriticize that. Apparently, that is a decision they made.\n  But this presented a problem. To announce a budget that did not do \nwhat the public had just demanded--control spending and control debt--\nwould not be popular. So what do you do then? It is pretty clear to me \nhow the conundrum was decided.\n  Mr. Lew would go before the American people and Congress and just \ndeclare that the budget he had put forth did put the Nation on a sound \nfinancial course; that it would end deficits and put us in a position \nto pay down our debt. They just decided that Mr. Lew would go out, \ndespite what was in the budget, and declare that it would do those \nthings. Thus, the statements of Mr. Lew amounted to what I have \ncalled--and will explain--the greatest financial misrepresentation \nconcerning the finances of this Nation ever made.\n  If somebody has something different, I would like to see it. I would \nlike to see somebody say, when we finish talking about this, that they \nhave other examples of this kind of misrepresentation.\n  These statements were made carefully and deliberately calculated and \nfor the political purpose, I have to say, of misleading the public. You \nmay say: Surely not, Jeff. You are exaggerating this situation. Surely, \nhe wouldn't do that.\n  Let me tell you what happened. The day before the budget was to be \nreleased, on a Monday, Mr. Lew went on\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nthe Sunday news programs to report on the budget that the President \nwould be submitting to explain what was in it. This is what he said on \nCNN on a Sunday morning program.\n\n  I will put this up because the words should live in infamy. This is \nhow he described the budget he laid out:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say, we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down our national debt.\n\n  That is exactly what the American people want to hear. There was no \nqualification placed on this statement, none whatsoever. He was \nspeaking directly to the American people on a Sunday morning news \nprograms. He said other things on several of the other programs that he \nparticipated in on February 12, 2011.\n  There were no qualifications. How could it be heard other than the \nway those plain words would suggest? It suggests that we had a plan, \nthat the President had a plan, and that Mr. Lew was producing a \nbudget--which his office produced--that would make sure we were on a \nsustainable financial course and we would not be adding to the debt \nanymore. ``We're not adding to the debt anymore.''\n  What else did that suggest? It suggested we can relax. We didn't need \nto talk about real spending reductions because we had a plan. Just \nfollow the President's plan. Everything is going to be okay; relax. \nDon't get too excited as they did in this last election because we have \neverything under control. Our plan fixes it.\n  That is essentially what happened, but the budget documents Mr. Lew \nsubmitted revealed the opposite. The question is: Did his own documents \nconfirm this analysis? Did it come close to it? Well, these documents \nwill reveal the truth. Actually, his documents revealed a rosy scenario \nof the truth. The numbers I am going to give of what his documents \nreveal turned out to be less positive than even they predicted.\n  In his own accounting table, Mr. Lew's 10-year budget got nowhere \nclose to the point where we could not say we are adding to the debt \nanymore or that we were in a position to pay down the debt. To anybody \nwho has the slightest concern for the meaning of words--or who believes \nin the most basic concept of an objective truth--this statement must be \ncondemned. Even though the Lew budget documents made calculations more \nfavorable than the rosy projections of CBO, it still unequivocally \nshowed that over the 10-year budget window there was never a year--not \none year--when we would be able to pay down the debt or balance the \nbudget or not add more debt.\n  Indeed, over the 10-year period his budget covered, which he was \nreferring to in this document, we would add $13 trillion to the total \ndebt of the United States. It would almost double it. It would be $9 \ntrillion to the public debt and $13 trillion to the gross debt. The \nyear with the single lowest deficit out of 10 years was $600 billion in \ndebt. In other words, the lowest single annual deficit in 10 years was \n$600 billion. President Bush's highest deficit was less than $500 \nbillion over 8 years. This is a huge debt, $600 billion, but would \naverage almost $1 trillion a year. On average it would be $1,000 \nbillion a year, which clearly leaves us on the same unsustainable path \nwe had been on.\n  On Tuesday Mr. Lew appeared before the Budget Committee. I am the \nranking Republican on the Budget Committee. I was amazed at what he was \nsaying on television. After we scrambled around and looked at the \ndocuments, it became clear this was not close to correct. How could the \nBudget Director of the United States of America go on national TV and \nmake these kinds of statements? How can we have any expectation of the \ntruth in Washington when the Budget Director tells us we are on a sound \npath when it didn't appear to be so? And, indeed, it wasn't so.\n  He came before the Budget Committee, and I quoted this CNN statement \nto him. I read it back to him and directly asked whether his statement \nwas accurate, and this is what he replied:\n\n       It's an accurate statement that our current spending will \n     not be increasing the debt . . . We've stopped spending money \n     we don't have.\n\n  Further, let me note that outside the 10-year window--based on the \nfinancial plan that that budget set forth--the deficits got worse. They \nwere going up in the outyears. The lowest year was $600 billion, but \nthey were going up every single year, by his own accounting. CBO's \nnumbers were much higher as far as the debt that would be added to the \ncountry.\n  For me this was a most stunning development. I don't believe it could \nbe explained away. It is obvious he determined that he was going to \nstand pat with his story, which was a political narrative that they \nwanted to spin. They wanted to spin a political narrative, but it was \nnot accurate, and that is important for us. The chief budget person in \nAmerica needs to tell the American people and the Budget Committee of \nthe U.S. Senate the absolute truth about the financial condition of \nthis country. He is not entitled to sugarcoat it, and he is absolutely \nnot entitled to totally misrepresent it.\n  I examined him. He said we are going to have a primary debt. We are \ngoing to have a primary deficit. So what is this, a primary debt? Well, \nwe don't count interest. I kid you not. The Budget Director of the \nUnited States of America said the statement--as I interpret it, and it \nwas not inaccurate--that he was not counting the interest on the debt. \nDid he qualify that when he told the American people that? No, he did \nnot. Did he make any kind of representations as to that? No. I would \nsuggest the numbers clearly show that even if we have the kind of bogus \naccounting where we don't count our interest, who could possibly write \na household budget, a city budget, or a State budget that didn't \naccount for the interest they have to pay every year? How ridiculous is \nthat? That is the kind of phony, gimmicky accounting that puts this \ncountry on a path to financial crisis. But that is what he said. Even \nby that definition it was not true, and this would not be true, and it \nis false. Well, phony accounting procedures, budget manipulations, and \ngimmicks such as this primary balanced idea are the way politicians \nhave maneuvered us into a situation where our path is so dangerous.\n  The American people are not happy about it, and they should not be \nhappy. There is no reason we have placed this country at such risk \nbecause of debt and spending--no reason we should do that. They sent us \nhere to this Congress for a lot of reasons, but the primary reason is \nto properly manage their money.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont, and I think we might get there a \ndifferent way, but I think we may share some of the views about this \nnomination. I respect his independence and gumption, as we would say in \nAlabama, to express his views openly and directly.\n  I will talk some more because this is an important matter, and I \ndon't intend to let it go lightly. I believe this Congress and the \nAmerican people are entitled to honest, sober, serious commentary and \ninformation from our leaders, and we are not getting it. It makes it \nhard to get the American people together to figure out how to tighten \nour belts and how to handle the financial crisis we are in if we have \ntop officials who say: We don't have a crisis, don't worry about it, we \nhave a plan that fixes it.\n  I don't see any reason to extend for a longer period of time the Lew \nnomination. He has come out of committee and he has bipartisan support. \nHe is going to be in a position to be confirmed, but I am not going to \nvote for him. I wish to talk some more about some of the additional \nproblems we have with his nomination but will do so later. I believe it \nis my responsibility to do so, and I intend to fulfill it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I say to my friend that he is right \nwhen he said that I oppose the Lew nomination also. I oppose his \nnomination for different reasons than he does, and I will speak later \non that issue.\n  From my perspective, at a time when the middle class is disappearing, \nwhen we have 46 million people living in poverty, when we have the most \nunequal distribution of wealth and income since the Great Depression, \nwe need a Secretary of Treasury who is going to\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nstand up for working families and be prepared to take on Wall Street. \nHe needs to be prepared to change our disastrous trade policies, be \nprepared to defend Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the safety \nnet that is so important to tens of millions of Americans. That is my \nobjection to Mr. Lew.\n  I agree with my friend from Alabama that deficit reduction is a \nserious issue. Where we disagree is that I don't believe we balance a \nbudget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the \npoor.\n  I ask my friend to take a look at the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. \nTake a look at all the corporations making record-breaking profits and \nstashing their money in the Cayman Islands. For what purpose? To avoid \npaying taxes to the U.S. Government.\n  The Senator and I have met with the parents of young men and women \nwho have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that is called patriotism. \nIt is not called patriotism when corporations run to the Cayman Islands \nto avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the Senator's views, I am concerned that \nworking Americans are not being fairly recompensed for their work on \nthe American debt. We have gone a long time with no real net \nimprovement in the income, inflation has been higher than wages, and \nWall Street is doing fine. It seems as though they win whether things \ngo up or down. I don't have any brief for that crowd. I think the \nSenator is right to be skeptical about how things are handled on Wall \nStreet, and I salute my friend for being aggressive in that pursuit.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend from Alabama, and with that, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                           Budget Malpractice\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to mark \nanother lamentable milestone in the long record of deadlines and \nmisgoverning that might be called malpractice over the last 4 years. As \nwe can see, today is the 1,400th day our colleagues across the aisle, \nwho control the agenda on the floor of the Senate through the majority \nleader, have failed to produce a budget or even bring one to the floor \nso we could vote on one. For 1,400 days this body has been truant from \none of the most fundamental obligations to the American people.\n  When they look to see what is happening in Washington, DC, they are \nincredulous. No family, no small business, no local government, no \nState government, no one except for the Federal Government, could \nactually operate without a budget. For nearly 4 years the Democratic \nleadership of the Senate has failed to put forward a fiscal plan to \nbreak our economy free from the lingering effects of the Great \nRecession. And the consequences of that are pretty clear when we look \nat trillion-dollar annual deficits and when we look at $16.5 trillion \nof debt which has threatened our economic recovery and job creation. \nThat is the bitter fruit sown from the negligence of failing to produce \na budget for 1,400 days.\n\n  I realize none of this is maybe as easy as it looks, and I know our \nDemocratic colleagues have been under constant pressure from the White \nHouse. Indeed, the White House itself has long reinterpreted the role \nof its annual budget submissions to Congress from the governing \ndocuments they once were to now really no more than political \nposturing. As evidence of that, I would point to the fact that the \nPresident's last budget he submitted got zero votes out of 99 Senators \nvoting. No Member, even of the President's own political party, would \nsupport his budget proposal last time because they believed it was not \na governing document they could support instead of just a political \nstatement.\n  These are some of the reasons I can't vote for Jack Lew for Treasury \nSecretary. After all, it was on his watch that most of this happened.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the fact that in my office as well as in \nthe hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Lew would not \ncommit to any limit--to any limit--on Federal spending. Traditionally, \nover the last 40 years or so, the Federal Government has spent roughly \n20 percent of our gross domestic product. It has been as high as 25 \npercent under the Obama administration. When I asked Mr. Lew what is \nthe right figure we ought to be shooting for, he wouldn't even mention \nany figure. So he would not commit to any limit on Federal Government \nspending.\n  He also would not commit to the administration complying with Federal \nlaw requiring it to submit a blueprint for reforming Medicare, known as \nthe Medicare trigger. It is a complex formula. But if Medicare is in \ntrouble, Federal law requires the administration to submit a plan to \nfix it. Mr. Lew said: We didn't do it, and we are not going to do it.\n  I can't support a nominee who refuses to commit to tackling one of \nthe biggest drivers of our debt on the eve of another manufactured \nfiscal showdown that was actually the President's and the White House's \nidea--this sequester people are hearing so much about which is now \nbeing used as a means by which to extract more money from the American \ntaxpayer. So instead of the Federal Government doing what every family \nand every business has to do when there is not enough money coming in \nthe door, the White House and the Democratic leadership are insisting \non more from hard-working Americans, after a $600 billion tax increase \nin December.\n  Unfortunately, it is hardly surprising that President Obama would \nnominate someone who cannot simply commit to following the law. This \nadministration has a record, sadly, of flouting the law of the land, \nand I will give some examples.\n  This administration, of which Mr. Lew has been an essential member, \nhas, for example, during the government-run automobile bankruptcy \nprocess--the company's secured creditors, who were supposed to get paid \nfirst, found they were given less than unions were because of politics \nand flouting the rule of law.\n  As Solyndra was going bankrupt, we know the administration, rather \nthan letting the private lenders pay for their bad judgment, decided to \nmake the taxpayers subordinate to those private lenders.\n  We know that last year, because the circuit court of appeals in the \nDistrict of Columbia has told us so, the President made \nunconstitutional appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and \nto now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That case hasn't been \ndecided, but it is impossible for me to see how the rationale would be \nany different from the court of appeals' decision in the NLRB case.\n  We also know that last year the President waived key requirements of \nthe 1996 welfare reform law. And to help implement ObamaCare, the \nInternal Revenue Service has announced that it will violate the letter \nof the law and dispense health insurance subsidies through Federal \nexchanges in those States that do not create State-based exchanges.\n  We know that when the 2,700-page behemoth known as ObamaCare began to \nbe implemented, when some of the supporters--and some of the \nPresident's own supporters--complained about it, they were issued \nwaivers even though the rest of the American people had to simply take \nit.\n  Finally, the President has again missed the legal deadline for \nsubmitting his own budget for this year. That was on February 4. In \nfact, four of the last five budgets have been late.\n  Simply put, we can't keep living like this. We can't allow this to \nbecome a precedent for future Presidents and future majorities, \nregardless of party, to rely on. We can do better. We must do better. \nAnd my 26 million constituents in the State of Texas demand that we do \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, just to follow up further on the \nsituation we face, I talked earlier about the critical importance of \nhaving honest numbers. We can disagree on certain numbers. Mr. Lew \npredicted that under\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nhis budget, last year's deficit in the 10th year would be about $800 \nbillion. The Congressional Budget Office, using the same numbers, the \nsame analysis, says it would be 50 percent higher. They said it would \nbe $1.2 trillion. He was using rosy scenarios. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office came out with greater debt numbers and more \ndanger for America.\n  I am not so much complaining about that, although I think they \ndeliberately tried to make their numbers look rosy. What I am \ncomplaining about is a fundamental mischaracterization of the budget he \npresented and what it would do according to his own analysis contained \nin the budget documents he submitted with his budget.\n  This is a very important matter. People say: Why don't you get \ntogether in Congress? Why don't you all reach an agreement? Well, it is \nkind of hard to reach an agreement when the lead negotiator for the \nPresident, Mr. Lew--some call him Dr. No--goes around saying:\n\n       We don't need to do anything; our budget we submitted will \n     get us over the next several years to the point where we can \n     look the American people in the eye and say, We're not adding \n     to the debt anymore; we're spending money that we have each \n     year, and then we can work on bringing down our debt.\n\n  He implies bringing down our total debt because we are going to have \nsurpluses, enough money to pay down the debt. However, according to his \nown numbers, the lowest deficit he had was over $600 billion, and they \nwere going upward the last 6 years, getting worse, and the \nCongressional Budget Office said the last deficit would be $1.2 \nbillion. Unbelievable. So I wanted to continue to discuss that.\n  According to the budget numbers he put out, his plan would add $13 \ntrillion in new gross debt to the United States in 10 years, by 2021. \nThat was in 2011. Single-year deficits will never drop below $600 \nbillion. In 2015 they would start climbing back up to $774 billion. \nOver the 10 years total spending would increase--not be reduced at all, \nof course, but increase--by nearly 50 percent, with mandatory spending \nalone--not in any way controlled or reformed or fixed by the Lew \nbudget--mandatory spending would increase by more than 80 percent. And \nmandatory spending makes up more than half of all the spending in our \ngovernment. So on his track, by his own budget, by his own projections, \nby what he believes should happen, it increased by 80 percent. In fact, \nentitlements are growing at about three times the rate of GDP growth, \nthe rate of the growth in the economy. That is unsustainable.\n  Do we ever hear that from the President or his chief budget guy, Mr. \nLew, who is now expecting to be the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nprimary, premier economic leader for America? If one can't be honest \nabout what the situation is, one ought not to be promoted. That is the \nway I feel about it, and I feel strongly about it. I have never seen \nanything like that in my entire time in the Senate, to have this kind \nof statement made that is so utterly unconnected to reality.\n  It wasn't long after Mr. Lew came to the committee--2 days or 3 days \nafter this statement--when I asked him about that. I asked him if that \nwas accurate, and he said:\n\n       It's an accurate statement that our current spending will \n     not be increasing the debt . . . We've stopped spending money \n     that we don't have.\n\n  And the lowest deficit is $600 billion.\n  But Mr. Geithner came after this exchange, and I am sure Mr. Geithner \nwas well aware of what happened in the Budget Committee. Mr. Lew dug \nhis heels in and insisted this statement was true. What did the \nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, say at that point? I think \nthis is the difference between Mr. Lew and Mr. Geithner. Mr. Geithner \nwas former head of the Federal Reserve in New York, a man of some \nseriousness and gravitas, and he wasn't going to go in there and say \nsomething that wasn't true before the Budget Committee, although he \ndidn't give it up easily. I had to use all the skills I had to pin him \ndown, but when I did, this is what Mr. Geithner said. Even if the \nbudget Mr. Lew put forward were passed and enacted, Mr. Geithner said \nthat ``we would still be left with a very large interest burden and \nunsustainable obligations over time.'' In effect, he said we would be \nleft with an unsustainable debt path, when Mr. Lew says: Don't worry, \nmy budget fixes it. And Geithner was talking about this very budget.\n  Writing in the New York Times, writing an article, an op-ed in the \nNew York Times, Mr. Lew said:\n\n       The President's budget is a comprehensive and responsible \n     plan that will put us on a path toward fiscal sustainability \n     in the next few years.\n\n  He wrote that in the New York Times--totally inaccurate. Does he not \nrespect the American people? Does he think he can just go and make CNN \nstatements and write in the New York Times and say anything he pleases \nabout the financial condition of our country--a financial condition \nthat represents the greatest threat to our national security, more than \nany other threat we have in this world today?\n  That same month, Mr. Lew stated in an interview with National Public \nRadio:\n\n       If we're able to reduce the deficit to the point where we \n     can pay for our spending and invest in the future, that is an \n     enormous accomplishment. This budget has . . . proposals that \n     would do that.\n\n  And it did not. The budget did not have anything in it that would \nhave had us pay for our spending. We are borrowing 36 cents out of \nevery $1 we spend today. We are adding debt to our Nation every single \nhour--and to say we are going to be paying down the debt.\n  At no point did Mr. Lew's own estimate show that the President's 2012 \nbudget was coming close to a point where we could pay for our spending. \nExcluding interest payments on the national debt--excluding the \ninterest--the plan would have resulted in $1.5 trillion in deficits \nover 10 years, and even more than that when you consider the full \ninterest cost of $7.2 trillion. The long-term outlook, with annual \ninterest payments approaching $1 trillion and mandatory spending \nconsuming over three-quarters of the budget after 10 years, and \ngrowing--entitlement and mandatory spending absorbing three-quarters of \nthe budgets--Mr. Lew's comments were not merely misleading, but I \nbelieve qualify to be described as the greatest financial \nmisrepresentation in the history of the American Republic. If someone \nhas a better analysis of it, I would like to hear it. If somebody comes \ndown and says this is a true statement, I would like to hear them say \nit. I invite all my colleagues--members of the Finance Committee; lots \nof them voted for Mr. Lew--do you think it is OK to say this? Do you \nthink this is accurate? And if it is not accurate, do you want to \npromote him anyway? Why would you want to do that? I do not understand \nit. I am not going to support that. Mr. Lew made these representations \nover and over again.\n  The President's next year's budget in 2012, for the 2013 fiscal year, \nwas formulated while Mr. Lew was still the President's Budget Director \nand delivered while he was the President's Chief of Staff. It similarly \nwas extreme and irresponsible, and it was part of a continued campaign \nto mislead the American people about how it operated, to say it was so \nmuch better than it really was.\n  Although the White House claimed $4 trillion in savings, according to \nthe Office of Management and Budget's own data, the 2013 budget would \nonly have reduced the deficit by $197 billion over 10 years. They \nclaimed they saved $4,000 billion--$4 trillion--but, in fact, it would \nonly have reduced the budget by $197 billion over 10 years--virtually \nnot changing the debt course of America. And all of those savings--\nvirtually every one--were from tax increases. The spending was not \nreduced.\n  The White House also pushed the idea that the budget contained $2.50 \nin budget cuts for every $1 in tax hikes, while in reality there was a \nnet spending increase above the policy baseline we were operating \nunder. It spent more, not less. They claimed there were $2.50 in cuts \nfor every $1 in tax hikes. That is not true. Overall, from current \nbudget levels, spending would have increased by more than $2 trillion.\n  The net result of the proposals contained in the 2013 budget was to \nbring the Federal debt up to $26 trillion by 2022--an increase of $11 \ntrillion. The proposed $4 trillion in savings simply did not exist. It \nwas a complete fabrication. Mr. Lew understood that. He helped write \nthat budget. He was the Chief of Staff at the White House when it \nactually came to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\n  Once again, a Lew-designed budget was presented to the American \npeople in false terms designed to create the impression that we were \nputting America on a sound financial path, while we were doing the \nopposite--if it had passed.\n  And, of course, you say: Well, Sessions, that is your view. You are \nthe one who is mischaracterizing the President's budget. This is all \npartisan. Maybe you would think that. I hope not. But let's see what \nsome of the other observers around the country said about it when it \nwas released. I am not talking about the budget that was described by \nMr. Lew in these wonderful terms. If we had a budget that would do \nthat, the American people would jump up and down and shout hallelujah. \nWe are not close to it, however, as independent observers noted.\n  Look what these honest observers said about it.\n  The Washington Post, the largest paper here in Washington, said this:\n\n       The larger problem with the budget is the administration's \n     refusal to confront the hard choices that Mr. Obama is so \n     fond of saying must be faced.\n\n  The title of that editorial: ``President Obama's budget kicks the \nhard choices further down the road.''\n  What about USA Today, a nationwide paper?\n\n       President Obama likes to talk about those ``Sputnik \n     moments'' when the nation rises to difficult challenges like \n     the one posed by the Soviet space program in the 1950s. On \n     Monday--\n\n  The day this budget was released--\n\n     he had a chance to turn his . . . budget proposal into his \n     own such moment. He whiffed.\n\n  The title of that editorial: ``Obama's budget ducks tough choices.''\n  What about the Financial Times?\n\n       President Barack Obama has unveiled a hugely disappointing \n     budget, cutting only a few percentage points . . . in \n     projected US federal deficits over the remainder of this \n     century. . . . If Mr. Obama will not make this case, who \n     will?\n\n  The title of that editorial: ``Obama's budget shows failure of \nleadership.'' That is absolutely true. It was a failure of leadership.\n  Another from the Washington Post:\n\n       White House budget director Jacob J. Lew has told advocates \n     of reform that the White House thinks any significant plan \n     offered by the president would simply become a target for \n     partisan attack.\n\n  Then it goes on to quote Alice Rivlin:\n\n       ``I would have preferred to see the administration get out \n     front on addressing the entitlements and the tax reform that \n     we need to reduce long-run deficits,'' said Alice Rivlin, a \n     commission member [on the deficit commission] who served as \n     budget director in the Clinton White House.\n\n  That was Alice Rivlin, a wise commentator, a Democrat, but a wise \ncommentator. She went on to say:\n\n       But they clearly made a tactical decision.\n\n  She meant a political decision.\n  That was the Washington Post. The title of that was: ``Obama spending \nplan criticized for avoiding deficit commission's major proposals.''\n\n  Another from the Washington Post:\n\n       Erskine Bowles, the Democratic chairman of the fiscal \n     commission, said the White House budget request goes \n     ``nowhere near where they will have to go to resolve our \n     fiscal nightmare.''\n\n  He is referring to this. This was on February 14--2 days after Mr. \nLew made those ridiculous statements.\n  This is Mr. Erskine Bowles, a man chosen by President Obama to head \nthe fiscal commission and spent a year studying our debt problem.\n  How about Investor's Business Daily, a prominent business \npublication?\n\n       The White House's new budget is far worse than merely bad. \n     By not attacking the underlying cause of our debt explosion \n     and by raising taxes, it will lead inevitably to a weaker \n     economy and perhaps even default.\n\n  The title of that editorial: ``Obama's Gutless Budget Proposal''--a \nproposal written by Mr. Jack Lew.\n  What about the Wall Street Journal? This is entitled: ``The Cee Lo \nGreen Budget.''\n\n       After three years of historic deficits that have added \n     almost $4.5 trillion to the national debt, President Obama \n     was finally going to get serious about fiscal discipline. \n     Instead, what landed on Congress's doorstep on Monday was a \n     White House budget that increases deficits above the spending \n     baseline for the next two years. Hosni Mubarak was more in \n     touch with reality last Thursday night.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, the premier business publication in America.\n  The Orlando Sentinel:\n\n       Count us deeply disappointed by the $3.7 trillion budget \n     that President Obama unveiled Monday. . . . To really tackle \n     the national debt, Mr. Obama needs to get off the sidelines, \n     and start leading.\n\n  The title of that: ``President Obama's budget plan falls short''--\nJack Lew's budget plan.\n  The New York Daily News:\n\n       But the bottom line is that [President Obama is] figuring \n     on reducing the deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years while \n     his blue-ribbon commission said cutting four times that \n     amount is critically necessary.\n\n  The title of that editorial: ``Deficit of courage.''\n  This is another one:\n\n       President Barack Obama rolled out a $3.7 trillion budget \n     Monday that promises $90 billion in reduced spending for \n     fiscal 2012, but it would still produce a whopping $1.1 \n     trillion deficit. The best that can be said is that we've \n     started to frame the national debate.\n\n  So said the Chicago Tribune.\n  The Indianapolis Star:\n\n       Obama has all but ignored the recommendations of his own \n     deficit reduction commission.\n\n  The headline of that editorial: ``We ignore `red menace' at our \nperil.''\n  How about the Los Angeles Times, a major western newspaper of liberal \npolitical views:\n\n       President Obama's budget for fiscal year 2012 landed with a \n     thud Monday, laying out short- and long-term tax and spending \n     plans that disappointed lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. \n     The proposal was a remarkably tame response to Washington's \n     fiscal problems, not the bold statement about belt-tightening \n     that the White House had suggested was coming.\n\n  The Denver Post, another large and liberal newspaper, states:\n\n       Obama called the proposal one of the ``tough choices and \n     sacrifices,'' yet it does not confront entitlements and \n     continues to act as if government spending is the way to \n     prosperity.\n\n  That is true for sure.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle, an important newspaper:\n\n       In a crucial way, it lacks honesty.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News, a big newspaper:\n\n       But taken as a whole, his proposals represent the third \n     time in 2 months he has walked up to the challenge of curbing \n     the deficit and more troubling long-term debt and turned away \n     on leading the Nation back from an impending fiscal \n     nightmare.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\n       The shortcoming in Obama's spending proposal is its lack of \n     strategy for sustained, long-term deficit reduction.\n\n  That is correct. It had none of that in it. It goes on to say:\n\n       Cutting deficits by $1.1 trillion over a decade might sound \n     significant. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \n     has projected deficits rising $12 trillion over that time.\n\n  The title of that editorial is ``Still missing the mark.''\n  The Minneapolis Star Tribune:\n\n       The flurry of deficit-reduction plans released late last \n     year were supposed to kick off a national ``adult \n     conversation'' about the Nation's metastasizing long-term \n     debt problem.\n\n  When is that conversation going to begin? It certainly didn't happen \non Monday when President Obama released his $3.7 trillion budget \nrequest for 2012. The title of that editorial is ``Slinking away from \nU.S. budget reality,'' written by Mr. Jack Lew, Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, who declared it was a wonderful budget, \ntotally misrepresenting what it would do.\n  The Washington Post, Dana Milbank:\n\n       Obama's budget proposal is a remarkably weak and timid \n     document. . . . The President makes no serious attempt at \n     cutting entitlement programs that threaten to drive the \n     government into insolvency.\n\n  What about Senator Conrad, who was the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee at that time, a distinguished Democratic Senator who retired \nfrom Congress and is no longer in the Senate. This is what Kent Conrad \nsaid, my friend, with whom I served on the committee:\n\n       But we need a much more robust package of deficit and debt \n     reduction over the medium- and long-term.\n\n  Well, our Democratic leadership in the Senate refused to bring up a \nbudget. Today marks the 1,400th day this Senate has violated the law of \nthe United States and not produced a budget. It is unthinkable at a \ntime when the debt represents the greatest threat to our country.\n  The House has passed a budget each year. That was part of the \nstrategy.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\nThat was part of the gimmick. Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, says \nwe don't need a budget; it is foolish to have a budget. That was his \ncomment: It is foolish to have a budget even though the law explicitly \nrequires the Senate to produce a budget.\n  What did he mean, ``foolish''? He meant if you pass a budget, \nsomebody could criticize you. Somebody could look at your spending and \ntaxes, evaluate it, and say: We don't like that. He doesn't fix the \ndebt. It raises taxes too much. It doesn't cut spending. Or it \nincreases the spending too much. Why do that? It is foolish. Let's \ndon't pass one, and we will criticize Paul Ryan, the young, dynamic \nchairman of the House Budget Committee who wrote a budget that passed \nthe House and would have fixed our debt problem and put us on a \nsustainable course.\n  This was a budget that was complimented by Alice Rivlin and Erskine \nBowles. They may not have agreed to everything that was in it, but they \ncomplimented him on having integrity and doing what it said in laying \nout a plan for the future of America. The House passed it.\n  What did the Senate do? Nada, nothing. It was one of the greatest \nacts of irresponsibility, I submit, in Senate history. There are a lot \nof them out there. This is one in the top group, in my opinion. How \ncould you possibly, at a time of crisis, not bring up the budget? The \nPresident submitted a budget, as he is required to do by law, and every \nPresident always has. The Senate just decided not to even move one. \nThey say: We will have one this year. I am looking forward to that. It \nis behind time, as was the President's submission of a budget. He was \nlate, according to the law, in submitting that.\n  As time went on and the tension rose over the budget and our future \nspending program, the Democratic leader in the Senate thought he would \nbe clever and would bring up Congressman Ryan's budget and make all the \nRepublicans vote for it--virtually all did; maybe two or three didn't--\nand then they would attack them because it had cuts in spending. They \nare going to say: You don't like old people. You don't like children. \nYou don't like education. You don't like this in health care, and this \nwill be great.\n  As I said, most Republicans, virtually all, voted for it.\n  Senator McConnell said: All right, let's bring up the Obama budget. \nLet's bring up the budget Jack Lew prepared to the floor.\n  He forced a vote on the Lew budget. How many votes do you think it \nreceived? Zero. Every Democrat voted against it and every Republican \nvoted against it. It was brought up in the House of Representatives. \nEvery Democratic Member of the House voted against it and every \nRepublican voted against it. It happened the next year in the 2013 \nbudget.\n  Not a single person voted for this budget because it wasn't worthy of \na single vote. It would not do anything to change the debt course of \nAmerica, and they were totally misrepresenting what it would do. It was \na sad moment. That is where we are.\n  My question simply would be, Where was Mr. Lew in this? He was the \narchitect. He was the architect of the budget, but he was deeply \ninvolved in the political activities that were going on at this time. \nIt fell to his lot--I am not sure if he asked for it--to come and \ntestify before the Budget Committee and say these kinds of things about \nit, these words that will live in infamy. Did he just volunteer to do \nit? Was he so much a part of the Obama political interest he would say \nwhatever it takes to promote a budget that wouldn't work?\n  Secretary Geithner, President Obama's own Secretary of the Treasury, \nwould not say so. He wouldn't say these kinds of things. He tried not \nto embarrass the administration, tried not to embarrass Mr. Lew. When I \npinned him down, he said this still leaves us on an unsustainable debt \ncourse; not fixing our problem as was represented.\n\n  Now we want to replace Mr. Geithner, a man who was frank in his \ntestimony about the dangers we faced, with a man who stood by this kind \nof testimony and statements.\n  I do believe our country is a bit confused. I believe we are to the \npoint where in politics people think they can say almost anything and \nnobody cares. Just say this or say that; if it is not true, well, so \nwhat. I guess it is just politics.\n  If we continue in that way, this is a very dangerous trend. It places \nthe entire democratic Republic of America at risk. The whole concept of \nAmerican Government is based on finding the truth. This is why you have \ndebate in the Senate; open, public debate. The truth, the theory is \nthat it will somehow rise to the top, and it normally will when you \nhave honest debate. You have negotiations on issues, you advocate for \nyour side, and you may begin to reach consensus, sometimes at least.\n  How can you reach consensus when the person you are negotiating with \nis insisting his budget does things it absolutely does not do? He is \ndoing that for political reasons, not for the interests of America. How \nare you able to deal with that?\n  I think this Senate--as a matter of its own integrity to defend the \nintegrity of the Senate, and, perhaps, more importantly, to defend the \nintegrity of the American people--has a firm and clear duty to insist \nthat high public officials tell the truth when they come before \nCongress or when they go on national television. He is being paid by \nthe American people. Was he paid to misrepresent the budget or to tell \nthe truth about the budget?\n  He didn't tell the truth about the budget. Is there a consequence? We \njust promote him to some other high office because he helped the \nPresident win his election by spinning the debt situation in America in \na way that is not correct.\n  Make no mistake, I don't have proof of this. And maybe it is wrong. \nBut it seems to me this was a campaign decision made in early 2011 that \nthey were going to say their budget fixed our debt problems. Why do I \nstate this? Because it was continued periodically off and on and was \nrepeated again in a national television ad by the President of the \nUnited States in September 2012 to win reelection. ``Our plan pays down \nthe debt,'' I believe, was the phrase they used in that television ad.\n  That wasn't true. He didn't have a plan that paid down the debt or \ndidn't add to the debt or put us in a position to pay down the debt. He \nnever had a plan to do that. He didn't.\n  You say: That is not correct. I will ask my Democratic colleagues--\nthis is a free country, a free Senate--you come down and say if I am \nincorrect on this. Show me if I am wrong. If I am wrong, I will \napologize; but I don't think I am wrong. I have looked at it hard, and \nI don't think anybody is going to come down and dispute what I have \nsaid fundamentally on the details of this budget document.\n  I thank the Chair for indulging me.\n  I yield the floor and would note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the Lew nomination has not received an \nenthusiastic response in many quarters, that is for sure--maybe from \nthe hard left, where he has been an advocate of some very hard left \nviews and some inflexibility when it comes to dealing with some of our \nentitlement programs and welfare programs that have been surging out of \ncontrol. But this is what some others have said about the nomination.\n  Larry Kudlow, a commentator on CNBC--who was an economist for the \nFederal Reserve System of the United States and a former chief \neconomist at Bear Stearns and an employee at the Office of Management \nand Budget, where he was a chief economist--said this on the radio not \ntoo long ago. I guess this was written about by Jeff Poor, a reporter \nfor the Daily Caller.\n\n       Larry Kudlow explained why President Obama's nomination of \n     Jack Lew as Timothy Geithner's replacement to head the \n     Treasury Department was a ``nutty appointment.''\n\n  If you keep up with business issues and stuff, you will see Mr. \nKudlow on TV regularly, and he, like a lot of our commentators, enjoys \nstirring the pot sometimes, but, as I say, he was a chief economist at \nBear Stearns and at the Office of Management and Budget and\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\nan economist at the Federal Reserve. He knows a great deal about the \neconomy. His instinct is what led him to call this a ``nutty \nappointment.''\n  Continuing Mr. Poor's quote:\n\n       Kudlow pointed to Lew as part of the problem.\n\n  Part of the problem as to why we don't have a budget. He said he is \npart of the problem.\n  Once again citing the Poor article:\n\n       Kudlow cited Lew's lack of qualifications as another reason \n     that President Obama's appointment was ``completely \n     irresponsible.''\n\n  Quoting Mr. Kudlow, the article went on to say this:\n\n       ``You know, this whole thing is kind of centered around the \n     Senate, which hasn't done a budget in 1,351 days--so whatever \n     that is, four years,'' Mr. Kudlow said.\n\n  And I will just add that today is the 1,400th day.\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       ``Now the White House might not even submit a budget, and \n     now the White House had taken the budget director and chief \n     of staff and put him over the Treasury, where Jack Lew is \n     completely--and I mean completely unqualified to be Treasury \n     Secretary.''\n\n  He is talking about Lew, and sending him to be Secretary of Treasury.\n  Mr. Poor goes on quoting Mr. Kudlow, who explains:\n\n       ``He has no financial experience. He has no international \n     experience. He has no currency experience. He ripped off \n     Citibank for a couple million dollars. He was there for one \n     year. I mean, there's about a million people--give me a phone \n     book, and I'll find somebody more qualified for Treasury \n     Secretary than former OMB director Jack Lew. This is all of a \n     piece. It is completely irresponsible.''\n\n  Well, that is pretty clear, what he expresses there, what he \nbelieves. And I think that is valuable insight.\n  Are we just making this up? This staffer for Tip O'Neill, the Budget \nDirector of OMB before and now Chief of Staff at the White House, is he \nreally qualified to lead the United States of America in addressing the \nchallenges of our time?\n  What about the Secretary of the Treasury position? Is that a matter \nof great importance? The Treasury is one of the four great senior \nCabinet positions we have--Attorney General, Defense Secretary, State, \nand Treasury. The credibility of the Treasury Secretary is his greatest \nasset, and, as I have said, this statement raises the most grievous \ndoubts about his credibility.\n  We have had great Secretaries. Albert Gallatin early on, who was a \nSwiss immigrant, helped create the House Ways and Means Committee and \ninstituted the development of the Treasury. Simon Chase from Ohio stood \nas one of Lincoln's top aides and was responsible for the civil system \nof federally chartered banks. William McAdoo, a distinguished \nbusinessman, helped create the Federal Reserve System. Andrew Mellon, a \nbrilliant Pennsylvania businessman, served as Secretary of Treasury. \nHenry Morgenthau, Jr., served as FDR's Secretary from 1934 through \n1945. William Simon, a successful businessman, served as Secretary \nunder Nixon and Ford. He supervised the Nation's economic policies in \ncrisis times.\n  So this nominee doesn't have the kind of background one would \nnormally look for in a Secretary of Treasury, particularly when we are \ndoing so poorly economically. We had a big recession, and we are coming \nout of it at a slower rate than we perhaps have ever seen other than \nthe Great Depression.\n  Mr. Malpass testified at the Budget Committee yesterday about the \nLew-Obama-Paul Krugman theory of borrowing money and spending money to \nstimulate the economy and get us out of the recession. All you have to \ndo is look at it and see it didn't work. How much more evidence do you \nneed?\n  So that is the advice we have been getting there. And this good \nstaffer quality is what our Democratic chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, seemed to see in Jack Lew during his recent \nconfirmation hearings. He seemed to call into question the necessary \nstature the position requires and whether Jack Lew met those standards. \nThis is what Senator Baucus said to Mr. Lew:\n\n       I'm going to ask you--it's clear you'd be a great staffer. \n     I'm not talking about being a great, courageous staffer and \n     telling the President what you think and don't think. I'm \n     talking about something else. I'm talking about the public \n     perception, the public demeanor, representing the United \n     States across the country and around the world, be able to \n     influence policy in a way that makes sense--most of us would \n     tend to agree with. We may differ along the edges, but most \n     everybody in this room agrees that needs to be done.\n\n  So even the chairman of the Finance Committee, a Democratic chairman, \nSenator Baucus, with great experience, certainly raised some questions \nabout the nomination.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I look \nforward to Senator Kaine's remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that the time count against the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Abnormal Times\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, it is an honor to stand here for my first \nspeech on the Senate floor. I am honored to be part of this body and to \nspeak where hundreds have spoken before and thousands will speak after \nme.\n  A normal first speech for a Senator is usually a proactive, forward-\nlooking speech. We are not in normal times. A normal first speech for a \nSenator usually happens much later, after a Senator has been around for \na number of months. We are not in normal times. A normal first speech \nfor a Senator is often in connection with the introduction of a piece \nof legislation. We are not in normal times. So I am speaking a bit \nearlier than I would have thought likely when I took the oath of office \non January 3, but I am speaking in particular because we are not in \nnormal times, and the abnormality of the times has a huge effect on the \nCommonwealth I am proud to represent.\n  In the summer of 2011 Congress passed a bill we are now talking \nabout, a bill dealing with the sequestration cuts of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There is no precedent I am aware of in congressional history for what \nis about to happen in 48 hours.\n  Congress designed a set of punishing, nonstrategic, ugly cuts \ndesigned to hurt the economy and hurt individuals and all--however they \nvoted on that bill--did not want these cuts to come into place. So \nthose who voted for the package in the summer of 2011 did not want the \nsequester cuts to occur and believed we would find, through compromise, \nan alternative; and those who voted against the package in the summer \nof 2011 largely voted against it because they did not want these cuts \nto occur.\n  So the abnormality of the times is this: Never, to my knowledge, in \nthe history of this body, has Congress designed a punishment that would \nhurt the lives of regular individuals and that would hurt the economy. \nIt was designed with that knowledge, fully. All hoped it would not \nhappen. Yet we are within 48 hours of allowing it to happen.\n  The effects this sequester will have on the country and the effects \nit will have on my Commonwealth are so significant and severe that I do \nfeel compelled to speak a little earlier than I otherwise might have. I \nwould also add I think the effects of these cuts on this institution \nand the credibility of this institution are equally severe.\n  What I wish to do in this speech is basically a couple things. I want \nto talk about the effect of these sequester cuts, if they happen, on \nregular people. I just returned from a tour around my State and I am \njust going to share some stories. I want to talk, with some data, about \nthe short-term impacts of these cuts on the broader economy. Third, I \nwant to talk about some long-term impacts, some impacts we are not \nnecessarily thinking of right now but should cause us significant \nconcern. Fourth, there is a way to avoid this, and I want to talk about \nhow we can avoid allowing this self-inflicted wound to occur. Finally, \nI want to talk about the fact that there is an upside in this moment \nfor us. This is not just about avoiding harming people, hurting the \neconomy. It is not just about avoiding negatives. I think there is an \nupside for us and for this institution and for this Nation if we do \nthis right.\n  Let me begin with my tour around Virginia. I am now a brandnew member \nof the Armed Services Committee, and I sit in a wonderful seat \nfollowing John Warner, who was there for 30 years, and\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nJim Webb, who was there before me. I am no replacement for either of \nthose individuals and I have big shoes to fill. So I decided to take a \ntour around my State last week and visit the various touch points in \nthe Commonwealth where we interact with our military and our national \nsecurity.\n  The map of Virginia is a map of the military history of this country: \nYorktown, where the Revolutionary War ended; Appomattox, where the \nCivil War ended; the Pentagon, where we were attacked on 9/11. We are \nthe most connected State to the military. One in eight Virginians is a \nveteran--not one in eight adults, one in eight Virginians, from birth \nto death. Over 100,000 Active-Duty Guard and Reserve, DOD civilians, \nDOD contractors. By the time we add up all of those and their families \nand military families, we are probably talking about one in three \nVirginians.\n  I went to the places where Virginians work every day, as ship \nrepairers in private shipyards, as Active Duty on naval bases, as DOD \ncivilians working as nurses in Army hospitals, as young officer \ncandidates training in ROTC programs, at VA hospitals. I went around \nthe State, and let me tell you what I heard.\n  A few miles from here is Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, one of the \npreeminent institutions that treats wounded warriors. A wounded warrior \nstill on Active service being treated there, his wife sitting right \nnext to him, we talked, and she ventured this: Let's talk about these \nfurloughs of these DOD civilian employees. My husband's nurses are all \nDOD civilians, and while the sequester protects Active Duty, it doesn't \nprotect the civilians. What is it going to mean to my husband's medical \ntreatment as he comes back from being wounded, injured defending this \nNation, if the nurses and health professionals at this hospital are \nfurloughed 1 day a week?\n  In the same roundtable, another wounded warrior said to me: Boy, the \neconomy is really going to suffer if we have this sequester. We are \ngoing to lose jobs, and the economy could shrink. I am a reservist.\n  He was a wounded warrior as a reservist, waiting to go back into the \ncivilian workforce into a job with a Federal agency that does national \nsecurity. What is that going to mean to me? Is there a hiring freeze? \nIs there a pay freeze? Is this a furlough? This wounded warrior was \nwondering about his economic future.\n  At the shipyard at Newport News--what a good news story. We \nAmericans, we Virginians, we manufacture the largest items that are \nmanufactured on planet Earth--nuclear aircraft carriers--in that \nshipyard. What a wonderful American example of ingenuity that is. Yet \nin looking at these sequester cuts, as repairs and other projects and \nprograms are being scaled back, the workers of that shipyard are asking \nabout the stability of their work and about whether the ships we put \nout and we put our people on will be truly ready to do the work they \nneed to do.\n  At another private shipyard, the owner, a small businessman that has \na shipyard in Hampton Roads, said: I have 50 employees. The way the \nNavy plans to deal with sequestration is to dramatically reduce \nmaintenance in the third and fourth quarters of the year. I am going to \nissue WARN notices to tell 300 of my 450 employees they are not going \nto have a job. I just don't see how I can run this business without \nthem, but I don't have the business to keep them if these sequestration \ncuts go through.\n  At a VA hospital in Richmond, the VA Corps services are protected \nunder the sequester, but they are under hiring freezes. They compete \nwith private sector hospitals to hire nurses and physicians, and they \nsay that is getting tougher and tougher to do. They do research in \nRichmond about traumatic brain injury, and that research money is not \nprotected from sequestration. So this research that will help us treat \nour wounded warriors better is in jeopardy if the sequester goes \nthrough.\n  It is not just military cuts. In Head Start, I talk with teachers who \nare facing significant cuts in programs for at-risk kids, even at a \ntime where, because of the economy, the number of at-risk children in \ntheir classrooms is growing and growing and the number of children \ntotal in their classrooms is growing and growing.\n\n  On Monday a number of us were at National Airport to talk about the \neffect of sequester on something that is fairly basic, the experience \nof the Americans by the millions and millions who travel every day in \nthe air: longer lines, potentially higher prices.\n  This is what Virginians were telling me as I went to talk to them \nabout what we were doing in Washington and the likely consequences they \nwere going to see in their lives. Again and again, what they said to me \nwas go up and find a solution.\n  I went to a bluegrass concert on Saturday afternoon. I was wearing \nblue jeans and a Carhartt jacket and I was taking an hour off to listen \nto a set of music. I sat next to a guy who appeared to be about 80 \nyears old, ramrod straight, energetic. He was a veteran wearing a cap \nfrom his Navy service. About halfway through the set he leaned over to \nme and he said: Now, I know you are here for music. You didn't come \nhere to politic. I said: That is right. I am here for music. He said: \nSo all I am going to say is this. There is not a single thing you are \ngoing to do, plus or minus--or not do--that will affect my quality of \nlife. I am fine. But I am telling you, for the good of the country, you \nought to go up and figure out a way to get people to work together and \nfind some deal.\n  So that is what my citizens were saying to me on this trip, just in \nthe last 2 weeks, at every stop: find a deal, work together. Not a \nsingle person said: Protect my job, protect my program, protect my \npriority by making the cuts in other areas worse. Not one person said \nthat. They were asking for a balanced approach, where there would be \npain, where there would be a balance of cuts but also revenues, and we \nwould try to tackle this in a targeted way.\n  Some statistics and thoughts. These are stories from individuals. Now \nlet's look at the immediate impact on the Virginia economy and on other \nimportant goals: our military readiness and defense posture.\n  A couple weeks ago we heard at an Armed Services Committee meeting \nfrom Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey as Secretary Panetta was \nexiting in that role. They had just announced that CENTCOM--the portion \nof the military that controls the space including Afghanistan--wants to \nhave two carriers in the Middle East to project American force to try \nto prevent or reduce any dangerous, provocative activities by Iran or \nanyone else and to protect our men and women in service, if the need \nshould happen. Their military judgment was we needed two carriers and \nthat force there to protect them. But about 2 weeks ago, the DOD \nSecretary said: We are not going to have two carriers; we are just \ngoing to have one.\n  Thousands of sailors who were on the verge of deploying, many of whom \nhad sublet their apartments, put their cars in storage, sold their \ncars, cancelled their cell phones, sent families back to other places \nin the country to stay with their parents, learned within just a very \nfew days it was all being turned topsy-turvy.\n  Having only one carrier in the Middle East, maybe nothing bad will \nhappen. But when the military leadership of the country suggests we \nshould have two and we decide, because of budget indecision, let's only \nhave one, that sends a message. It sends a message to our friends, it \nsends a message to those we would be protecting that our commitment is \nwavering, and it also sends a message to our adversaries that our \ncommitment might be wavering.\n  We heard many bits of testimony that day from General Dempsey and \nSecretary Panetta about how our readiness, our ability to respond with \nflexibility, gets compromised if we don't get this right.\n  On the National Guard side, I visited a National Guard Army called \nthe Stonewall Brigade in Staunton, VA. Here is something interesting. \nThis National Guard combat brigade, the Stonewall Brigade, their first \naction as a brigade was 20 years before the French and Indian Wars. \nTheir first action as a brigade was in the 1740s. Since then, they have \ndeployed again and again to protect Americans. Yet they were talking \nabout sequestration affecting their ability to train their people.\n  One of the individuals who was the commander of that brigade said in \na\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\nvery powerful way: I am going to send my people, and they are going to \ndo their best, but I would rather send them 100 percent trained than 80 \nor 85 percent trained. If we act now after we sequester and reduce \ntraining, we will be sending people into service 80 or 85 percent \ntrained.\n  Our DOD civilians, the Pentagon has announced it would take steps to \nfurlough 800,000 civilian employees for up to 22 days a year. In \nVirginia alone--one State--90,000 individuals, beginning at the end of \nMarch, early April, will face the beginnings of furloughs 1 day a week \nfor up to 22 weeks.\n  There aren't many towns and cities in Virginia that have more than \n90,000 people. Yet we would take all those people and put their \neconomic livelihood at risk for the foreseeable future as we try to \nfigure this out. Let me tell you who some of these folks are. These are \nthe nurses who treat our wounded warriors. These are our air traffic \ncontrollers who keep us safe in the air. Think of those individuals and \nthe fact that they are trying to make a living for their families and \nthey are trying to do good service for their fellow Virginians and \nfellow Americans and then multiply that by 90,000, and that is just one \nState's worth.\n  We all want a vibrant private sector. We all think the private sector \nbeing strong is the key to economic growth. The estimate of most \neconomists is that Virginians, because of sequestration and reductions \nto private contracting, would stand to lose up to 200,000 jobs, 137,000 \non the defense side and nearly 70 on the nondefense side.\n  The Newport News Shipbuilding company that I announced earlier, the \nlargest industrial employer in Virginia, is preparing to shrink; facing \nsmaller ship repairs and having to issue WARN notices to their \nemployees. We see this all over the Commonwealth.\n  Educators. Virginia stands to lose $14 million in funding for primary \nand secondary education, and this is funding that is targeted. It is \ntargeted to funding to the most disadvantaged students, title I \nfunding. One hundred ninety teachers' jobs are at risk and about 14,000 \nfewer disadvantaged students will receive these services. In a \nparticular passion of mine, Head Start and early childhood education, \n70,000 students nationally will lose their spaces in early childhood \neducation Head Start because of the sequester; about 1,000 of those are \nin Virginia.\n  The statistics are grim, and these aren't just numbers on a page or \nnumbers in a budget book. These are parents who are sitting at a \nkitchen table already worrying about how to make ends meet and finding \nthat they are going to have 1 less day of work every week, potentially, \nfor the next 20 weeks or people who spent their lives in shipbuilding \nand they are going to be given WARN notices, with no clear indication \nof when their company or other companies might start hiring again.\n  Those are the short-term impacts. Let me talk, for a minute, about \nsome long-term impacts because these are the stories that aren't \nnecessarily in the newspaper. But as I listened to my constituents last \nweek, they made this case, and they made it in a way I found to be \npretty compelling.\n  When the decision was announced about the USS Truman not being \ndeployed, there was a 20-year-old airwoman aviator on the carrier who \nwas quoted in the newspaper as saying: I was so excited to be on my \nfirst deployment for my country. I want to have a military career, but \nI am starting to think that might not be realistic.\n  We have a whole generation of young people who serve in the military, \nand they are our future generals and Joint Chiefs of Staff and future \nDeputy Secretaries of Defense and Secretaries of Defense in that \nleadership corps. They have decided they want to devote their future to \nprotecting the Nation. But what is happening in this building is making \nthem believe maybe this is not a realistic career choice.\n  I spoke to ROTC students at the University of Virginia. These are \nfolks on the verge of commissioning as officers in all four primary \nservice branches--Army, Marine, Air Force, Navy--and I spoke to them \nlast week and one of them said this to me. I found this very chilling.\n\n       I am training to be an officer because I want to serve my \n     country and guess what, I am willing to put myself into \n     harm's way to known hostilities and unknown hostilities in \n     the world, to serve my country. But I have to ask myself, am \n     I willing to put my career at risk by making a career choice \n     to pursue a path when I do not have confidence that the \n     civilian political leadership of the country has a commitment \n     to me and to my colleagues?\n\n  Being willing to face hostilities and enemy fire--they signed up for \nthat. But as they think about their military careers, whether they \nwould do their 4 years and leave or whether they would make a career \nout of it, the message we send from this building and this Capitol \nabout whether we are committed to them is one of the factors they \nutilize to try to make their decisions.\n  Similarly, students around this Commonwealth and country who are \nthinking about being early childhood educators would wonder about the \nfuture of early childhood or Head Start programs. In a really funny \ninterchange with some welders and the president of the shipyard, the \nNewport News Shipyard, which is run by Huntington Ingalls, he said: If \nwe do layoffs or scale back and we lose nuclear engineers for the subs \nand carriers, they can find other jobs. In fact, the president, Mike \nPetters, a good friend, said: It is easier for this company to replace \nme, the CEO, than it is to replace a nuclear engineer.\n  But if our commitment to shipbuilding and ship repair and ship refurb \nis questionable and a nuclear engineer has other career options and \nthey have to analyze which career option they should pick, or a welder \nhas other career options--and all do--and they have to decide which \ncareer options they pick, we will find it down the road increasingly \ndifficult to have the kind of talent we need to do the jobs that need \nto be done to protect this Nation if we are not sending them a signal \nthat we can find compromise, find agreements, and provide funding in an \nappropriate way for these critical services.\n  Here is the good news. The good news is we can avoid this. In fact, \nwe have an obligation to avoid this. I was a little bit surprised when \nI came to the Senate to learn some things I did not know. I thought I \nwas an educated observer. I was a little bit surprised, for example, \nthat in the Budget Act that deals with how budgets are written, the \nbudgets do not even go to the President. It is purely congressional. \nWhen the House and Senate pass a budget and then when it is \ncompromised, it is purely congressional. Appropriations acts of course \ngo to the President for signature, but they never get there unless \nCongress does them.\n  So while everyone has a responsibility to try to make this right, and \nthe President and his team definitely have a responsibility, this is a \ncongressional constitutional responsibility. There is a unique \nlegislative prerogative for us to get this right and for us to avoid \nthe self-inflicted damage to the economy and to people that every last \nperson who voted was sure would not occur. Again, I say we are in a \nunique situation where we have designed a punishment and we would allow \nthat punishment to affect individuals and our economy. I do not think \nthere is a precedent that would be similar in the history of this body.\n  In order to address it, we have to find a balanced approach, as my \ncitizens were telling me, and not gimmicks. No more sequester or \nsupercommittee, no more continuing resolution. There is a process. We \nshould follow that process. The process involves compromise. The \nprocess involves listening. And we need to do it.\n  I will say one more thing about why it is important that we do it, \nand not just for the economy. A lot of people think we are broken. I \nwas struck in talks to some of my citizens that for as many people as \ndo not like the current President, no one says to me that the \nPresidency as an institution is broken. For as many people as do not \nlike this or that decision of the Supreme Court or the judiciary, no \none says to me they think the judiciary is broken. But the third branch \nof government--really the first branch of government, we are first in \nthe Constitution, the legislative branch--many people look at this \npotential sequester and other similar things and they worry about \nwhether we are broken. So we not only have a constitutional obligation \nto fix it, we really need those of us, and all of us who care about \nthis institution in the Capitol, we have to do our part to fix it.\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\n  The good news is that we can. Let me show you what we have done \nalready by way of dealing with our fiscal challenges, and especially \ntackling deficits so we can try to get our balance sheet more in \ncontrol. I have three very simple charts that are pretty easy to \nfollow.\n  Congress, both Houses, and the President, have taken thus far, 2010 \nto now, steps that have reduced the deficit going forward over a 10-\nyear period by about $2.4 trillion. This is how this has been done. I \nget no credit for this because this all happened before I got here. \nThis is what Congress has done over the last couple of years to reduce \nour deficit path and bring us closer to balance to the tune of $2.4 \ntrillion. We have done spending cuts of about 60 percent of the total. \nBecause of some of these other actions, we have been able to project a \nsavings in interest payments of another 14 percent. And with the \ndecision at year end on the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the \nbipartisan compromise that resulted, we have put in new revenue of \nabout 26 percent of this total. All you have to know from looking at \nthis chart is it is balanced.\n  We could argue the ratio. We might like it more red, more green, more \nblue. We could argue about the ratio. But it is a balanced approach of \nrevenue, of spending cuts and of interest savings. That is what we have \ndone already, and I give praise to the Members of Congress and the \nPresident who have been able to take that step.\n  But we all know we have more to do. So now that test is before us and \nthat challenge and chore is on our table. We have more to do and there \nare two alternatives we will likely be debating and voting on within \nthe next couple of days in this body, a Democratic approach and a GOP \napproach to how do we do more. That is because most would agree if we \nhave done about $2.4 trillion of deficit reduction already that we need \nto do about another $1.5 trillion or so over the course of the next 10 \nyears. We will be voting on one proposal tomorrow that has been \nadvanced by the Democratic majority. That says we will additionally \nclose our deficit over the course of this year. We will do it in a way \nthat will push us forward to finding a bigger solution. And we will do \nit in a balanced way: 50 percent through new revenue, closing some \ncorporate tax loopholes that have outlived their usefulness, raising \nrates at the top end for a very few Americans who can afford it. I talk \nto Virginians and they know we can afford it. So 50 percent of our \nadditional deficit reduction would be on the new revenue side and 50 \npercent would be on spending cuts--spending cuts, many of which have \nalready been agreed to in this body.\n\n  One of the core kinds of spending cuts--and it is important here--the \nspending cuts in the proposal we will vote on tomorrow are not across-\nthe-board pain for everybody equally because everything is not worth \neverything else. They are targeted spending cuts, the right kind of \nspending cuts. So, for example, this body last summer voted on a farm \nbill to reduce significantly farm subsidies. It was bipartisan, \nDemocratic and Republican votes. That bill died on the House side, but \nthat notion that we can save money and that we should, that had \nbipartisan support, that is in the spending cuts component of the \npackage we will talk about tomorrow, and that is the Democratic \napproach.\n  Is it magic? No, it is not magic. You might argue about the ratio. \nYou might argue about the items. But the key to it is, just as what we \nhave done so far to reduce the deficit by $2.4 trillion has been a \nbalanced approach, the approach we will vote on tomorrow on the \nDemocratic side is a balanced approach.\n  There is also a Republican approach, or approaches. It was a little \nbit unclear as I took the floor whether there will be a single bill or \nmultiple bills. But the GOP approach to this, which they laid on the \ntable and which we will also debate and vote on, is, as you will see, \nall spending cuts. They might be different spending cuts from those in \nthe sequester. In the context this will emerge. But there is no revenue \nin this approach. It is not a balanced approach, and I argue, based on \nwhat we have already done with the $2.4 trillion, the right way to do \nthis is to do it in a balanced way. That is the right thing for the \neconomy. It is the right thing to soften the effect of these cuts. It \nis the right thing to make sure that people's lives are not needlessly \nturned topsy-turvy.\n  Can we save? Sure we can, and we should. But you cannot fix a balance \nsheet on just one side of the balance sheet. You have to look at both \nsides of the balance sheet, and I think that is what we will be \ndebating over the next couple of days.\n  I have been thinking about this, and the last thing I will say before \nI close and talk about an upside is, when I was home in Richmond over \nthe weekend after this week-long tour, knowing we would be coming here \ntoday to debate about these proposals, something happened in my \nhometown that I want to recommend to the contemplation of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate. Virginia had been wrestling for two or three \ndecades about what to do about transportation because it would be good \nfor the economy for us to invest in transportation.\n  I will be candid and even sheepish. I was the Governor of Virginia \nand I strived for 4 years to get my legislature to do something \nmeaningful, to invest in transportation, and aside from a few modest \nwins here or there I never was able to convince my legislature to do \nwhat I thought needed to be done.\n  Saturday in Richmond, 90 miles from here, 4 days ago, my Republican \nGovernor, Bob McDonald, a friend, a Republican House of Delegates, \noverwhelmingly Republican House of Delegates, 2 to 1, and a Republican \nSenate--it is a split Senate 20-20 but there is a President who breaks \nties who is a Republican Lieutenant Governor so it is a Republican \nmajority body--Republican Governor and Republican legislature decided \nto do something to benefit the economy and here is what they did. They \ndid a package of $880 million of revenue for transportation, annually \nwhen fully phased in, and 80 percent of the package is new revenue and \n20 percent is spending cuts in general fund programs that would be \nrepurposed to transportation.\n  For them to do that, they had to make a hard decision. For them to do \nsomething that was balanced, because an individual whose name is often \nmentioned in Washington, Grover Norquist, said can you not do this \nwithout violating your pledges, and others said it would be anathema to \never raise a tax or fee and it will be politically damaging and it will \nbe economically wrong, and a Republican Governor and a Republican \nlegislature looked at them and said: The right thing to do to benefit \nour economy is to take a balanced approach. And by an overwhelming \nmajority in both Houses, supported by Republicans and Democrats and \ncelebrated with excitement by a Republican Governor, this is what \nhappened, 90 miles from here a few days ago in order to benefit the \neconomy.\n  A transportation package is not a precise analog to what we are \nwrestling with here, but it is pretty close. This was a step that was \ntaken to benefit the economy. It was done in a balanced way. We are \nfaced with a fundamental decision about whether we are going to benefit \nthe economy or whether we are going to intentionally allow something to \nhappen that will hurt the economy. I think the lesson for what happened \nin Richmond is the economy benefits from a balanced approach and an \nimbalanced approach is not going to be the way we get to a solution \nthat is good for the economy and good for people.\n  The last thing I will say is this. Much of my discussion has been \nabout trying to avert bad things--people being furloughed, people \nlosing their jobs, small ship repair yards potentially having to close, \nwounded warriors not having the nursing care they need, students \neligible for Head Start not being able to go into classrooms, Guards \nmen and women not receiving the kinds of training they need to go into \nthe field and be fully prepared--much of what I have described has been \nabout trying to avert negative consequences.\n  But the best part of all is I think we are in a unique moment where \nit is not just about averting the negative. I think we can do something \nthat will have a positive effect, that will avert negative \nconsequences, certainly, but by getting some certainty and by showing a \nspirit of compromise and cooperation, we will be sending a message from\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nthis body that will have a positive effect on the economy.\n  There are some who see signs of the economy showing some strength. \nThe stock market is doing pretty well. It is a bit volatile every day, \nbut where are we on the stock market? We are doing pretty well. There \nwas news about the housing prices and housing market coming up. \nConsumer confidence has been stronger than expected. These have not yet \ncongealed into the trends we hope to see, but there are signs and there \nis evidence that we have an economy that is ready to achieve some lift.\n  If we look at our global competitors, we see that there are some \nweaknesses. This is a lesson I heard preached again and again by my \nsenior Senator as he talked about global economies around the world. \nSenator Warner talks about how Europe and the Euro Zone has its \nchallenges, the Japanese economy has its challenges, and the Chinese \neconomy has not been quite as strong as it had been. Our major global \ncompetitors are not just clicking on all eight cylinders.\n  If we do something right now, it will send a message throughout the \neconomy that we are not only open for business, but there is a balanced \napproach that can be reached by a Senate and a Congress that is willing \nto work together and put country first and do what is right for the \neconomy. I think we have every reason to believe we will not only avert \nthe negative consequences I spent the last half hour talking about, but \nwe will take those positive trends in the economy and put some more \nhealing into the economy.\n  We will see some more lift that could be significant. We will see \nmore of that cash that is in bank accounts invested back into the \nAmerican economy. We will put some distance between ourselves and some \nof our other global competitors. This is what is at stake for us if we \nget this right.\n  It should be enough for us to do the right thing and find a balanced \napproach to avoid hurting people and to avoid hurting the economy. We \nwill not only get an additional benefit if we act in a balanced way--\nbecause I believe we will avert those consequences--but we will see our \neconomy lift in a more accelerated way.\n  I will conclude by saying this: This is a moment where we have a \nchoice to make. I was with Leader Reid an hour or two ago, and we sat \nthrough a beautiful ceremony where a statue was unveiled of Rosa Parks. \nOne of the speakers talked about a very humble and pedestrian setting \nwhere she had a decision to make. The decision was, Do I just do what \nhas always been done? Do I just kind of keep drifting into a situation \nthat I know is unjust and unequal or do I decide to do something \ndifferent?\n  We are drifting toward something that is very bad, something that \nMembers of Congress believed strongly when the bill was first put in \nplace should not happen and would harm people and would harm our \neconomy. That is the moment we are in right now, a moment to make a \ndecision.\n  The decision is, Do we allow ourselves to drift in a way that hurts \npeople or do we choose a balanced approach that will help people, \nstrengthen the economy, strengthen our budget, strengthen our ability \nto create jobs, and strengthen the reputation of this body?\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Senator Kaine\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to commend my friend \nof 33 years for his maiden speech and thoughtful exposition of the \nchallenges which face our country. I have had the opportunity to know \nand work with Tim Kaine since we were in law school together. There is \nno one who is brighter; there is no one who brings more relentless \noptimism to any challenge. He is going to be a great addition to the \nSenate.\n  I know so many colleagues from both sides of the aisle have come to \nadmire his intellect, his fairness, and his willingness to always do \nthe right thing. I just wanted to rise briefly to commend my good \nfriend. I know it is his first speech, but it will not be his last.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to add my congratulations to the junior \nSenator from Virginia for his maiden speech. We knew when he decided to \nrun that he would be an outstanding Member. As his speech showed, he is \nliving up to those high expectations. His speech was thoughtful, \nrelevant, and showed both sides of the issue. That is the kind of \ntrademark the junior Senator from Virginia has, and we look forward to \nworking with him in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to continue to share my concerns \nabout the appointment of Mr. Jack Lew to be the Secretary of the \nTreasury of the United States, one of the four senior Cabinet positions \nthat are so important to America.\n  I have delineated how he proposed the budget in 2011. He announced on \nCNN and several other Sunday morning shows--this is when he was going \nto introduce the budget the next day, and he was giving a preview of \nit.\n\n       ``Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to \n     the point where we can look the American people in the eye \n     and say, we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down our national debt.''\n\n  Now, that would be a thing to celebrate. But I am convinced that he \nand the White House officials had met and they decided they weren't \ngoing to change the tax-and-spend and deficit policies of the United \nStates, but they knew that wasn't going to be popular after 2010's \nshellacking of big-spending politicians. So what did they decide to do? \nThey decided to prepare a budget that made no real change in the \nspending trajectory of America, continuing us on, as Secretary Geithner \nsaid just a few weeks later, an unsustainable course, while telling the \nAmerican people they did what they wanted.\n  As I indicated earlier, this budget he presented never had a single \nyear in the 10 years of that budget in which the deficit fell below \n$600 billion. That is larger than any deficit President Bush ever had \nin his 8 years, and it was going up during the last 5 years.\n  They said the deficit would go up $740-some-odd billion in the 10th \nyear. The Congressional Budget Office took their very same proposals--\nthe independent CBO--and concluded that it would be $1.2 trillion in \nthe 10th year, in debt--a totally unsustainable debt course and getting \nworse in the outer years.\n  So I am very much of the belief that this Senate should not accept a \nman for the Secretary of the Treasury, to promote him to that august \nposition, who makes this kind of representation about the budget he \nprepared as Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The budget \ngot zero votes in the House twice and zero votes in the Senate twice. \nIt has been panned by editorial boards all over America. He has been at \nthe center of the political financial maneuvers of the Obama \nAdministration from the beginning.\n  A lot of people are wondering why an agreement hasn't been reached \naround here: Why don't you agree? It is hard to agree if the man you \nare negotiating with is as out of contact with reality as the Wall \nStreet Journal said of Hosni Mubarak shortly before he fell in Egypt. \nSo I am baffled by it.\n  I wish to share now a few more thoughts about how this sequester we \nare talking about so much now happened, how it came about, and Mr. \nLew's role in it. In fact, he designed it. He proposed a budget later \nin February 2012 that would eliminate it, and now he denies ever \ncreating it in the first place. From Bob Woodward's book--he studied \nthis carefully and talked to people, and I saw him on television this \nmorning being quite firm about this. He has written a recent op-ed \npiece explaining the situation.\n  This is what Bob Woodward said in his book ``The Price of Politics'':\n\n       Lew, Nabors, Sperling and Bruce Reed, Biden's chief of \n     staff, had finally decided to propose using language from the \n     1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law as the model \n     for the trigger . . . It would require a sequester with half \n     the cuts from Defense, and the other half from domestic \n     programs.\n       Later in the negotiations, Obama adviser David Plouffe \n     reportedly said that he couldn't believe that Republicans \n     were going to agree to any deal with sequester as a trigger.\n\n\n[[Page S907]]\n\n\n  Who started this? According to Mr. Woodward, no doubt about it, it \nwas Mr. Lew.\n  In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, Bob Woodward quoted Lew in \nsaying this:\n\n       There was an insistence on the part of the Republicans in \n     Congress for there to be some automatic trigger . . . [it] \n     was very much rooted in the Republican congressional \n     insistence that there be an automatic measure.\n\n  Woodward went on to say:\n\n       The president and Lew had this wrong.\n\n  That is what I just read about him saying the Republicans insisted on \nit. Mr. Woodward said in his piece:\n\n       The president and Lew had this wrong. My extensive \n     reporting for my book ``The Price of Politics'' shows the \n     automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and \n     were the brainchild of Lew and White House congressional \n     relations chief Rob Nabors.\n\n  Was Mr. Lew correct in insisting somebody else did it, or he and the \nWhite House?\n  Furthermore, on Senator Burr's questioning of Lew at the February \nFinance Committee confirmation hearing, Woodward says:\n\n       [Senator] Burr asked about the president's statement during \n     the debate, that the Republicans originated it.\n\n  That is, the sequester.\n  Mr. Woodward writes this:\n\n       Lew, being a good lawyer and a loyal presidential adviser, \n     then shifted to denial mode:\n\n  ``Senator, the demand for an enforcement mechanism was not something \nthat the administration was pushing at that moment.''\n  That is how he handled that in the committee. Did he give a straight \nanswer? No.\n  Then, during the negotiations for compromise that people had been \nhoping would happen for really the first 4 years of President Obama's \nadministration because we are on an unsustainable path, and it is not \ngoing to be fixed without leadership from the President--if he opposes \nit, the Democratic majority in the Senate will not pass it. You can put \nthat down. They have not bucked him one time and won't buck him on a \ncomprehensive financial settlement to put America on a sound path. We \nhave seen that the whole time. We have Senators meeting and talking and \nindicating they might agree, but fundamentally they are looking over to \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They don't want to break rank with the \nPresident. That is just the way it is.\n  So Lew was now the top negotiator for President Obama. He has been \ncalled an ``obstructer of compromise.'' Reportedly, more than any other \nperson in the room, Lew sabotaged agreement. Jack Lew has a long \nhistory of showing a failure to compromise on the drivers of the debt, \nthe kinds of spending programs that are out of control, and we have to \nlook at them. We can't have fundamental, large programs growing at \nthree times the rate of the GDP, three times the rate of the economy.\n  Going back a long time ago, when Speaker Gingrich and now-Ohio \nGovernor John Kasich--Kasich chaired the Budget Committee, and Mr. Lew \nwas a deputy in President Obama's OMB office. Mr. Kasich reportedly \ntold President Obama's economic adviser Gene Sperling at the White \nHouse that Lew ``did not know how to get to yes.'' That is Kasich's \nview of it.\n  A recent National Journal article on Lew quotes former Senator Judd \nGregg, who chaired and was ranking member on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, of which I am ranking member today. Judd Gregg, a highly \nrespected Senator who didn't seek reelection and remains a very \nvaluable contributor to the national discussion on debt and spending, \nsaid this:\n\n       ``He's like a labor-union negotiator. He's not going to \n     give you an inch if he doesn't have to . . . He's a true \n     believer in the causes.''\n\n  Well, that is apparently what we have been having because we can't \never get to an agreement that would do something significant.\n  The same National Journal article went on to say:\n\n       By causes, Gregg means Medicare and the rest of the social \n     safety-net. These are the progressive ideals close to Lew's \n     heart, friends and former colleagues say . . .\n\n  So Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps have been growing at very \nrapid rates, and they are very large programs. And all of them, every \nprogram, can be examined, looked at, and we will find waste, abuse, \nfraud, mismanagement, and they can be reduced. But Mr. Lew said no.\n  When it came to the sequester, let me remind my colleagues that food \nstamps, which have gone from $20 billion in 2001 to $80 billion in \n2012--11 years--went up four times. There is no way to make that \nprogram better? We have the inspector general finding fraud in some of \nthese programs. Medicaid has been rising well above the economy's \ngrowth rate, and it definitely has the potential to be reformed and \nmade more efficient. Not a dime was cut from food stamps. Not a dime \nwas cut from Medicaid. Only 2 percent was obtained from Medicare, but \nit was taken in a way that just cut the payments to doctors and \nhospitals, which is not going to be able to be maintained much longer, \nexperts tell us.\n  What kinds of examples do we have from Bob Woodward's book ``The \nPrice of Politics''? This is what he says:\n\n       [Brett] Loper [House Speaker John Boehner's policy \n     director] found Lew obnoxious. The budget director was doing \n     75 percent of the talking, lecturing everyone not only about \n     what Obama's policy was, but also why it was superior to the \n     Republicans'.\n\n  That is Woodward's take. He goes on to say:\n\n       [Barry] Jackson [Boehner's chief of staff] found Lew's tone \n     disrespectful and dismissive.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Lew was incredulous when he considered the Republican \n     proposal as a whole. The changes they were considering \n     sounded simple. But the speaker's office was laying down \n     general principles and looking to apply them to extremely \n     complex programs. The devil was always in the details.\n       Boehner was sick of the White House meetings. It was still \n     mostly the president lecturing, he reported to his senior \n     staff.\n       The other annoying factor was Jack Lew, who tried to \n     explain why the Democrats' view of the world was right and \n     the Republicans' wrong.\n\n  Look, when you are in a negotiation, it is not the time to have an \nargument over what your world view and my world view is. What you have \nto try to do is find out: Aren't there some things we can agree on that \nare consistent with both our world views and get us in a position so we \ncan reach an agreement to save the Republic from financial disaster.\n  Why would not the Office of Management and Budget Director, unless he \nbelieved this bogus, phony statement--which he does not; he knew it was \nnot accurate--why would he not want to do something historic and try to \nget America on a sound course? It was within the grasp.\n  So Mr. Woodward goes on:\n\n       ``Always trying to protect the sacred cows of the left,'' \n     Barry Jackson said of Lew, going through Medicare and \n     Medicaid almost line by line while Boehner was just trying to \n     reach some top-line agreement [on what they could do].\n\n  It was a very unsatisfactory situation. An agreement that could have \nbeen reached, I think, was not reached. And you keep looking around for \nfingerprints about how it fell apart, and it looks as though Jack Lew \nwas the person doing that.\n  Mr. Lew is ideologically driven very strongly. That has become more \nclear as I have looked at the data and researched his background.\n  During the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations, Lew reportedly would not \nentertain even an idea by Senate Republicans that included any reforms \nto Medicaid. Everybody knows Medicaid has to be reformed. This is a \nhealth care system for poor people. Governors all over America are up \nin arms about Federal regulations and restrictions. The program had \nbeen surging in cost. It needs to be evaluated and improved. It has to \nbe. It had no changes whatsoever in sequester because Jack Lew said no.\n  The publication Politico reported that ``Democrats and \nprogressives''--progressives are, apparently, not liberals. \nProgressives are folks who--I do not know. One of the things \nprogressives do is they tend to be postmodern and they pretend not to \npay much attention to the meaning of words. They have an agenda, in my \nobservation, and they interpret the Constitution or the laws of the \nUnited States--well, they are more flexible. What do you want it to \nmean today? They are not into the plain meaning of words so we can have \na common understanding of what people mean when they sign an agreement \nor pass a law.\n  Anyway, Politico reported that ``Democrats and progressives'' were \n``cheering Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew's \npromotion to White House chief of staff, saying he has a decades-long \nhistory of protecting entitlement programs--especially Medicaid--\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\n  It goes on. Politico reported that:\n\n       Lew played a crucial role in protecting Medicaid from the \n     across-the-board cuts that would take place if the \n     supercommittee didn't get a deficit deal--which it didn't. \n     When Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's aides pressed \n     for including Medicaid as part of the sequester during a \n     last-minute conference call, Lew shouted, ``The answer is . . \n     . No, no, no!''\n\n  So this has not been a healthy situation. This country is now in a \nfix. We have the sequester that is hammering us and disproportionately \nand unwisely mandating cuts on the Defense Department.\n  We can do better than that. Mr. Lew wanted that. He got that. Maybe \nhe knew all along the White House was not going to agree to the things \nthat would make this system work better and maybe, therefore, put us on \na sound path and, he was quite happy to have the Defense Department--\none-sixth of the government--get half the cuts and happy to protect \nhuge segments of the government from any cuts.\n  Well, you cannot cut our interest payment. We do not want to cut \nSocial Security, but need real reform that puts the program on a sound \nbasis.\n  So that is how we got into this fix.\n  I would say to my colleagues, if you believe the President's budget \nthat Mr. Lew submitted on CNN on February 12, 2011--if you believe he \nwas correct to say: ``Our budget will get us, over the next several \nyears, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye \nand say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending money that \nwe have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national \ndebt,'' then you should vote for him. If you think that is a true \nstatement, I would like to have somebody explain to me how it is true. \nAnd if it is not a true statement, should not the Congress of the \nUnited States, the U.S. Senate, stand up and say we cannot accept high \ngovernment officials giving us this kind of answer?\n  With his budget, the lowest deficit we would have had is $600 \nbillion. We would have added $13 trillion to the national debt over 10 \nyears and maintained, as Secretary Geithner said, this Nation on an \nunsustainable debt course.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague, the assistant Democratic leader, \nSenator Durbin, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama for \nyielding the floor.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  I rise today to join many colleagues who are expressing concern over \nthe impact that sequestration is going to have on America and on my \nState of Illinois.\n  We are just days away from a budgetary perfect storm that we created. \nWe have to come together to have a more balanced and sensible approach \nto reducing the deficit. I was on the Simpson-Bowles Commission, \nnominated by Majority Leader Harry Reid. I served with 17 others--6 by \nthe President, and 6 each from the House and the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans equally divided. We considered the deficit crisis facing \nAmerica. And it is serious. We borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend. \nThat is unsustainable. No family could continue with that kind of a \nregimen, no company could, and certainly no nation can.\n  So we have to have deficit reduction, but we need to do it \nthoughtfully.\n  First, we do not want to do it too quickly. I just met downstairs \nwith a group from Illinois. They are civic and business leaders from \nthe Quad Cities area in western Illinois. We talked about the fact that \nwe are in an economic recovery but a slow one, one that is taking hold \nbut slowly. We need to take care that whatever we do does not \njeopardize economic recovery.\n  Right now, downtown the Federal Reserve Board is trying to keep the \neconomic recovery moving forward and jobs created. The way they are \ndoing that is keeping interest rates low, so it is cheaper to borrow \nwhat is needed for a home or a car or a business. That is not good news \nfor senior citizens on fixed incomes who want to see higher interest \nrates. But what they are trying to do is fuel capital and business \nexpansion. That is the Federal Reserve.\n  Meanwhile, what is going on in Washington, not too far away from the \nFederal Reserve--a few blocks away at the Capitol--is the opposite \nmessage. What we are hearing from Members of Congress is that we need \nto cut spending.\n  Cutting spending at this moment in time means cutting jobs at this \nmoment in time, which means fewer people paying income taxes and more \npeople drawing government benefits. That is not the recipe for economic \nexpansion.\n  So at opposite ends of Washington, we have contrasting approaches to \nthe current economy. We are neutralizing all of the work being done by \nthe Federal Reserve and by our austerity program here when it comes to \nour budget. And what is about to occur on Friday is an across-the-board \nspending cut. People say: Fine, cut spending. But it is also a cut in \njobs--jobs in the civilian sector as well as the public sector. And \nthat, to me, is shortsighted.\n  We need a deficit reduction plan that is sensitive to the state of \nthe economy, that invests at this moment when we need it, but makes \ncertain we are going to be reducing spending in the outyears. We are \ndoing just the opposite. We should build on the $2.5 trillion deficit \nreduction we have accomplished in the last several years with President \nObama. But we need to do it thoughtfully, to ensure that all the \nnational priorities--such as defending our Nation, education, and \nhealth care--can succeed in the 21st century.\n  As the new chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the \nlooming impact of the sequestration on the Department of Defense will \nbe significant. Indeed, contractions in defense spending are already \nimpacting the national economy and are affecting operations for our men \nand women in uniform at home and overseas.\n  For the first time since the spring of 2009, the Department of Labor \nreported that the U.S. economy actually shrank by one-tenth of 1 \npercent. That is largely due to a 22.2-percent decrease in national \ndefense spending.\n  The Department of Defense has already implemented a civilian hiring \nfreeze and is eliminating 46,000 temporary jobs.\n  Last week, the Congress was notified that the Department of Defense \nwill notify 800,000 civilian workers they are about to be laid off. \nThese workers will not be paid one day a week for the rest of the year. \nThat equates to a 20-percent reduction in their income.\n  These civilian and temporary workforces are not just bureaucrats at \nthe Pentagon. In fact, 86 percent of the workforce I am describing \nresides outside of Washington, DC. These are civilians working for our \nDepartment of Defense who literally fix the equipment in our depots and \narsenals. They are teachers for our schools, training the children of \nmilitary families, counselors, police officers, medical professionals, \nblue-collar wrench turners and maintainers at our military bases.\n  The impact of sequestration is already being felt not just here in \nthis country but overseas. I just returned last week from a whirlwind \ntour--I am still recovering--over to Africa to visit Uganda, Djibouti, \nand then into the gulf into Bahrain.\n  I saw firsthand the men and women in uniform who are defending our \ninterests, pursuing our missions, and the impact of sequestration. In \nUganda our U.S. military is currently training Ugandan military forces \nto take down a notorious leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, Joseph \nKony. They are making significant progress; however, their mission is \nso important to increasing stability in a difficult portion of the \nworld, and it could be sacrificed to a sequester.\n  In Bahrain, home of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, I met with ADM John \nMiller. He took me on these ships, and I met with our great sailors, \nthe men and women in our naval forces who are keeping America safe and \nwatching some of America's most threatening enemies. They have already \ncancelled deployment of a second aircraft carrier to the gulf. We were \ngoing to have the Truman come to the gulf and supplement our naval \nforces in the Fifth Fleet. It has been cancelled because of \nsequestration. Why? Because the Navy had to hold the Truman in reserve \nto save the money. This is just one example of how you can't contain \nthe effects of sequestration. So there will be one carrier out there \nprotecting our men and women in uniform. There should be two; that is \nthe safest thing to do. Due\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\nto the budget cutbacks that will not be possible.\n  As Secretary Panetta stated recently, the Pentagon is facing a \nperfect budget storm--sequestration nearly halfway through a fiscal \nyear coupled with a potential yearlong continuing resolution. If \nsequestration isn't averted--it goes into effect on Friday--it will \nimpose senseless across-the-board cuts on almost every account in the \nDepartment of Defense as a result of Congress's inability to devise a \nmore responsible solution.\n  The second issue in the continuing resolution we have had for the \nlast 5 months--and the threat of the Pentagon having to do so for \nanother 7 months under a potential yearlong CR. What is a CR? The CR is \na snapshot of last year's budget bill applied to this year. Does that \nmake sense?\n  Last year we were building a ship. This year we completed it. This \nyear the budget says keep building the ship. It is finished. To merely \nreplicate the same budget from last year and say we are extending the \nCR is wasteful. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\n  The Pentagon's fiscal year 2012 budget is a lot different than what \nthey need in 2013, particularly in readiness funding. When we hear the \nPentagon tell us the first thing we have to do is cut back in \nreadiness, let's translate that into language that average people would \nappreciate.\n  Right up there is a door to the gallery in the Senate Chamber. A few \nyears ago a nephew of mine named Michael had a summer job working that \ndoor. I like Michael a lot. The reason he worked that job for a few \nweeks was he just enlisted in the Army, and we wanted to give him a few \nbucks in his pocket before he took off. He is a great kid. A big smile \non his face and off he went. He became part of the Mountain Division \nout of Fort Drum, and he was assigned to Afghanistan.\n  The whole family--and we have a pretty big family--was waiting, \nhoping, and praying for Michael's safe return. We had one thing going \nfor us: not only the fact that he was young, strong, and determined, \nbut he had been trained. Readiness equals training equals survival. The \nPentagon has told us sequestration will cut back in readiness and \ntraining.\n  What if it were your nephew, your son, husband, wife, or daughter? \nWould you want the best training before they were sent into action? Of \ncourse you would. Readiness and training are essential for a military \nready to respond when it is called on. When we cut back in these areas, \nwe jeopardize the chance of success of a mission, and we reduce the \nlikelihood of their being ready and surviving any combat they might \nface. It is very shortsighted.\n  General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated: \n``Readiness is what's now in jeopardy. We're on the brink of creating a \nhollow force.''\n  That is sequestration. In the operations account alone, the account \nassociated most closely with a hollow force, the combined effect of \nsequester and a yearlong CR will leave a shortfall of over $40 billion \nin the last 7 months of this year.\n  As the department protects warfighter needs in Afghanistan and troop \npay, as they should, the impact necessarily falls disproportionately on \nthe rest of the Department, no matter how important their mission.\n  For our troops, sequestration will mean an immediate impact on \ntraining and readiness. Eighty percent of Army combat units will have \nto delay their training. Fifty-five percent of Marine Corps combat \nunits will have unsatisfactory readiness ratings. Navy ship deployments \nwill be cut by nearly 25 percent.\n  Sequestration would also mean significant cuts to family support \nprograms. It isn't just the soldier who goes to war; it is the soldier \nand the soldier's family who go to war. The Pentagon provides mental \nhealth, suicide and financial counseling, and critical services to \nmilitary members and their families. While the Department is going to \ntry its best to protect these programs, these services are going to be \nsharply reduced under sequestration.\n  Let's not come to these hearings and lament the incidence of suicide \nin the military, as horrific as it is, and then turn around and say: \nWell, you will never notice the sequestration cut when it comes to \ncounseling for PTSD and mental issues facing our military. Yes, we \nwill. We need to be sensitive to these military members and their \nfamilies.\n  The Defense Health Program will face a shortfall of $2.5 billion \nunder sequester. The Department is projecting there may not be enough \nfunding to cover health care access for some military retirees. We are \nalso looking at significant job loss in the industrial base. They are \ngoing to be felt in high-tech defense industry as well as blue-collar \nworkforces across the country. The Navy estimates 30,000 private sector \nworkers will be laid off or reduced in pay, and repair of ships, \naircraft, and maintenance of facilities and equipment will be affected. \nThe Army has estimated 5,000 layoffs at its own depots.\n\n  These are just preliminary. The list goes on. From those workforce \nreductions in the intelligence community, we don't know the overall \nimpact of our Nation's safety. As we meet in the comfort and safety of \nthis Chamber, there are Americans--men and women, some of them civilian \ncontractors--who are working for our military and intelligence agencies \nwho are watching the threats to the United States every single second, \nevery minute, every hour, every day.\n  We don't want to shortchange them because in doing that we \nshortchange our protection, our defense. Every State is going to feel \nthese job losses.\n  The day before yesterday I was at Scott Air Force Base near \nBelleville, IL. At that base, the Rock Island Arsenal in the Quad \nCities and Air Guard units across Illinois--Springfield, Peoria--the \neffect is going to be significant: 15,000 civilian personnel in \nIllinois will be furloughed for 22 days over the next 7 months, \nessentially a 20-percent pay cut. That means $52 million is coming out \nof the pockets of those working families in my State who are trying to \nget through the worst recession we have had in decades.\n  About 1,500 of these civilian furloughs are Guard technicians. These \npeople are the backbone of the National Guard in every State with \ncritical maintenance and training responsibilities. There might have \nbeen a day in the distant past when we could say, well, it is just the \nNational Guard. We have learned better. When it came to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, it was America's Reserves and National Guard who stepped \nup. Time and time again, deployment after deployment, they went into \naction, and we were proud of what they did. To shortchange them when it \ncomes to this basic maintenance and reliability is shortsighted.\n  The loss of Guard and Reserve training in Illinois is equivalent to \nalmost $20 million lost. Delaying or canceling necessary military \nconstruction means it will cost more in the future to the tune of about \n$27 million. In the Quad Cities, the Rock Island manufacturing hub \ncould lose $197 million in workload. These cuts don't make sense--not \nfor Illinois, not for America.\n  I want to talk about what sequestration means for civilian families \nin my State of Illinois. The across-the-board cuts that are scheduled \nto begin on Friday will work a real hardship on families, children, and \nthe elderly. Seventy thousand young kids across the country will be \nkicked out of Head Start. Head Start is the pre-K program which gets \nyoung kids off on the right foot, to enable them to learn when they \narrive in kindergarten and school. Mr. President, 2,700 preschoolers in \nIllinois will be eliminated from the program because of sequestration.\n  Loan guarantees for small businesses are way down. That is the engine \nof our economy, one of the best job creators. They are going to be cut \nby $540 million nationwide. Fewer jobs, less innovation, less economic \ngrowth. In just a single recent year, more than 2,300 small businesses \nused these loan guarantees in Illinois, and now there will be a \ndramatic reduction.\n  If sequestration takes place, the food we eat is going to be at least \nthreatened, if not slowed down; 2,100 fewer food inspections will \noccur, putting our children at risk and costing many jobs in the food \nproduction industry and definitely slowing down production.\n  The Centers for Disease Control estimates each year roughly one in \nsix Americans, about 48 million people, get sick; 128,000 are \nhospitalized; and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. Is food inspection \nimportant? You bet it is. It is clear we need more food inspection in\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\nthe United States, not less, as the sequestration would cause.\n  Up to 373,000 mentally ill adults would be prevented from receiving \nnecessary treatment, putting them at risk of hospitalization, crime, \nand homelessness.\n  Cuts to medical research would mean delays in finding cures to heart \ndisease, cancer, and Alzheimer's, which are so important to every \nfamily in America. Illinois alone will lose $38 million in funding for \nmedical research and innovation as a result of the sequestration.\n  How badly will it set back research and innovation? This is how the \nhead of NIH under President George W. Bush described it:\n\n       We are going to maim our innovation capabilities if you do \n     these abrupt deep cuts at NIH. It will impact science for \n     generations to come.\n\n  The National Science Foundation would issue nearly 1,000 fewer \nresearch grants and awards. This translates to $20 million less for \nscientific research in my State.\n  A recent National Science Foundation grant helped build and support \nthe National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University \nof Illinois. What a dynamo of job creation this is, and now we are \ncutting it back.\n  This center hosts several supercomputers which are used to model and \nsolve some of the most serious engineering challenges facing us in the \nworld. Health and nutrition services would be dramatically reduced \nputting women, children, and the elderly at risk.\n\n  I know what the other side said. Peggy Noonan, the great speech \nwriter who appears on television regularly--and I disagree with her \npolitics, but I admire her writing skills immensely--says: We are \nliving in a government of ``freak out'' and the President is trying to \nfreak us out by telling us all the terrible things that are going to \nhappen as a result of sequestration.\n  I have news for Ms. Noonan. These are real cuts. They will be \nnoticed. They will have a long-term impact. If the President didn't \nspeak out about what these cuts meant, he would be derelict in his own \nimportant responsibilities. I am glad he is telling us. I am glad the \nAmerican people see it coming, and I hope, as they see it coming, they \nwill join us in a way of trying to avoid it and find a better approach.\n  As many as 376 fewer Illinois women will be screened for cancer \nbecause of these cuts; 5,576 fewer children will receive lifesaving \nvaccinations; $764,000 less will be spent to provide seniors with basic \nMeals on Wheels. The list goes on.\n  That is the bad news. Is there a way out of it? There will be. The \nSenate will get a chance to vote tomorrow. The House has decided in a \nvery curious move to basically leave town and ignore this. They passed \ntwo bills last year which have expired. They don't even apply anymore, \nand Speaker Boehner announced earlier this week, well, it is now up to \nthe Senate.\n  I am not sure if things have changed. I was paying pretty close \nattention, but under the Constitution I believe we have a House and a \nSenate. Unless we have gone to some Nebraska model, a unicameral model, \nthere is nothing we can do in the Senate to cure this problem alone. We \nneed to have the cooperation of the House. The Speaker can't wash his \nhands of this and walk away, which, apparently, he suggested he could \nearlier this week.\n  We are going to come up with a balanced approach, one that makes a \nlot more sense than what I have just described. It is going to be a \ncombination of spending cuts--yes, there will be some--and increased \nrevenues. We are going to close some loopholes which benefit wealthy \nindividuals and big corporations. We can replace sequestration, which I \nhave just described, and avoid the damage and cuts and still achieve \ndeficit reduction.\n  In January, Congress agreed to use a balanced mix of spending cuts \nand new revenues to delay sequestration to March 1. Congress agreed on \na bipartisan basis to split it 50-50 between taxes and spending cuts. \nLeader Reid voted for it, as did Speaker Boehner. Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican leader, voted for it, as well as Leader Pelosi. Senate \nBudget Committee chairman Patty Murray voted for it, as did House \nRepublican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. This bipartisan \napproach of equal cuts and tax increases apparently had the wholesome \nbipartisan support in both Chambers.\n  The American people agreed, incidentally, that it makes sense. Those \nwho have been successful in America--God bless them. They have done \nwell. Many of them have created big businesses and jobs. It is not \nunreasonable to ask them to pay back some, particularly if they happen \nto be in those income categories like a man I know named Warren \nBuffett, one of the wealthiest people in America. He has said over and \nover again there is something wrong with the tax system when he pays a \nlower tax rate on his income than his secretary. I think he is right.\n  The change we are making to come up with revenue basically is to \napply the Buffett rule. The money you make over $1 million is going to \nbe subject to higher taxation, up to $5 or $6 million. That money will \nbe captured over the next 10 years to enable us to reduce the deficit \nand reduce the impact of sequestration. It would close that loophole, a \nloophole which I think needs to be closed and is long overdue, and the \nAmerican people agree we should close other loopholes--oil and gas \ncompany loopholes, for example, offshore tax haven loopholes.\n\n  In line with these priorities, the Senate Democrats tomorrow will put \nforth a balanced approach to avoid sequestration for the rest of this \nyear and give Congress more time to pass a long-term budget agreement. \nOur bill would ensure that millionaires are not paying a lower tax rate \nthan the people who work for them or the janitors who clean their \noffices. The Buffet rule is an important step in reducing the \ninequality in the Tax Code.\n  Even as our economy has recovered, this inequality, unfortunately, \nhas grown. A recent study found the top 1 percent of income earners \ncaptured 121 percent of the income gains in the first 2 years of the \nrecovery. They were the first to get well in a big way. What about the \nrest of America? The top 1 percent captured 121 percent of the income \ngains, and the other 99 percent fell further behind. Let us reverse \nthis once and for all. This income inequality is inconsistent with \nbalanced economic growth. The Senate Democrats' plan also closes tax \nloopholes that actually cut taxes for companies that move factories \noverseas. I cannot imagine why there would be a reward in the Tax Code \nfor a company in America that decides to offshore its production and \nlay off American workers. If they want to do that, if that is a \ncorporate decision to make more money, it shouldn't be with the \nincentive or the reward of our Tax Code. That is a tax policy that \nshould be put to rest once and for all.\n  On the spending side, our bill cuts wasteful direct payments in our \nagricultural programs, and I come from an agricultural State. Those \ndirect payments should come to an end. They are made to farmers in good \ntimes and bad. This is not a safety net. In many instances, it is a \nwindfall. We made this a part of the farm bill--the bipartisan bill \nthat passed the Senate--and we include it in this approach for deficit \nreduction.\n  The Pentagon has to play a role in further deficit reduction, and \nthey know it. I have long said we need to make smart cuts in defense \nprograms, not the sequestration approach. The Senate Democrats' bill \nincludes these smart defense cuts and, importantly, delays them until \nafter we have ended the war in Afghanistan next year.\n  This choice should be an easy one for every Senator and every \nAmerican. We simply have to choose. Are we for national security, \neducation, infrastructure, and innovation or are we for special \ninterest tax loopholes, subsidies and giveaways? That is what it boils \ndown to.\n  For over 200 years, our national values have reflected that we want \nto stand together when it comes to keeping America strong, educating \nour children, leading the world in research, and building the \ninfrastructure for the 21st century. Our votes tomorrow will be an \nindication of whether we still believe that.\n  We were never supposed to be at this moment in time. We weren't \nsupposed to face this sequestration. It was supposed to be such a \nparade of horribles we would do everything we could to avoid it. We \nvoted for it on a bipartisan basis, sent it to the President, and he \nsigned it into law. I know he felt--and\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nhe said it publicly--it would never reach that point. Well, it has \nreached that point. Now the question is, Are we going to throw up our \nhands and say that is the way Washington works now?\n  We lurch from one crisis to the next. The crisis this week is \nsequestration. Three weeks from now it will be the continuing \nresolution. This is no way to run a government and it is no way to run \na nation. I implore the Speaker and all the leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle, for goodness' sake, don't say it is the other guy's \nresponsibility. We have to come together and solve this problem. That \nis why we were sent here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJack Lew to be the Secretary of the Treasury. Am I in order to do that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the problem we face with Mr. Lew's \nnomination is that the Senate does not have answers to very basic and \nfactual questions about Mr. Lew. How can we make an informed decision \non his nomination if we don't have answers to basic questions?\n  Let me provide several examples, starting with New York University. \nHe worked for this tax-exempt university and he was given a subsidized \n$1.4 million mortgage. Mr. Lew claims he cannot remember the interest \nrate he paid on his $1.4 million mortgage the tax-exempt New York \nUniversity gave him.\n  Does that pass the laugh test? I asked Mr. Lew to provide details on \nthe mortgage to Congress. He refused repeatedly to provide full details \nand documentation of this taxpayer-subsidized mortgage. The \nexplanations he did provide were needlessly complex, making it almost \nimpossible to understand the structure of his loan.\n  What is he hiding? Why can't Congress get a straight answer out of \nthis nominee to be our next Secretary of Treasury?\n  When Mr. Lew was executive vice president of New York University, the \nschool received kickbacks on student loans from Citigroup. Then Mr. Lew \nwent to work for that same Citigroup. When I asked Mr. Lew if he had \nany conversations with Citigroup about these kickbacks while he was at \nNew York University, he once again ``could not recall.'' I asked for \nany documents related to his involvement in the kickbacks and he \nrefused to search for them.\n  Did those conversations occur? We don't know.\n  On Monday, the New York Times uncovered a $685,000 payment that New \nYork University gave Jack Lew on his way out the door. The New York \nTimes called the payment ``unusual.'' It is a shame Mr. Lew failed to \nprovide these details as part of his confirmation process, leaving us \nto rely on the press to dig out the details.\n  He told the committee he received ``severance pay'' from New York \nUniversity but did not disclose the amount. The dictionary defines \nseverance pay as: ``A sum of money, usually based on length of \nemployment, for which an employee is eligible upon termination.''\n  Was Mr. Lew terminated? If so, why was he terminated? If not, was the \nseverance package truly a parting gift from the university? I don't \nknow the answers to those questions because Mr. Lew was not forthcoming \nwith the answers.\n  When it comes to questions about investments in the Cayman Islands, \nthings get even less transparent. Mr. Lew claimed he did not know \nUgland House was a notorious tax haven. He claims he did not know he \nhad his money in the Cayman Islands. He claims he was not aware of any \nCitigroup Cayman Islands account.\n  Again, this does not pass the laugh test. President Obama and \nChairman Baucus have highlighted Ugland House as a problem over a long \nperiod of years. When Mr. Lew was at Citigroup for years he signed \ndocuments which disclosed the fact that he was investing money in the \nCayman Islands.\n  This is his distinctive signature, right here; the Ugland House \ndescription here, and the Grand Cayman name here. It is very obvious \nthis signature doesn't belong to anybody else. It has been highlighted, \nand there have been a lot of newspaper articles about it. How are we \ngoing to have that signature on the dollar bill if he gets to be \nSecretary of Treasury?\n  So everybody knows to whom that belongs. Yet with all this \ninformation, he is telling the committee he doesn't know anything about \nthe Cayman Islands or where his money was going.\n  We have so many more questions for Mr. Lew.\n  This is what the Wall Street Journal said last week in reference to \nMr. Lew's past:\n\n       Investor in Cayman Islands tax haven? Check. Recipient of a \n     bonus and corporate jet rides underwritten by taxpayers at a \n     bailed-out bank? Check. Executive at a university that \n     accepted student-loan kickbacks toward a favored bank? Check. \n     Excessive compensation with minimal disclosure? Check.\n\n  Mr. Lew's eagerness and skill in obtaining bonuses, severance \npayments, housing allowances, and other perks raise very serious \nquestions about whether he appreciates who pays the bills. How will he \napproach the burden on taxpayers to pay the government's bills? Will he \nact as cavalierly toward the taxpayers as Treasury Secretary as he did \nat Citigroup and New York University?\n  But despite all these questions, we are right now, this very day, \nrushing ahead to a vote on this nomination. Clearly, these questions \ndon't matter to Mr. Lew's supporters because they are confident they \nhave the votes. Unfortunately, they even have some assistance from my \nside of the aisle. But transparency and sunlight are essential for \nCongress and for the American people because with transparency and \nsunlight comes accountability.\n  Those supporting Mr. Lew today better not expect any real answers out \nof him in the future if he will not answer these questions before \nconfirmation. Whether we serve on the Finance Committee or on any other \ncommittee, we must do our constitutional job of oversight. We pass laws \nand we appropriate money and so we have a responsibility as Senators to \nmake sure the laws are faithfully executed, which means we have to get \nanswers from Cabinet people or people generally in the executive branch \nof government. If there are questions about the seriousness of \nfaithfully executing the laws, faithfully spending the money we \nappropriate, we must ask questions. Do you think we will get answers \nfrom Mr. Lew after he becomes Secretary of the Treasury if he will not \nanswer questions before his confirmation?\n  The larger problem, though, may be that when Mr. Lew actually does \ntry to answer a question, he confirms our concerns. For example, when \nMr. Lew was caught with the Cayman Islands bank account, he said: Well, \nI didn't make any money. Apparently, there is now a brandnew standard. \nIt is OK to invest in ``the largest tax scam in the world''--and those \nare the President's words about the Cayman Islands and Ugland House, \nthe largest tax scam in the world--so long as you don't make any money. \nThat is the new standard.\n  When Mr. Lew was asked about New York University's investment in \nCayman Island investments, again he could not recall them. Mr. Lew \nreceived over $1.2 million in his final year at New York University. He \nwas hired specifically to run the business side of New York University. \nYet despite all this, he claims he had no specific knowledge of where \nNYU's money was being invested.\n  When I asked Mr. Lew if he could explain morally his decision to take \nalmost $1 million from an insolvent company supported by taxpayers, he \ncould not answer. He said this to me: ``I will leave it to others to \njudge.'' Mr. Lew refused to explain why he thought the bonus was \njustified. Since Mr. Lew could not answer that question, today I answer \nit for my colleagues, as they consider a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on this \nnomination.\n  It is important we hold members of this administration equal to the \nstandards they set for everyone else. When it comes to oversight, I \ndon't think anybody is going to question this Senator is an equal \nopportunity overseer, because I raise these same questions about \noversight whether we have a Republican administration or a Democratic \nadministration. I believe it is important to hold members of this \nadministration equal to the standard they set for everyone else.\n  Let's look at that standard. In the past, the President has railed \nagainst\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\nthe ``fat cats'' on Wall Street. Today, the President nominates a man \nwho took a bonus from a bailed-out, financially insolvent bank. The \nPresident has constantly complained about the high cost of college \ntuition. While Mr. Lew was at NYU, the university increased tuition \nnearly 40 percent while he was getting paid more than the New York \nUniversity president.\n  In the not-so-distant past, the President has called the Ugland House \n``the biggest tax scam in the world.'' Today, he nominates a man who \ninvested there. In fact, the President has repeatedly railed against \nthe Cayman Islands and Cayman Islands investments.\n  Mr. Lew is a serial Cayman Islands investor. On his watch, Citigroup \ninvested money there, New York University invested money there, and he \ninvested his own money there.\n  I believe it is essential to hold everyone to the same standards they \nset for others. For these reasons, I vote NO on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we review the Lew nomination--I think \nall of us should ask a number of questions about any nominee. One of \nthem deals with their professional competence, their proven integrity, \nand their good judgment.\n  Senator Grassley has invested a good deal of time working on and \nunderstanding some of the things that happened when Mr. Lew was at \nCitigroup, the bank that apparently had the largest losses of any of \nthe Wall Street banks, and it was not a good tenure there. He was a \nfinancial adviser; and it shows that, to the extent he has had any real \nbanking experience, his experience has proven not to be successful. It \nis like the football player who might have played some games but he \nlost.\n  In early 2008, Mr. Lew became a top executive in the Citigroup \nAlternative Investment Unit, which houses hedge funds and private \nequity investments. News reports indicate that massive losses in this \ndepartment played a role in leading to a Federal bailout of Citigroup--\nhis department.\n  One troubling aspect of Mr. Lew's department was that he was betting \nagainst the taxpayers. That is what the experts conclude: Citigroup, \nunder Mr. Lew's leadership, was betting on the collapse of the housing \nmarket.\n  Simon Johnson, an economist at MIT and a liberal, testified before \nour Budget Committee and said this about the crisis:\n\n       This mismanagement of risk was comprehensive in that \n     organization.\n\n  He was talking about Citigroup, their mismanagement of risk was \ncomprehensive. On January 16, 2009, Citigroup announced a loss of $18.7 \nbillion, the same day that taxpayers bailed out Citigroup with $301 \nbillion in loan guarantees. What a dramatic event that is, and was.\n  Mr. Lew's previous experience as an adviser at Citigroup provides a \npretty good indication that he was in the wrong place and didn't \nperform well under these circumstances.\n  The day before the taxpayers came to Citigroup's rescue, Mr. Lew \nreceived a bonus. The President has been vigorous in attacking those \nwho received Wall Street bonuses. He said it was wrong and it shouldn't \nhappen. And in this case, he is exactly right: Mr. Lew should not have \ngotten this bonus. But it doesn't seem to bother the President to \npromote this man to Secretary of Treasury.\n  Here is what happened: Mr. Lew received a bonus, for the \nmismanagement that occurred there, in an amount exceeding $940,000. \nAlmost a $1 million bonus. How many people do you know who get a $1 \nmillion bonus? The bonus was in addition to the $1.1 million salary he \nwas paid for his work at Citigroup.\n  One news account of this event, citing that Securities and Exchange \nCommission filing, states this:\n\n       His unit lost billions of dollars in 2008 as its bets \n     turned sour. In the first quarter of 2008 alone, the unit \n     lost $509 million. The company stopped publicly disclosing \n     the unit's individual numbers thereafter, but the part of the \n     company that absorbed alternative investments lost $20.1 \n     billion in 2008.\n\n  We should be concerned about Mr. Lew assuming the role as America's \ntop financial adviser and economic advocate. He has told us to be \nconcerned about this, if we would listen to him. During his \nconfirmation hearings before the Budget Committee in 2010 to be \nDirector of Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Lew was asked his \nviews on the Wall Street financial collapse which he was smack dab in \nthe middle of. What did he say about that?\n  Well, he said, Senator, when we discussed it, I mentioned to you I do \nnot consider myself an expert on some of these aspects of the financial \nindustry. My experience in the financial industry had been as a \nmanager, not as an investment adviser. I would defer to others who were \nmore expert in the industry and parse it better than that.\n  In other words, he disclaimed any real knowledge of the business. If \nso, how did he get the No. 1 job? Was it because of his political \nconnections to the Clinton administration? And when he got a bonus to \nleave Citigroup, he only got that bonus if he was going to the Federal \nGovernment--the kind of crony capitalism that Larry Kudlow has so \nraised questions about.\n  Mr. Kudlow's question: Why did Citigroup allow him to have a bonus \nwhen he departed the bank, when he led one of the worst divisions in \nthe history of any banking department--any bank, ever--and he only got \nthat if he was going to work for the government?\n  And Mr. Kudlow knows Wall Street. He knows people all through Wall \nStreet. You have seen him on television nightly. He was an economist \nfor the Federal Reserve, an economist for the chief economist for the \nSenate Budget Committee at one time, and worked for the Office of \nManagement and Budget. He raises the question of crony capitalism. Why?\n  Maybe Citibank, and the Wall Street financial community in desperate \nstraits, thought: Wouldn't it be nice to have our guy move over to the \nWhite House, be right in the President's office and be Director of \nOffice of Management and Budget? We are glad to see him go over there \nand we are glad to pay him $1 million. Maybe he will take our phone \ncalls.\n\n  That is what Mr. Kudlow was talking about. And the Wall Street \nJournal--the Wall Street Journal believes in a free market. They are \nnot opposed to people making a bonus. The Wall Street Journal sensed in \nhis maneuverings an unhealthy crony capitalism deal, where people move \nback and forth from businesses and they use their government \nconnections to advantage the business they left or they might return \nto. It is unhealthy. It is not free market capitalism; it is crony \ncapitalism. It is not good.\n  The President was against all these bonuses and he is against a lot \nof this, and we are going to have an open administration, but he \ndoesn't seem to worry about that.\n  So, such experience as Mr. Lew had demonstrates a lack of financial \nsuccess, dramatic failures, in effect, $20 billion in losses in 2008 \nalone; but yet he got a $1 million bonus.\n  There is another matter of great importance. I remember when it \nhappened. Judd Gregg from New Hampshire, former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, former ranking member of the Budget Committee--long-time \nmember of that committee--worried about the future debt and \nunsustainable financial path of America and came up with an idea. In \n2003, he proposed legislation, which was enacted, that placed a legal \nrequirement that the President of the United States submit legislation \nif Medicare trustees--the people who run the Medicare Program--issue a \nfunding warning for the program as part of their annual report. If \nAmerica's trustees see they are on a funding path that is unsustainable \nand dangerous for Medicare, they shall formally notify the President of \nthe United States. This would require the President to analyze the \nproblem and submit legislation to Congress to see if we can't put \nMedicare on a sound path.\n  That is a simple event. Shouldn't we thank Judd Gregg for that? This \nprovision has been commonly referred to as the Medicare trigger, and it \nis intended to ensure that steps are taken to shore\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nup the program's finances before it is too late.\n  President Bush was the first one to receive that warning when he was \nin office, and he submitted legislation to deal with the Medicare \ncrisis. He complied with the law.\n  The law states this:\n\n       If there is a Medicare funding warning made in a year . . . \n     the President shall submit to Congress, within the 15-day \n     period beginning on the date of the budget submission to \n     Congress under subsection (a) for the succeeding year, \n     proposed legislation to respond to such warning.\n\n  This is in the United States Code. When I say it is in law, it is in \nthe United States Code. It requires that to occur. And it makes ever so \nmuch sense, does it not? Shouldn't we be worried about a program as \nimportant to Americans as Medicare? Shouldn't we be honestly dealing \nwith it? Wouldn't Congress want to know what the President's plan is to \nfix it? He doesn't get to dictate that, but he gets an opportunity to \nlay out a vision to how to place it on a sound path.\n  Why wouldn't he want to do that? What objection should he ever have \nto that? He ``shall'' submit this, according to the law. President Bush \ndid. But by contrast 2012--last year--marked the fourth consecutive \nyear the Obama administration failed to submit such a legislative \nproposal despite the clear and unambiguous legal obligation to do so.\n  They say: We think we offered something with our Patient Protection \nAct--ObamaCare--and we do not have to do it.\n  They don't get to decide. The question is Medicare trustees--they \nsaid the warning is in effect. They sent the notice to the White House. \nAnd this is when the President's action is triggered. Mr. Lew, if he is \nconfirmed, will be chairman of the Medicare trustees, as Secretary of \nTreasury of the United States. That is one of his top responsibilities.\n  So for 2 of those 4 years, 2010 through 2011, Jack Lew was the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. He also served in that \noffice in part of 2012. As Director, he was the person responsible for \ndrafting and submitting fiscal proposals and complying with budget law \nunder 31 U.S. Code, section 1105. That is his duty, legally.\n  The House and Senate Budget Committees as well as a strong majority \nof the Senate Republican conference have written letters asking the \nObama administration to respond to the Medicare trigger, the Medicare \nwarning, and submit legislation to Congress dealing with Medicare's \nfunding shortfall, as the law requires. But to this day they have not \ncomplied, just refused, just as the Senate majority here refused to \nproduce a budget in 4 years even though the U.S. Code calls for a \nbudget to be submitted.\n  Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Medicare Actuary, who is a person who is \nreally good with the numbers on Medicare and has great respect in the \nCongress, projects that on its current course, Medicare faces a $36.9 \ntrillion unfunded obligation over a 75-year period. Yet the President's \nmost recent budget submission would actually increase Medicare spending \nrelative to the current law, putting the program in an even more \nunsustainable position.\n  Yesterday I joined with Senator Cornyn and 20 other Republican \nSenators in sending another letter to the President on this matter. We \nwrote this:\n\n       During his testimony before the Finance Committee, Mr. Lew \n     was asked about your administration's failure to abide by \n     federal law while he served as OMB Director. Mr. Lew stated \n     that the decision not to comply with the law was made prior \n     to his service at OMB. We find it stunning and noteworthy \n     that so far Mr. Lew has not provided adequate responses to \n     congressional inquiries on the matter. Congress needs a \n     clearer understanding about his role in the violation of this \n     law, including exactly when Mr. Lew became aware of this \n     legal requirement and what counsel, if any, he provided the \n     Administration on whether it should comply with the law.\n\n  That is what was written, and of course they have not responded. I \nsuspect they have no intention of responding. They have not responded \nbefore. I ask, should we not consider this before we advance him from \nthe position of chief of staff to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees \nof Medicare, who has a duty to protect the program? And he will not \neven respond to the legal mandate that they lay out a proposal to fix \nMedicare when it is in a dangerous, unsustainable path, as it is today.\n  There are other matters I would mention, but I see my good colleague \nSenator Sanders here.\n  I will be pleased to yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from Alabama for yielding. I also \nintend to vote against Jack Lew to be our next Secretary of the \nTreasury but, in fact, for very different reasons than my colleague \nfrom Alabama.\n  Let me begin by stating that I have had the opportunity to speak with \nJack Lew in my office on several occasions. It is very clear to me that \nJack Lew is a very intelligent person. He is a very serious man. I \napplaud his many years of public service to our country. Furthermore, I \nbelieve that this afternoon he will be confirmed by the Senate. But I \nhave to say that he will not be confirmed with my vote. The reason for \nthat is that at this particular moment in American history, we find \nourselves in the most difficult economic moment since the Great \nDepression.\n  The reality is--and we do not talk about it too much, the media \ndoesn't talk about it too much, but most people understand--the great \nmiddle class of this country is disappearing. Poverty is \nextraordinarily high. Over 46 million Americans are living in poverty. \nAt the same time, while the middle class collapses and poverty is \nextraordinarily high, the wealthiest people in this country are doing \nphenomenally well and we are seeing recordbreaking profits for large \ncorporations.\n  The question is--given the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury is \none of the most important positions in our Government, having enormous \npowers unto himself in addition to being a key adviser to the \nPresident, the question is, Is the new Secretary of Treasury prepared \nto take on the increasingly powerful oligarchy that controls the \neconomic and political life of our Nation and stand with the working \nfamilies of America who are being battered and beaten up every single \nday? I do not believe by any stretch of the imagination that Jack Lew \nis that person.\n  This is the economic reality we are confronting today, and this is \nthe economic reality we need a Secretary of Treasury to work with the \nAmerican people to improve. We have the most unequal distribution of \nwealth and income of any major country on Earth, worse than at any time \nsince before the Great Depression. Today the wealthiest 400 Americans \nown more wealth than the bottom half of America--150 million people. \nFour hundred to 150 million. Do I believe Jack Lew sees this as a \nserious problem he is going to address? I do not.\n  Today one family, the Walton family--one of the major welfare \nbeneficiaries in America because they pay their workers such low wages \nand provide such poor benefits that many of their workers are on \nMedicaid, food stamps, assisted housing--that one family owns more \nwealth than the bottom 40 percent of American families. Do I believe \nJack Lew is going to say: Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense, we \nhave to change those policies. No, I do not.\n  Today the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the wealth in America, \nwhich is incredible unto itself. But even more incredible is that the \nbottom 60 percent own less than 3 percent of the Nation's wealth. This \nis not only a moral issue, it is not only an economic issue because \nwhen you have that kind of wealth and income disparity, \nworking families are not going to have the money to spend to buy goods \nand services to create jobs, it is also a political crisis because as a \nresult of Citizens United, this 1 percent can now spend unlimited sums \nof money to elect those candidates who support their agenda and to \ncreate terror on the floor of the Senate on the part of any Member who \nis going to vote against their interests. Gee, should I vote to deal \nwith the greed on Wall Street if Wall Street is going to pour millions \nof dollars against me in my reelection campaign?\n\n  Do I believe Jack Lew as Secretary of Treasury is going to begin to \naddress the issues of income inequality and wealth inequality in this \ncountry? Not for a second do I believe he will do that.\n  While the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, the Federal \nReserve reported last year that median\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nnet worth for middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from \n2007 to 2010. Can you believe that? It dropped by 40 percent. That is \nthe equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average \nmiddle-class family.\n  This is even more incredible, and it is absolutely important. I get \ntired of being one of the very few people up here who talk about it. I \nhope there will be some other Senators who will talk about what is, in \nfact, one of the major issues facing this country--income and wealth \ninequality.\n  In terms of income, here is a fact that is literally beyond \ncomprehension. The last study on this subject showed that from 2009 \nthrough 2011, 100 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. \nAll of the new income generated went to the top 1 percent, while the \nbottom 99 percent--those include some pretty wealthy people--actually \nsaw a loss in their income. What that tells us is that it almost \ndoesn't matter that economic growth now is obviously low. It is not as \nhigh as we want it, but it almost doesn't matter because all of the new \nincome generated by this economic growth is going to go to the top 1 \npercent. Do I think this is an issue Jack Lew is going to address? No, \nunfortunately, I do not.\n  Real unemployment in this country is not what the papers report--7.8 \nor 7.9 percent. Real unemployment is over 14 percent if we count those \npeople who have given up looking for work or who are working part time \nwhen they want to work full time--some 23 million people. Have I heard \none word from Jack Lew about the need to come up with programs to put \nmillions of people back to work immediately, including the young people \nwhose unemployment rate is higher than that of the general public or \npeople of color who are also economically suffering? I have not.\n  Millions of people are still underwater on their mortgages, and \nmillions more have seen the American dream of home ownership turn into \na nightmare of foreclosure.\n  The next Secretary of Treasury will be facing enormous challenges. \nLet me mention just a few. The next Secretary of Treasury will play a \ncentral role in regulating and overseeing Wall Street and large \nfinancial institutions. Let's never forget that as a result of the \ngreed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of \nAmericans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings, and their \nability to send their kids to college. That is all attributable to the \ngreed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.\n  We need a Secretary of Treasury who does not come from Wall Street \nbut is prepared to stand up to the enormous power of Wall Street. We \nneed a Treasury Secretary who will end the current business model of \nWall Street, which is operating the largest gambling casino this world \nhas ever seen, and demand that Wall Street start investing in a \nproductive economy where businesses actually produce real goods and \nservices and create jobs. Do I believe Jack Lew is going to be doing \nthat? No, I do not.\n  In my view, we need a Secretary of the Treasury who will understand \nthat when the largest banks in this country have become even larger, it \nis time to break them up. Do I believe Jack Lew will work to break up \nthese huge financial conglomerates? No, I do not.\n  Today the 10 largest banks in America are bigger than they were \nbefore the financial crisis began. You may remember that we bailed out \nWall Street because they were too big to fail; that if these banks went \nunder, they would take a significant part of the American and world \neconomies with them and the taxpayers of this country had to bail them \nout. Now we find that every single one of the top 10 financial \ninstitutions today is larger than they were when we bailed them out \nsome years ago because they were too big to fail.\n\n  Today the six largest financial institutions in this country--\nJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, \nand MetLife--have assets equal to two-thirds of the GDP of this \ncountry--over $9.6 trillion. Six financial institutions have assets \nequal to two-thirds of the GDP of the United States of America. These \nsix financial institutions issue two-thirds of all of the credit cards, \nhalf of all of the mortgages, control 95 percent of all derivatives, \nand hold nearly 40 percent of all bank deposits in this country.\n  Do I think this issue--this concern--is something Jack Lew will \naddress? Not in a million years. While millions of Americans continue \nto struggle through the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, Wall \nStreet is doing phenomenally well today. They caused the recession, we \nbailed them out, and now they are doing phenomenally well. Financial \ninstitutions made over $143 billion in profits in 2012. It was the most \nprofitable year on record with the exception of 2006, just before the \neconomic meltdown. Incredibly, the financial industry now makes almost \nhalf of all nonfarm corporate profits in the United States--up from \nabout 10 percent in 1947.\n  As someone who has worked hard to elect Barack Obama on two \noccasions, I remain extremely concerned that virtually all of his key \neconomic advisers have come from Wall Street, and Jack Lew is no \nexception to that.\n  Let me be clear. It is not just because Mr. Lew served as a chief \noperating officer at Citigroup during the financial crisis; it is not \njust because Citigroup awarded Mr. Lew a $940,000 bonus as he was \nleaving to join the State Department; it is not just because Citigroup \nreceived a total of $2.5 trillion in virtually zero-interest loans from \nthe Fed or that the Treasury Department provided Citigroup with a \nbailout of more than $45 billion during Mr. Lew's tenure at Citigroup; \nI am opposed to Mr. Lew's nomination because of the views he now holds \nabout Wall Street and the financial bailout.\n  On September 22, 2010, when I asked Mr. Lew at a Budget Committee \nhearing if he believed deregulation of Wall Street significantly caused \nthe crisis--something that almost all economists agree with--here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       I don't believe that deregulation was the proximate cause. \n     I would defer to others who are more expert about the \n     industry to parse it better than that.\n\n  At his confirmation hearing at the end of this month, Jack Lew called \nthe Glass-Steagall Act ``anachronistic,'' and said that the Dodd-Frank \nAct had ``effectively'' dealt with the issue of too big to fail. I \ncould not disagree more.\n  In my view, we don't need another Treasury Secretary who thinks that \nthe deregulation of Wall Street did not significantly contribute to the \nfinancial crisis. We need someone who will stand up to these huge \nfinancial institutions on behalf of the American people, small \nbusinesses, and working families and say enough is enough: Wall Street, \nyou cannot continue to operate the way you are.\n  The next Treasury Secretary will be the lead negotiator for the \nPresident on how to reduce the deficit, an issue we are all concerned \nabout. Here is the issue: Do we balance the budget by cutting Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition, and programs that \nmiddle-income and working families depend upon? We could do it that \nway. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, will come up \nwith that proposal, and it will mean huge suffering for tens and tens \nof millions of families who are already hurting. That is one way we \ncould do deficit reduction.\n  First of all, I think that approach is way out of touch with what the \nAmerican people want. The American people have been very clear: They do \nnot want cuts in Social Security, they do not want to cut veterans \nprograms, and they do not want to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\n  The American people have also been clear that at a time when the \nwealthiest people and largest corporations are doing phenomenally well, \nwhen their effective tax rates are the lowest in decades, when they \nenjoy huge loopholes that enable them to avoid paying their vast share \nin taxes, the American people say: Those guys have got to start paying \ntheir fair share.\n  All of us will remember a few years ago when Wall Street was on the \nverge of collapse because of their greed and recklessness. They came \ncrawling to the Congress and the taxpayers of America and said: We are \nAmericans; we love America; bail us out. Congress--against my vote--\nbailed them out.\n  Now these same corporations that told us how much they love America \nare not only shipping our jobs to China and other countries, they are \nstashing their profits in the Cayman Islands,\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nBermuda, and other tax havens and avoiding their responsibility as \ntaxpayers. Offshore tax schemes have become so absurd that one five-\nstory office building in the Cayman Islands is now the home to more \nthan 18,000 corporations. Everybody knows what that is about. All that \nis is a mail drop for corporations. They don't exist there; they are \njust using that address as a means to avoid paying taxes to the United \nStates and other countries.\n  Let me give a few examples of some of these large corporations and \nwhat they have done to avoid paying American taxes at a time when \nrevenue today, as a percentage of GDP, is almost at the lowest it has \nbeen in decades. The choice is to cut Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid, or ask enormously profitable corporations to stop using \nloopholes to avoid paying taxes. I will give just a few examples, \nalthough I could give many examples.\n  In 2010, the Bank of America--one of the largest financial \ninstitutions in this country, an institution bailed out by the working \nfamilies of this country when they were on the verge of collapse--set \nup more than 200 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, which, by the way, \nhas a corporate tax rate of zero, so they can avoid paying U.S. taxes. \nHow is that? We bail them out, they run to the Cayman Islands, set up \n200 separate subsidiaries in order to avoid paying taxes to America. It \nis time for Congress and it is time for the Secretary of Treasury to \naddress that issue. In a million years do I think Jack Lew is prepared \nto do that? No, I don't. We need a Secretary of Treasury who will do \nthat.\n  Not only did the Bank of America pay nothing in Federal income taxes, \nbut in 2010 it received a rebate from the IRS worth $1.9 billion that \nyear. They pay nothing in taxes, they are enormously profitable, they \nwere bailed out by the American people, and then they get a rebate from \nthe IRS for almost $2 billion. Then people say: We don't have enough \nrevenue; we have to cut Social Security; we have to cut nutrition \nprograms for hungry children. Yet when one of the largest financial \ninstitutions in the country gets a rebate and doesn't pay any taxes, at \nleast for some of my colleagues, that is okay.\n\n  In 2010, JPMorgan Chase operated 83 separate subsidiaries \nincorporated in offshore tax havens to avoid paying some $4.9 billion \nin U.S. taxes. That same year Goldman Sachs operated 39 subsidiaries in \noffshore tax havens to avoid an estimated $3.3 billion in U.S. taxes. \nCitigroup--where Mr. Lew actually worked--has paid no Federal income \ntaxes for the last 4 years after establishing 25 subsidiaries in \noffshore tax havens. On and on it goes.\n  Wall Street, which was bailed out by the American workers, caused the \nrecession, is now enormously profitable. Its CEOs get huge compensation \npackages, but when it comes to paying their taxes, suddenly they love \nthe Cayman Islands. My suggestion is that the next time these crooks \ndestroy their banks and need to be bailed out, let them go to the \nGovernment of the Cayman Islands to get their bailout and not the \ntaxpayers of the United States of America.\n  Let me conclude by talking about trade for a moment because the \nSecretary of the Treasury gets involved heavily in trade issues. Trade \nis not a sexy issue, but it is an enormously important issue. I think \nit is important for all of us to understand that our current, \nunfettered, free-trade policy has been an unmitigated disaster for the \nworking people of this country. Last year our trade deficit was more \nthan $540 billion. Permanent normal trade relations with China--\nremember when that came up? Oh, my goodness, we are going to open up \nthe Chinese market, we are going to create all kinds of jobs in the \nUnited States, we are going to sell all of our products to the large \npopulation in China. Well, not quite. Not quite. PNTR with China led to \nthe loss of nearly 3 million American jobs, and the NAFTA agreement led \nto the loss of nearly 1 million American jobs as large multinationals \ncontinue to throw American workers out on the street and move to China, \nMexico, and other countries where workers are paid pennies an hour.\n  In 2008, I supported then-Senator Barack Obama when he told the AFL-\nCIO in Philadelphia the following:\n\n       What I refuse to accept is that we have to sign trade deals \n     like the South Korea Agreement that are bad for workers. What \n     I oppose--and what I have always opposed--are trade deals \n     that put the interest of multinational corporations ahead of \n     the interests of American workers--like NAFTA, and CAFTA, and \n     permanent normal trade relations with China. And I'll also \n     oppose the Colombia Free Trade Agreement if President Bush \n     insists on sending it to Congress because the violence \n     against unions in Colombia would make a mockery of the very \n     labor protections that we have insisted be included in these \n     kind of agreements. So you can trust me when I say that \n     whatever trade deals we negotiate when I'm President will be \n     good for American workers, and they'll have strong labor and \n     environmental protections that we'll enforce.\n\n  That was Barack Obama, candidate for President in 2008. \nUnfortunately, President Obama signed those bad trade deals into law \nwhile Mr. Lew was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \nAs a result, more American jobs have been lost and our trade deficits \nfor all of those countries have gone up. In my view, we need a \nSecretary of Treasury who will work to fundamentally rewrite our trade \npolicies to ensure that American jobs are no longer our No. 1 export. \nDo I believe Jack Lew will be that person? Not a chance.\n  I will conclude by simply saying this: This country faces the most \ndifficult economic times since the Great Depression. Tens of millions \nof working families, seniors, and children are struggling every single \nday to keep their heads above water while the wealthiest people are \ndoing phenomenally well and large multinational corporations are \nenjoying record-breaking profits.\n  Because of all the money Wall Street and these large profitable \ncorporations have, they are investing in the political process, putting \nin huge amounts of money--hundreds and hundreds of millions of \ndollars--to elect candidates who will represent their interests and not \nthe interests of the average American.\n  Now is the time to have people in the Obama administration who are \ngoing to stand with the American people, stand with workers, stand with \nseniors, and have the courage to take on the big money interests that \nare causing so many problems for our Nation. In my view, Jack Lew is \nnot that person and I will vote against him becoming our next Secretary \nof Treasury.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will just say that I share some of the \nviews of Senator Sanders. I believe he said we need to stand up to the \noligarchy that controls our economy and is involved in depressing \nwages. I would say most businesses like to pay their employees all they \ncan, but it is better to not pay them more and they look for good \nworkers at lower wages and that is the way they work and that is their \ninterest. We can't look at the big corporations for objective analysis \non how to create an economy that serves working Americans. If one \nthinks that, one is not truly a free market person as I like to see \nmyself. I guess Senator Sanders sees more of a government-dominated \neconomy and would have the same skepticism about how it works.\n  So I think we do need to ask ourselves a good deal about what is \nhappening when working Americans have not seen their wages increase. \nTheir wage increases, if at all, have been short of inflation. This has \ngone on for a decade and something is unhealthy and we need to do \nbetter. Mr. Lew did come from that crowd and, apparently, for what he \nknows about it is a part of it, and I think skepticism is certainly \nwarranted, as I have indicated.\n  I believe unemployment is high, and higher than people think, and we \nneed to work together. Senator Sanders talks about trade deals. The \nPresiding Officer and I have worked together. We got a bipartisan piece \nof legislation passed that tried to equalize currency differences \nbetween the United States and China which would begin to level the \nplaying field rather significantly in favor of American workers who are \nnow being unfairly competed against via currency manipulation by China. \nThat has to be confronted, and I am prepared to do that.\n  I also hope my colleagues will give some thought to the problem of \nimmigration. There is no doubt that large amounts of immigration, low-\nskilled, medium-skilled workers pull down the\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nwages of American working people. So we need to have an honest, \neffective, lawful system of immigration that serves the American \ninterests as a whole and part of that is to ask ourselves: Is it \npulling wages down? In one sense, I would say immigration is the other \nside of the coin of trade. It is one thing to take a plant and move it \nto a country and place it down and they work for less; it is another \nthing to bring the workers from that same country to the United States \nto work for less, and then the manufacturer may not be hiring American \npeople, may not be able to do so at wages they would need to work. So I \nwould just make that point.\n  With regard to Mr. Lew, he has made a number of very serious false \nrepresentations. I am going to put this up one more time. These are \nwords that should live in infamy. They should be an example to anyone \nin the future who thinks they can come before the Congress and make \nfalse representations or make them to the American people. The budget \nMr. Lew produced as Office of Management and Budget Director in 2011--\nhe brought it out in February. The day before he produced it, he made \nthis statement on CNN. He also made similar statements on other \ntelevision programs that Sunday morning. The budget was officially to \nbe produced on Monday. This is what he said:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down our national debt.\n\n  That was Candy Crowley on CNN that morning. Was that true? Should we \nconsider a man to be Secretary of Treasury, an august position that \nrequires great credibility and integrity, knowledge about how to manage \na government and a business and the world economy, if he is not correct \non that?\n  I have asked my colleagues throughout the day: Does anybody defend \nthis? Will anybody come forward and say this is an honest statement of \nthe condition of America at this time when he made that statement, that \nwe are not going to be adding to the debt anymore?\n  When Mr. Lew submitted that budget the next morning, Monday morning, \nhe made press statements, but he submitted a stack of documents that \ncame with the budget; it was 6 to 8 inches high, and it had tables and \naccounting from his office. They are his numbers from the Office of \nManagement and Budget where he was a Director. Those numbers show this: \nThey show that there was never a single year in 10 years in which there \nwas a budget surplus. The lowest single deficit in that 10-year period \nwas $600 billion, in 1 year; the lowest, $600 billion. The highest \ndeficit President Bush had in his whole 8 years was under $500 billion. \nThis is the lowest in 10. The 5 years, according to his own numbers, \nthe deficits went up to $740 billion, $750 billion in the 10th year, \ngoing up. Truthfully, they were going up even more so in the next 10 \nyears.\n  The Congressional Budget Office came in and they analyzed the same \nnumbers and they take assumptions and policies. They use the same \nframework and the same policies, but they traditionally make more \nrealistic assumptions. They concluded that in the 10th year, the \ndeficit wouldn't be $744 billion but 1,200 billion, 1.2 trillion. They \nsay Mr. Lew's assumptions were too rosy. He projected more growth than \nwas likely to occur and got better numbers than were likely to occur.\n\n  But, regardless, I am not basing my complaint on the fact he had too \nrosy a scenario; I am basing my concern on the fact that Mr. Lew \nmisstated what was in his own report, even his rosy numbers. How can he \nsay we are spending only money we have each year, when the lowest \ndeficit is $600 billion?\n  He came before the Budget Committee and I asked him about it. I was \nflabbergasted. How could he say that? We looked at the budget he \nsubmitted and had a full--as much time as we liked, but the numbers \nwere clearly not sustaining what he was saying publicly. So I asked \nhim: Is it an accurate statement? Is this an accurate statement? I read \nit right back to him. This is what he said:\n\n       It's an accurate statement that our current spending will \n     not be increasing the debt.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We have stopped spending money we don't have.\n\n  I would just say if we are going to have a compromise around here, if \nwe are going to discuss rationally how to get this country on a sound \npath, we can't have the budget director saying basically he has a \nsurplus when he doesn't come close to having a surplus. Erskine Bowles, \nthe man President Obama appointed to head the debt commission, said a \nfew days after this, I think the 13th or the 14th: This budget goes \nnowhere close to where they will have to go to avoid a fiscal \nnightmare. That is President Obama's expert who spent a year heading, \ncochairing the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission--nowhere near. Yet \nwhat did Mr. Lew say about it? Don't worry, American people. You don't \nhave to tighten your belt. No agencies have to make cuts. If those mean \nRepublicans make any suggestions of reducing spending, we will just \nattack them because they are hurting old people, children, schools, and \nso forth.\n  That is the game that was played. I don't appreciate it. It is not \nright. We do not need to have high-ranking officials coming before this \ngovernment misrepresenting the most fundamental facts about our future \non the most critical issue of our time.\n  Admiral Mullen said the debt is the greatest threat to this Nation's \nnational security. If the Office of Management and Budget Director \ncan't tell the truth, he doesn't need to be promoted to be the \nSecretary of Treasury, one of the great Cabinet positions in the United \nStates; the top, primary economic position in our country--and the \nworld, for that matter.\n  What does this prove? It proves he has a political staff mentality, \nnot an august, independent personality of leadership. I hate to say \nthat. I don't know Mr. Lew personally. I have met him, but that is \nabout it. I haven't been involved in these negotiations where he has \nbeen the ``heavy'' according to Mr. Bob Woodward in his book, and the \npeople who were in there whom he obstructed and refused to allow \ncompromises to go forward. He was the point man for the failure of the \ndiscussions that had been going on for several years between the White \nHouse and the Congress to try to reach a plan that would put America on \na sound course.\n  What is particularly amazing is that at the same time he was \nannouncing the President's budget--later on that year Congressman Ryan \nand the House Republicans passed a 10-year budget that would change the \ndebt course of America, tighten spending across the board, alter tax \nrates in a way to create economic growth, reduce the deficit \ndramatically, and put us on a sustainable, long-term path. I wouldn't \nagree with everything in it, but it was a very solid effort. Erskine \nBowles praised the effort. Alice Rivlin, President Clinton's OMB \nDirector, also complimented the effort. But President Obama and Jack \nLew trashed it and politically spent 2 years campaigning against it \nwhile the Members of this body refused to bring forth a budget at all--\nnot the Senate Democrats, oh no. Senator Reid said it would be foolish \nfor us to bring forth a budget. Today marks the 1,400th day since this \nbody has passed a budget. Passing a budget in the Congress is required \nby the United States Code. Unfortunately, it does not put people in \njail if they do not do their duty. But it is in there, and it was not \ndone.\n\n  So Mr. Lew has been very loose, made statements that are not \njustifiable. They are just not justifiable.\n  For example, on February 15--2 days after this--being interviewed by \nNational Public Radio, he said:\n\n       If we're able to reduce the deficit to the point where we \n     can pay for our spending and invest in the future, that is an \n     enormous accomplishment. This budget has specific proposals \n     that would do that.\n\n  It does not. It does not bring us to the point where we can pay for \nour spending and invest in the future. We have nothing but \nunsustainable deficits each year.\n  He goes on to say, in a different CNN interview: It takes real \nactions now so that between now and five years from now, we can get our \ndeficit under control so that we can stabilize things so that we're not \nadding to the debt anymore.\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\n  Again, there is not a single year in Mr. Lew's budget that the \ndeficit was lower than $600 billion.\n  Oh, later, at ABC, he said:\n\n       This budget has a lot of pain--\n\n  It did not have much cuts, that is for sure.\n\n     [But] it does the job, it cuts the deficit in half by the end \n     of the president's first term.\n\n  Give me a break.\n  The fourth year in President Obama's term, the deficit was $1,200 \nbillion. That is what it averaged all 4 years. President Bush's average \ndeficits were probably $250 billion, $300 billion maybe. The highest he \never had was $450 billion.\n  So when he says he is going to cut the deficit in half--no, not so. \nHe did not come close to cutting the deficit in half. He went on the \nsay:\n\n       It's going to take a lot of hard work just to take us to \n     the point where we're not adding to the debt.\n\n  He did a White House blog on February 13--the same day as this:\n\n       Like every family, we have to tighten our belts--\n\n  That is true--\n\n     and live within our means while we are investing in the \n     things that we need to have a strong and secure future. . . . \n     We know that you have to stabilize where we are going before \n     you can move on and solve the rest of the problem. This \n     budget does that.\n\n  So I think those descriptions of his budget are stunningly erroneous, \nand I do not believe it was a mistake. He served in the Office of \nManagement and Budget under President Clinton. He was not the boss, but \nhe was one of the top ones. He knew the budget continued to add to the \ndebt every single year in an unprecedented and unsustainable amount.\n  He produced a budget that made no change in America's debt course of \nany significance--virtually none--and then announced it solved all our \nproblems. He basically told the American people: Well, don't you worry. \nStick with us. We have a plan. You do not have to have all those cuts. \nYou do not have to have those cuts. These people just want to get your \nmoney. Follow us. Relax. Cool it. It is OK. We have a plan. Our plan \nwill solve this problem.\n  It was not true, and I am very unhappy with that. I think we cannot \nallow that to continue.\n  He did other things. He served as one of the top people in the OMB \nduring President Clinton's term for a period of time. He knows how the \nbudget process works. He, in my opinion, was totally on board with the \nmajority leader in the Senate, Senator Reid, in his decision not to \nbring up a budget. They did this jointly. They talked about it. There \nis no doubt about that. This was all a planned strategy not to expose \nSenate Democrats to any real reduction in spending but to attack \nanybody who had the gumption to lay out a real plan that might change \nthe spending in America. That was the campaign strategy. So he worked \non that. That is where he was.\n  So we began--and I was the ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee--we had all these young Senators who got elected in 2010. \nThey wanted to be on the Budget Committee. They wanted to be involved \nin fixing this country's financial problem. They campaigned on it. They \ntalked about it all over their States. It was the most competitive \ncommittee here. We had a long list of people who wanted to get on the \ncommittee. They all could not get on. But we got some very good, \ntalented people to join the committee and we do not have a budget. We \nhave not had a budget in 1,400 days.\n  So Mr. Lew was asked: Why doesn't the Senate do a budget? Do you know \nwhat he said? This is a quote on CNN.\n\n       . . . we . . . need to be honest. You can't pass a budget \n     in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes. . . .\n\n  Yes, we do need to be honest. Let me read the quote again:\n\n       . . . we . . . need to be honest. You can't pass a budget \n     in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes. . . .\n\n  Surely, he knows we cannot filibuster a budget. Surely, he knows a \nbudget is passed by a simple majority. That is why a budget is so \nimportant. That is what the Budget Act did. It said the country needs a \nbudget. It should not be filibustered. You should be able to pass a \nbudget with 51 votes, and it cannot be filibustered. It has been that \nway since 1974. It is in the United States Code--the Budget Act.\n  He said that twice. Mr. Lew has to know better than that. Everybody \nknows that. We cannot filibuster a budget. And yet he was defending the \ninaction in the Senate and did not seem to care whether his words were \ntrue, I would suggest, and that is not good.\n  So we get into problems with integrity as it comes to spending in \nAmerica. Time and time again, we have estimates that underestimate the \ncost of a program and at the same time overestimating the revenue for \nthe program.\n  Just 2 days ago, I asked for and received--actually, 1 day ago, \nyesterday--from the Government Accountability Office an accounting of \nthe President's health care proposal. As you remember, the President \nsaid: I will not sign a bill that adds one dime to the national debt--\nnot one dime. Everybody said: How are you going to add all these people \ninto government health care and it not cost money? Oh, we are sure this \nis not going to happen. Trust us. Trust us. Do it. But we just got back \na report. They conclude that there are several parts of the bill that \nproject savings that will not occur, resulting in a shortfall of \nrevenue over the life of the bill. They indicate it would add more than \n$6.2 trillion to the primary debt of the United States. In other words, \nwith an unfunded liability of that much, it would take $6.2 trillion \nbeing deposited today and paying out over 75 years to supplement this \nprogram to keep it from failing. It will cost more than a dime. It will \ncost $6.2 trillion. It is another unsustainable program. It does not \nhave dedicated revenue. It is going to cost more than this, frankly. \nBut this is the latest report that hammers this idea that it is not.\n  So I guess what I am saying is, this is truly serious. Our total \nbudget today is less than $4 trillion. This is going to add $6 \ntrillion. Our budget this year is about $3.5 trillion. That is how much \nwe spend. We take in about $2.5 trillion. We spend $3.5 trillion. \nThirty-six percent of what we spent last year was borrowed money \nbecause we do not bring in enough money to pay for our current \nexpenses.\n  We just got a report yesterday from the Government Accountability \nOffice--an independent group that does good work--saying it is going to \nadd $6.2 trillion to the deficits. That is why we have to have \nintegrity here. This is how we go broke. This is how we are getting \nthis country in a position we do not need to be in.\n  During my remarks today, I have exhaustively documented the case \nagainst the confirmation of Mr. Lew. I do not do it for personal \nreasons. I do it simply because I think it is the right thing for our \ncountry. I have detailed his disastrous budget plans that were rebuked \nby editorial boards across this country and unanimously rejected by \nCongress. Remember, his budget was brought up in the House. It got not \na single Republican or Democratic vote. It was brought up in the \nSenate--not a single Republican or Democrat voted for the budget. What \na rejection. This is the man we are going to promote to Secretary of \nTreasury?\n  I have discussed his repeated, knowing, and deliberate false \nstatements about those budget plans--most notoriously his claim that \n``our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point \nwhere we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not \nadding to the debt anymore. . . . ''\n  I have discussed his curiously enriching time at a failed division of \nCitigroup, the bank that had the greatest difficulties, perhaps, of any \nbank, and he headed the division where some of the worst problems were. \nHe got a big bonus just about the time they got a $310 billion bailout \nloan guarantee--$310 billion.\n  As I close my remarks, I would appeal to my colleagues to oppose Mr. \nLew. I would appeal to my colleagues to defend the integrity of the \nSenate, to defend the right of our constituents to hear the truth from \ngovernment officials through CNN or whatever program they are hearing, \nand to defend the idea--the very concept--of truth itself as an \nobjective matter.\n  I would also like to place this in a wider context. Today is the \n1,400th day since Senate Democrats have passed a budget. They say we \nwill have one this year. Maybe we will. Why has this gone on so long? \nBecause they decided it would be better to offer no solution, no plan, \nto help struggling Americans and,\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\ninstead, tear down anyone who dared offer a plan to solve our Nation's \neconomic problems. This is the heart of the problem in Washington right \nnow. We have one political party that sees the budget debate as an \nexercise in political warfare, to advance power, not problem solving.\n  At the center of this strategy is the White House, and at the center \nof the White House is Mr. Lew. In his campaign for reelection, \nPresident Obama repeatedly said he had a plan to ``pay down our debt.'' \nIf he did, he never submitted it to Congress. He did not have one. He \neven ran a campaign ad, late in the campaign, saying:\n\n       I believe the only way to create an economy built to last, \n     is to strengthen the middle class--asking the wealthy to pay \n     a little more so we can pay down our debt in a balanced way. \n     So we can afford to invest--\n\n  More, I guess--\n\n     in education, manufacturing, and home-grown American energy, \n     and for good middle class jobs.\n\n  But did he have such a plan? Not Mr. Lew's plan, at that point his \nChief of Staff, supervising the OMB Director, who followed him. Again, \nthis was the strategy: offer a plan that does nothing to alter our \ndangerous debt course while pretending it does just the opposite. Then, \nonce you have done that, attack anyone who dares to propose to reduce \nthe size of the bureaucracy, attack anyone who suggests Washington is \ntoo powerful--attack, attack, attack, while never offering anything \nthat would actually work to help Americans who are struggling every \nday. After the White House budget was submitted in 2011, this budget I \nhave referred to that he announced, President Obama, if you remember, \nspoke at George Washington University in your area, with Congressman \nPaul Ryan, the House Budget chairman in attendance, sitting right \nbefore us.\n\n  Congressman Ryan, as you remember, had laid out a plan which would \nfix the financial future of America, if adopted, and put us on a sound \ncourse.\n  President Obama responded:\n\n       One vision has been championed by Republicans in the House \n     of Representatives. . . . It's a plan that aims to reduce our \n     deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. . . . But the \n     way this plan achieves [that goal] would lead to a \n     fundamentally different America than the one we've known \n     throughout most of our history. . . . This is a vision that \n     says up to 50 million Americans have to lose their health \n     insurance in order for us to reduce the deficit. And who are \n     those 50 million Americans? Many are someone's grandparents \n     who wouldn't be able to afford nursing home care without \n     Medicaid. Many are poor children. Some are middle-class \n     families who have children with autism or Down's syndrome. . \n     . . These are the Americans we'd be telling to fend for \n     themselves.\n\n  This is our level of debate in Washington: when Congressman Ryan \ndeals honestly with the challenges we face to tighten the belts across \nthe board, create mechanisms to enhance American growth and job \ncreation, this is what the President said--with him sitting right \nthere.\n  Senator Reid produces nothing, brings out no budget, because he says \nit is foolish to do so? He meant foolish politically. He didn't mean \nfoolish for America not to bring forth a budget. How could it possibly \nbe foolish for America, the United States Senate, to comply with U.S. \nlaw that says we should bring up a budget?\n  Majority Leader Reid said of one Republican reform effort that it was \n``a mean-spirited bill that would cut the heart out of the recovery \nthat we have in America today. It goes after little children, poor \nlittle boys and girls. We want them to learn to read.''\n  This is the level of debate we have in this country. This is why we \nhave a sequester that can't be fixed, this kind of ridiculous talk. \nSomebody needs to stand up and say we are tired of it.\n  My plan, my view for America, is to help poor people be prosperous, \nrise out of poverty. We don't judge that by how many checks we send \nout, how much deficit we run up, and leave our country in danger. The \nRepublicans, candidly, have not done enough to stand up to these \negregious attacks. We need to defend ourselves more effectively and \naggressively. Voting against Jack Lew would be a vote against dishonest \ntactics, misrepresentation of facts.\n  Every Republican ought to ask themselves, should I vote to advance a \nman to a top position he is not really qualified for, who is loyal to \nthe President's political agenda, and places that above telling the \ntruth?\n  The painful truth is to some extent this political strategy has been \nsuccessful up to now. President Obama and his Senate majority have \nblocked fiscal reform and continued on our path to fiscal disaster. It \nis time we pointed out that the establishment they are shielding from \ncuts, the big government apparatus they continually defend, is hurting \npeople every day. It is bloated, it is inefficient, it is duplicative, \nand fraud occurs every day.\n  Their policies, their endless support of the bureaucracy has created \npoverty, joblessness, and dependency. It has created low wages, low \ngrowth.\n  In cities such as Baltimore, Detroit, and Chicago, governed almost \nexclusively by Democrats and Democratic policy at every level, the \ngood, hard-working people are hurt every day by these leftist policies. \nThey do not work.\n  In the city of Baltimore, one in three children live in poverty. One \nin three Baltimore residents are on food stamps. Imagine that, the \ngreat city of Baltimore.\n  In Chicago, where roughly 500 homicides occurred in 2012, 51 percent \nof the city's children live in a single-parent home.\n  In Detroit, almost one in three households had not a single person \nworking at any time in the last 12 months. Almost one-third of them \nhadn't had a single person working. The city's violent crime rate is \namong the worst in the country. More than one-half of all Detroit \nchildren live in poverty.\n  This should not happen. What is the response? Borrow more money and \nsend out more checks. This is not the way to help people. These are the \nconsequences of leftist policies. We are opposed to those policies. \nThey do not work. They hurt the people, they pretend and assert that \nthey are helping.\n  We are fighting for policies that create jobs, create rising wages, \ncreate opportunity, help more people earn a good living and care for \nthemselves, be independent and prosperous and get on the road to higher \nwages, supervisory positions, health care and retirement benefits. This \ncan be possible in this country. We are trying to lift people out of \npoverty and strengthen family and community. We are trying to protect \nthe good and decent people of this country from a debt crisis.\n  Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson told us this Nation has never faced a \nmore predictable financial crisis. They said if we don't get off this \ncourse, this unsustainable path, we may have another one, and it may be \nworse than the 2007 one.\n  Where does Mr. Lew stand? Where does the White House stand? They did \neverything they could to defend the bureaucracy, no matter the cost in \nwasted dollars or lost jobs. Mr. Lew submitted an indefensible budget \nplan that would have caused further social and economic devastation. \nThey deliberately misled the Nation about that plan, deliberately \nmisled the country about it. He knew this wasn't true, and then he \nparticipated in a strategy that shot down any efforts from the \nRepublican side to reform the situation.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these tactics from the White House. I \nurge them to stand up for the good and decent people of this country \nwho work hard every day, try to do the right thing, want to get ahead, \nand want to see their wages rise instead of stagnate. I urge them to \nvote to hold high government officials accountable by putting politics \nahead of policy or sacrificing truth for political gain. I urge them to \noppose Mr. Lew.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to spend a few minutes this afternoon talking \nabout what is going to happen on March 1, something we have known is \ngoing to happen for 18 months. Nobody really wanted it to happen this \nway, but I want to make the case if we give the administration the \nflexibility, we can easily swallow $85 billion a year in reductions.\n  I am going to go through a small set of oversight reports I have \nactually done in the last year or so talking\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\nabout waste within the Federal Government.\n  We looked at the urban area security grants of the Department of \nHomeland Security. We looked at the Department of Defense, the programs \nthat were in the Department of Defense which don't have anything to do \nwith defense; that is $67 billion a year.\n  Let me say that again: $67 billion a year is spent in the Department \nof Defense which has nothing to do with defending the country.\n  We outlined the 100 most wasteful projects, we put that out in \nDecember of this year, a treasure map. We looked at the Market Access \nProgram and what it is actually doing to some of the wealthiest \nagricultural businesses in this country. It is subsidizing their export \nof sales. Money for nothing, all of the money that we spent that hadn't \nactually accomplished anything. We did a report on that.\n  Next we did a report on the subsidies for the rich and famous because \nwe do have a mixed-up Tax Code, and over $30 billion a year in benefits \ngoes to a very small number of people in this country inappropriately \nthrough our tax cuts. The discussion and disagreements we are going to \nhave on that will be about what do you do with that. Everybody agrees \nwe probably ought to fix that. Do you fix it by just raising taxes or \ndo you fix it by reforming the Tax Code and actually getting greater \ntaxes coming into the Federal Government?\n  The other point I wanted to make is there are a lot of things we may \nsequester that I have been talking about for years, which actually \nhaven't gotten any traction, but I suspect right now will be getting \nsome traction. The first one is the grant programs in the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  In one area, the Urban Area Security Initiative, which is a component \nof the Homeland Security grants, we spend $170 million a year on one \ngrant program. What we did when we looked at it is we found tremendous \namounts of waste that have nothing to do with increasing the security \nin the communities where this money was spent.\n  Let me give you a few examples: domestic drones that have limited \ncapability, can't fly over anything that is populated because they are \nnot reliable enough. Also, underwater robots, snow cone machines, \nsecurity upgrades for spring baseball training programs and stadiums, \ncolor printers, BearCat vehicles for communities of 20,000 people who \nwill never have a need for that piece of equipment. Yet we spent it \nbecause the people making those pieces of equipment are so good at \nhelping cities get grants whether they need them or not, they apply for \nthem.\n  Columbus, OH, bought an underwater robot, $98,000. They don't have a \nfacility, a true natural lake or other lake in which they could \nactually utilize this piece of equipment, but they bought it anyway.\n  Spring training in Arizona, $90,000 to install video surveillance at \nthe Peoria Sports Conference Complex. The Seattle Mariners and San \nDiego Padres have their spring training there.\n  Here are Urban Area Security Initiative grants which are supposed to \nbe spent on security. What we found is a large portion of the money \nacross the country is not being spent on security; it is being used to \naugment aspects of what communities need.\n  This is a good way to trim $700 million through these grants. While I \nam at it, what we do know is the Department of Homeland Security, 6 \nmonths ago, had $8 billion in unobligated balances. Secretary \nNapolitano made a decision--and her basis was for stimulus, economic \nstimulus--she would take the requirements off of those grants and push \nthat money out the door. They were only able to push $3 billion out the \ndoor, so there is still $5 billion sitting in Homeland Security in \nunobligated money from last year alone that hadn't been spent. This \naddresses many of the issues that we are talking about in terms of the \nsequestration.\n  The Department of Defense, in terms of the ``department of \neverything''--let me outline for you a minute. Not all this money could \nbe saved because they are doing some things, but they have no business \nbeing at the Department of Defense, with $67.9 billion over 10 years in \nnondefense spending; nonmilitary research and development, $6 billion a \nyear. And education, the average cost to educate a child on base in \nAmerica--not our foreign bases, not where we actually need private \nschools--is over $51,000 per year per student.\n  We could consolidate that program, as we do at all but 16 bases, and \nover 10 years save $9 billion.\n  There are STEM programs, 103 different STEM--science, technology, \nengineering, and math--programs within the Pentagon alone. \nConsolidating those would save $1.7 billion over the next 10 years. \nThese are programs not necessarily initiated by Congress either, I \nmight say. They do have the flexibility on a lot of these programs to \nmake those changes.\n  The Department of Defense tuition assistance program totally \nduplicates our veterans assistance program. So you can do in-service, \nhave access to tuition while you are in-service and then have the \nidentical access to tuition afterward, and you can claim them both.\n\n  So we have multiple duplications there. And there is nothing wrong \nwith wanting to give an educational benefit to our troops, but we don't \nneed to do it twice. That is a significant $5.4 billion.\n  Alternative energy. We have a Department of Energy. Their whole goal \nis to work on alternative energy and renewable energy and efficiency \nwithin energy. The Department of Defense is spending $700 million a \nyear on research in alternative energy that totally duplicates \neverything we are doing everywhere else. So there is $700 million we \nshould not be spending at the Pentagon for something that is already \nbeing done somewhere else.\n  We also know we have a benefit for our military families called the \nPX and commissaries. But when we go out and price products, what we \nfind is you can actually buy at retail stores at a lower price than you \ncan at the commissary. For the cost of running all those organizations, \nwe could give every troop an additional $1,000 a year and save $5 \nbillion over the next 10 years. We could give them $1,000 more, and \nthey would be able to buy at lower prices from a commercial vendor \nversus a commissary.\n  Overhead support and supply services. Over 300,000 military members \nare performing civilian-type jobs. In other words, these are Army, \nMarine, Navy, and Air Force personnel trained as warfighters, and we \nhave them doing nonmilitary jobs at the Pentagon. We could put civilian \nemployment in place and have these military people available to be \nwarfighters and save $37 billion over the next 10 years just in the \ndifferential in what our total costs are for the two different types of \nemployees.\n  So when we talk about a sequester taking $85 billion, I have just \ncited over $85 billion over 10 years just by looking at a few programs. \nSo we hear the number, and we think about the Federal Government being \ntwice the size it was 11 years ago and that we are 27 percent higher in \nterms of discretionary spending in nondefense and that even if the \nsequester goes through, as it is now planned for the military, the \nmilitary expenditures will actually still be greater next year than \nwhat they are this year. So it is important that we talk honestly with \nthe American people about where we are on these projects.\n  Let me just for a second talk about a report called the ``Waste \nBook.'' We put it out every year. We gave 100 examples of the most \negregious ways tax dollars were wasted last year.\n  Examples include $450,000 for an unused airport in my State and \n$325,000 for robotic squirrels. This was a grant issued to study what \nwe already know about robotic squirrels and their interactions with \nrattlesnakes. I can't see that as a priority for us. At a time when we \nare running $1.2 trillion deficits, we don't need to be spending money \non that type of research.\n  We spend $91 million a year giving--you won't believe this one--\ncharitable status to the NFL, the PGA, and several other sports \nentities. So on the profits they make, the PGA defers taxes coming to \nthe Federal Government in terms of $91 million a year. Now, I don't \nknow of a pro sports team that isn't in the business of being \nprofitable, yet the organizations they send a lot of this money through \nwe are allowing to hide that money through the Tax Code. That is $91 \nmillion a year. Why are we doing that?\n  Another example: $27 million was spent by the State Department on \npottery classes in Morocco. The whole\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nproject was an abject failure, but the real question is, Why are we \nspending $27 million on pottery classes in Morocco? Could we spend $27 \nmillion and have a better effect for the Moroccan people than a failed \npottery class program? The answer is, certainly.\n  The size of the State Department is twice the size it was 5 years \nago--twice the size in terms of total expenditures.\n  The other thing we talked about is the subsidy for the rich and \nfamous in terms of what is out there. On average, we found $30 billion \na year that millionaires--people who make at least $1 million a year--\nenjoy in benefits from tax giveaways and Federal grant programs. That \nis $30 billion a year. That is $300 billion. That is over one-third of \nwhat we are talking about on the sequestration. Yet we have done \nnothing on that.\n  This has been out for a year, by the way. Here are some more \nexamples. We have $74 million spent on unemployment checks that went to \nmillionaires last year. That is right, $74 million went out to people \nwho made $1 million, but we still paid them unemployment. We spent $316 \nmillion on people who are making more than $1 million a year farming. \nWe sent them $316 million worth of subsidies and $89 million for \npreservation of their ranches and their estates. These are people \nmaking an adjusted gross income above $1 million a year. We sent them \n$9 billion in retirement checks, we sent them $75.6 million in energy \ntax credits for their homes, we sent them $7.5 million for costs and \ndamages due to emergencies, and we also gave them a writeoff on their \ngambling losses in excess of $3 billion.\n  The other thing I found very unusual as we looked at this is that \npeople making an adjusted gross income in excess of $1 million were \ngiven $16 million in government-backed education loans. That is right, \n$16 million in government-backed education loans.\n  One of the other areas we did a study on was the Market Access \nProgram. We have all heard of Sunkist and Welch's and Blue Diamond. In \n2012 we paid them $6 million from the taxpayers to help them sell their \nproducts overseas. These are hundred-million-dollar corporations, \nminimally. They are billion-dollar corporations. We don't do that for \nthe rest of all the corporations in this country, but because they \nhappen to be associated with an agriculture program, we decided to \nsubsidize the overseas products of the very well-to-do corporations. \nThat may be a laudable goal, but at a time of tight priorities, it is \nnot a laudable goal. Over $2 billion has been spent on this program, \nwhich has indirectly subsidized their advertising costs. So $2 billion \nhas gone to very profitable agricultural companies that, if we were to \nlook at their 10-Ks, their SEC reports, they are doing just fine. They \ndon't need the Federal taxpayer to do this.\n  The California wine industry, which had domestic sales of $18 billion \nin 2009--it is higher than that now--got $7 million, and the American \ncotton industry received $20 million and received another $4.7 million \nfrom a separate USDA market access program.\n  Finally, I wish to talk for a minute about more than $70 billion in \nFederal funds that has been left unspent years after it has been \nappropriated. We have $70 billion sitting out there in accounts that \nhas been obligated but not spent, now older than 5 years old, which \nmeans it is never going to be spent. So that money is sitting in a bank \naccount somewhere that we could pull back, if we had effective \nmanagement, because people didn't use the money in a grant, they didn't \nuse the money in a program, and yet we have failed to do that. So we \nare borrowing an extra $70 billion every year to fund the government \nwhen we have $70 billion out there in accounts that should revert back \nto the Treasury.\n  At the end of this year the Federal Government had $2 trillion in \nunexpended funds. This is according to OMB, not the Congressional \nBudget Office. The Office of Management and Budget says that two-thirds \nof this money was obligated, but a third of it wasn't obligated. So you \nhave $650 billion in unobligated balances sitting in the Federal \nGovernment accounts that we are not shuffling around to direct to the \nthings that are most important.\n  Let me finish, but first I would like to make one other point. I got \na letter this week from the mayor of a medium-sized town in my State. \nIt is from the mayor of McAlester, OK. I am going to enter this letter \ninto the Record because in this letter we see a demonstration of the \nkind of leadership that is needed when there is a financial problem in \nfront of you.\n  Let me read this.\n\n       The City of McAlester is currently working hard to \n     rebalance our budget after a sudden downturn in our revenues \n     over the past two months. As you know, municipalities in \n     Oklahoma are required by statute to maintain a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  In other words, it is a law in Oklahoma that you have to have a \nbalanced budget. So what has he done?\n  Continuing to read:\n\n       The first step we took was to implement a hiring freeze.\n\n  So they reassigned workers. And with a revenue shortfall projected at \n$1.2 million, they took every other expense account category, including \nsupplies, repairs and maintenance, fuel, utilities, travel and \ntraining, consulting services and legal services, and reduced their \nbudgets. In other words, they responded.\n  The mayor continued in his letter:\n\n       None of these cuts are without pain. But all will be \n     accomplished while maintaining essential city services.\n\n  Now, for McAlester, a $1.2 million budget cut is a bigger hit than we \nare talking about with sequestration. If the mayor of a community of \n25,000 people can make the adjustments to serve his constituency \nwithout decreasing services, why can't we?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                McAlester, OK,\n\n                                                February 26, 2013.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn, M.D.,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Coburn: The City of McAlester is currently working \n     hard to rebalance our budget after a sudden downturn in our \n     revenues over the past two months. As you know, \n     municipalities in Oklahoma are required by statute to \n     maintain a balanced budget. With sales tax receipts abruptly \n     falling by ten percent compared to the prior year, we have \n     had to act quickly to reduce costs.\n       The first step we took was to implement an immediate hiring \n     freeze. The budgeted positions that are currently open \n     include two street maintenance workers, a full-time and a \n     part-time administrative assistant, a water plant operator, a \n     police officer, an animal control officer, a firefighter, an \n     accounting manager, a meter reader and a planning director. \n     We will reallocate work among other employees wherever we \n     can. If we determine that an unfilled position will affect \n     the safe operation of the community, only then will the \n     position be filled.\n       With a revenue shortfall projected at $1.2 million, we are \n     also making budget reductions In virtually every other \n     expense category including supplies, repairs and maintenance, \n     fuel, utilities, travel and training, consulting services, \n     legal services, etc. Of course, we have also zeroed out any \n     contingency amounts we had included in the budget for the \n     unexpected. However, we have been careful to retain budget \n     items for long-term infrastructure projects as we consider it \n     unwise to risk damaging our city's future.\n       None of these cuts are without pain. But all will be \n     accomplished while maintaining essential city services. By \n     reducing our spending in these areas, we anticipate we can \n     finish the fiscal year without having to dip into emergency \n     fund balances.\n       Prompted by what we see as an economic situation likely to \n     continue into the next fiscal year and potentially beyond, we \n     are also taking this opportunity to thoroughly review our \n     local government cost structure. The goal is to organize in a \n     way that is more efficient and more effective. By stretching \n     each revenue dollar to the max and by prioritizing our needs \n     and wants, we hope to narrow or eliminate the gap between \n     what citizens expect from their government and what they are \n     willing and able to pay for.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Steve Harrison,\n                                         Mayor, City of McAlester.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. The final point I would make is the following: A little \nmore than 3 years ago we passed an amendment that I offered that forced \nthe Government Accountability Office--the government's accounting \noffice--and the Comptroller General to identify every program in the \nFederal Government, and not only to identify it but to outline where we \nhave duplications and overlaps. And they have done a wonderful job. We \nare going to get the last third of that report about a month from \ntoday, April 1, but what do we know so far? We know we have\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\nabout $370 billion in the first two-thirds of this where they say there \nis massive duplication. There is $370 billion worth of expenditures a \nyear.\n  I have talked with the President, and he disagrees with me on this, \nbut when you think about it, we have 47 separate job training programs, \nof which all but three overlap. They are highly ineffective in total. \nSo why don't we have two or three? We spend almost $19 billion on those \nprograms. We could spend $9 billion, cut it down to three programs, put \nmetrics on it, and make sure it is working. The reason I know it is not \nworking is I looked at every job training program in my own State, and \nthe ones that are most successful are the ones that are totally State \nrun without any Federal Government interference. The ones that are \nfederally run--and some are good, I will give you that, but most are \nnot--most are not successful in efficiently and effectively giving \nsomebody a life skill and getting them into employment.\n  We have 253 different, duplicative Department of Justice grant \nprograms spending $2 billion a year. If you are needing a grant, you \nmight apply to DOJ in one of these 253 areas and then you might apply \nagain over here in another area for the same thing. And the fact is \nthat the Government Accounting Office says: We don't know if people are \ndouble- and triple-dipping. As a matter of fact, what did we find? We \nhave people getting the same amount of money from different grant \nprograms from the same grant application. So what we have is a \ntremendous problem.\n  We just discovered in the State of Oklahoma that we have a housing \nadministrator for a city that has no houses. There are 3,700 housing \nadministrators in the United States--probably closer to 4,000 because \nwe are still counting. Some of those have very big responsibilities. I \ndon't mean to diminish them at all. But couldn't we consolidate those, \nespecially in areas such as rural Oklahoma and the other rural States \nso we spread that overhead and have fewer housing administrators?\n  We have 56 financial literacy programs. Think about that for a \nminute, 56 different programs for the Federal Government to create a \nprogram to make you financially literate.\n  First of all, there is a problem with that because we are not \nfinancially literate, borrowing $1.2 trillion a year. No. 2, we don't \nknow what the words efficiency and effectiveness mean in the Federal \nGovernment--or, at least, have limited knowledge of that. And, finally, \nwhy do we have that many financial literacy programs? There is no sane \nanswer to that question.\n  As I outlined in some of the others, 160 housing assistance programs, \n$170 million a year. We have 53 programs across 4 agencies to help \nentrepreneurs. The Federal Government is helping entrepreneurs? Our \nentrepreneurial spirit is not very active and not very successful in \nterms of what we are doing within the government, and yet we spend $2.6 \nbillion on it.\n  We have 15 different separate unmanned aerial aircraft programs \nwithin the Federal Government. We are going to spend $37 billion on \nthat. Why do we have 15? Maybe two or three, because we have different \nrequirements, but 15?\n  So we have the massive amount of duplication that is going on within \nthe Federal Government which implies massive amounts of duplicative \nadministrative and overhead costs. I would bet that one-third of what \nis happening in the sequester, if you consolidated programs--didn't \neliminate any, just consolidated the management--you could save one-\nthird of what the sequester is just from the administrative overhead \nassociated with those.\n  So when you hear discussions about we shouldn't be doing the \nsequester, that the sequester is going to be painful--and it is; I \ndon't deny that. But it doesn't have to be. All it takes is a small \ndrop of common sense, both in Congress and the executive branch, to \nwork our way through these problems.\n  My hope is the President will work with us on giving him flexibility \nin terms of managing this.\n  Remember, $85 billion really isn't 85. It is only going to be about \n44. That is what we are talking about. It is disproportionately heavy \non the defense. I have a lot of colleagues on my side who disagree with \nme on the waste that is in the Pentagon, but I have seen it, I have \nlooked at it, and I have had a lot of people inside the military call \nand talk to me about the waste that is there. We now have an admiral \nfor every ship we have in the Navy. Nobody else has that anywhere else \nin the world, and with that comes an average of 200 other employees per \nadmiral.\n  The question is, Can we do this? Should we do it? And can we do it in \na way that is best for the American people? We are going to cut this \nmoney one way or the other. It is not because a Republican wants to cut \nit or because the President wants to cut it or because a Democrat wants \nto cut it. We are going to cut it because the math in our future is \ngoing to force us to cut it. I know people don't think discretionary \nprograms are much of the problem with what we are spending money on, \nbut I would surmise that well over 15 percent of everything we do in \ndiscretionary spending--including the Pentagon--is not effective or \nefficient.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask permission to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Congratulating Dr. Frank Cleckley on His Retirement\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Franklin D. \nCleckley, one of the true giants of the legal system of West Virginia. \nI do so because Frank is getting ready to retire after nearly half a \ncentury of service to our great State--as a lawyer, as a professor, as \na judge, and as an unwavering champion of justice. I wish to \ncongratulate him for the extraordinary job he has done and to thank him \nfor his countless contributions to the betterment of West Virginia.\n  Dr. Cleckley's stellar and pioneering legal career began in 1965 when \nhe earned his law degree from Indiana University. It will end next week \nat West Virginia University with a retirement ceremony that so many of \nhis family, friends, and colleagues will be attending to celebrate this \ngreat man. I only wish I could be there because I have valued and \nappreciated his friendship for so many years.\n  Frank Cleckley joined the faculty at West Virginia University College \nof Law in 1969, after serving as a lawyer in the U.S. Navy Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps at the height of the Vietnam war. Not only was \nhe the first African American on the staff at the West Virginia \nUniversity College of Law, he was also the first full-time African-\nAmerican professor in the history of West Virginia University.\n  As a law professor at West Virginia University, Frank literally wrote \nthe book on practicing law in West Virginia. He authored two you will \nfind in every courtroom and every lawyer's office in West Virginia--the \n``Handbook on Evidence for West Virginia Lawyers,'' and the ``Handbook \non West Virginia Criminal Procedure.'' These two books are continually \nupdated and are, in the words of the West Virginia Supreme Court, the \nbible for West Virginia's judges and attorneys.\n  Of course, for the generations of West Virginia law students who have \npassed through Dr. Cleckley's classroom, the fact that he wrote those \ntwo books is a source of great amusement for them, whenever they hear \nhim quoting himself in his lectures. ``As it says in `Cleckley,' '' \nProfessor Cleckley would say with a smile.\n  Also, as a member of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, the \nfirst African-American justice in our State, Frank Cleckley would pay \nspecial attention when lawyers stumbled over evidence in their \narguments. And on more than one occasion, Justice Cleckley would \nquietly quip to one of his colleagues: There's one lawyer who didn't \ntake my evidence class.\n\n  Frank Cleckley grew up in Huntington, WV, the youngest of 11 \nchildren. At one point, his ambition was to play pro football. But \nafter working for former Indiana Congressman J. Edward Roush in the \n1960s, he found his true calling--to be a lawyer and champion of civil \nrights.\n  Throughout his legal career, he has been an exceptional trial lawyer, \nnot only in antidiscrimination lawsuits, but also in representing \nclients who couldn't pay him. In fact, he came to be known as the \n``poor man's Perry\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nMason.'' He has been a one-man legal aid society.\n  He also was instrumental in reviving the Mountain State Bar \nAssociation, the oldest minority bar in the United States. In 1990, he \nestablished the Franklin D. Cleckley Foundation to help former \nprisoners with education and employment opportunities. Two years later, \nhe set up another organization to bring civil rights leaders to the \nWest Virginia University as lecturers.\n  Last fall, as he reflected on his long legal career, Frank said that \nwhen he was a kid in Huntington, he wanted to do something with his \nlife that was meaningful and important in West Virginia. Well, he did. \nBut it turns out it wasn't the NFL, as he once thought. It was WVU. \nFrank Cleckley is a true Mountaineer. He helped West Virginia \nUniversity become the nationally respected institution it is today.\n  The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. once said that the arc of the \nmoral universe is long but it bends toward justice. And, in my view, \none of the reasons it bends toward justice is there are people such as \nFrank Cleckley bending it with their honesty, their integrity, and \ntheir commitment to what is right.\n  It fills me with great pride to stand here today and tell the Senate \nabout the accomplishments of Prof. Frank Cleckley and his service to \nWest Virginia. He is a great lawyer, he is a great man, and a great \nWest Virginian, and Gayle and I join his family and friends in \ncelebrating his long and distinguished pursuit of justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly, I hope, we will be voting on the \nconfirmation of Jack Lew to be the next Secretary of the Treasury, and \nI urge my colleagues to support that nomination. He is the right person \nat the right time to be Secretary of the Treasury. He has devoted his \nentire life to public service. I thank him for that, and I thank him \nfor his willingness to continue to serve his Nation. He has a great \nrecord of accomplishment.\n  I have known Jack Lew for 26 years. I have served with him on common \nissues, and I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues some of \nthe things he has done. He first served in the House of Representatives \nas a staff person for Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill. In that \ncapacity, one of the responsibilities he had was to be the liaison to \nthe commission that was working on Social Security reform when \nPresident Reagan was President of the United States. I mention that \nbecause I think we all point to that time when a Democratic-controlled \nCongress and a Republican administration were able to deal with one of \nthe most difficult challenges of the time, the solvency of Social \nSecurity, and they were able to come together with a bipartisan \nproduct. Jack Lew's fingerprints were involved in that transaction. He \nwas able to bring us together. We need that type of person as Secretary \nof the Treasury today, a person who will bring together our Nation with \nthe type of fiscal policy that Democrats and Republicans can rally \nbehind as we look for a solution to our fiscal issues.\n  He was President Clinton's OMB Director, and during that time we \nbalanced the Federal budget. We were able to do something that has only \nbeen done once in my lifetime; that is, we actually balanced the \nFederal budget. Jack Lew was the architect of bringing us together to \nbalance the Federal budget. We need that type of leadership in the \nTreasury today--a person who understands fiscal responsibility and \nunderstands how to do it in a way where you can create job growth. \nDuring those years, let me remind us, we created millions of jobs.\n  He then returned to public service as the OMB Director for President \nObama and as Chief of Staff. He has the experience we need to be \nSecretary of the Treasury, and he has the political know-how to bring \nus together--Democrats, Republicans, Americans--to do what is right for \nthis country.\n  I am proud he is willing to step forward. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination. He is the right person at the right time to \nlead our Nation on fiscal policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 \nminutes remaining for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on the \nLew nomination; that following the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today I spoke in support of Jack \nLew's nomination to be the next Treasury Secretary. Over the last 6 \nhours or so some have come to the Senate floor to question Mr. Lew's \ncharacter, claiming he has not been forthcoming throughout his \nconfirmation.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Mr. Lew participated in one of the \nmost thorough reviews of any candidate for this position: a process \nthat included hours of interviews and the examination of 6 years of tax \nrecords and more than 700 questions for the Record. In comparison, the \ncommittee asked Secretary Geithner only 289 questions--only; Secretary \nPaulson 81; and Secretary Snowe 75 questions. Remember, Jack Lew was \nasked over 700 questions.\n  Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Lew has been nothing but \nopen and transparent. I believe he has gained the trust and confidence \nof many in this Chamber. In fact, 19 of 24 Senators on the Senate \nFinance Committee yesterday voted on a bipartisan basis in favor of \nJack Lew's nomination.\n  Many recognize that Mr. Lew is well qualified to be the Nation's next \nTreasury Secretary. He has demonstrated time and again that he has the \nknowledge and policy expertise to help get the Nation's economy back on \ntrack. He is a very smart man and a very dedicated, total public \nservant.\n  If confirmed by the Senate today, Mr. Lew has said he is eager to \nwork with all of us here in the Congress to strengthen the American \neconomy and create more jobs. That is the key, work together to create \nmore jobs. The only way we could get past these constant budget battles \nis by working together, Republicans and Democrats, in the House and the \nSenate, and we need to work with Mr. Lew and the administration to \ncraft policies that create more jobs and spark economic growth.\n  If confirmed, we will be entrusting Mr. Lew with the authority to \noversee America's financial system and economic policy. It is a great \nresponsibility, one which I believe Mr. Lew will live up to. I think he \nhas what it takes.\n  The Treasury Secretary is obviously the top economic adviser to the \nPresident. He works for the President and he works for the country. So \nthe second role of the Treasury Secretary is to speak to the Nation \nabout our Nation's finances. It is a dual role. He is working for the \nPresident and he is also working for all of us, the people of the \nUnited States of America. It is a very prestigious, very important \nposition. When he speaks, he is speaking for America on financial \nmatters and also on economic matters. It is a separate role that all \nTreasury Secretaries perform, the good ones, and I think Jack Lew is \ngoing to be a very good one.\n  I ask my colleagues to confirm Mr. Lew today as the Nation's next \nTreasury Secretary so he can get to work and help strengthen the \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will wrap up here with a few thoughts \nbefore we vote. I spent a good deal of time today delineating a series \nof serious, deep problems with this nomination, why I truly believe he \nshould not be confirmed. I suppose maybe there are votes to confirm \nhim. We will see as that goes forward. I do not see any need to delay \nany further, but it is time for the American people and the Members of \nthis Senate to consider where we are with this nomination.\n  On February 13 of 2011, a day before the President submitted the \nbudget, the budget Jack Lew wrote, he went on CNN and other TV stations \nand said these words, words that will live in infamy if we care \nanything in this body about respectful treatment from the executive \nbranch, if we have any commitment to the plain truth. He said:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down our national debt.\n\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\n\n  How unbelievable a statement could that be, since his own numbers--\nnot somebody else's, his own numbers when he submitted the budget on \nMonday, the next day--showed that the lowest single deficit in any one \nof the 10 years was $600 billion. He would have added $13 trillion to \nthe gross debt of the United States over 10 years and the numbers, the \ndeficits were going up in the last 5 years--a totally unsustainable \ncourse.\n  Erskine Bowles, the head of the fiscal commission, was in shock, I \nthink, when he saw this. He was appointed by President Obama to head \nthe commission. He said this will take them nowhere near where they \nhave to go to avoid the Nation's fiscal nightmare--nowhere near. And he \nwas absolutely right about that.\n  Then he also said, on CNN on a different day, another interview, the \nbudget ``takes real actions now so that between now and 5 years from \nnow, we can get our deficit under control so that we can stabilize \nthings so we're not adding to the debt anymore.''\n  It had never come close to that. It is a horrible thing. He said \nthis. I asked him about it before the committee. I read that very quote \nto him before the committee 3 days later and this is what he said. I \nasked him, is it an accurate statement, this statement right here? And \nhe said:\n\n       It's an accurate statement that our current spending will \n     not be increasing the debt. . . .\n\n  He went on to add:\n\n       We've stopped spending money that we don't have.\n\n  First of all, this Senate, this Congress, should defend the integrity \nof our process. We should not have high government officials come \nbefore our committees and before the American people and misrepresent \nin such a dramatic way the financial condition of our country. I called \nit then and I repeat now that this, I believe, was the greatest \nfinancial misrepresentation in the history of this Republic. If anybody \nhas one that is bigger, let me hear it, but I don't think they will. I \nsaid that earlier today. You tell me--$13 trillion added to the debt \nand they say we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore.\n  The budget was a terrible budget. It was a terrible budget. Editorial \nboard after editorial board--the Washington Post, the Los Angeles \nTimes, the Denver Post, the Dallas Morning News--there must have been \n40 editorial boards that hammered this budget for failing to lead--the \nWall Street Journal, Financial Times, Investor's Business Daily--they \nall hammered this budget because this was early in 2011, after the 2010 \nelections, after the shellacking of the big spenders, and there was a \nhope somehow that we would be able then to get the administration to \ncome around and change some things. But they stayed right with their \nbig spending policies. They stayed right with it and they decided not \nto tell the truth, that we are not backing down, we are going to \ncontinue to spend, we are not going to cut spending. They would not say \nthat. This is what they said. Whereas their budget did just the \nopposite.\n  I feel strongly about this. This is not right. We in Congress should \nnot have this kind of misrepresentation before us and we should not \nreward people who participate in such misrepresentation. He is the \narchitect of the administration's calculated plan to misrepresent the \nbudget, to not have a budget in the Senate, to not expose themselves \nany more than possible, to attack Republicans such as Paul Ryan in the \nHouse, who actually laid out a plan that would change the debt course \nof America. That is what the plan was, and Mr. Lew was the architect of \nit and he executed it. Boy, what was it like, do you think, for him to \nbe in the Senate, in the White House, and have to be told or asked: \nWould you go out and say this?\n  Mr. Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury--I ask consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Geithner--and this is important, colleagues--\nTreasury Secretary Geithner came before the committee. He would not \nrepeat these words.

Mr. President, just over a year ago my good friend, \nSenator Mark Kirk of Illinois, and I launched a new caucus in the \nSenate. Our purpose was to bring attention to the problem of \nunemployment among our military veterans. Mark and I looked at \neverything the Department of Veterans Affairs and other government \nagencies were doing to help veterans find jobs. We believed the private \nsector needed to be more involved, so we created the Senate Veterans \nJobs Caucus.\n  Today, the Senate Veterans Jobs Caucus is the Congressional Veterans \nJobs Caucus. It is a bicameral, bipartisan group of 37 Senators and 46 \nHouse Members brought together by a shared commitment to the newest \ngeneration of veterans.\n  This week we are kicking off the caucus's activities for the 113th \nCongress with a ``Day on The Hill.'' It is an event highlighting our \nwork on behalf of veterans, and particularly our showcase program, ``I \nHire Veterans.''\n  Not only will we be recruiting more Members of Congress to join our \ncaucus, but we will also be enlisting more businesses to join the eight \nmajor corporate partners that have already joined our ranks. These \ncorporations expect to hire about 200,000 veterans in the next 5 years.\n  The members of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus are leading by \nexample. We are hiring veterans to work in our Senate and House \noffices. My colleagues will probably see the signs as they go by our \noffices that say ``I Hire Veterans.'' It is a logo displayed proudly in \nour offices--the same logo my colleagues will see in the businesses \nthat share our commitment to veterans.\n  Our I Hire Veterans Program is basically our new yellow ribbon, a \nspecial welcome home and a commitment to serve those who have served \nour country in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances.\n  There is no sugarcoating the fact that the job market is tough, \nespecially for our young veterans. Unemployment among these veterans \nhas reached crisis proportions according to the latest data from the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. Listen to these figures, if my colleagues \nwill. They are astonishing. For veterans 18 to 24 years of age, their \nunemployment rate is 31.3 percent--31 percent. Even more staggering is \nthe jobless rate for female veterans in that same age bracket of 18 to \n24, and that is over 55 percent unemployment. The employment situation \nisn't much better for the National Guard and Reserves because employers \nare reluctant to hire somebody who may be subject to being called to \nduty, and this generation of National Guardsmen and Reserves are coming \nhome from a decade of repeated deployment that, in many cases, \ninterrupted or delayed their careers or education. Many of them are \njust now realizing how difficult it can be to jumpstart school or a \ncareer.\n  If we don't do something it is going to get worse. With more than \n100,000 service men and women expected to reenter civil life each year \nover the next 5 years, their challenge to find jobs is only going to \nintensify. Listen to the veterans, and we would be surprised when they \ntell us that sometimes the stress of finding a job in a tough economy \ncan match the stress of combat in some of the most dangerous and \ndistant places in the world.\n  Imagine for a moment that you are 21 and just back from the rugged \nstreets of Kandahar, reunited with your family, and you are going up \nand down the streets of your hometown looking for a job week after week \nwith no luck at all. That is real stress. That is pressure, and that is \nwhat more than 3 out of 10 of our young veterans are experiencing right \nnow as we speak.\n  Like every generation of American warriors before them, today's \nveterans make great hires. They lead by example. They understand \nteamwork. They are flexible and open to change. They are tech savvy. \nAnd talk about performing under pressure--even in the most stressful \nsituations, with limited resources, they get the job done.\n  After World War II, with the millions of American GIs returning home, \nPresident Harry Truman appointed GEN Omar Bradley to run the Veterans' \nAdministration. Bradley was a popular choice, and his steely approach \nto helping veterans was widely admired. Bradley's marching orders to \nthe VA were simple: ``We are dealing with veterans, not procedures, \nwith their problems, not ours.''\n  You will find that same kind of commitment to today's generation of \nveterans in the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus.\n  It is simply unacceptable that when the courageous Americans who \nfight our wars finally get to come home, they have to fight for jobs. \nThe Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus is committed to making sure that \ndoes not happen.\n  America has said it is time to bring our troops home. After a decade \nof war and incredible sacrifice by our warriors, the homecomings are \nwell underway. It is not always easy to come home from war. But the \nhomecoming will be easier if we fulfill our obligations, and that \nincludes making sure our fighting men and women come home to a job.\n  After all, as General Bradley said: ``We are dealing with veterans, \nnot procedures, with their problems, not ours.''\n  I would ask all of my colleagues here--we have 37 of our Senators \nsigned up to this Veterans Jobs Caucus--I would hope we would have 100, \nand we are going to be working hard for that. I want to thank my good \nfriend Senator Mark Kirk from Illinois for helping launch this. We have \nworked together. We will continue to work with all of our Senators. We \nappreciate and thank you.\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, more than 2 million Americans have \nserved our Nation in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other post-9/11 missions \naround the world. Now, as these men and women return home, they are \nconfronting yet another challenge--finding a job.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among \nyounger veterans has reached staggering proportions. Nearly one-third \nof all veterans aged 18-24--and more than half of female veterans in \nthat range--are unemployed.\n  Roughly 800,000 veterans call Illinois home. And in 2010, Illinois' \nveteran unemployment rate was the fourth highest in the country.\n  That is why I joined with my good friend and colleague, Senator Joe \nManchin (D-WV), in forming the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus. And \n1 year later, 35 Senators and 46 Representatives from across the \npolitical spectrum have joined the effort.\n  We are bringing together government and business leaders, veteran \nservice organizations, and educational institutions to identify \nsolutions to reduce vets' unemployment. And I am proud to report that \nseveral Illinois employers, such as State Farm and Caterpillar are \nstepping up to help.\n  At a time when so many see a divided government, we owe it to our \nveterans to cast aside our differences and work across the aisle to \nhelp solve this problem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S924-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S924-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FILIBUSTER AND A MOTION TO CUT OFF DEBATE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to attempt to clear \nup some confusion about Senate procedure. The confusion I wish to \naddress is that some observers of the Senate seem to have a hard time \ntelling the difference between a filibuster that is designed to kill \nthe nomination of a Cabinet member or a judge and a motion by the \nmajority leader to cut off debate. Let me say that again--the \ndifference between a filibuster that is designed to prevent the \nnomination of a Cabinet member or a judge on one hand or a motion by \nthe majority leader of the Senate to cut off debate.\n  There is a big difference. But sometimes I read in the newspapers \nthat Republicans are filibustering, for example, Senator Hagel, as if a \nmajority of Republicans or a majority of the Senate intended to deny \nthe confirmation of Senator Hagel through a filibuster, when, in fact, \nwhat most of the Republicans were saying was: The nomination of the \nformer Senator has come to the floor only 2 days ago. We have Senators \nwho have legitimate questions about the nomination, and we wish to have \nsome time to discuss it.\n  In that case, we were forced to have a vote on a motion by the \nmajority leader to cut off debate on Thursday before the recess, even \nthough the\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\nDemocratic leadership and the White House had been told by Republican \nSenators--enough of us--if we voted after the recess there would be \nplenty of votes to make sure the President's nominee had an up-or-down \nvote, as we have done throughout history in the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, for whatever reason, the majority leader and the White House \nfelt they had to push through a vote and then went into a large \ncomplaint that Republicans are filibustering the President's nominee, \nRepublicans are obstructionists of the President's nominee, when all we \nwere doing was doing what Senators historically do, which is ask for a \nsufficient time to exercise our constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent.\n  Advice and consent is our best known constitutional responsibility. \nBooks have been written about it, movies have been written about it, \nand speeches have been made about it time after time. If we do not do \nit, we would be derelict in our duty.\n  So there is a big difference between asking for time to exercise our \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent and using a filibuster to \nprevent the nomination of a Cabinet member or a judge.\n  I went back through history as best I could. The Congressional \nResearch Service has issued a report on what has happened throughout \nthe Senate's history on Cabinet members and judges.\n  On district judges, according to CRS, no district judge nomination \nhas ever failed to be confirmed because they failed to obtain cloture. \nDid it take some time? Were questions asked? Yes, of course. That is \npart of the process. But the fact is, no district court nomination has \never failed to be confirmed because they failed to obtain cloture.\n  So if the majority leader will wait a sufficient amount of time for \nthe minority members to have their questions answered, a district judge \nin this body today--and we have proved it time and time again--will not \nbe denied his seat because of a 60-vote cloture vote. There will be an \nup-or-down vote on a district judge.\n  The same is true so far with a Cabinet member. The only exception I \nhave found is when the Democrats, unfortunately, used a cloture vote--a \n60-vote requirement--to block the nomination of John Bolton, President \nBush's nominee to be U.S. Representative to the United Nations.\n  Some Presidents include that position in the Cabinet; some do not. \nBut aside from that singular incident, which I point out was the \nDemocrats--the Democrats--saying they are going to filibuster a nominee \nby the President and deny him a seat, so far as I have been able to \ntell, there has not ever been an instance in the history of the Senate \nwhere Republicans have used a filibuster to deny a Cabinet member an \nup-or-down vote when nominated by a President.\n  That only leaves circuit judge nominees. Up until 2003, so far as I \nhave been able to find, the rule of the Senate was that the President's \nnominees to be on the Federal courts of appeals always received an up-\nor-down vote. They were decided by a vote of 51.\n  Then our friends on the Democratic side, when President Bush became \nPresident, decided they did not like that and they changed the \npractice. They began to filibuster President Bush's judges to deny them \ntheir seats.\n  I had just arrived in the Senate in 2003. I was very upset by that \nbecause I knew some of the nominees. I knew about Miguel Estrada. I \nknew how Charles Pickering, in Mississippi, had been a pioneer in the \ncivil rights movement when people said he was not. I knew that William \nPryor had been a law clerk to the Honorable John Minor Wisdom, the \nFederal courts of appeals judge for whom I clerked in New Orleans. I \nknew these were good people. They just happen to be conservative. They \njust happen to be Republicans. So our friends on the other side of the \naisle said: We are going to filibuster and kill those nominees.\n  There were three others: Priscilla Owen, Carolyn Kuhl, Janice Brown. \nAll the cloture votes failed. There was no final vote. And then there \nwere four more in 2004. So there were 10 altogether. Democrats for the \nfirst time filibustered to kill 10 of President Bush's judges.\n  That produced a reaction. That produced Republicans who said: OK, we \nare going to change the rules of the Senate. We are going to make this \na majoritarian institution. We are going to decide these questions by \n51 votes.\n  Well, cooler heads prevailed and we adopted a consensus that only in \nextraordinary cases would Federal appellate court judges be denied \ntheir seat by a cloture vote, by a 60-vote margin. In every other case, \nit would be 51 votes.\n  Based on the research I have been able to make, only two of President \nObama's circuit court nominees have failed to obtain cloture and were \nnot confirmed, and those are Caitlin Halligan and Goodwin Liu.\n  So the bottom line of history is, no district judge has ever been \ndenied his seat or her seat by a filibuster. No Cabinet member--with \nthe exception of John Bolton by the Democrats, if you want to count \nthat--has been denied his or her seat by a filibuster.\n  As far as circuit court nominations go, the score is 10 to 2. The \nDemocrats have filibustered to death 10 of President Bush's nominees, \nand Republicans, in return, have filibustered 2. I think that is an \nunfortunate precedent. I would like for the Senate to go back to where \nit was when even a nominee such as Clarence Thomas for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States was decided by a majority vote.\n  In addition to that, of course, there is the question of: Do we \nfilibuster legislation? The answer is yes, we do. And sometimes we do \non either side to kill a bill. If a bill comes over here to abolish the \nsecret ballot in union elections, I imagine Republicans will do their \nbest to kill the bill with a 60-vote margin. Democrats would do the \nsame with a right-to-work provision if Republicans were in charge. That \nhas happened throughout history. And with lesser nominations that has \nhappened. If a National Labor Relations Board nominee is controversial, \nthere might be a 60-vote requirement--even with a nomination to the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n\n  I remember when the distinguished majority leader held up President \nBush's TVA nominees because he thought the President should have \nappointed Democrats instead of Republicans. I pointed out to him that \nthe law did not say he had to do that. But the majority leader said, \nwell, he was going to hold them up anyway. I could not get him to stop \ndoing that until I held up somebody he wanted from Nevada.\n  So this has gone on throughout history with lesser nominees. It is a \npart of the advice and consent of the Senate. It is a way we gather \ninformation. It is a way we make a point. It is a way we sometimes get \nsomething in exchange. It is a power that an individual Senator has.\n  As with all the powers we have, it should be exercised with \nrestraint. If all 100 of us exercised all the privileges we have at any \ngiven time, nothing would happen.\n  Let me conclude by remaking my first point. Advice and consent is the \nbest known responsibility of this Senate. It is a constitutional duty. \nWe exercise it diligently. It often involves some delay. It often \ninvolves asking for more time to consider someone, getting information \nthat was not easily gotten before. Every Senator knows that the time to \nask a nominee about an issue is before that nominee is confirmed. They \nare able to talk about something, it seems, easily. Their appointments \nare not hard to get. So that is a part of what we do every day.\n  But I hope the observers of the Senate will make a distinction in the \nfuture between the majority leader's effort to cut off debate and the \nminority's intention to kill a nominee with a filibuster. Because we do \nnot do it with district judges--never have. We do not do it with \nCabinet members--never have. We have done it twice on the Republican \nside with circuit court judges; Democrats have done it 10 times--both \nunfortunate precedents, I think. But with Cabinet members and district \njudges, that is the record.\n  So there is a difference. There is a difference between asking for a \nreasonable amount of time to debate and exercise advice and consent and \na filibuster with the intention of preventing the nomination entirely, \nfinally, of a judge or a Cabinet member.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, while the Senator from Tennessee is on \nthe floor--and because he referenced the filibuster of district judge \nnominees--let me say that there was a concerted effort to try to \nfilibuster a district court nominee, one whom Senator Reed and myself \nhad a particularly keen interest in, since we recommended this \ncandidate to the President, and it was the Senator from Tennessee, \nalong with 10 of his Republican colleagues, who decided that was not in \nthe best traditions of the Senate and who voted against the filibuster \nand to allow cloture so that the precedent remains that district judges \nwill not be filibustered. I just want to take this opportunity to thank \nhim for doing that, and to let him know he has my gratitude for that. I \nthink it was in the best interests of the Senate. I do not think the \nSenator did it in order to gain any gratitude from me. I think he did \nit because, as a matter of principle, he thought this was the way the \nSenate should behave. But I certainly do appreciate it and I want to \ntake this moment to say so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S926-S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am here, actually, Mr. President, to once again \nurge Congress that we have to wake up to the growing threat of climate \nchange. The alarm bells are ringing. The signs are all around us. Yet \nwe continue to sleepwalk through history, ignoring the warnings from \nthe scientific community, from economists and business leaders--even \nfrom our military--of long-term shifts in the climate of our planet.\n  Another alarm has now sounded--this time by the Government \nAccountability Office, the taxpayers' watchdog. For the first time \never, the threat to the Federal Government of climate change has been \nincluded on the Government Accountability Office's High Risk List.\n  Every 2 years, at the start of a new Congress, GAO--the Government \nAccountability Office--provides the House and Senate with a list of \nprogram areas that are at high risk. GAO was the government's \nnonpartisan auditor, and the High Risk List is its catalog of threats \nto the integrity and performance of the Federal Government.\n  GAO says:\n\n       Solutions to high-risk problems offer the potential to save \n     billions of dollars, improve service to the public, and \n     strengthen the performance and accountability of the U.S. \n     government.\n\n  House Oversight Committee chairman, Darrell Issa, has called the High \nRisk List ``the most important report published.'' As we face the \nindiscriminate spending cuts of the multibillion-dollar sequester, \nChairman Issa pointed out that ``the list represents tremendous \nopportunities to save those billions of dollars.'' It is enough, \nactually, to prevent the sequester we are careening toward twice over.\n  Only 55 issues have been elevated to the High Risk List since it \nfirst began in 1990. The current list comprises 30 big-ticket problems, \nsuch as improving defense program management, protecting the Nation's \ncyber infrastructure, and modernizing Federal health programs. When a \nproblem reaches GAO's High Risk List, it shouldn't matter if you are a \nDemocrat or a Republican. These issues must be among the top priorities \nof Congress and of the Nation.\n  Add now to this list of serious national problems the destabilizing \nfiscal risk posed by climate change.\n  The Federal Government and our military--and by definition, the \nAmerican taxpayer--own and operate hundreds of thousands of buildings \nand extensive infrastructure in every State, including utilities, flood \ncontrol and navigation systems, powerplants, distribution networks, and \nirrigation systems, not to mention the usual roads and bridges. The \nFederal Government also manages about 650 million acres of land for \ngrazing, for timber, for conservation, and for recreation. That is \nnearly 30 percent of the total area of the United States, and climate \nchange is affecting virtually all of it.\n  The overwhelming majority of climate scientists tell us that the air \nand oceans are warming, that sea level is rising, and that we are \nchanging the very chemistry of our oceans. These changes--some of them \nunprecedented in human history--increase the risk of extreme weather, \nsuch as heat waves, floods, droughts, and storms. As GAO points out, \nFederal assets in every corner of the country are at risk.\n  Storms crashing into the Southeast, wildfires burning throughout the \nWest, and floods inundating the Northeast are not just local problems. \nDroughts are draining aquifers in the Midwest, warm temperatures are \nmelting permafrost in Alaska, and rising, warming, more acidic oceans \nare eroding our national coast lines and threatening our lives and our \nseas. These are not just local problems. Climate change is a high-risk \nthreat to our shared national well-being, our shared national wealth, \nand our shared national heritage.\n  The GAO High Risk List sounds yet another alarm that we are fools to \nignore. For instance, GAO found that neither the National Flood \nInsurance Program nor the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation is \nprepared to deal with climate change.\n  Between 1980 and 2005, the Flood Insurance Program's exposure \nquadrupled to nearly $1 trillion. The Crop Insurance Program increased \n26-fold to $44 billion. Yet GAO reports that these programs have not \neven developed the ``information needed to understand their long-term \nexposure to climate change and not yet analyzed the potential impacts \nof an increase in the frequency or severity of weather-related \nevents.''\n  Major private insurance companies such as Allianz, Swiss Re, Munich \nRe, and Lloyd's of London have for years been developing strategies to \naddress climate change. Our Federal insurance programs don't even have \nthe basic information to address these risks.\n  Understanding and preparing for these risks is essential to protect \nour communities from catastrophic loss. According to NOAA, the value of \nflood insurance coverage in my home State of Rhode Island was $2.2 \nbillion in 2011. The Ocean State has received $57 million in payouts \nsince 1978, some of which helped Rhode Islanders recover from our \nrecord floods of 2010 brought on by extremely heavy rainfall. Folks who \nhave flood coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program should \nknow that heavy rainfall has increased in the Northeast by 74 percent \nsince the 1950s, and scientists predict that warmer air will continue \nto increase the frequency of heavy rainfall and consequent flooding in \nthe Northeast.\n  Disaster aid is expensive. FEMA has obligated more than $80 billion \nin Federal disaster aid between 2004 and 2011. Another $50.5 billion in \nemergency aid was just approved for the northeastern communities \ndevastated by Hurricane Sandy. PSE, New Jersey's largest utility, \nplans to spend over $4 billion over 10 years to make its electric and \ngas systems more resilient to these severe storms. New Jersey's second \nlargest utility, JDP, announced that it intends to spend $200 million \nto do the same. According to Jeanne Fox, who is a commissioner on the \nNew Jersey Board of Public Utilities, ``This is a cost of climate \nchange, pure and simple.''\n  It is really time for us to wake up. In the private sector, the \ninsurance and utility industries are facing the threat. Congress must \nnow act responsively.\n  House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings asked GAO \nComptroller Gene Dodaro if it was ``GAO's opinion that regardless of \nthe outcome of global negotiations to reduce carbon emissions, the \nUnited States Government should take immediate action to mitigate the \nrisk posed by the climate change.'' Comptroller General Dodaro \nresponded with a simple and unequivocal ``yes.''\n  In the High Risk List, GAO states that despite any possible future \nreduction of emissions, ``greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere \nwill continue altering the climate system for many decades.'' That is \nthe way the laws of physics and chemistry work. Damage with lasting \nconsequences is already done.\n  Many effects of climate change can be mitigated, and it is the \nresponsibility of this Congress to help our Nation prepare and adapt. \nSome Federal efforts are underway. In 2003 the U.S. Department of \nTransportation initiated a study of climate risks to gulf coast \ntransportation. It is now cooperating in that study with the South \nAlabama Regional Planning Commission. The Bureau of Land Management and\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\nthe U.S. Forest Service are developing a drought vulnerability model, a \ncarbon storage map, and an alpine monitoring program to help land \nmanagers in southwestern Colorado cope with the effects of a changing \nclimate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a Climate-\nReady States and Cities Initiative to help local health departments \nprepare for changes in health risks driven by climate change. EPA \npartnered with New York City's Department of Environmental Protection \nto develop a software tool that helps drinking water and wastewater \nutility operators understand how climate change poses risks to their \nfacilities.\n\n  Rhode Island, I am proud to say, is one of many States that have \nformed a climate change commission. The commission is coordinating with \nFederal officials to identify specific State and local challenges that \nare presented by our changing climate. Twenty other States have similar \nclimate action plans developed or underway.\n  Despite the actions by States, the actions in the private sector, and \nthe warnings in the GAO High Risk List, special interest politics in \nCongress prevent the Federal Government from using our resources \neffectively and efficiently against this threat. The polluting special \ninterests have Washington gripped in a barricade of obstruction, and \nthe effect truly is disgraceful.\n  Consider, for example, NOAA's proposal to create a National Climate \nService, akin to its renowned National Weather Service. This was a no-\ncost restructuring that would have centralized NOAA's work on \nunderstanding the climate, including its observations of climate \nchange. The National Climate Service would have helped meet the growing \nlocal demand for climate change science information. This proposal was \nblocked by Republicans over in the House who simply don't want to hear \nabout climate change. That kind of thinking will not get climate change \noff the High Risk List.\n  According to GAO, ``The Nation's vulnerability can be reduced by \nlimiting the magnitude of climate change through actions to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions. . . . While implementing adaptive measures \nmay be costly, there is a growing recognition that the cost of inaction \ncould be greater and--given the government's precarious fiscal \nposition--increasingly difficult to manage given expected budget \npressures.''\n  Congress has been asleep long enough. We have a tradition in this \nbody of taking the accounting of GAO--our nonpartisan watchdog--\nseriously and of taking GAO's High Risk List seriously. GAO now joins \nour defense and intelligence communities, our scientific research \ncommunities, our State and local governments, and major sectors of \nprivate industry that have all elevated climate change from their to-do \nlist to their must-do list.

EVERETT KOOP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the passing of an \nextraordinary American, a man who received the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. I think he was one of the true leaders in my lifetime when it \ncame to issues related to health care. Of course, I am referring to \nformer U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.\n  It is hard to imagine today, as we reflect on all that has happened \nin the last several decades, the courage it took for Dr. Koop to step \nup and honestly describe the HIV/AIDS epidemic to the American people. \nThis socially conservative doctor went so far as to make sure there was \na mailing to every household in America that described the threat of \nthis disease. There were many who thought that would never happen \nbecause of the political environment of the day. But Dr. Koop rose to \nthe challenge and, in doing that, he saved lives in America. And he \ninformed this country in a way that no other Surgeon General has about \nthis looming danger.\n  If only that alone were his legacy, it would be more than enough. But \nI had a special personal friendship with him that related to our mutual \nefforts against the scourge of tobacco and the deaths related to that \nproduct. We have come a long way in America, and Dr. Koop was part of \nthe progress we made. He was resolute in making it clear that tobacco \nwas the No. 1 avoidable cause of death in America at his time, and is \nstill today.\n  He was helpful in so many ways. When Senator Frank Lautenberg and I, \nmore than 25 years ago, teamed up--I was then in the House; Frank in \nthe Senate--to ban smoking on airplanes, it was something that neither \nSenator Lautenberg nor I could have predicted would have had the impact \nit did. It is one of the Malcolm Gladwell tipping points in health \nhistory in this country because when we took smoking off airplanes, \npeople started asking the obvious question: If secondhand smoke is not \nhealthy on an airplane, why is it healthy in a train, in a bus, in an \noffice, in a hospital, in a restaurant, in a government building? And \nall of the dominoes started to fall.\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\n  America is a different place today. C. Everett Koop was one of the \nmost courageous medical voices who stepped out time and time again to \nremind us of the importance of that issue. Once again, his leadership \nsaved lives.\n  On the back pages of yesterday's Washington Post was an editorial \nentitled: ``PEPFAR's glowing report card, 10 years later.''\n  PEPFAR--the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--was begun \nunder President George W. Bush. While President Bush and I haven't \nalways seen eye to eye, I have the greatest respect for his leadership \nin the effort to end the global AIDS pandemic.\n  PEPFAR is the largest global health initiative ever undertaken \nfocused on a single disease. When Congress reauthorized it in 2008, we \nasked for a report card on its effectiveness.\n  Well, a remarkable--and remarkably thorough--analysis of PEPFAR was \njust released by the National Institute of Medicine of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. The verdict: PEPFAR has been ``globally \ntransformative,'' a ``lifeline'' and credited around the world for \n``restoring hope'' in the long, difficult struggle against HIV/AIDS.\n  The report goes on to say that the program has set big goals ``and \nhas met or surpassed many of them'' and it ``has saved and improved the \nlives of millions'' of men, women and children throughout the world.\n  That is an achievement that all Americans can be proud of.\n  On the front page of yesterday's newspapers was the story of one \nAmerican who could take a special pride in our Nation's efforts to end \nthe global AIDS pandemic.\n  C. Everett Koop died Monday at the age of 96.\n  He was called ``America's Doctor.'' As U.S. Surgeon General during \nthe Reagan administration, Dr. Koop informed--and really transformed--\nAmericans' understanding of HIV/AIDs.\n  He saw beyond politics and ideology and understood that HIV/AIDs were \nnot punishments, they were a public health emergency.\n  At a time when there was great fear and ignorance about HIV/AIDs and \nlittle treatment for the illness, Dr. Koop saw that information was the \nmost useful weapon against AIDS.\n  In May 1988, he mailed a seven-page brochure, ``Understanding AIDS,'' \nto every household in the country. It was an audacious act of \nleadership, especially in an administration in which almost no one else \nwould even utter the word ``AIDS'' in public.\n  Dr. Koop was also a tireless campaigner against tobacco. As surgeon \ngeneral, he released a report in 1982 that attributed 30 percent of all \ncancer deaths to smoking.\n  He wrote that nicotine was as addictive as heroin, warned against the \nhazards of secondhand smoke, and demanded that the warning labels on \ncigarette packs be rewritten to reflect the lethal dangers of tobacco.\n  It is probably hard for anyone younger than 40 and perhaps even 50 to \nunderstand how Dr. Koop's courage and candor fundamentally changed the \npublic debate on smoking.\n  Before the Surgeon General's report, smoking was common in offices \nand restaurants and public buildings throughout America--even in the \nconfined space of airline cabins.\n  In 1986, I cosponsored a bill in the House--and Senator Lautenberg \ncosponsored a measure in the Senate--to ban smoking on domestic flights \nof 2 hours or less. We didn't know it then but that law, which passed \nin 1987, was the beginning of a smoke-free revolution that has saved \ncountless lives.\n  Dr. Koop provided the facts and the leadership to make that change \npossible.\n  Remarkably, Charles Everett Koop had no background in public health \nwhen he was appointed by President Reagan in 1981 to head the \ncommissioned corps of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n  He was, at the time, 64 years old and one of the world's leading \npediatric surgeons. He was also a socially conservative Christian who \nhad written a popular treatise against abortion.\n  He was born in Brooklyn, an only child, and he used to say that he \nhad wanted to be a surgeon since he was 6 years old.\n  He attended Dartmouth College and Cornell University's Medical \nCollege and began his residency at the University of Pennsylvania \nHospital in 1942.\n  In 1946, when he was not yet 30 years old, Dr. Koop became chief of \nsurgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n  Pediatric surgery as a medical specialty barely existed at that time. \nMost doctors viewed children then as little adults. Operations on \nnewborns were rare and often fatal.\n  Dr. Koop established what is considered by many the first neonatal \nintensive care unit in the country.\n  President Bill Clinton awarded Dr. Koop the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom in 1995.\n  Dr. Koop's legacy will live on in the scores of pediatric surgeons he \ntrained, many of whom went on to head pediatrics departments in \nhospitals in America and around the world.\n  His legacy will live on through the institute that bears his name, \nthe C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth University.\n  And Dr. Koop's legacy will live on in the millions of lives his work \nhas helped save.\n  I want to read a quote from one of those millions of people. This is \nwhat one man wrote on the Washington Post Web site following the front-\npage story announcing Dr. Koop's death:\n  ``When I was 6 months old, Dr Koop was a pediatric surgeon in \nPhiladelphia. On Thanksgiving night, he left his family dinner to \nperform an emergency operation on me for pyloric stenosis,'' a \ncondition which prevents the stomach from emptying into the small \nintestine. ``The surgery saved my life.''\n  The man continued: ``That was 68 years ago. I grew up . . . went to \ncollege and two graduate schools . . . got a commission in the Army . . \n. served 7\\1/2\\ years active duty with 2\\1/2\\ years in Vietnam in 2 \ninfantry divisions . . . 25 years in the Army Reserves . . . and 30 \nyears as a civilian intelligence officer in DC, with 15 years on the \n[Joint Chiefs] staff. [I was] in the Pentagon during the 9/11 attack.''\n  He ends by saying: ``I can only hope that in some small way, I have \nbeen worthy of the life Dr Koop gave me although I could never \nadequately repay him.''\n  Dr. Koop's wife of 67 years, Elizabeth, died in 2007. He remarried in \n2010.\n  I want to offer my condolences to his widow, Cora Hogue, to Dr. \nKoop's children and grandchildren and his many friends and colleagues.\n  As I mentioned, Dr. Koop lived to the impressive age of 96 years. But \nwhat is truly impressive is the fact that untold millions of people \naround the world have lived, and will continue to live longer, \nhealthier lives, because of the professional excellence, wisdom, and \ncourage of Dr. Charles Everett Koop. He served America well and he will \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S928-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S928-S940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Debate on the \n     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those \n     opposing the appeal.\n       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ \n     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact \n     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the \n     disposition of complaints.\n       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. \n     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.\n       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting \n     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary \n     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.\n       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit \n     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative \n     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the \n     effective discharge of its duties.\n       Sec. 3.

If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman.

But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determinations and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member.

In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) APPROVAL OF BLIND TRUSTS AND FOREIGN TRAVEL REQUESTS \n     BETWEEN SESSIONS AND DURING EXTENDED RECESSES: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) COMMITTEE USE OF SERVICES OR EMPLOYEES OF OTHER \n     AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n     RULE 2: PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS, ALLEGATIONS, OR INFORMATION\n\n       (a) COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate \n     has violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     or any rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the \n     conduct of any individual in the performance of his or her \n     duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or \n     has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the \n     Senate. Such complaints or allegations or information may \n     be reported to the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a \n     Committee member, or a Committee staff member.\n       (b) SOURCE OF COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or (5) \n     information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) FORM AND CONTENT OF COMPLAINTS: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\n     of six members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS\n\n       (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) NON-PUBLIC HEARINGS: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an \n     adjudicatory hearing; and any hearing which is concerned \n     with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or \n     respondents designated by the Committee shall be an \n     adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the \n     procedures described in paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) SUBPOENA POWER: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) PRESIDING OFFICER: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) WITNESSES:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) RIGHT TO TESTIFY: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) CONDUCT OF WITNESSES AND OTHER ATTENDEES: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) ADJUDICATORY HEARING PROCEDURES:\n       (1) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) SWEARING OF WITNESSES: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE AND CALL WITNESSES:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n     Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, b a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCEDURES: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) TRANSCRIPTS:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing.

Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) COUNSEL AT DEPOSITIONS: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) DEPOSITION PROCEDURE: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual \n     who has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent \n     time, seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the \n     objection from the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the \n     Committee, who may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     rule on the objection. If the Chairman or Vice Chairman, \n     or the Committee upon referral, overrules the objection, \n     the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the Committee as the case \n     may be, may direct the witness to answer the question or \n     produce the document. The Committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless \n     the witness refuses to testify or produce documents after \n     having been directed to do so.\n       (5) FILING OF DEPOSITIONS: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   RULE 7: VIOLATIONS OF LAW; PERJURY; LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS; \n   EDUCATIONAL MANDATE; AND APPLICABLE RULES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\n       (a) VIOLATIONS OF LAW: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.\n       (b) PERJURY: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury.

Mr. President, there is a document posted on the wall of \nthe offices of the Senate Armed Services Committee with all of the \nstaff listed in order of seniority, with the dates on which they \nstarted their service. The second name on the list is that of Rick \nDeBobes, the staff director of the committee, who joined the committee \nstaff 24 years ago, on March 9, 1989. That record of service is all the \nmore remarkable because Rick did not come to the Senate until after he \nhad completed a distinguished 26-year career in the Navy. His last \nassignment on Active Duty was as legal advisor to Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff William Crowe.\n  This week, Rick will retire for the second time, culminating an \nextraordinary record of 50 years of service to the Senate, the Navy, \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces, and his country.\n  In the course of his service on the committee staff, Rick has played \na key role in the enactment of 24 National Defense Authorization Acts. \nA proud graduate of Georgetown University, Rick received his law degree \nfrom Fordham University and a masters' degree in international law from \nthe National Law Center at George Washington University. He has gone on \nto have what I am sure must be a far greater influence on international \nlaw than any of his professors or mentors could have imagined. It is no \nexaggeration to say that Rick DeBobes has been involved in writing or \nimproving virtually every major piece of national security legislation \nto come before the Congress in the last quarter century, starting with \nthe Goldwater-Nichols legislation that he helped shape before joining \nthe committee staff.\n  For the last 10 years, Rick has served as staff director of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--one of the toughest and most important \njobs in the Senate. In this capacity, Rick has not only helped guide \nour annual National Defense Authorization Act to enactment each year, \nbut also played a vital role in congressional oversight of our military \noperations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. His leadership of the \ncommittee staff has also seen the enactment of the Wounded Warrior Act, \nthe Detainee Treatment Act, the Military Commissions Act of 2009, the \nWeapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act, TRICARE for Life, and the repeal \nof don't ask, don't tell, along with other major legislation. Rick's \nadvice and counsel on all of these matters--informed by his unique \nbackground and experience--have been invaluable not only to me and to \nother members of the Armed Services Committee, but also to our military \nchiefs of staff, combatant commanders, and other senior military and \ncivilian officials in the Department of Defense.\n  In the 16 years that I have served as chairman or ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Rick has spent countless hours in my \noffice, discussing national security matters of every kind. He has \njoined me on virtually every overseas trip I have taken, including more \nthan a dozen trips to Iraq and Afghanistan. We have met together with \nSenators, Secretaries of Defense, chiefs of staff, and foreign heads of \nstate. We have been through markups, floor debates, and conferences \ntogether. Through all of this, I have not only appreciated and needed \nRick's wise counsel, I have enjoyed his company.\n  Rick's hallmark as staff director has been the composure, the \nsteadiness, and the sound judgment that he brings to the job every \nsingle day. The committee staff often line up outside Rick's office \ndoor, bringing him one crisis after another that needs to be addressed. \nWhether it is early in the morning before a hearing or late at night \nafter a ``Little 4'' meeting in conference, Rick always makes time for \nthe staff. And I don't think any of us have ever seen Rick lose his \ncool--except perhaps when his beloved Georgetown Hoyas basketball team \nblows a late lead.\n  As Rick leaves us to enjoy a well-deserved retirement with his wife \nMargaret, his children, and his grandchildren, I know I speak for the \nentire Armed Services Committee--members and staff--when I say: Thanks, \nRick, for a job extraordinarily well done, and best wishes for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S940-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING WAYNE WILSON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize one of \nNevada's own, Wayne Wilson, for being named as a finalist for the \nCitizen Service Before Self Honors by the Congressional Medal of Honor \nFoundation. His efforts to assist disabled veterans have earned him \nthis distinct honor, and I am both humbled and honored to recognize him \ntoday.\n  After graduating from the United States Army Sergeant Major Academy \nin 1976, Wayne served in the National Guard for over four decades. He \nserved as command sergeant major of an engineer group and a combat \nengineer battalion. In 1984, he transferred to the Nevada National \nGuard and moved to Carson City. Throughout Wayne's lifetime, he has \nalways remained an active member in the veteran community and has \ndedicated his free time to looking after this community's needs. Wayne \nwas one of the original founders of the Veterans Guest House, is a \nlifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans, DAV, and has been \nnamed the Silver State's Veteran of the Month.\n  In 2008, Wayne founded the Northern Nevada Wheelchair Program to \ndistribute wheelchairs to disabled veterans. Providing our Nation's \ngreatest heroes with mobility and independence is a unique gift and a \nsingular act of heroism. His commitment to putting others first is a \ntrue example of sacrifice for the betterment of others.\n  In October 2012, I had the privilege of meeting Wayne when he was \nrecognized by Governor Sandoval as Nevada's Veteran of the Month. His \ncontinued service and sacrifice to our country and veteran community \nmakes me proud that Wayne calls Nevada home. Today, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in recognizing Wayne for his tireless efforts to better the \nSilver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S940-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S940-S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CLARENCE JACKSON\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nreflect on the sad news that Clarence Jackson, a Tlingit elder, \n``walked into the forest'' on January 31, 2013, at the age of 78.\n  Clarence Jackson was an individual who committed his life to the \nNative peoples of Alaska. Clarence was invaluable and irreplaceable, as \nhe generously shared his vast knowledge of the\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nTlingit language, history and culture. In 1972, Jackson signed the \narticles of incorporation for Sealaska Corporation that was created \nunder the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. As one of the original \nincorporators of Sealaska Corporation, he was the only board member to \nserve continuously from the time Sealaska was founded. He also served \non the board of directors for Sealaska Timber Corporation and served as \nthe chairman of the Sealaska Heritage Institute's Council of \nTraditional Scholars. But many saw him as an ambassador to the \ncommunity. He was a gentle man adept at using humor to reach people. In \nhis capacity on the board, he represented Sealaska at funerals, \ncelebrations, and many other community events.\n  Clarence was born in Kake, AK, on May 24, 1934. He lived there most \nof his life, attending Sheldon Jackson School in Sitka. He continued on \nto Sheldon Jackson College in 1954. Growing up immersed in his Tlingit \ncommunity allowed him to become a very articulate orator. He excelled \nthrough his teachings of the Tlingit culture. After college, Clarence \nmoved back to Kake, where he became a fisherman and operated a small \nstore.\n  In the 1960's, Clarence became a delegate to the Central Council of \nTlingit and Haida Indians in the Alaska Native claims movement. He \nserved as this council's president from 1972 through 1976.\n  Clarence also advocated for the importance of preserving the cultural \nvalues of all Native people and eloquently spoke to this at Celebration \n2012 in Juneau.\n  Clarence positively impacted the lives of everyone he met. He \naccomplished a great deal for his Native people, and he was blessed \nwith a truly wonderful family. Thanks to modern technology, his stories \nand life experiences will live on for eternity.\n  On behalf of the Senate I extend condolences to Clarence's family, \nhis wife of 58 years, Gertrude Louise ``Lidda'' Paddock, and the \nTlingit people of Southeast Alaska. His life has been appropriately \nhonored with a ceremony at Elizabeth Peratrovich Hall, in Juneau, \nAK.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S941-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM ALEXANDER\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and \ncongratulate chief of police M. James ``Jim'' Alexander, Jr., of the \nLebanon New Hampshire Police Department for his more than 26 years of \ndedicated law enforcement service to our State and Nation.\n  The Chief began his law enforcement career as a police officer with \nthe Brattleboro, VT, Police Department in 1987. Chief Alexander then \njoined the Lebanon New Hampshire Police Department in 1990 as a patrol \nofficer. He was promoted to patrol supervisor in 1991, sergeant in \n1996, lieutenant in 1999, captain in 2002, and deputy chief in 2004. \nJim was appointed Lebanon's chief of police on March 1, 2006.\n  During his long career as a public safety professional, Chief \nAlexander has been a leader in promoting community-oriented policing, \nimproving public safety within the State of New Hampshire, and \npromoting sound public policies and practices, which have helped keep \nNew Hampshire one of the safest States in the Nation. Chief Alexander \nhas worked tirelessly with his peers and with other public safety \nofficials to better the administration of justice. He is well known for \nhis collaboration with local, county, State, and Federal law \nenforcement agencies. He was recognized in 2007 with the Community \nHealth Leadership Award, and in 2009 he received recognition for his \nextraordinary commitment and contributions to the Grafton County Drug \nCourt Program. Under his leadership, the Lebanon, NH, Police Department \nwas cited for the extraordinary assistance provided to the U.S. \nMarshals Service in helping to successfully end a dangerous 9-month-\nlong standoff with convicted antigovernment activists.\n  As Chief Alexander celebrates his retirement, I commend him on a job \nwell done. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him, his wife Deb, \nand their adult children, Nick and Jacqui, well in all future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S941-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S941-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/27/senate-section/article/S941-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read twice and placed on the calendar pursuant \nto the order of February 14, 2013, as modified on February 26, 2013:\n\n       S. 16.

A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of a National Women's History Museum, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Women's \nHistory Museum Commission Act of 2013, a bill that would create a \ncommission to evaluate and plan the establishment of a museum dedicated \nto women's history in our Nation's capital city. I appreciate the co-\nsponsorship of Senators Milkulski, Murkowski, Klobuchar, Ayotte, \nStabenow, Shaheen, Murray, Landrieu, Boxer, and Feinstein. \n  American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in \nsuch diverse fields as government, business, medicine, law, literature, \nsports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. The need for a \nmuseum recognizing the contributions of American women is long overdue.\n  In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American \nhistory concluded that: ``Efforts to implement an appropriate \ncelebration of women's history in the next millennium should include \nthe designation of a focal point for women's history in our Nation's \nCapital.''\n  Although Congress has made commendable provisions for the National \nMuseum for African American History and Culture, the National Law \nEnforcement Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, \nthere is still no institution in the capital region dedicated to \nwomen's role in our country's history.\n  This National Women's History Museum Commission Act would be a good \nstep toward rectifying this oversight. The legislation is very \nstraightforward and would simply establish a commission, similar to \nwhat was done for the African American History and Culture Museum, to \ndevelop a feasible plan for the establishment of such a museum in here \nin Washington, D.C. However, unlike previous museum commissions, \ntaxpayers will not shoulder the funding of this project. The proposed \nlegislation calls for the commission to fund its own costs.\n  A museum dedicated to women's history would help ensure that future \ngenerations understand what we owe to the many generations of American \nwomen who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society. These \nkey moments in history deserve a museum, which would present the \nstories of pioneering women like abolitionist Harriet Tubman, founder \nof the Girl Scouts Juliette Gordon Low, Supreme Court Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, astronaut Sally Ride, and Maine Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith.\n  Of special pride to the State of Maine is a legendary predecessor in \nthe Senate seat I now hold: Margaret Chase Smith who was the first \nwoman nominated for President of the United States by a major political \nparty, and the first woman elected to both houses of Congress. Senator \nSmith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and enjoyed bipartisan \nrespect over her long career for her independence, integrity, wisdom, \nand courage. She remains my role model and, through the example of her \npublic service, an exemplar of the virtues that would be honored in the \nNational Women's History Museum.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Women's History \n     Museum Commission Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
