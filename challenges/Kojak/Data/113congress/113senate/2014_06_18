Over the last several days the world has looked in horror \nas the terrorist organization ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and \nSyria, has swept across Iraq. As we speak they are sweeping even closer \nto Baghdad. They are murdering and they are pillaging. The group is now \npositioned outside Baghdad. It threatens to unleash its violent \nextremism on the capital of Iraq. ISIS poses a threat to Iraq and the \nsurrounding region--and that is an understatement.\n  As President Obama and his advisors consider options to combat the \nthreat, conservative Members of Congress--or I should say Republican \nMembers of Congress and their pundit cheerleaders--are more interested \nin playing their favorite game--their favorite game: blame Obama. It \ndoesn't matter what it is, it is his fault for putting people's lives \nin jeopardy--our military, special forces. The FBI captured someone who \nwas the ringleader of the Libya Benghazi attack. They have criticized \nthe President for bringing this man to justice.\n  Yesterday I listened with dismay when the Republican leader suggested \nand claimed that President Obama prematurely withdrew troops from Iraq. \nThink about that for a minute--5,500 dead Americans, tens of thousands \nwounded. Thousands and thousands have been wounded grievously.\n  I ask my friend and Republicans he leads, would they have preferred \nthe United States stay in Iraq? Would they have preferred our soldiers \nhave stayed in Iraq in harm's way? Is he--are they, the Republicans--\nwilling to risk more American lives?\n  The Republican leader and other Republicans seem to have forgotten \nwhy President Obama initiated the troop drawdown in June of 2009. Why? \nThe Iraqis wanted us out. The Iraqi government didn't want American \nforces to stay. Is the Republican leader and the Republicans he leads \nsuggesting that American servicemembers should risk their lives even \nmore, even as the Iraqi people were telling our military to leave?\n  What has been taking place in Iraq is a civil war. Do the Republicans \nand their leader believe that service men and women from Kentucky and \nthe other 49 States across this great country should be inserted in the \nmiddle of their civil war? I don't think so. Fighting between factions \nin Iraq has cost thousands of Iraqi and American lives over the last \ndecade, and it spawned a new breed of terrorism now. Yet the original \narchitects of the war--of the invasion of Iraq--would have us believe \nthat this is all President Obama's fault. Think about that.\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\n  Is there anything further from the truth?\n  I don't think so. This is an Iraqi civil war, and it is time for the \nIraqis to resolve it themselves. Those who attack President Obama for \nbringing our troops home from Iraq are wrong and out of step with the \nAmerican people. After a decade of war the American people have had \nenough. American families have had enough. I do not support in any way \nputting our men and women in the midst of this civil war in Iraq. It is \nnot in the national security interests of our country. It is not worth \nthe blood of American soldiers. It is not worth the monetary cost to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Rather than spending hundreds of billions of dollars--the war in Iraq \nis at about $1.5 trillion. Rather than spending more money doing that--\nfighting George W. Bush's war--how about we use that money to rebuild \nour Nation's infrastructure--roads, bridges, dams, water systems, sewer \nsystems. We have a deficit in infrastructure of trillions of dollars.\n  How about doing a better job of educating our children? Maybe we \ncould raise the minimum wage or give the long-term unemployed \nunemployment compensation or maybe we could help men and women draw the \nsame amount of money for doing the same work or maybe we could fully \nfund the Veterans' Administration and ensure that our veterans--more \nthan a million have come back from Iraq--are getting the care they need \nand deserve. Instead of addressing these issues at home, they are stuck \nin the same game. And it is not blame Obama; this is a new one--new \nyesterday or the day before. They are stuck listening to the very same \nneocons--obviously, that is where the Republicans are getting their \ninformation again--the same neocons who pushed us into the Iraq war in \nthe first place, as they try to plunge our military in yet another \nforeign misadventure.\n  What is absurd is the fact that after all these years their \nsuggestions haven't changed. They are in a time warp. Those who are the \nso-called experts are so eager to commit American soldiers to another \nwar. Why is their advice so valuable?\n  Take President Bush's Paul Wolfowitz, who some say was the architect \nof the war. He has accused President Obama recently of not taking a \nstrong position in Iraq. Wolfowitz took a strong position on Iraq's \nsectarian violence when he stated--listen to this bizarre statement--\nand this is a quote: ``There's been none of the record in Iraq of \nethnic militias fighting one another.'' No, only for centuries. Look at \nwhat he said: There is none of the record in Iraq of militias fighting \neach other. That is Wolfowitz.\n  How about Bill Kristol--not the comedian. He is a writer. Bill \nKristol is another one of the architects of the Iraq war who infamously \npredicted that American soldiers would be welcomed as liberators in \nIraq. He said the war would last 2 months. Well, he was only wrong by \nabout 9 years and 10 months. Kristol also claimed there was no evidence \nof discord among Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq. No? Only centuries of \ndiscord--centuries. Yet even in light of this incorrect assertion about \nIraq, Kristol went on to say that we need to have more fighting in \nIraq, beating the drum alongside all the neoconservative friends.\n  This morning there was an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal. Who \nwould write that? How about Dick Cheney? Just to remind everyone, he is \nthe former Vice President of the United States, who clearly was the \nchief architect of the war. If there is one thing this country does not \nneed, it is that we should be taking advice from Dick Cheney on wars. \nBeing on the wrong side of Dick Cheney is being on the right side of \nhistory.\n  To the architects of the Iraq war, who are now so eager to offer \ntheir expert analysis, I say thanks but no thanks. Unfortunately, we \nalready tried it your way, and it was the biggest foreign policy \nblunder in the history of the country. Now people come back and say \nthey can give me some examples that have been worse, and I listen. But \nfor me--I know a little bit about history--this was a foreign policy \nblunder that would be hard to take away from being the number one \nforeign policy blunder in the history of the country.\n  President Obama and his military advisors are considering their \noptions to address ISIS, but putting combat troops back in Iraq isn't \none of them. I have no doubt that President Obama and America will meet \nthis threat head-on without the advice of Wolfowitz, Cheney, Kristol--\nthe architects of the invasion of Iraq. President Obama will meet the \nthreat with the same smart foreign policy which has been the hallmark \nof his administration. The President will continue to identify and \nprotect what is truly in our national security interests, using our \nfull array of national security tools and standing up to terrorism \nwhere it threatens our national stability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3774-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For 5\\1/2\\ years the Obama administration and its \nallies in Congress have sought cover for their disastrous economic \nagenda with routine broadsides against an endless procession of straw \nmen. It is hard to recall a single speech from a Democratic leader in \nWashington that didn't involve some spirited defense of a principle \nnobody ever challenged or some attack on a villain that doesn't exist. \nInstead of working with us on ideas that would actually do something to \nalleviate the concerns and anxieties of the middle class, these \nDemocratic leaders have been blissfully content to play politics year \nafter year after year.\n  Instead of delivering relief, they have delivered a steady diet of \nbad political theater day in and day out with the same ridiculous and \npredictable moral every single time: Democrats care. So vote for them \nand all will be well.\n  If you haven't noticed, all is not well for working families in this \ncountry. Four years after administration officials trumpeted ``recovery \nsummer'' in June 2010, working men and women in this country are more \nanxious about work and family and the high cost of living--and that is \nto say nothing of the millions who can't find work at all.\n\n  The White House knows all of this, and that is why they are planning \nto hold a summit on the topic next week. They want everyone to think \nthey are on the case, that they have a plan, but what they don't seem \nto realize is nobody believes them anymore and that folks have moved \non.\n  The sad truth is most of the folks I have talked to are convinced \ngovernment is working against them, not for them. I don't blame them. \nWhether it is frustration over an absurdly complicated Tax Code that \ndrains people of their time and energy or just a general sense that \ngovernment programs are rigged to help the well-off and well-connected, \nan increasing number of our constituents don't even think government is \ncapable--let alone interested--in making their lives any easier these \ndays. It is a shame because while the Obama administration has been \nplaying politics, Republicans have been quietly assembling a lot of \ngood ideas to help Americans deal with the stresses of a modern \neconomy.\n  All of these ideas are consistent with our party's longstanding \ncommitment to the principles of upward mobility, shared responsibility \nfor the weak, and a strong but limited central government. Every single \none of them deserves a vote.\n  For my part, I have pressed for legislation that addresses a variety \nof concerns of the people in my State. The Family Friendly and \nWorkplace Flexibility Act, which I introduced with Senator Ayotte, \nwould enable working mothers to enter into a voluntary agreement with \ntheir employers whereby they could bank overtime compensation in the \nform of time off with their families. It would give families the \nchoice, not just the employer.\n  Another bill I will introduce today will fix a flaw in the Tax Code \nso men or women who work at home are not prevented from claiming a \ndeduction for a home office if that office includes a baby crib so they \ncan take care of their child while working. The Working Parents Home \nOffice Act would not only help parents save on childcare costs, it \nwould help increase their earning potential by incentivizing them to \ncreate new income streams from home.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  For parents worried about failing schools for their children, Senator \nKirk introduced the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter \nSchools Act--a bill that would provide more and better educational \nchoices and some much needed compensation for teachers unions that too \noften put their own interests above those of our children.\n  Then there is the National Right to Work Act, a bill I cosponsored \nwith Senator Paul, which will eliminate a Federal rule that requires \nemployees of certain companies to join a union or pay union dues \nwhether they want to or not. Lifting this rule would vastly increase \njob opportunities in my State for women and men who want to work but \ncan't find it, especially in the area of manufacturing.\n  The senior Senator from Maine has a proposal that would repeal a \nsenseless provision in ObamaCare that is incentivizing employers all \nacross the country to limit their employees to 30 hours a week.\n  The junior Senator from Nebraska has a bill--the Workplace \nAdvancement Act--that would further equip women in the workplace with \nthe knowledge and tools they need to fight employer discrimination.\n  The junior Senator from Florida has a bill--the RAISE Act--that would \namend the National Labor Relations Act to allow employers to give \nmerit-based pay increases to employees who are currently prohibited \nfrom receiving them because of outdated labor rules, and the junior \nSenator from Utah has a number of good proposals in a variety of areas.\n  These are just a few of the very good ideas that Members of my \nconference have put together to address the concerns and anxieties of \nworking men and women whose wages have remained stubbornly flat during \nthe Obama years, even as the cost of everything from college tuition to \nhealth care continues to soar. There are many others, including bills \npassed by the House that the Democratic majority in the Senate \ncontinues to block.\n  I am very proud of the work so many of my colleagues have done in \nputting all this legislation together. This morning some of us will \npresent a number of these ideas at a press conference to draw attention \nto the urgent needs of our constituents and the short-sightedness of \nthe majority leader in blocking our ideas to address them. Every one of \nthese Republican ideas is meant to address some common concern of \nworking families in our country, but none of them ever get a vote \nbecause it would not fit the story line Washington Democrats are \npeddling.\n  Apparently Senate Democrats would rather people didn't know \nRepublicans have been working overtime behind the scenes to make their \nlives easier or paychecks bigger for working moms and recent college \ngraduates. They would rather people didn't even know about these or \ndozens of other ideas we have that are aimed at making life a little \neasier for middle-class Americans, because if they did, they might \nrealize there is an entirely different approach to the problems that \nhave been plaguing this economy for years now and choose it over \ntheirs.\n  What Republicans have been saying is that there are a number of \nthings we can do right now to help folks deal with the pressures they \nface every day in this economy. We have been talking about these ideas \nfor years, and we will be talking about them later today because 5\\1/2\\ \nyears into the Obama economy Americans are eager for some fresh \nthinking. They are tired of the same old big government solutions that \nonly make life harder and more complicated. They are tired of a \nDemocratically controlled Senate that will not allow a debate or a vote \non any of our better proposals.\n  Most of our constituents are thinking about long commutes, shrinking \nbudgets, obscenely high tuition and health care bills. They think about \nhow nice it would be to have some more flexibility at work. They are \nfrustrated with a Tax Code that seems to punish their efforts to make a \nlittle bit more money for their family, and they are not getting \nanything from the White House but empty rhetoric and more of the same.\n  Today Republicans are reminding people there is another way. While \nDemocrats have been plotting ways to hold on to their majority, we have \nbeen listening to the concerns and anxieties of our constituents and \nfiguring out new, creative ways to address them.\n  It is long past time we had a real debate in this country, instead of \nthe false choice Democrats constantly present to the public between \ntheir own failed ideas and some political villain that doesn't exist. \nIt is time Americans saw the real choice before them, and once they do, \nI think the choice will be an easy one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3775-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3775-S3776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    MASTER SERGEANT AARON C. TORIAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning I wish to commemorate the \nlife and service of a brave U.S. marine from Paducah, KY, MSgt Aaron C. \nTorian. This highly accomplished marine was tragically killed on \nFebruary 15, 2014, from injuries sustained during combat training \noperations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was 36 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Master Sergeant Torian received many \nmedals, awards, and decorations--including the Purple Heart, the Navy \nCommendation Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device, the Navy and \nMarine Corps Achievement Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon with Gold \nStar, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with three stars, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, \nand the Good Conduct Medal.\n  When he was 28, Master Sergeant Torian was named the Second Marine \nDivision's Noncommissioned Officer of the Year. It is a high honor. \nThis distinction recognizes marines who excel in physical fitness, \nleadership skills, and tactical and technical proficiency. Receiving it \nmade Aaron a role model for hundreds of NCOs in the Second Marine \nDivision.\n  At the time he won the award, he simply said:\n\n       I had to step up. I just figured that this is what I'd \n     joined the Marine Corps to do, and so I always did it 100 \n     percent.\n\n  ``His work ethic was remarkable,'' says Aaron's mother Esta Smith. \nShe said:\n\n       He was a warrior as a marine. . . . He ultimately gave \n     everything for his country and he never put himself anything \n     but last. He gave everything because he loved his country.\n\n  Born in 1977, Aaron was a native of Paducah and grew up in the region \nbefore his family moved to Maryland. Aaron graduated from Thomas Stone \nHigh School in Waldorf, MD, where he was a star athlete in baseball and \nfootball. He was awarded a football scholarship to the University of \nTennessee at Martin, where he graduated in 2001. Aaron then went on to \nearn a master's degree in instructional leadership at Tennessee Tech in \n2003.\n  Aaron's time at Tennessee Tech was notable for a few other reasons \nbesides his degree. He worked as a graduate assistant football coach, \nand he also met the woman who would become his wife, Jurley Pomeroy. \nTogether the couple had three children.\n  ``He was a great dad and always everything his children needed him to \nbe,'' says his wife Jurley. ``When he got off the plane, being the best \ndad and best husband was his number-one priority.''\n  Aaron joined the Marine Corps in 2003 and promoted to Master Sergeant \nin September of 2013. In addition to being a wonderful father and \nhusband and an exemplary marine, he was a faithful member of College \nAcres Baptist Church in Wilmington, NC. He was a community volunteer \nfor his local college baseball grounds crew and also at the St. \nNicholas Greek Orthodox Church annual Greek festival.\n  Aaron's mother said:\n\n       Aaron held on to the thing he believed in: faith, love, and \n     freedom. . . . The conversation was always about how blessed \n     he felt and how he thanked God for his beautiful family. \n     Humility was the definition of Aaron.\n\n  Aaron's final deployment was his sixth in total. He served two tours \nin Iraq and four in Afghanistan. At the time of his final deployment, \nhe was assigned to the Second Marine Special Operations Battalion, \nMarine Special Operations Regiment, U.S. Marine\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nCorps Forces Special Operations Command based out of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  In late February of this year, Master Sergeant Torian was laid to \nrest with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Just \nlast month at the Memorial Day ceremonies in Aaron's native McCracken \nCounty, KY, county officials unveiled a commemorative street sign for \nMSgt Aaron C. Torian. For 1 year it will be displayed in front of the \ncounty courthouse and then placed permanently at a location of his \nfamily members' choosing.\n  ``Thank God for the blessing and honor of allowing me to be your \nmom,'' says Aaron's mother Esta. ``Semper Fi--always faithful. My son, \nyou are a true American hero.''\n  We are thinking of Aaron's family today as I share his story with my \nSenate colleagues, including his wife Jurley, his children Elijah, \nLaura Bella, and Avery, his mother and stepfather Esta and Jim Smith, \nhis father Joe Torian, and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  I want the family of MSgt Aaron C.

Mr. President, we bring to the floor our fiscal year \n2015 spending bill, but before the Republican leader leaves, as the \nSenator from Maryland, I too would like to join with great respect in \ncondolences for Master Sergeant Torian's family. For all of us who are \nSenators who have constituent families where people have died, we have \nto be in this together.\n  These are times when we are not the Republican Party or the \nDemocratic Party. We are not red or blue. We have to be red, white, and \nblue. From this side of the aisle to that side of the aisle, Godspeed \nto his family, and I thank the Senator for bringing this wonderful \nyoung man to the attention of the Senate. Those remarks were quite \npoignant and moving.\n  We have to stand by those families--the widow, the children who will \nneed an education, and let's do it shoulder to shoulder.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for \nher additional comments about this wonderful young man.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we bring to the floor on a \nbipartisan basis the annual appropriation bills of the Commerce-\nJustice-Science bill, the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development, and also the Agriculture, Rural Development, and \nFood and Drug Administration. I wish to thank all of the members of the \nAppropriations Committee for their tremendous work on these bills. \nFirst, I wish to say a special word about my vice chairman Richard \nShelby, who has done the hard work and the due diligence of helping \nmove the entire process but also moving, in particular, our bill that \nfunds the Commerce Department, Justice Department, and the science \nprograms, such as our space program.\n\n  In terms of transportation, we have the able leadership of Senator \nMurray, with her vice chairman Senator Collins; and on agriculture, \nchairman Mark Pryor and, again, his vice chairman Roy Blunt.\n  This process is about moving America forward. This legislation we are \nputting before the Senate today puts America's middle-class families \nfirst, creating opportunity by creating jobs today.\n  With investments in physical infrastructure in the transportation and \nhousing bill, we are building roads and bridges, repairing them, and \nupdating transit lines and rail lines, so we literally and figuratively \ncan keep America on the move. At the same time we are also meeting \nAmerica's compelling human needs with our investment in home ownership \nas well as in housing and in urban and economic development.\n  We also create jobs tomorrow with investments in research and \ndiscovery. What we do in these important science agencies is drive \ninnovation, leading to new products and new jobs. And guess what. \nScience saves lives.\n  When we look at Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations, we see that \nwe fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--a lot of \nwords with a lot of alphabet, synonyms and acronyms and so on.\n  At the end of the day, we fund the weather service. What does the \nweather service do? They predict weather. They predict immediate \nweather, such as is it going to rain this afternoon, and they predict \nweather emergencies, whether we are going to have a tornado.\n  Our hearts go out, again, on the other side of the aisle, to the \npeople of Kansas, where they were hit by a double tornado--an \nunprecedented weather event. They are calling it the twin sisters, \nreferring to what happened in Nebraska. They were the ugly sisters, but \nthey were made less ugly because of the way the weather service could \nhelp alert the people in that community. That is what we fund.\n  We protect the American people by making sure we fight crime and \nterrorism by funding Federal law enforcement; by making sure our \nmedicines and medical devices are safe by funding the Food and Drug \nAdministration; and we meet compelling human needs, whether we are \ntalking about affordable housing or affordable food.\n  While we do it, we are also reforming the agencies. Sure, people talk \nabout appropriators as spenders, but we have a sense in this committee \non both sides of the aisle--and I must say that Senator Shelby has \nhelped lead this--that we need to be a more frugal government. We need \nto get value for our dollar, demonstrating that we need to be able to \nsave money or use money. We are going to spend very wisely.\n  It has been 3 years since we were able to bring an appropriations \nbill to the floor. I am not going to go into all the reasons why. \n``Why'' doesn't get the job done. What we need to do is return to \nregular order. So what does that mean? Today we have these three bills \npending. It means we want to enact all of our appropriations bills by \nOctober 1. We want to keep government operating not on autopilot, not \non shutdown, nor on lavish spending. We have to reduce our Federal \ndeficit, but we also have to reduce other deficits, particularly in the \narea of deficits related to innovation as well as the fact that our \ncrime rates are on the rise in many cities and we need to reduce them. \nThe American people today want to make sure we have a government they \ncan count on. But they need to count on the fact that not only are we \nopen and doing business but that when we are, we are smarter about it.\n  Vice Chairman Shelby and I have been working on a bipartisan basis. \nWe have been working on a bicameral basis. That means hands across the \naisle, hands across the dome to restore regular order and civility in \nthis process.\n  I look forward to moving this bill. I would say to my colleagues who \nare listening, many of my colleagues saw a few months ago the way \nSenator Lamar Alexander, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Richard Burr, and \nI moved a bipartisan bill on the child care and development block \ngrant. That had not been reauthorized since 1996, but we showed we \ncould do it. We cleared 18 amendments. We actually had votes on \namendments. We had an open process where amendments could be offered, \ndiscussed, debated, and at the end of the day voted on because we had a \nprocess that worked. As Senators\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nwho worked together, we were able to pass that bill.\n  Senator Shelby and I are providing leadership today to be able to do \nthat. So we ask our colleagues to support us in coming to an agreement \non the motion to proceed so that we can move ahead on this bill. We are \nmaking progress. There are several bills we have already moved out of \nthe committee, and we will be moving more. But right now, today, we \nwant to move these three bills and do it in a way that we are proud of \nwhat we do, we are proud of our process, we are proud of our conduct, \nand we are proud that we did it in the right way, with debate, \ndiscussion, and the votes that are required.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this morning I wish to join my longtime \ncolleague and friend, the senior Senator from Maryland and chair of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Senator Barbara Mikulski, in \nsupporting the consideration of three bills before us today. All three \nbills received strong bipartisan support at the full Committee on \nAppropriations level.\n  I am pleased we have begun to reestablish regular order in the \nappropriations process. We started that last year, and we need to \ncontinue it, and we are.\n  After the uncertainty of sequestration and last year's disagreement \nover the Budget Control Act caps, this past December's Murray-Ryan \nbudget deal provided the clarity needed to move us toward a regular \nbudget and a regular appropriations process. The Murray-Ryan deal, \nwhich became the Bipartisan Budget Act, provided a compromise solution \nthat ended the congressional deadlock over top-line discretionary \nspending.\n  While I appreciate that the chairwoman was operating in a tight \nfiscal environment, we did not ultimately agree everywhere on how to \nallocate funds within the new caps. All 14 Republican members of the \nAppropriations Committee wrote to the chair on May 21 of this year \nexpressing our concerns over the use of budgetary mechanisms in \nsubcommittee allocations. In that letter we also stated and we continue \nto express our opposition to increasing the level of total CHIMPs in \nthe Federal discretionary budget beyond current levels.\n  While we continue to have concerns about how the majority reached \ntotal 302(b) allocations, the bills before us today for the most part \nreached their allocations by making tough choices; that is, shifting \nresources from lower to higher priority programs.\n  The allocations for the CJS, transportation and housing, and \nAgriculture bills conform to the intent of the Murray-Ryan deal. Both \nthe Commerce-Justice-Science bill and the Agriculture bill actually \ndecrease spending compared to the current enacted levels, while still \nbeing sufficient to meet the needs of the agencies. I am pleased to \nhave worked with the chairwoman to ensure that the CJS bill \nsuccessfully balanced the important and competing interests of law \nenforcement, scientific advancement, and U.S. competitiveness. The \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development bill has a moderate \nincrease of only 1.4 percent, after taking into account the \nscorekeeping difference between OMB and CBO on FHA loan receipts.\n  I believe passing these funding measures will give Congress a voice \nin government spending that it was constitutionally intended to have. \nInstead of ceding spending discretion to the executive branch or simply \nlocking in place priorities that have become outdated--as a continuing \nresolution would do--this bill includes hundreds of limits on how \ntaxpayer dollars can be spent. While I might not agree with every item \nin each bill, I think we have found solid middle ground upon which both \nsides of the aisle can comfortably stand.\n  Once again, I thank the chair, Senator Mikulski, for her willingness \nto work together, and I encourage my colleagues to come to the floor \nand offer their amendments so we can debate the merits of them.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the vice chairman for his \nremarks. I think he makes excellent points. We had a tough top line to \nmeet. The CBO score--these budgets speak words that people are trying \nto follow. The Congressional Budget Office actually says how much \nthings will cost, and when they took a look at what our FHA program and \ncertain mortgage rates would cost, they found out we overestimated \nrevenue by $4 billion. That is a lot of money even by Washington \nstandards. So we had to adjust accordingly, and it has not been easy.\n  I will tell my colleagues that we are now coming down to talk about \nwhere we really are now--what are the agencies we want to fund, why we \nwant to fund them at the amount we do, and what problems they actually \nsolve for the American people. The American people have a right to ask \nat the end of the day not ``did you spend money'' but ``what did you \nspend it on and what did we get for it? Are we a stronger country? Do \nwe have a better economy? Do our children have a brighter future? Are \nwe meeting compelling human needs?'' I think in these three bills the \nanswer is yes.\n  When we look at Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations, we want to \ntell our colleagues what we have done. It really funds several \ndifferent agencies, and it comes to a total of $51.2 billion. It is \nconsistent with the CJS allocation, and it is $398 million less--I want \nto say this clearly. What we are doing in the Commerce-Justice-Science \nbill, we are spending less money than we did last year, but we think we \nare getting more value for the dollar. We are $398 million below what \nwe spent last year, but at the same time we have kept our communities \nsafe, we have promoted jobs, and we have promoted innovation.\n  We used our spending to guide Federal decisions from Federal law \nenforcement to space exploration. The CJS bill provides $28 billion for \nthe Justice Department. This is $260 million more than 2014. We did \nthis because we believe the Justice Department is an agency that people \nin local communities feel they need to be able to count on. It keeps \nAmerica safe from crime and terrorism. It protects communities at the \nlocal level. It protects families against domestic violence and sexual \npredators. And the job of the Justice Department is to administer \njustice fairly.\n  This bill funds key law enforcement and prosecution agencies. What do \nwe mean by that? Federal law enforcement is made up of the FBI, the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. \nattorneys who actually prosecute the bad guys or the bad gals for \neverything from mortgage fraud, to cyber terrorism, to drug dealing and \ndrug cartels, so they can keep us safe from all of this, protecting us \nagainst gangs, drug dealers. Why is it important? Federal law \nenforcement goes after gang activity, fraudsters trying to be more \npredatory.\n  What is the result in this funding? We have done a lot. In my own \nhome State of Maryland, over the last year our Federal law enforcement \nhas arrested 280 violent fugitives. Federal law enforcement brought \ndown child pornographers and traffickers, bank robbers, and took a big \nwhack at the heroin trafficking rings. I am really proud of them. I am \nproud of what they do in Maryland, and I am proud of what they do \naround the world.\n  Look at how our FBI, working with our special operations, brought to \nheel and brought into our custody one of the men who killed our Embassy \npersonnel in Benghazi. Let's do a big hurrah for the FBI and special \nops, but let's do our hurrah not only with words but putting the money \nin the Federal checkbook so they get to be able to continue to do the \njob of keeping America safe.\n  There are many other aspects of this bill that are important. This is \nwhy we look out for our State and local departments.\n  We have also put in an important investment in the Violence Against \nWomen Act. We are spending $430 million to give grants to prevent and \nprosecute domestic violence and also to be able to deal and help with \nrape victims.\n  This bill puts money in the Federal checkbook to put more police \nofficers on the beat. But I like the fact that we are actually \nprotecting them with more bulletproof vests and being able to do other \nwork.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\n  This bill also addresses the backlog of sexual assaults, making sure \nwe test no matter where they are. We have seen time and time again that \nevidence is gathered and that somehow or another it is in some box in \nsome lab or some police department. Rape victims cannot be dually \nassaulted--one by the predator who attacked them and then by a \nlackluster prosecutorial system. If you gather the evidence, test it \nand use it to make sure we have the right predator. Prosecute the \npredator. See if they are a serial predator. Let's not doubly assault \nthe victim by not only what happened to them on the street but also \nwhat happens to them in the criminal justice system.\n  So we are doing a lot. I feel very strongly about this, but I also \nfeel very strongly about the need to create jobs. This bill provides \n$8.6 billion for the Department of Commerce, which helps them protect \nour patents, promotes trade and economic development. It helps our \ncoastal economies with sustainable fisheries and healthy oceans. It \nexports American goods and services and supports more than 11 million \njobs.\n  This bill does a lot by putting our Commercial Service officers--\nthose who actually work in embassies--to work, with business to be able \nto help them. And we make sure they are not only in Europe but they are \nin Asia and Africa, where the new opportunities are.\n  Our dynamic Secretary of Commerce has focused on bringing foreign \ninvestments to the United States, and we have seen what they have meant \nto Maryland and what they have meant in Alabama and what they have \nmeant in America.\n  We also, through the Commerce Department, help with our weather \nbureau. I am going to say more about it, but what I want to talk about \nright now is the National Science Foundation--one of our other main \nagencies--because it does the basic research in science, technology, \nand engineering.\n  Then there is NASA. I am going to say more about NASA later. I know \nwe have others waiting to speak. For NASA, actually, we have done more \nthan what the President wanted to do because we wanted to have a \nbalanced space program. We have particularly emphasized human space \nflight, a reliable transportation system, and space science.\n  We have here where we are creating jobs, we are protecting people in \ntheir communities, and we are laying the groundwork for jobs of the \nfuture. There are many other issues I will talk about as the bill \nunfolds.\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked very closely with Senator Coburn. \nEverybody knows Senator Coburn prides himself on being a watchdog on \nFederal spending. And you know what. He has been. I love some of his \nideas; some give me a little pause. But we actually met. We actually \nmet to see what we could do to be able to reform our government so we \ncould get more value for the dollar. I am going to have a separate \nspeech just on that so the American people know, when they say ``Watch \nwhat you spend, Barb,'' I really am doing it. So is Senator Shelby. So \nare the members of our committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, again I rise today in support of, \nspecifically, the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill, where I \nam the ranking member for the Republicans.\n  I appreciate the leadership, as I have said earlier, of the chair on \nthis particular bill. We have worked together for many years. I chaired \nthis subcommittee at one time, and I believe the bill being considered \ntoday reflects a strong bipartisan effort.\n  The competing interests of the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill always prove challenging, but I believe this bill \nstrikes the appropriate balance.\n  The allocation for the CJS bill; that is, the Commerce-Justice-\nScience bill; is $51.2 billion, which is just below the fiscal year \n2014 enacted level--yes, below. Working within this allocation, we \nsought to balance priorities, hold agencies accountable for their work, \nand demand efficiencies to stretch limited Federal dollars. Ultimately, \nthese efforts ensure that Federal resources are spent efficiently and \neffectively.\n  The bill before us provides robust funding for the Department of \nJustice and law enforcement grant programs totaling $28 billion. It \nfocuses attention and resources on some of the most difficult issues \nplaguing the Nation, including human trafficking, gang violence, child \npredation, a growing heroin crisis, threats to cyber security, and \ndomestic terrorism.\n  Grant programs such as VALOR, Byrne, veterans courts, crime lab \nimprovements, violence against women, and the COPS Program will receive \nfunding to advance the important work being done at the State and local \nlevel in our Nation.\n  Moreover, the bill ensures that the Department maintains its focus on \nevidence-based programs and activities that have a proven record of \neffectiveness. This requirement emphasizes the committee's commitment \nto ensuring that Federal dollars are not just spent but are spent \nwisely.\n  The bill also includes $8.6 billion for the Department of Commerce, \nwhich is responsible for a range of issues, including weather \nforecasting, economic development, trade promotion, and fisheries \nconservation, among others.\n  The bill prioritizes resources to support NOAA's next generation of \nweather satellites that will enable the National Weather Service to \ncontinue to provide timely warnings for dangerous weather outbreaks \nthat we all experience. To ensure that these weather satellites stay on \nbudget and are delivered on time, the bill continues and expands \nstringent oversight requirements involving the inspector general. I \nbelieve our Nation cannot afford cost increases and schedule delays in \nthese programs, and we expect that these oversight requirements will \nhelp avoid such a scenario. These satellites are essential to weather \nforecasters across the country. Without them, forecasters would be \nunable to provide important warnings about devastating storms, tornado \noutbreaks, and hurricanes, putting the safety of the American people at \nrisk.\n  The bill also provides sufficient resources and direction to improve \nthe management of the Nation's fisheries, including new approaches to \nmanage red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico. These new approaches should \nprovide a more equitable system for commercial fishermen and increase \nthe number of fishing days for recreational anglers.\n  The bill also provides $18 billion for NASA, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. In order to preserve the planned launch \nschedule in 2017 for the heavy lift launch vehicle, or SLS, the bill \nincludes $1.7 billion for SLS rocket development, which is very \ncrucial. It also maintains focus on these efforts by requiring NASA to \nfollow its own internal guidance regarding joint confidence levels in \nfuture funding requests.\n  The bill also preserves important funding for ongoing activities of \nthe International Space Station and other vital science research \nmissions.\n  In addition, the bill safeguards the advancement of efforts underway \nto develop a U.S. vehicle to transport our astronauts to the space \nstation. I believe those efforts must continue in a transparent way to \nensure that the government is not saddled with mounting bills and no \nrecourse.\n  I commend the chair for working with me to include language that \nrequires certified cost and pricing data for the crew vehicle \ndevelopment contract. The goal of the language is not to up-end a \nfixed-price contract; rather, the goal is to make certain that the \nprice NASA has agreed to pay for vehicle development matches actual \ndevelopment expenditures. NASA and its contractors have a history of \ncost overruns and schedule delays, whether the contract has a fixed \nprice or not. With no other U.S.-based options to get to the space \nstation, I believe we cannot find ourselves at the eleventh hour with \nan overburdened program that requires a bailout to succeed.\n  Once again, these measures are included to ensure that the government \nis not just spending taxpayer money, but that it is doing so in a cost-\neffective manner.\n  I reiterate my belief that the bill reflects the Senate's priorities \nand the needs of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is now \nconsidering appropriations bills that fund important segments of our \nFederal Government. Those include the agencies responsible for \nscientific research, justice and nutrition programs, as well as the \nDepartments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.\n  It has been some time since we have been able to fund the operations \nof the government through regular order, so it is encouraging that \nleaders on both sides of the aisle have been able to work together now \nto pursue that goal.\n  As we are here today considering these bills, I think it is helpful \nto remember where we were at this time last year. We were unable to \nstart a budget conference. There was a government shutdown looming just \na few months ahead, and businesses and families across the country had \nabsolutely no certainty about whether their government could even keep \nthe lights on.\n  Today we have more certainty thanks to the 2-year budget agreement, \nand building on the bipartisan work we all did to reach that agreement, \nthe members of our committee, Senator Collins and I, have been able to \nput together a transportation and housing bill that makes responsible \ninvestments in infrastructure and community development and helps \nprotect the most vulnerable among us.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago the Appropriations Committee approved the \ntransportation and housing bill by a vote of 29 to 1--an extremely \nstrong show of bipartisan support. This bill received such remarkable \nsupport because it helps families and communities, it gets workers back \non the job, and it lays down a strong foundation for long-term and \nbroad-based economic growth. It does this in a manner that is fiscally \nresponsible, with growth of just a little more than 1 percent over the \nfiscal year 2014 level when looking at the program funding levels and \nfactoring in FHA receipts, which do vary from year to year. After \nadjusting for inflation, the funding in this bill is actually 2.5 \npercent less than what it was in fiscal year 2008, as a result of the \nspending cuts we have now applied to discretionary appropriations.\n  This bill is timely. It makes critical, targeted investments to \naddress concerns that have developed over the past year. In light of \nthe dramatic growth in domestic energy production, it includes new \nresources to strengthen oversight of energy shipments by rail to keep \nour communities safe, including funding for additional rail safety and \nhazardous materials inspectors, training for first responders, more \ntrack inspections, research into the volatility of crude oil, and \nrequirements for stronger tank car designs.\n  This bill includes $10 million to improve vehicle safety defects \nanalysis and investigation, to help ensure we do not see a repeat of \nthe Department of Transportation's failure to detect unsafe parts in \nGeneral Motors and other manufacturers' vehicles.\n  This bill provides an additional 10,000 vouchers to move us closer to \nfinally eliminating homelessness among our Nation's veterans. Due to \nthese investments, we have been able to reduce the number of homeless \nvets on our Nation's streets by 24 percent since 2010. We are well on \nour way to eliminating it altogether.\n  Our bill includes direction to help communities implement the \nViolence Against Women Act in Federal housing programs as well as \nresources to improve coordination between housing programs and domestic \nviolence survivors services. It makes it possible for HUD to support \nyouth aging out of foster care, giving them more time to find stability \nand save money, thereby helping to reduce the elevated risk of \nhomelessness facing those vulnerable young people.\n  This bill invests in our communities. It provides $3 billion for \ncommunity development grants to State and local governments to help \ncommunities fund projects that meet their unique needs and support \nefforts to create jobs and $950 million for the HOME Program to help \ncreate affordable housing.\n  It ensures the FAA has sufficient funding to continue rebuilding its \nworkforce after the disruptive effects of last year's sequestration. It \nfully funds the FAA's airport grants and research programs as well as \nthe contract towers and Essential Air Service Program that so many of \nour rural communities depend on.\n  It includes sufficient funding for HUD's house and homeless \nassistance program, to preserve this vital piece of the Nation's safety \nnet. More than half of the 5.4 million very low-income households that \ndepend upon the housing assistance provided in this bill include \nsomeone elderly, disabled, or both. Without these programs, many of \nthese individuals would be homeless.\n  The bill includes $90 million for Choice Neighborhoods. That is a \nprogram that helps tear down and rebuild distressed public housing as \nwell as language making it possible for more local authorities to \naccess private capital through the Rental Assistance Demonstration to \nrenovate our aging housing stock. Notably, it includes reforms to make \nthe programs in this bill more accountable and more effective. These \ninclude provisions to make it easier for public housing authorities to \nmanage their capital and operations needs as well as resources for HUD \nto use the lessons it has learned since Hurricane Katrina to develop \ntemplates that communities can quickly implement to speed recovery \neffectively following a disaster.\n  The bill streamlines environmental reviews for Native American \nhousing. It works to ensure accountability for property owners who do \nnot maintain the quality of their HUD assisted housing. It increases \naccountability in the CDBG Program.\n  That is our bill. We do make tough choices. To fund increases for \ninflation and other uncontrollable costs, we made the very difficult \nchoice of trimming funding for programs that Members care about, \nincluding the TIGER and HOME Program. In short, this bill is a good \nbill.\n  I note that most of the transportation funding, a total of just over \n$50 billion, comes from our highway trust fund. As we all know, right \nnow, the highway trust fund is headed toward a crisis. The Department \nof Transportation expects the balances in this fund to reach critical \nlevels later this summer. To deal with this uncertainty, States now are \nalready bracing for the worst-case scenario. Some States such as \nArkansas have already put their projects on hold. This crisis could \nalso hurt workers in the construction industry who depend on jobs to \nrepair our roads and bridges.\n  If Congress does not act, a shortfall in the highway trust fund will \nput at risk the funding we have included here in our THUD bill. We need \nimmediate action to solve that crisis well before October when the new \nfiscal year starts. We need to work together to avoid that unnecessary \nand preventable crisis. In the meantime, I am glad we are turning to \nthe transportation and housing bill and getting the work of the \nAppropriations Committee done.\n  Together with the Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, I encourage \nMembers to bring their amendments to the floor and to work with us to \nmake it even better. This bill enjoys broad bipartisan support, because \nit takes a practical approach to addressing the real needs we find in \nthe transportation and housing sectors.\n  The investments it makes would improve safety, increase efficiency, \nand help our communities, and lay down a strong foundation for long-\nterm and broad-based economic growth and help position our country and \nour economy to compete in winning the 21st century global economy. I \nurge our colleagues to support our bipartisan bill. I hope we can move \nrapidly to final passage.\n  Before I yield, I do want to thank Chairman Mikulski for her support \nand leadership. As the former chair of the VA HUD subcommittee, she \nappreciates the importance of the investments in our bill. This bill \nincludes priorities of Members on both sides of the aisle, reflecting \nthe Appropriations Committee's bipartisan tradition.\n  I thank our entire committee for their work. I especially want to \ntake a moment to express my thanks to my ranking member Senator Collins \nand her staff for all of their hard work and cooperation throughout \nthis process. I am proud that together we have written a bill that \nworks for families and communities. Investing in families and \ncommunities and long-term economic growth should not be a partisan \nissue. I think the bipartisan work that went into this bill and the \nstrong support it received in committee proves it does not have to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am told the Senator from Washington \nState has a very brief statement she would like to make. I ask \nunanimous consent that she be allowed up to 3 minutes to make her \nstatement before I reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine. I will \nexplain to her later how Maine continues to play a very interesting \nrole in such an important issue.\n  (The further remarks of Ms. Cantwell are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to join with Chairman \nMurray as we hope to begin floor consideration of the bipartisan fiscal \nyear 2015 appropriations bill for Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies.\n  As usual, it has been a great pleasure to work with Chairman Murray. \nShe is extremely fair-minded and bipartisan in the approach she has \ntaken to this bill. I also thank her staff for working closely with my \nstaff as we sought to craft a bill that I believe deserves the support \nof all of our colleagues.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to thank Chairwoman Mikulski and \nVice Chairman Shelby for their extraordinary leadership in advancing \nthose three appropriations bills through what at times is turning out \nto be a daunting process. It is my hope and expectation that we can \ngive Members of this body the opportunity to debate all three of these \nbills, to offer amendments, and ultimately to pass them, and that we \nhave an open and transparent process.\n  I would encourage cooperation on both sides of the aisle. It is in \nthe best interests of this country for us to do our work in the regular \norder, in the normal process, and to pass these bills, and then to hold \nconferences with the House to iron out any differences.\n  Last week the House did approve its own version of the THUD \nappropriations bill. This is an important step in the process which \nwill eventually allow the two Chambers to meet in conference and \nproduce a final bill to send to the President for his signature. I \ncommend the leaders of the Appropriations Committee and also the floor \nleaders for making sure we have the time available to bring these bills \nto the floor.\n  There is no reason we cannot pass each one of the appropriations \nbills, have a conference with the House, and get them to the President \nbefore the start of the fiscal year so we can avoid gigantic omnibus \nbills that are a poor way to legislate or, even worse, continuing \nresolutions that lock into law increased costs and priorities that may \nno longer reflect today's needs.\n  The THUD bill before us today is essentially a jobs bill. It provides \n$54.4 billion in responsible investments in transportation and housing \nprograms, and it includes input from Members on both sides of the \naisle. Every Senator has unmet transportation and housing needs in his \nor her State, from crumbling roads and unsafe bridges to a growing \npopulation of vulnerable low-income families, seniors, and disabled \nindividuals in need of housing assistance.\n  Chairman Murray and I worked very hard to accommodate the input from \nmany Members. This bill we bring before you received overwhelming \nsupport in the full Appropriations Committee. In fact, as Chairman \nMurray mentioned, the vote was 29 to 1 to report this bill to the full \nSenate. It is essential to acknowledge that this year's THUD bill is \ndirectly affected by nearly a $3 billion reduction in Federal Housing \nAuthority receipts for fiscal year 2015. As a result, we were faced \nwith making very difficult decisions to ensure that the Federal \ninvestments in this bill were prioritized to meet the most critical \nneeds.\n  One of the most pressing issues this bill addresses has not received \na great deal of attention, so I want to spend a moment on it; that is, \nthe safe transportation of crude oil and other hazardous materials by \nrail. I know the Presiding Officer is very familiar with this issue. I \nam pleased to say our transportation bill strengthens three components \nto help ensure the safe transportation of crude oil and other hazardous \nmaterials. It focuses on prevention, mitigation, and response. If you \ntalk to any emergency responder, they will tell you those are the three \ncritical components.\n  We do so without adopting the President's poorly conceived proposal, \nwhich would have created yet another level of bureaucracy in the \nSecretary's office. Instead, we chose what I believe to be a wiser \ncourse. We provided funding directly to the agencies to support \nadditional rail inspectors, advance research efforts, and to establish \ncooperative training programs.\n  I know firsthand how horrific these disasters can be, because last \nyear there was a terrible derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, 30 miles \nfrom the border of Maine, that cost 47 lives and essentially destroyed \nthis picturesque village. I was very proud that 30 Maine firefighters \nresponded to the call for help from their Canadian counterparts.\n  Senator Murray and I held an oversight hearing to look at rail \nsafety, and the fire chief from Rangeley, ME, Tim Pellerin, testified \nbefore our committee at our oversight hearing. He provided gripping \ntestimony about this extraordinarily dangerous experience, as well as \nthoughtful recommendations about what should be done. I want to tell \nthe chief that we listened to him, and a lot of our recommendations in \nthe bill--particularly with regard to training--reflect the advice he \ngave us as a first responder on that very dangerous scene.\n  Turning to another issue, this bill provides $550 million for the \nTIGER Program, an effective initiative that helps advance \ntransportation infrastructure projects. We have seen firsthand how \nTIGER projects create good jobs and support economic growth in our home \nStates.\n  Turning now to air travel, the aviation investments included in our \nbill will continue to modernize our Nation's air traffic system. These \ninvestments are creating safer skies and a more efficient air space to \nmove the flying public.\n  In addition to transportation programs, our bill provides sufficient \nbut not generous funding to keep pace with the rising cost of housing \nvulnerable families. More than 4 million families will continue to \nreceive critical rental assistance for their housing. Without it, many \nof these families would otherwise become homeless.\n  Chairman Murray and I continue to share a strong commitment--indeed, \na passion--to reducing homelessness in this country. For that reason we \nhave included more than $2 billion for homeless assistance grants. \nSince 2010 we have reduced overall chronic homelessness by 16 percent \nand veterans homelessness by 24 percent.\n  These programs are working, and we have the data to prove it. That is \nwhy our bill builds on these successes and provides an additional \n10,000 HUD-VASH vouchers to serve our Nation's veterans.\n  We have an obligation to our Nation's veterans. That has been very \nmuch on our minds recently, and we can point with pride to the \nreduction by 24 percent in homelessness among veterans, but we want to \ncomplete the job. We don't want any veteran to be homeless, and we are \nmaking progress through this well-conceived program.\n  While our bill helps families in need and our Nation's veterans, it \nalso invests in our communities. Boosting local economies is critical \nto job creation and helping families obtain financial security. Our \nlegislation supports these local development efforts by providing more \nthan $3 billion for Community Development Block Grants.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer has had the experience, as most \nMembers have, of talking to State and local officials about the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program. It is an extremely popular \nprogram with States and communities because it allows them to tailor \nthe Federal funds to support locally driven economic and job-creation \nprojects. It isn't Washington telling them how this money should be \nspent but, rather, providing the flexibility so that they can meet \nlocal economic development needs and help to create new jobs.\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n  The bill before us does not solve all of the problems in either the \nDepartment of Transportation or in the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment; we don't have the money to do that.\n  Most notably, the administration's budget does not come up with a \nrealistic way to address the urgent need to prevent the highway trust \nfund from becoming insolvent in August.\n  There should be no doubt in the mind of any Member of this body, if \nthe administration and Congress do not take action before the August \nrecess, State departments of transportation will not be reimbursed for \nwork that has already been completed and new projects will likely grind \nto a halt and jobs, good construction jobs, will be lost.\n  The administration must present an achievable plan to avoid this \ndisruption, these lost jobs, these stalled transportation projects, and \nCongress must work in good faith to secure passage.\n  Transportation is the lifeline of our economy, supporting millions of \njobs and moving people and products. When coupled with the housing and \neconomic development projects, the fiscal year 2015 transportation and \nhousing appropriations bill will create jobs now when they are needed \nmost and will establish the foundation for future growth.\n  Just as important to our economic future, however, is reining in \nexcessive Federal spending and getting our national debt under control, \nwhich must be a priority governmentwide.\n  We have met the budget allocations that have been provided to us. In \nsetting priorities for fiscal year 2015, I believe our T-HUD bill \nstrikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and the \nnecessary fiscal restraint.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present this legislation to the \nMembers of this Chamber. As we continue the debate on these bills, I \nurge my colleagues to consider how important it is that we complete our \nwork on time, and I hope they will support the efforts of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                              NFL Football\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nbeing so kind.\n  There are 27 tribes in the State of Nevada, Native Americans. The \nissue regarding the name Redskins is very important to every one of \nthose tribes. Every time they hear this name, it is a sad reminder of a \nlong tradition of racism and bigotry.\n  A month or so ago, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the team, had some \npeople come to Nevada and agree to buy one of the Indian tribes a car \nif they would say nice things about the Redskins. They refused.\n  This is extremely important to Native Americans all over the country, \nthat they no longer use this name. It is racist.\n  Daniel Snyder says it is about tradition. I ask: What tradition? The \ntradition of racism, that is all this name leaves in its wake.\n  The writing is on the wall. The writing is on the wall in giant \nblinking neon lights. This name will change and justice will be done \nfor the tribes in Nevada and across the Nation who care so deeply about \nthis issue.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office today took away all the trademarks. \nThe Redskins no longer have trademarks. They are gone.\n  So as I understand the law, if the Presiding Officer wants to use the \nname Redskins and sell them shirts, she can do that. There is no \ntrademark anymore for the Redskins.\n  Daniel Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this, \nbut it is only a matter of time before he is forced to do what is right \nand change the name.\n  The leader on this issue is the junior Senator from the State of \nWashington. Senator Cantwell has been tireless in showing the American \npeople how unfair it is for the Redskins' name to be used as it is. I \nthink she is one of the leading causes that the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office said it is no longer--no longer--a trademark. They did \nthat this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I know Senator Collins and Senator \nMurray are leaving to go to the DOD to meet with Secretary Hagel, and \nwe both look forward to their return this afternoon, but I want to \nacknowledge the great role they played in putting together the \nappropriations and transportation funding for the entire United States \nof America, as well as the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  We are going to talk more about transportation because it literally \nkeeps America rolling, whether it is the kinds of problems we solved \nwith the issues around safety, congestion--they are absolutely crucial. \nBut also what they talked about in their bill is housing and urban \ndevelopment and how--it is also the famous HUD bill--it does not only \ndo urban development.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is from the State of North Dakota, whose \nterrain and challenges are very different than my State, a coastal \nState. But the Presiding Officer would be interested to know--because \nshe has been hit by some bad weather--that when Hurricane Sandy hit, my \nState was hit by two things: a hurricane--a hurricane on my Eastern \nShore, in which a whole town was underwater and literally people had to \nbe rescued by Zodiacs, by boats, and so on.\n  Then out in western Maryland, our mountain counties, people were hit \nby a blizzard. It was so bad that regular snowplows, local government, \nand the private sector weren't working. The Governor had to bring in \nthe National Guard--and God bless our State troopers and first \nresponders. They were bringing out senior citizens on snowmobiles and \nthings strapped to their chests to get them to safety because the free \nzone was there.\n  I tell that poignant story because while we looked to FEMA to rescue, \nit was really the Community Development Block Grant money that helped \nlocal communities come back. FEMA was there for readiness, so we were \nready to respond. It was ready to respond. But the big job of \nrehabilitation always comes through CDBG. I am going to talk about it \nbecause it is a lot of letters--one more agency with a lot of letters--\nbut it is also a big impact. What we need to be able to focus on is \nthis is Federal spending with local decisionmaking. It is money that \ncomes to local communities to eliminate blight and to create jobs. \nBlight can come from a natural disaster or communities that are aging \nwith that kind of impact.\n  We hope we have support for the bill, but, gee, they did a good job \nand they did it with diligence, civility, collegiality and common \nsense, as is characteristic.\n  I would point out we have tried to use common sense too. Working with \nSenator Shelby, as I have said, I am going to emphasize the word \n``frugality.'' How do we make sure we get value for the taxpayers' \ndollar.\n  It is something in which I strongly believe. My colleague has been a \nFederal watchdog. He, like I, believes in the funding of these \nagencies. These watchdog agencies are absolutely crucial.\n  The Appropriations Committee, under my chairmanship but with the \nstrong concurrence of the vice chairman, believes in the inspectors \ngeneral.\n  Congress can hold an investigation and we can pound our chests and \nput glasses on our noses and ask tough questions, but we need the kind \nof truly drilling down to know what agencies are doing and are they \nmaking sure we avoid boondoggles, waste, stupidity, and at the same \ntime terrible cost overruns.\n  Thanks to working on a bipartisan basis, we have insisted that \ninspectors general be at every hearing. This has been a new innovation \nof the leadership of Senator Shelby and me. We want the inspectors \ngeneral to be part of our official record so we know the top 10 issues \nthey brought to our attention to stand sentry, and we put money in the \nFederal checkbook to fund them.\n  We funded the Commerce Department IG at $30.6 million, $600 million \nabove 2014 for Justice to make sure grant programs were well \nadministered for NASA, to avoid techno-boondoggles, and for the NSF, so \nthey too keep an eye on it.\n  We are going to talk more about the problems they identified and the \nproblems we solved, but I note on the floor\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nSenator Pryor from Arkansas, who has chaired the Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, FDA, an important subcommittee that is \npart of our overall bill today.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2015 \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I know Senator Blunt, the ranking \nmember, is on his way over. We were just in another subcommittee \nhearing and we were asking questions.\n  Before I say anything else, I thank Senator Blunt because he has been \na great partner to work with. He has been outstanding. He knows this \nstuff. He works hard. He knows how to work the system. He has been \ngreat. He is one of those guys we can trust, and he is very bipartisan. \nIf we had more folks like Senator Blunt around here, we would get a lot \nmore done. He is doing great work for the country by doing what he is \ndoing.\n  This is a commonsense and bipartisan bill. It did pass unanimously \ncoming out of the full Appropriations Committee last month, and I am \nconfident my colleagues will support it. When they have a chance to see \nit, they will like it. I heartily encourage everyone to take a good \nlook at it and support it for final passage.\n  Agriculture, as we know very well, is something America does better \nthan anybody else in the world. We are the envy of the world when it \ncomes to agriculture. We do it right. We are the gold standard. We are \nwhat every other nation in the world wants to be. It is of course rural \nAmerica's No. 1 industry. So when we talk about agriculture and rural \nAmerica, it is doing something we can be extremely proud of in this \nbody and in this country because they do it better than anybody else.\n  I learned a lesson 1 or 2 years ago when Senator Stabenow took over \nas chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. She told me \neverybody thinks of Michigan and they think of automobile \nmanufacturing--heavy industry--as the No. 1 industry, and it is in \nMichigan, but agriculture is No. 2.\n  If we were to go around a map of the United States, that is what we \nwould see pretty much in almost every State. Agriculture is either the \nNo. 1 industry or No. 2. In a few cases it is the No. 3 industry. I \ncould go around to all 50 States, but in Arkansas, as an example, \nagriculture equals a full 25 percent of our State's economy. So 25 \npercent of our economy is agriculture or agra related.\n  Again, if we look around the country, we will see numbers similar to \nthat in many States. It contributes $17 billion in economic activity to \nArkansas. It also supports thousands and thousands of jobs--in fact, \nabout one in six jobs. We could put up a chart similar to this for any \nState in the Union. The numbers may change from State to State, but \nthey will be generally the same.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill we are talking about builds on \nthe strengths of our agricultural industry. It invests in the Farm \nService Agency. It prohibits the closure of FSA offices, which provide \nvital services to our farmers and ranchers, and it provides funding for \nfarm ownership loans. It also invests in the Agricultural Research \nService and the Natural Resources Conservation Service so America can \ncontinue to innovate and make our agricultural products more \nefficiently.\n  This is another area America truly leads the world in, agricultural \ninnovation. Agriculture is actually very science-based and very \ninnovative. It doesn't always get credit for being high-tech, but it \nactually is. So much of that basic research and the things that make a \ndifference out in the field happen in this legislation, but that is not \nall the bill does. It also makes smart investments to help improve job \nopportunities and quality of life for families in rural America.\n  One thing we don't want to see is the old ``Tale of Two Americas,'' \nwhere urban and suburban get all the money, get the latest and the \ngreatest and the best and the cutting edge and rural America is left \nbehind. That can happen and it does happen in Washington, \nunfortunately, quite a bit--but not in this bill. This bill's primary \nemphasis is on rural America. It is one of the few bills we talk about \nin any given Congress that does focus on rural America. It makes smart \ninvestments there.\n  It maintains funding for the Rural Development Water and Waste \nDisposal Program to help many of our very small communities obtain \nclean water and sanitary waste disposal systems. Here again, just \nbecause one lives in smalltown America doesn't mean they shouldn't have \nclean water. Everybody should have clean water. So this bill makes sure \nthat happens.\n  It increases funding for the Food and Drug Administration to ensure \nthat our food and our drug supply remains the safest and the most \nreliable in the world. There again FDA is in this bill. Everybody in \nthe world wants to be like FDA. Everybody wants the integrity we have \nin our system for our food and our drugs. We fund FDA here.\n  It provides funding for the Food Safety and Inspection Service to \nkeep our food supply safe, and it sustains the school meals equipment \ngrants so our schools can continue to provide healthy meals for kids.\n  We also included in this legislation money for disaster relief. Some \npeople have asked me: Why? Why should we do that? I have a photograph \nrecently taken in Arkansas. This is just one example of the devastating \neffects of a tornado.\n  Here we look at what used to be someone's home. We have to remember \nthese people worked all their lives to have this house, and in about 45 \nseconds this is what was left of it. It may be hard to see on the \ntelevision, but right here is a motorcycle, a pickup truck, a power \nline lying in the yard, a few appliances, a few people hugging, but one \nthing we see is their pride in America, where they put up their flag. \nEven in the most adverse circumstances they came together and pulled \ntogether to make that happen.\n  So we put disaster money into this legislation because our country \nneeds disaster money. We need to make sure disasters are fully funded \nand we have those resources when our neighbors need it the most.\n  In this storm lives were lost, homes were completely wiped out, and \nmany communities were left in ruins. Arkansas is not unique. I wish I \ncould say this didn't happen, but it does happen periodically around \nthe country. This bill provides funding to help States respond when \nnatural disaster strikes.\n  My view is that supporting this legislation is a no-brainer. It is \nbipartisan. It is a good, commonsense, solid piece of legislation. It \nsustains our agricultural producers, our communities and our families, \nand it strengthens our economy and secures the future of our Nation.\n  Before I turn it over to my colleague from Missouri--and I know we \nare all anxious to hear what he says--there has been a question, as I \nhave talked to many of my colleagues both on the Democratic and the \nRepublican side, about whether we will allow amendments. The answer is: \nAbsolutely, yes; we would like to see amendments.\n  I cannot speak for everyone in the Chamber, but from the members of \nthe Appropriations Committee who are involved in this legislation, \nincluding the chairwoman and the ranking member, yes, we want to talk \nto Senators about their amendments. It is a little bit like the Statue \nof Liberty: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses \nyearning to breathe free.'' We want to see those amendments. We want to \ntalk about them.\n  We are hoping we will be able to put together managers' packages. We \nare hoping we will be able to find common ground and make this bill \nbetter as it goes through the process. Certainly we don't want a lot of \nfunny business on that. We want real amendments, good amendments, \namendments that are important to moving this forward.\n  I know many of my colleagues have been frustrated, but we would like \nto talk to as many Members as possible about their amendments. I will \nbe on the floor on and off most of the day, either on the floor or near \nthe floor all day. So if anyone's office wants to talk to me about \namendments or any Member wants to talk about amendments, I will be glad \nto do that.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nArkansas in introducing this bill. He has been a great person to work \nwith.\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\n  I also fully associate myself with his comments about our colleagues' \nability to amend these bills. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby have \nbeen real advocates for us getting back to the process the way it \nessentially worked in the country for a couple hundred years. We got \nout of the habit of bringing these bills to the floor, letting Members \ncome to the floor and offer better ways to spend this money or if they \nwant to propose not to spend it at all, that is one of the proposals \nthey can make.\n  The Senator from Arkansas and I have worked to make the tough \nchoices, but seldom is a bill so perfect that it can't be improved, and \nthere is nothing wrong with defending the decisions we have made.\n  I believe one of the real losses for the country and the Senate of \nthese bills not coming to the floor in recent years is that Members of \nthe Senate haven't had to hear the debate. Members who bring a bill to \nthe floor haven't had to defend the bill. Before we know it, if we \ndon't have to defend what we are for, we have a hard time remembering \nwhy we are for what we are for.\n  This process makes sense if we do it the right way. Certainly, \nSenator Pryor has wanted to approach this in that way, and maybe, more \nimportantly, from both our points of view, Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby have been advocating that we bring these bills to the floor and \nwe debate these priorities.\n  I am particularly pleased to join with Senator Pryor in introducing \nthis bill and bringing this bill to the floor, the fiscal year 2015 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, for agriculture, for rural \ndevelopment, for the Food and Drug Administration, and the things that \nrelate to those agencies. The Senator made a good point already about \nhow important this industry is. In Missouri as in Arkansas, agriculture \nis the No. 1 industry. In my State it is responsible for 16 percent of \nthe State's workforce. Frankly, as world food needs develop, I believe \nthe percentage of our workforce that will have jobs because of \nagriculture--growing, producing, and processing it, figuring out how to \nget it to markets around the world--will be an even higher percentage \nin the future. I think agriculture is the No. 1 industry in most \nStates. If it is not the No. 1 industry, it is right there at the top.\n\n  For 150 years now the Federal Government, through what would become \nthe Department of Agriculture after a bill President Lincoln signed in \n1862, has been doing many of the things we want to continue to do in \nthis bill. This is not a newfound obligation on the part of the Federal \nGovernment. This is not something for which the Federal Government just \ndecided it needed to have some responsibility. This is something that \n150 years ago the Federal Government said: You know, we don't need to \nhave--as the land grant universities were founded, the Federal \nGovernment said: We need to help these universities manage the research \nthey are doing so that what they are doing can be shared throughout our \ncountry, so it is not needlessly duplicated, so it is properly not only \nallocated but funded.\n  So the activities in this bill include one of my priorities, which is \nagricultural research. It includes conservation activities, housing and \nbusiness loans for rural communities, domestic and international \nnutrition programs, and food and drug safety. Certainly all of those \nhave a top priority on the list of different individual Members of the \nSenate. It would be hard to find a Senator who didn't have near the top \nof their priority list one of the things this bill does.\n  The Senator from Arkansas and I have made difficult decisions in \ndrafting this bill. Aside from the disaster recovery efforts, the bill \nis $90 million below last year's bill. I think it represents a \nresponsible approach to the funding of these priorities but at the same \ntime tightening our belts as we work to live within our means.\n  We have prioritized programs that protect public health and maintain \nthe strength of our Nation's agricultural economy. Agriculture is one \nof the few sectors in our economy that consistently enjoy a trade \nsurplus. Last year was our strongest export year in ag products in the \nhistory of the country. Recent information from the Department of \nAgriculture indicates that 2014 is going to set a new record. We need \nto continue to work through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to open \nnew markets, and we are doing that--particularly markets in Asia and \nEurope that need to be more open to our products. Expanding \nagricultural exports is vital. Every $1 billion in agricultural exports \nsupports an estimated 8,000 American jobs.\n  If we need to have a domestic priority in the Congress today, it is \nmore private sector jobs. One way to do that is to continue to do what \nwe are doing in this bill and to do it even better.\n  Opening export markets is only one piece of the puzzle that maintains \nour agricultural economy. The American farmer is the best in the world \nat producing products that are desired worldwide in the global \nmarketplace. Smart investment in ag research has helped us get to that \npoint. We have products with a quality, with a market sensitivity, and \nwith a health and nutrition value that people all over the world want.\n  This bill places significant emphasis on maintaining research at our \nland grant universities and our non-land grant university systems that \nhave a commitment to agriculture and funding competitive research \nbeyond that in things such as the Agriculture and Food Research \nInitiative.\n  These programs are critical to our increased production. Every dollar \nspent in agricultural research results in around a $20 return to the \nU.S. economy. By the way, that comes year after year. Once you create \nthat notch and work to try to improve it, it continues to come.\n  This bill will also provide our rural communities with even more \nability to compete both here and abroad.\n  In a bill where many items didn't get the funding that was requested, \nwe fully funded the Food and Drug Administration request. It is \nimportant to the chairman, important to our committee, and important as \nwe look at the health and safety of the products for which the Food and \nDrug Administration is responsible.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his leadership. I thank \nour chairman and ranking member of the full committee for working so \nhard to see these bills debated on the floor. I look forward to working \nwith our colleagues as they come up with ways to improve this bill. It \nis one of the three bills that are on the floor this week.\n  I hope we can return to a day very quickly where all the \nappropriations bills are on the floor in as small a group as possible \nand where they are all open to amendment. We have to get back into the \npractice of remembering why we are for what we are for and why we have \ndecided to propose that the hard-earned dollars of American families \nshould be spent for these things as opposed to not spending them all or \nspending them on something else. It is a process that will work if the \nSenate shares the commitment of the chairman and Senator Shelby and I \nthink everybody on the Appropriations Committee to try to get back into \nthe business of doing this business publicly and openly and in the \nright way.\n  Madam President, I will yield for Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have a few more comments after listening to my colleague \nfrom Missouri. I did want to mention a few.\n  The first point is on exports. We all know we have a bad trade \ndeficit. We all know that. But it would be horrendous if it were not \nfor agriculture. Agriculture is really a huge net plus for us when it \ncomes to exporters. You may ask yourself why that is. It is because we \nraise the safest, highest quality food in the world, and other people \nwant it. There is no question that when that food shows up on shelves \nin foreign countries, if this says ``Made in the USA,'' sometimes they \ncan charge a premium because they know the USDA seal of approval is of \nthe highest quality you can find anywhere in the world. So exports are \nvery important.\n  We heard the President--not just this President but the previous \nPresident as well--talk about exports and how many jobs exports create. \nWe need to get back in the exportation business, and agriculture is a \ngreat way to do that.\n  Senator Blunt alluded to research. There are some tremendous numbers \nin research. For every dollar of research, you get a $20 return to the \nU.S. economy. That is a no-brainer. That is\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nsmart policy. That is the right thing to do. It is good for the \neconomy.\n  But also we both had an experience a few weeks ago where Bill Gates, \nwho founded Microsoft, came in and talked to us about American \nagricultural research and how important it is in feeding the world. One \naspect that struck me is here is a man--Bill Gates--who has been an \neconomic revolutionary. He has changed the world with Microsoft and the \ndigital revolution and the high-tech and all the efforts in which he \nhas been involved. He has been at the cutting edge of so much of that \nchange we have seen in our economy and the world's economy in the last \n20-, 30-plus years. It is phenomenal. But here he is in the autumn of \nhis life, and what does he come back to? Agriculture--something that is \nso basic that we take for granted, but because he has seen the work in \nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, he has seen the work around the \nworld, he has seen the abject poverty, and he has seen the starvation, \nhe knows that when they get their hands on American products such as \nseed, fertilizer--all the things we take for granted--that would be a \nlife-changer for those people around the world.\n  I think it was Senator Blunt who said his experience is that when \npeople have been eating bad food all their lives, once they get a \nchance to eat good food, they don't want to go back to bad food. That \nis what Bill Gates is talking about, and that is where ag research \ncomes in. That is how this piece of the puzzle fits.\n  There is another point I want to make about rural America. Generally \nin this legislation we have provisions for rural water, rural housing, \nrural broadband, rural electricity. Again, we have to understand the \neconomics of that. If you wanted to add broadband somewhere, if you \nwanted to do it, say, in suburban Washington, DC, obviously you have in \nmany cases relatively high income levels and you have population \ndensity. You have what makes it economically feasible. But if you are \nout in rural America, you want those people to have access to \nbroadband, but you get so many fewer customers per mile. That is why we \nhelp. This is sort of the premise of the old Universal Service Fund we \nhave had for a long time in telephone to help expand that network to \nevery single home in America. Now, of course, we have a lot of wireless \ntechnologies and whatnot. So we want to make that readily available to \nrural America.\n  The last bit of substance I wanted to add to what Senator Blunt \nmentioned is the funding for the Food and Drug Administration. I am not \nsure there is an agency that is responsible for more innovation than \nthe FDA. We need to keep the FDA stable. We need to keep them well \nfunded. They need to be able to approve drugs and do the testing they \nneed to do.\n  One of the new frontiers they are dealing with is nanotechnology. We \nare seeing nano products enter the marketplace all over this economy, \nand there has been very little testing on that for human safety. So the \nFDA is doing that. We need to continue to fund them so they can do the \njob. We don't want them to be an obstacle to innovation; we want them \nto be a partner in innovation. Let these companies that come in and \nhave these great products, whatever they are--cosmetics, food, \nwhatever--let them innovate and do that and again create American jobs \nand enhance the marketplace. But in order for the FDA to do that, we \nneed to fund them.\n  Senator Blunt is right. We have the best system of government in the \nworld, bar none. And the U.S. Senate always has its moments where it \ngets a few rough edges. This is democracy at its finest. People don't \nalways agree. They fuss and fight and things get balled up here and \nthere. But our system works, and it works great if we let it work.\n  I think what the chairwoman and the ranking member of the full \ncommittee are saying is: We want the process to work. We want it to \nwork. We want to talk about amendments. We want to have amendments. We \nwant to have votes. We want to get back to regular order, whatever that \nmeans in the Senate. But most of us know what that means. It means \ngetting back to where Senators can participate in the process, but it \nis also done in good will and good faith.\n  With that, Madam President, I would yield the floor, but I would \nencourage my colleagues to look closely at and support this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I note that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona is on the floor, and we want to be sure he has an \nopportunity to speak.\n  I do have a housekeeping matter to take care of and just a few \nwords--about three sentences--about ag, but I want the Senator from \nArizona to be heard.\n  Madam President, I wish to comment on the Agriculture bill, but I \nwill keep that for later on in the day. I will be on the floor along \nwith Senator Shelby trying to move this bill in a way that we could \ncomplete the motion to proceed and that we could move to amendments.\n  Right now, I wish to compliment both the Senator from Arkansas and \nthe Senator from Missouri, Senators Pryor and Blunt, for the excellent \nway they have moved the agriculture FDA bill. They have worked on a \nbipartisan basis. They have met compelling human needs--in other words, \nfeed America first; see how we can feed others in need around the \nworld; look out for everyone from the family farm to also food safety \nbecause now so much of our food is also imported. At the same time, \nthey have supported the Food and Drug Administration. That is an agency \nlocated in Maryland that is responsible for oversight of the food \nsupply but also our pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical devices.\n  My colleagues have spoken eloquently about exports, particularly with \nfood. I will speak later today about the exports of pharmaceuticals, \nbiotech, and medical devices because there are countries around the \nworld that want to look out for their own people, but they don't have \nan FDA. So when we have products--life science products--that save \nlives or improve lives and they have been stamped by the FDA as safe \nand effective, then countries know they can buy them with confidence. \nThis means those areas of endeavor are not only good for jobs in this \ncountry, great for improving the lives of people in our country, but \nthey are also a major source of the new American export economy.\n  I think they did a great job, and I will say more about it. But right \nnow, unless Senator Shelby has something to say, we can go to our \nSenate colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as if in morning business, and I wish to enter into a colloquy \nwith the Senator from South Carolina when he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning with my \ncolleague, the Senator from South Carolina, to put to rest once and for \nall the claim we hear so often today: President Obama wanted to leave a \nresidual force of U.S. troops in Iraq after 2011. He tried his hardest \nto do so, but Iraqi leaders prevented that from happening because they \ndemanded that Iraq's parliament approve legislation to grant privileges \nand immunities for U.S. troops that would remain in the country.\n  This is a very important item and aspect of the debate that is now \ngoing on, and it is a claim that was made in growing desperation these \ndays as it becomes increasingly clear for all to see that the \nPresident's mishandling of Iraq for the past 5 years and his consistent \ninaction on Syria has now brought us to the verge of disaster.\n  The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria--a more ambitious, more violent, \nand more radical offshoot of Al Qaeda--has now taken over a swath of \nterritory in Iraq and Syria that is the size of the State of Indiana. \nIt is the largest terrorist safe haven in history. The ISIS's offensive \nis now reigniting sectarian conflict in Iraq and threatening to erase \nthe gains that nearly 4,500 brave young Americans gave their lives to \nsecure and was largely secured when the President took office in \nJanuary in 2009. In January 2009 the surge had succeeded. Iraq was not \nviolent. The surge had succeeded. We had won the war. In\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nthe words of General Keane: We won the war and lost the peace. And that \nis a fact.\n  The administration and its defenders are now scrambling to pin the \nblame for this catastrophic failure on anyone but themselves. They are \ntrying to blame the Bush administration, and they are trying to blame \npeople like myself and the Senator from South Carolina for voting to \nauthorize the war while conveniently forgetting that Vice President \nBiden, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, his \npredecessor, Secretary Clinton, and many other Democrats still serving \nin this body voted for the war in Iraq as well.\n  They also seem to have forgotten that the Senator from South Carolina \nand I began criticizing the Bush administration as early as 2003 for \ntheir mishandling of the war and calling for a change in strategy. In \nfact, in 2006 I called for the firing of the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Rumsfeld, because of the mishandling of the war. Indeed, the \nvery strategy that was finally adopted with enormous success was thanks \nto a great leader named General David Petraeus and a great ambassador \nby the name of Ryan Crocker.\n  Most of all, the administration and its defenders are trying to blame \nthe failures of Iraq on Iraq's leaders. To be sure, the lion's share of \nthe blame for Iraq's current problems lies squarely with Prime Minister \nMaliki and other Iraqi leaders. But the administration cannot escape \nits own responsibility for the current disaster. This is something that \nthe Senator from South Carolina and I saw firsthand, and we stated that \nover and over. In order to set this debate to rest once and for all, we \nwould like to review the record.\n  We predicted that when all the troops were withdrawn there would be \nthe events that are taking place today--not as rapidly, but we \npredicted that Iraq would fall into chaos if we withdrew all the troops \nand did not leave a residual force behind as we have in South Korea, \nGermany, Japan, Bosnia, and other countries after the conflict had \nended.\n  From its first day in office, the Obama administration signaled a \nhands-off approach to Iraq. It immediately pushed for a faster drawdown \nof U.S. forces than our commanders recommended. It appointed an \nambassador to Iraq, Christopher Hill, who had no experience working on \nIraq or serving anywhere in the Arab world. I think he is a fine man, \nbut he had no experience. It adopted a hands-off approach of shaping \nIraqi politics, which was demonstrated most vividly as it refused for \nmonths and months to take a hands-on approach with Iraqi leaders and \nhelp them broker the necessary compromises about the country's future \nin the aftermath of the 2010 elections in Iraq.\n  Nowhere was the Obama administration's failure more pronounced than \nduring the debate over whether to maintain a limited number of U.S. \ntroops in Iraq beyond the 2011 expiration of the 2008 Status of Forces \nAgreement or SOFA. The administration is quick to lay blame on others \nfor the fact that they tried and failed to keep a limited presence of \ntroops in Iraq. They blamed the Bush administration, of course, for \nmandating the withdrawal in the 2008 SOFA. This does not ring true, \nhowever, because as former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice has made \nclear, the plan all along was to renegotiate the agreement to allow for \na continued presence of U.S. forces in Iraq. ``Everybody believed,'' \nshe said in 2011, ``it would be better if there was some kind of \nresidual force.''\n  Most of all, the Obama administration blames Iraqis for failing to \ngrant the necessary privileges and immunities for a U.S. force presence \nbeyond 2011. This too is totally misleading because as we saw \nfirsthand--Senator Graham and I traveled to Baghdad and Erbil. We met \nwith Allawi and Maliki, and we met with Barzani. We met with all of the \nleaders of the main political blocs, and we heard a common message \nduring all of these conversations: Iraqi leaders recognized that it was \nin their country's interest to maintain a limited number of U.S. troops \nto continue training and assisting Iraqi security forces beyond 2011. \nBut when we asked Ambassador Jim Jeffrey and the commander of U.S. \nForces in Iraq Lloyd Austin--in direct response to a question in a \nmeeting with Maliki--what tasks U.S. troops remaining in Iraq would \nperform and what their missions were, the answer was they had still not \nmade a decision.\n  In Erbil, Barzani said he would fly to Baghdad. Allawi, the actual \nwinner of the election, said that he would agree, and then after that, \nPrime Minister Maliki announced that if his partners agreed, which they \ndid, he would agree to a residual force in Iraq. Those are just facts.\n  Just days after the Senator from South Carolina and I left Baghdad, \nPrime Minister Maliki, as I said, signaled his willingness--and it is a \nmatter of public record--to a residual presence of U.S. troops if 70 \npercent of Iraqis agreed. The Kurds agreed, the Sunnis agreed, and \nMaliki himself signaled his support. Had the United States and our Iraq \npartners used our influence then and there, we could have lined up the \nremaining Shia support to enable Maliki to make this difficult \ndecision. Unfortunately, that did not happen.\n\n  Instead, months and months passed and the administration made no \ndecision on what missions and troop levels it would be willing to \nmaintain in Iraq. By August 2011 the leaders of Iraq's main political \nblocs joined together and stated that they were prepared to enter \nnegotiations to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  Another entire month passed and still the White House made no \ndecision. During this long internal deliberation, as Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey later testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, the size of a potential U.S. force presence \nkept ``cascading'' down from upwards of 16,000 to an eventual low of \nless than 3,000. By that point, the force would be able to do little \nmore than protect itself, and Prime Minister Maliki, and other Iraq \nleaders, realized that the political cost of accepting this proposal \nwas not worth the benefit. To blame this failure entirely on the Iraqis \nis convenient, but it misses the real point. The reason to keep about \n10,000 to 15,000 U.S. forces in Iraq was not for the sake of Iraq \nalone. It was first and foremost in our national security interest to \ncontinue training and advising Iraqi forces and to maintain greater \nU.S. influence in Iraq. That core principle should have driven a very \ndifferent U.S. approach to the SOFA diplomacy. The Obama administration \nshould have recognized that after years of brutal conflict, Iraqi \nleaders still lacked trust in one another, and a strong U.S. role was \nrequired to help Iraqis broker their most politically sensitive \ndecisions. For this reason the administration should have determined \nwhat tasks and troop numbers were in the national interest to maintain \nin Iraq and done so with ample time to engage with Iraqis at the \nhighest level of the U.S. Government to shape political conditions in \nBaghdad to achieve our goal. I focus on this failure not because U.S. \ntroops would have been engaging in unilateral large-scale combat \noperations to this day. In fact, they had won the conflict, and there \nwas literally no further combat that the United States was engaged in. \nBy 2011 U.S. forces were no longer in Iraqi cities or engaged in \nsecurity operations. However, a residual U.S. troop presence could have \nassisted Iraqi forces in their continued fight against Al Qaeda. They \ncould have provided a platform for greater diplomatic engagement and \nintelligence cooperation with our Iraqi partners. It could have made \nIranian leaders think twice about using Iraqi airspace to transit \nmilitary assistance to Assad and his forces in Syria. And most \nimportantly, it could have maintained the significant diplomatic \ninfluence that the United States still possessed in Iraq--influence \nthat had been and still was essential in guaranteeing Iraq's nascent \npolitical system, reassuring Iraqi leaders that they could resolve \ntheir differences peacefully and politically despite their mistrust of \none another and checking the authoritarian and sectarian tendencies of \nPrime Minister Maliki.\n  There is a need for immediate action. Every day that goes by, there \nis greater sectarian violence, and there is greater success by ISIS. I \ndo not believe they can take Baghdad. But look at the places they have \nalready taken. By the way, they are now threatening the major oil \nrefinery in Iraq. I can assure you that will affect the world price of \noil. There is a need because\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nthere is more polarization of Iraq, there is a return of the Iraqi Shia \nmilitias, there is wholesale killing and slaughter going on, and it \nwill get worse every single day.\n  Is there any good option now in Iraq? No, there is no good option. \nThe worst option is to do nothing, and apparently, according to the \nWall Street Journal this morning, that is basically the approach that \nhas been taken.\n  We need to recognize that taking military action now is difficult \nbecause our intelligence has been so severely degraded since 2011 \nbecause ISIS is becoming so integrated with the Sunni tribes. We need \nto be careful about striking targets, even convoys in the open. There \nis a real risk of killing Sunni tribal elements and pushing the tribes \ncloser to ISIS.\n  We also have to recognize that political change in Baghdad has to \ntake place. But the question is: Do we wait for political change? Every \nday we wait there is more and more Iranian influence. The chief--one of \nthe most evil people in the world--of the Iranian Quds Force has been \nin Baghdad planning with Maliki. So what does Maliki do when he doesn't \nsee us giving him any real assistance? He turns to the Iranians. There \nare published reports of Iranian combat troops now coming into Iraq as \nmore and more of the radical ISIS people are flowing from Syria into \nIraq.\n  As I said, I admit that I was surprised at the rapidity of the \nsuccess of the ISIS. But I also believe that the longer we wait to \ncarry out some airstrikes--as difficult as it is--that we can identify \nwith the few people we have on the ground--it sends a signal \npsychologically over these people who are traveling long distances in \nthe desert--the ISIS--of an American aircraft flying overhead and \nperhaps taking some of them out if we have sufficient information. That \nis a psychological effect on any enemy. Air power alone does not win \nconflicts, but air power can have a significant effect on the morale of \nyour people, on your capability, and of at least inflicting some damage \nand changing the enemy's plans.\n  Obviously, political reconciliation is the key, and we must do \neverything in our power to make sure that Maliki appoints a government \nof reconciliation. But it can't be the prerequisite for U.S. military \naction because the events and time are not on our side.\n\n  We also have to recognize this is not an Iraqi conflict. This is an \nIraqi-Syrian conflict now. The most, the largest, and the richest \ncenter of terrorism in the history of the world is now in the Iraq-\nSyria area. They have hundreds of millions of dollars from the banks in \nMosul, and, obviously, they acquired a whole lot of equipment during \ntheir incredible progress across Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to have a look at the maps of Iraq and Syria and \nlook at the places that are now controlled by ISIS. As I say, I don't \nbelieve they can roll into Baghdad in their vehicles with their guns \nmounted on them, but they sure as heck can cause a lot of problems: \nbombings, assassinations, the radicalization of these Shiite militias. \nIf one of these Shiite shrines is damaged by ISIS or by Sunni \nmilitants, we are going to see a very bigger explosion which will bring \nus back to the days of 2003, '4, '5, and '6, before the Anbar \nawakening. The same Sunnis who were part of the Anbar awakening that \njoined us in putting down Al Qaeda are now being polarized by Maliki. \nThe Shiites, as well as the chickens, are coming home to roost as far \nas Maliki is concerned because of the continued marginalization and \npersecution of Sunnis all over Iraq, much less in Anbar Province.\n  So we have to act. We have to act. We must act. I know there are \nalways people who will tell our leaders reasons why we can't, but I \nknow of no military expert who believes that doing nothing is a recipe \nfor anything but further chaos and eventually threats to the United \nStates of America. Our Secretary of Homeland Security has stated it and \nour Director of National Intelligence has stated it: that people in \nthis part of Iraq and Syria will be planning attacks on the United \nStates of America. That is their view. It also is mine. But we can do \nsome effective air strikes. We can. And it is more difficult because of \nour degraded intelligence. By the way, when we left Iraq, all of those \nintelligence capabilities were shut down.\n  To make them more effective and mitigate the risks that could push \nSunnis deeper into the arms of ISIS, they have to be accompanied, as I \nmentioned, with a limited presence of special forces on the ground. \nThese forces could gather intelligence to improve our targeting by ISIS \ncontrol, air strikes from the ground, and provide advice to Sunni \ntribes.\n  I believe several other steps could be taken. No. 1, who are the most \nrespected people in Iraq today? Probably David Petraeus and Ryan \nCrocker. Send them back. Send them back, those who worked so closely \nwith the Sunnis such as General MacFarland--then Colonel MacFarland--\nthe people who built up these long relationships with the Sunnis. Send \nthem back. Maliki will listen to David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker. Send \nthem back. Send back a planning team, a group of smart people who can \nwork with what is left of the Iraqi military leadership and identify \ntactics and a strategy that can reverse this tide of the ISIS which is \nabout to engulf them.\n  Send some air power. Send some air power with targets we can \nidentify. I am fully aware of the risks associated with it. I wish to \nrepeat over and over and over: There are no good options. Also, we need \nto make it very clear to Maliki that his time is up; that he must \narrange for a transition.\n  The Shia won the election, a majority of the votes--not a majority of \nany of the parties but an overall majority of the vote. This new \ngovernment could be headed by a Shia, but it has to be a Shia who can \nreach out to the Sunni and bring them together in a government of \nnational reconciliation.\n  All of my colleagues have seen the pictures of the young Shia who are \nnow joining up and are ready to die--the movement from Basra of the \nShia militia organizations which had been put down before that are now \nrising from the ashes. We have seen the horrible pictures of the \nexecutions that are taking place and the incredible displacement--\n500,000 people from Mosul alone. The Kurds have now taken Kirkuk. That \nis an ambition they have had for the last 50 years. We will see now a \ndrive for total Kurdish autonomy from the government in Baghdad, and \nthey will be making their own deals as far as oil is concerned, and the \nKurds will now be pursuing their centuries-old ambition for a Kurdish \nstate, which will cause the Turks to be very concerned.\n  I also wish to point out that if ISIS continues to succeed and they \nmove back and forth to Syria, they will now pose a direct threat, first \nof all, to Jordan, and then to other gulf states, and finally, \neventually, Saudi Arabia, but those right next to Iraq will be most \nunder threat.\n  So I urge the President and I urge my colleagues to understand the \ngravity and the seriousness of this situation; to understand that if \nISIS succeeds, even without taking Baghdad, and they are able to \nestablish what they call a caliphate in the Syria-Iraq area--larger \nthan the State of Indiana--and are able to train, equip, and export \nterror not only throughout the region but throughout the world, it will \npose a direct threat to the security of this Nation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nshowing up.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am sorry I was late. Actually, I had an exchange with \nGeneral Dempsey about this very topic.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona see any scenario where ISIS is \nmilitarily stopped and that the Iraqis can retake ground lost to ISIS \nwithout U.S. air power being involved?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know of no military expert who believes that without \nthe use of U.S. air power they will be able to at anytime soon regain \nthe lost territory, which is a sizable part of Iraq.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Did my colleague hear President Obama say it is \nunacceptable for Iraq or Islamists to have safe havens in Iraq and \nSyria? Did my colleague hear him say that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, I did not, but I did hear him say on December 14, \n2011: ``We are leaving behind a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant \nIraq with a representative government that was elected by its people,'' \nand other quotes throughout the campaign.\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My point is, does my colleague agree he is right? It is \nnot acceptable for our national security interests for ISIS to have a \nsafe haven in Syria and Iraq that could run from Aleppo to Baghdad; \nthat that is not a good thing for us?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I totally agree.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, if it is not a good thing for us, how do we change \nit? Give me a scenario where we put these folks on the run in Syria and \nin Iraq without American air power. Give me a scenario of political \nreconciliation in Baghdad where that has a snowball's chance in hell of \nsucceeding as long as they are losing on the battlefield. Give me a \nscenario where the battlefield turns our way without U.S. air power.\n  I can give my colleagues a scenario where it begins to turn on the \nbattlefield: Iran comes in with great numbers. The most likely scenario \nto stop ISIS is Iranians getting involved with Shia militia. Does that \nbother the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also like to point out what the Senator from \nSouth Carolina knows and I know: The air power has a psychological \neffect. When an aircraft flies over the enemy, they are going to do \nthings differently if they fear they are going to be hit from the air, \nas we all know. Air power does not determine the outcome of conflicts, \nbut it sure is important in the battlefield equation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is it fair to say the Air Force in Iraq is grounded for \nall practical purposes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not only grounded but a lot of the air assets, I am to \nunderstand, such as Apache helicopters, are in the hands of ISIS.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So, to the President: We agree with you that Iraq \nmatters. We agree with you that it is not in our national security \ninterests to have ISIS occupy territory from Aleppo to Baghdad. But \nhere is what is a mystery to me: How do we turn this around unless we \nstop their advance inside of Iraq and we go after them in Syria?\n  As to political reconciliation, I completely agree that is the \nultimate change that needs to occur, that air strikes alone will not \nget us to where we want to go, but it is a chicken-and-egg concept for \nme. Can my colleague from Arizona imagine a scenario where we can get \nall the parties together when ISIS is winning on the battlefield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is why I was amused by various commentators who have \nbeen consistently wrong, including one in the New York Times today: All \nwe need to do is have everybody sit down together--a total misreading \nof the situation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the problem with that: To go to a meeting in \nBaghdad, you are likely to get killed trying to get there. Who is going \nto sit down in Baghdad when everybody is getting killed based on \nsectarian differences? So my advice would be to use American air power \nbefore it is too late as part of a coordinated, diplomatic effort. That \nAmerican air power is part of diplomacy. That may sound \ncounterintuitive, but it makes perfect sense to me. Diplomacy cannot \nsucceed unless we change momentum on the battlefield. But when you drop \na bomb, you need to have a game plan beyond the bomb falling, and that \nwould be a regional conversation.\n  Can my colleague see how Maliki can put Humpty Dumpty back together \nagain?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I cannot. That is why he has to agree to a transition.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would not send $1 to Iraq. I would not send one soldier \nto Iraq, one airman to Iraq until we understand that over the arc of \ntime Maliki has to go. I have been there more times than I can count. \nMaliki did some good things on his watch, but he has become a political \nleader who cannot bring the country together. But that, to me, is a \nconcern that is addressed after we stop the momentum on the \nbattlefield.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona believe it is still possible that the \nKurds, the Sunnis, and the Shias, that we know fairly well, can regroup \nand reconcile with themselves if we act decisively?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am totally confident that they can. That is how the \ncountry was held together for long periods of time.\n  Could I ask my colleague--I began before the Senator from South \nCarolina arrived talking about this business of the allegations that \nsomehow it is the Iraqis' fault that we didn't leave a residual force \nin Iraq. I went through our meetings with Maliki, with Barzani, with \nAllawi, how they were all committed to maintaining residual force.\n  Could the Senator from South Carolina for the Record recount the \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing where he directly questioned \nGeneral Dempsey about this entire issue, after we had withdrawn?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I will be glad to. And to put it in context, in 2008 \nwe signed a strategic framework agreement. It was envisioned that we \nwould negotiate a follow-on force with advisers and some special forces \nunits to secure our Nation as well as to protect our gains. In the \nprocess of trying to get the Iraqis on board, Hillary Clinton called me \nto ask if my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, and I think Senator \nLieberman--maybe he didn't go; I can't remember--would go over there \nand talk to Barzani, Allawi, and Maliki, and we said, Sure, we would be \nglad to.\n  Here is what I found. I found in the meeting with Prime Minister \nMaliki, who was very openminded about a follow-on force--Barzani said, \nI will take 250,000 Americans; that was never in doubt about where the \nKurds were--Allawi understood, the Sunnis understood the need for a \nfollow-on force. It really was about the Shia politics.\n  After we got back, Maliki said, If the other groups will do it, I \nwill do it. But he says, What kind of force are you talking about, \nSenator Graham?\n  Mr. McCAIN. This was in a meeting in Baghdad?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This was in a meeting in his office. He asked me, What \nkind of force are you talking about? I turned to General Austin and \nAmbassador Jeffries and I asked them, What is the number? Answer the \nPrime Minister's question. They said, We are still working on that. The \nPrime Minister looked at me and said something to the effect, Well, I \ndon't know what I am supposed to be agreeing to.\n\n  We come back to Washington. We go to the Vice President's house. We \ntalk to Mr. Donilin, saying they need a number--sometime--and they said \nthey would get back to us about the number. I am still waiting on that \nphone call.\n  During my questioning of General Dempsey about the follow-on force, I \nasked him--General Austin recommended somewhere in the 18,000 to 20,000 \nrange, the Pentagon got down to 10,000, and below that they felt very \nuncomfortable. I asked him directly, Did the number cascade down or did \nthe number go down because the Iraqis said, That is too many Americans; \nwe don't want that many Americans on our soil. He said, No, sir; the \nnumbers kept cascading down because the White House kept changing the \nnumber.\n  So I want the record to reflect that in a meeting with the Prime \nMinister of Iraq, when he asked me how many troops we are talking \nabout, we could not give him an answer. I want the record to reflect \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said the numbers went down and down \nand down not because the Iraqis were saying no but because the White \nHouse kept lowering the number--to the point that it got to be absurd, \nand we will prove that over time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, could I--I see our colleague from Florida is \nwaiting. I think I would like to have the Senator from South Carolina \nsummarize. The cost of inaction, of doing nothing, is the greatest cost \nwe can incur. The situation on the battlefield is not only terrible, \nbut the polarization of the different groups in Iraq is growing worse \nby the hour. We are seeing the resurgence of the old Shia militias \nthat, thanks to David Petraeus, we had put down before. Iraq is largely \nunder control, thanks to David Petraeus, Ryan Crocker, and the surge in \n2011. If we had left--and it is a fact--if we had left that residual \nforce behind, history would be very different.\n  I would add one other comment. We cannot ignore Syria in this \nsituation. We have to understand Syria is now part of this huge area, \nthe size of the State of Indiana, which is governed by ISIS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I find there are a number of things I \nagree with the Senator from Arizona on. One of the things I agree with \nthe senior Senator from Arizona on is that Maliki needs to go. \nOtherwise, I think Iraq is going to blow apart, and it is going to end \nup in three parts, just like the Vice President, when he was a Member \nof the Senate, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said \nwas going to happen.\n  I will address this subject later on.\n  I came to thank Senator Shelby, who is here, and Senator Mikulski, \nwho I hope is within earshot of my remarks, for the bill they have come \nforth with and specifically with regard to the part that has to do with \na little agency that I have some familiarity with and to which I have a \ngreat deal of emotional attachment; that is, NASA.\n  What they have done is continue to flush out in Appropriations the \ndirection that was laid out--when there was no direction--4 years ago \nin the 2010 NASA authorization bill, for which I constantly give credit \nto our former colleague, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas. I had the \nopportunity to help draw up a balanced plan for the space program--\nbalanced in all aspects: human, nonhuman space exploration, \naeronautics, science, education, the whole works.\n  Earlier this month the National Academies came out with a report that \nwas required by that act 4 years ago that reaffirmed the need for a \nrobust U.S. space program aimed at the goal. The goal is way down the \nline. We are going on a human mission to Mars. The Academies' study was \ncochaired by a former Republican Governor, a former head of the Office \nof Management and Budget, Gov. Mitch Daniels. What they concluded was \nthat human space exploration remains vital to the national interest but \nit is only going to succeed if it is properly funded.\n  So the increase in funding provided in this bill for human \nexploration is going to keep us on track in the coming year. We know \nthat the Space Launch System and its spacecraft, a capsule called \nOrion--which is being built as we speak, assembled at the O building \nat the Kennedy Space Center--we know these are critical to human \nexploration. NASA has a very boring term for that. They call it \n``foundational capabilities.'' That is the capability of putting humans \ninto deep space and eventually on Mars. While other countries are \ntalking about a heavy lift rocket, we are actually building it, and it \nis being built today with its spacecraft.\n  Now we are going to look to the first test of this spacecraft. It is \ngoing to come in just a few months. It is the Orion spacecraft on top \nof another rocket to do the deep space penetration and high-velocity \nreentry, pulling lots of Gs, to see how the instrumented spacecraft \nperforms. It is on track and the space launch system is on track.\n  However, the funding increases are going to have to be maintained in \nfuture years. If we go back to this, shall I say--I have other \nadjectives for it, but shall I say not the best idea of taking a meat \nax to the budget called the sequester--if we go back to the sequester \nlevels, NASA is not going to be able to achieve its exploration goals.\n  So this funding bill that Senators Mikulski and Shelby have produced \nalso reiterates the need to engage our international partners in \nscience and exploration. It supports the international collaboration \nthat is so important in our space program.\n  There is another new NASA partnership with the German space agency \nfor astronomy research. This same bill also continues the investment in \nNASA's Commercial Crew Program. It would allow the largest NASA \ninvestment in the program to date.\n  The President requested $849 million to do a competition to make \nthese rockets that are already proven to be safe for humans--put in all \nthe redundancies and the escape systems. The President requested $849 \nmillion. That was NASA's request. This bill gets it close. It gets it \nto $805 million.\n  But we are going to need to work, to continue to work, with Senator \nShelby and Senator Mikulski, as the bill goes to the conference \ncommittee, to make sure we have the right mix of oversight and \ninnovation in how NASA contracts for this competition with the \ncompetitors--the private industry--as we are letting commercial \ncompanies provide this service not only of cargo to and from the \nInternational Space Station, but now we are going to provide this \nservice of crew going to and from the ISS.\n  I cannot overstate the importance of the commercial crew in the long-\nterm viability of the space station because, look, we are going to \nextend the ISS; that is, the International Space Station, to 2024. It \nought to be extended beyond that. Certainly there is all the research \nthat is being produced. We spent $100 billion putting it up there. We \nought to keep it to the end of the decade of the 2020s at least, and we \nneed to make sure there is sufficient funding to support the research \non this orbiting outpost.\n  It is a fantastic asset in low-Earth orbit. It is not only for \nresearch to improve life on Earth, but it is also a technology test bed \nand a stepping-stone for exploration.\n  There is another reason. Because we have had the aggressiveness of \nMr. Putin, and suddenly all the reverberations coming out of Ukraine, \nit is just another reminder that we want American rockets for Americans \nto fly on to get to our own space station. The commercial crew, if we \ncan pour the juice into it, as to their target of 2017, they can \nactually move it back to 2016. So we have a geopolitical reason to keep \nthis going.\n  It is interesting that as of this day, with this bill on the floor of \nthe Senate, scientists and engineers have gathered in Chicago for the \nthird annual International Space Station Research and Development \nConference. Research investments will help ensure the maximum \nscientific return for this one-of-a-kind laboratory. By the way, \nbecause of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, it is designated as a national \nlaboratory--a part of the ISS.\n  I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski for their hard work in \nsupporting the Nation's space program. I look forward to continuing to \ncollaborate with them. At the end of the day, what we want to do is to \nget this bill out of conference and to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nFlorida for his remarks, especially in the area of NASA, the funding of \nNASA, the importance of NASA, which he knows very well. We have worked \ntogether a long time and of course some of us--the Presiding Officer \nmight not remember--but he was an astronaut himself in another part of \nhis life. We go back a long time to our House days. We came to the \nHouse at the same time. But we have worked together on NASA because we \nbelieve in science, we believe in space, we believe that it is great \nfor America in many ways.\n  I point out again that we have a bipartisan effort on the floor right \nnow. We have three bills: the agriculture appropriations bill, which \ncame out of the Appropriations Committee 30 to 0, with Republican and \nDemocratic support; the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill--\nwhere I serve as the ranking member of the subcommittee and Senator \nMikulski serves as the chair of the subcommittee--which came out 30 to \n0; and the transportation, housing bill, which came out 29 to 1.\n  We are talking about working together. We are working under the \nMurray-Ryan numbers. That is what we are trying to stay within. I would \nlike to see us move these three bills. If we can do this, we are going \nto regular order, which we need. I think it shows--when we have this \nkind of bipartisan effort coming out of the Appropriations Committee to \nthe floor--we are saying to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle: \nLook, we believe these are fair bills, we believe it is a bipartisan \neffort, and we want to fund these agencies because they are important \nto this country and also there is some certainty out there. We do not \nneed to go back to uncertainty in this body or in this government.\n  I thank Senator Nelson for his remarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  This morning the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed \nlegislation approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. I believe that Congress \nshould do all it can to push the Obama administration to approve this \nproject. This will, of course, help create American jobs; they will \ncome along with the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  To me, this morning's committee vote was nothing more than a show \nvote. It is going to do nothing to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline. It \nwill put no pressure on the White House. It will not put a single \nshovel in the ground building the pipeline because the Democratic \nmajority leader has absolutely no intention of allowing this bill to \nget to a vote right here on the Senate floor. The majority leader knows \nthat if Senators got the chance to vote on this bill, there is a very \nhigh likelihood it would pass. President Obama cannot afford that, and \nthe majority leader will not do anything the President does not want. \nThe majority leader will not do anything to anger the extremists who \nfund the Democratic Party and who oppose an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy in a plan that includes oil.\n  I know the last thing Americans and the people in the gallery want to \nhear about is Senate process and Senate procedures, but here is why it \nmatters: There are issues that are important to this country, issues \nsuch as jobs, energy, and controlling government spending. There are \nproblems we need to solve in this country, and they are not being voted \non here in the Senate because the majority leader continues to block \nvotes. He has blocked votes, he has blocked amendments, and he has even \nblocked debate on one issue after another.\n  I believe the majority leader has abused every power at his disposal \nand even broken the rules of the Senate--rules that have been in place \nfor over a century. He has done this to give himself new powers. Over \nthe past 6\\1/2\\ years the majority leader has taken an unprecedented \nstand against action in the Senate. He has used tactics such as the so-\ncalled filling the amendment tree on bills. That means he stops anyone \nelse from offering amendments other than himself. He has used what is \ncalled rule XIV of the Standing Rules to bypass committees, so we are \nonly able to talk about what he wants to talk about, not what our \nconstituents want to talk about, what we hear about from home, or what \nother committee members want to talk about. These kinds of tactics may \nmake it easier for Senator Reid to get what he wants, but they shut \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats--out of legislating and they shut \nout the American people whom all of us represent, Democrats as well as \nRepublicans.\n  Senator Reid has filled the amendment tree at least 85 times since he \nbecame majority leader. That is more than twice as many times as the \nprevious six majority leaders combined.\n  Between July 2013 and May of this year, Republicans in the Senate \nfiled 810 amendments, but we only got a total of 9 votes--810 different \nideas brought forward by Republicans, and Senator Reid has blocked vote \nafter vote, to the point where we have gotten only 9 votes on 810 \namendments, and this is almost in a full year.\n  If you want a comparison, take a look at the House of \nRepresentatives, where the Republicans are in the majority but the \nminority party, the Democrats, have an opportunity to offer amendments \nand have votes. Over that same time period in the House of \nRepresentatives, the Democrats have gotten 132 votes on their \namendments. The Democratic minority on the House side has had 132 \nvotes, while the Republican minority on the Senate side has gotten a \ntotal of 9.\n  In the Senate, it is not just the Republicans who are not getting \ntheir votes. The majority leader is blocking the Democrats as well. \nDuring that same time, from July of 2013 to May of 2014, Democrats \nintroduced 676 amendments on legislation on the floor, and there were \nonly 7 rollcall votes on 676 amendments. I guess it is not surprising \nthat Republicans cannot get votes on their amendments, but it is very \nsurprising that the Democrats cannot get votes because only the \nmajority leader gets a vote.\n  It is the same story on appropriations bills, and that is why I am \nhere at this time--because we are dealing with appropriations bills. \nThey are some of the most important bills we are supposed to consider \nin Congress. These are the bills which determine how much Washington \nspends every year on all the discretionary programs. We started \ndebating the first of these yesterday, and we may do so over the next \nfew weeks.\n  It used to be that the Senate would take up these bills one by one, \nand Senators would get a chance to offer amendments and to represent \nthe people who elected them to office. Not anymore. Under this \nDemocratic majority leader, the amendment process on appropriations \nbills has been almost completely shut down. In the past 2 years \nRepublicans have gotten just six amendments to appropriations bills. \nSenate Democrats only got one amendment during that same period. The \nSenate approved trillions--trillions--of dollars in Washington \nspending, but Harry Reid allowed action on just seven amendments total. \nIn the 8 years before Senator Reid became majority leader, the Senate \nprocessed an average of almost 300 amendments to appropriations bills \nevery year--every year almost 300 amendments to appropriations bills.\n  Senators from both parties have been shut out of the process, and the \npeople we represent have been shut out of the process as well--all by \nSenator Reid. It is the same kind of power grab we saw last September \nwhen the majority leader used the so-called nuclear option to stop \ndebate in the Senate. He radically changed the rules of the Senate to \nstrip the rights of the minority party. Originally, it had to do with \neliminating the filibuster on nominations, but it is the same effect. \nThe majority leader grabbed more power for himself and took away the \nright of anyone else in the Senate to represent their constituents.\n  This is not how it is supposed to be. The Senate was designed to be a \nplace where we debate these issues and where political minorities get \nfair representation. The father of our Constitution James Madison \nexplained that the Senate's role was ``first to protect the people \nagainst the rulers.'' James Madison, the father of the Constitution, \nstated that the Senate's role is ``first to protect the people against \nthe rulers.'' That was the point of this body. That is why over its \nhistory the Senate has adopted rules that provide strong protections \nfor political minorities. Well, the way the Senate has been run by \nMajority Leader Reid, it has been embarrassing, it has been unfair, and \nit has been insulting to the American people.\n  Again, I know this isn't the most exciting topic of discussion for \npeople to hear, but the damage that is being done by the Senate's \nfailure to act is very real. Congress has important legislation to \ndebate, such as approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, but the majority \nleader won't even allow a vote on the bill. Our Nation has a total debt \nof $17.5 trillion, but the majority leader of the Senate blocks \namendments that could improve the appropriations bills and maybe start \nto control Washington's wasteful spending. We should have an open \namendment process on these appropriations bills this year, as we should \nhave had in previous years, and we should be starting with the bill \nthat is on the floor today.\n  It is time for Democrats to stop the show votes and allow real votes \non issues important to American families.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded, and that I be recognized to speak as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to \nthe Senate to speak about the situation in Iraq. A moment ago I was\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\njoined by some very close friends from South Florida, including the \nformer mayor of West Miami, and now the chair of the county commission \nin Miami-Dade County, Rebecca Sosa. She actually got me started in \npolitics.\n  When she was mayor of West Miami, I told her I was interested in \npublic service. We walked door to door in the small city called West \nMiami which has 5,000 residents. She taught me how to campaign one on \none with real people and their real lives.\n  Now I return home every weekend--when we are done here and with my \nwork throughout the State--to the same community that I still live in, \nand increasingly people there are asking me about the situation in \nIraq. The question I get from many people is--and I want to be blunt \nabout how they say it--I understand this is a problem, but why is it \nour business? Why do we care about what is happening in another country \nwhen it seems to be a fight among themselves?\n  That is a very legitimate question. I know Americans are watching the \nissues that are happening abroad, and they ask themselves: Why does \nAmerica need to be the world's policeman?\n  I want to take a few moments to explain why this matters--why it \nmatters to people not just in the Middle East but even people in the \nsmall city of West Miami where I still live. The situation in Iraq is, \nto some extent, a civil war between Sunni and Shia, as we see in other \nconflicts such as Syria and other places. That is a real aspect of it. \nI would say the current government of Iraq has contributed greatly to \nit--by the way, spurred on by Iranian influence--to further exacerbate \nthat divide between Sunni and Shia.\n\n  While it is fair to say that much of what is happening in Iraq is a \ncivil war between two sects, it is not fair to say that is all it is, \nbecause what is happening in Iraq has a direct bearing on the future \nsecurity of every American, even those Americans who live in the small \ncity of West Miami where I live. Here is why.\n  Imagine for a moment if we could go back in time to the year 1997 or \n1996 or 1998 or 1999 and had known about Al Qaeda then what we knew by \nSeptember of 2001. We would have realized this is a dangerous group \nthat had the capacity and the deep willingness to attack and kill \nAmericans in order to terrorize so that we would leave the Middle East \nand turn it over to people such as them. If we had known that and taken \nthat seriously--and I would say some did know this--if we had done \nsomething about it, it is fair to say that eventually there would have \nbeen some sort of terrorist attack, but maybe there wouldn't have been \none on September 11, 2001. If we had actually targeted this group and \ndegraded their capabilities while they were still in their safe haven \nin Afghanistan--or even before that--we potentially could have saved \nthe lives of thousands of Americans and, more importantly, avoided the \nrise of Al Qaeda in the region and in the world. But we did not. While \nthis is not a time to point fingers or throw blame around, I certainly \nthink it is a time to learn the lessons of that history and apply them \nto the challenges of our time.\n  What is happening today in Iraq and in portions of Syria is in many \nways the exact same thing: A radical group--ISIL--which, by the way, \nrose through the ranks of Al Qaeda until they now have a split from Al \nQaeda, believe it or not, because Al Qaeda thinks that ISIL is too \nbrutal to their fellow Muslims. This group has been growing in strength \never since the United States left Iraq. This group has been fed and its \nstrength has been given to them by foreign fighters who have spilled \ninto the conflict in Syria where they have established a foothold and \nhave used it as a staging and operational ground to take their brand of \nruthlessness now into Iraq.\n  We saw over the weekend images and photographs and videos of the mass \nassassinations, executions of Shia members of the Iraqi military. They \nhave grown in strength over this time and they have begun to grow in \ntheir influence in Iraq. Their goal is simple: They want to establish \nthe premier Islamic caliphate in all the world--the premier Sunni \nIslamic caliphate in the region. Caliphate basically means Islamic \nkingdom. They don't care about existing borders. The kingdom they \nenvision is a vast safe haven that encompasses portions of Syria they \nalready have under their control and portions of Iraq they are now \ngaining control of.\n  What is their goal for this place they are trying to set up? Their \nfirst goal is to institute Sharia law, and they have a particularly \nbrutal brand of Sharia they have forced upon people both in Syria and \nnow increasingly in Iraq.\n  Their second goal is to establish an Islamic caliphate state--a safe \nhaven from where they can plan and train and ultimately carry out \nterrorist attacks against the United States and other countries, \nincluding attacks here in our homeland.\n  We must learn the lessons of before 2001, and we must say to \nourselves: Under no circumstances will we ever again allow a safe haven \nor for this kind of terrorist group to ever gain a safe haven anywhere \nin the world. We will never allow this to happen again.\n  That is why it is so critical for us to be engaged here. The reason \nwhy we should care about this issue is not because we want to force \nupon Iraq democracy or force upon Iraq the type of government we think \nthey need. The reason why we care is because we cannot allow a safe \nhaven to develop there, that can be used to carry out attacks that can \nkill Americans, including here in our homeland. This is why we should \ncare. This is why it is so important that the Commander in Chief of the \nUnited States--the President--come as quickly as possible before the \nAmerican people and before this Congress with a plan to address this \nrisk.\n  I know the President likes to go around saying the war is over, but \nno one told ISIL that. No one told Al Qaeda that. No one has told these \nterrorists that. They don't think the war is over. In fact, in their \nminds, this war will go on for hundreds of years. The only person who \ncan rally this country behind a plan to address this is not a U.S. \nSenator or a Member of Congress, not the majority leader or the Speaker \nof the House, not the countless people who write very well-informed \nopinion pieces in our newspapers. The only person in this country who \ncan rally us around a plan to address this is the President himself.\n  So while I understand he doesn't want us engaged in another conflict, \nand neither do most Americans, he knows--he must know--that we are \ngoing to have to do something about this. That is not the issue before \nus. The issue before us is whether we do something about it now or we \ndo something about this later when the problem will be much harder and \nmore costly to address.\n  I hope the President does bring us together to solve this problem. \nThis doesn't need to be--and it should not be--a partisan issue. The \nnational security of the United States should never be a partisan \nissue, for if terrorists carry out an attack on our homeland they will \nnot attack Democratic sites but Republican sites; they will not target \nconservatives but leave liberals alone; they will target Americans. \nAmericans from every political persuasion died on 9/11. I fear that may \nhappen at some point again. So we should all care about this.\n\n  The only person who can bring us together to do something about it is \nthe President, and so far he has failed to do it. I don't know if it is \nbecause it runs counter to his political narrative that the war is over \nand he got us out of Iraq. I don't know why it is, but so far he has \nnot done that, and he must.\n  Mr. President: On this issue, you must lead. You must put aside all \nof these domestic, political debates that are going on in your office \nabout how this is going to poll or whether this runs contrary to what \nyou said on the campaign trail. This is too important, it is too vital, \nit is too serious, and it is too dangerous.\n  I have my own ideas, as do others, about what that plan should look \nlike, but we want there to be a plan. We are not asking the President \nto come forward with a plan to go looking for something to attack. We \nwant him to come forward with a plan because only he can, and he must. \nIn my opinion, that plan has to be we must do whatever we can and \neverything we can to prevent this group, ISIL, from gaining operational \nlong-term control of these territories in Iraq. To me, that means going \nafter their command-and-control structure, which involves their ability \nto transit fighters and weapons and fuel and food and ammunition from\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\ntheir safe havens in Syria to their increasingly new spaces they have \nnow carved out for themselves in Iraq.\n  I think all of us in this Chamber, when it comes to issues of \nnational security, understand we should not be a part of the back-and-\nforth of partisan politics.\n  I guess my plea here today on the Senate floor is this: Mr. \nPresident, you must lead on this issue. You must come forward with a \nplan that we can rally this Congress and our people behind, because if \nwe fail to do so, I fear our Nation will pay a terrible price down the \nroad. Never again can we allow an Al Qaeda-style group to establish a \nsafe haven where they can plot against us anywhere on this planet. The \nchoice before you, Mr. President, is you either deal with it now or \nsome future President and future Congresses and future Americans will \ndeal with it later. I hope you will deal with it now. I hope we will \nremember the lessons of our recent history. The only one who can lead \nus in that direction is you, Mr. President. I hope you will, because \nthe consequences of failing to do so would be dramatic and, in my \nopinion, will be condemned by history.\n  I hope over the next few hours, the next few days, we will have the \nopportunity to come to this floor and advocate on behalf of a concrete \nplan of action that most, if not all, of us can support, so we can \nensure we can say that during our time here we did everything we needed \nto do to keep America safe.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the House's \ntragic and disconcerting failure to do anything to fix our broken \nimmigration system, even though an entire year has passed since the \nSenate passed bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform with 68 \nvotes--an impressive bipartisan vote total in this increasingly \npartisan climate.\n  The House Republicans' lack of action on immigration is almost \ncompletely inexplicable if you compare the most recent Republican Party \nplatform to what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had to say \nabout the Senate immigration reform bill.\n  When you take the time to look at both of these documents, you \nrealize that no other bill that we could pass during this or any other \nCongress would accomplish as many of the Republican Party's stated \nlegislative objectives as passing immigration reform.\n  Just so that everyone understands this, I want to take you through a \nstep-by-step process where we look at the Republican Party platform and \ncompare it to the CBO report.\n  The first substantive sentence of the Republican Party platform says:\n\n       The best jobs program is economic growth. Republicans will \n     pursue free market policies that are the surest way to boost \n     employment and create job growth and economic prosperity for \n     all.\n\n  Well, what does the CBO report have to say about what the immigration \nbill does for economic growth, job growth, and economic prosperity?\n  Page 3 of the CBO report says that ``the bill would increase real . . \n. GDP relative to the amount CBO projects under current law by 3.3 \npercent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. . . .''\n  Think about what that means in a $16 trillion economy. If we pass \nthis bill, we will be adding over $500 billion of annual economic \ngrowth to our economy than we otherwise would. This is a staggering \nnumber.\n  Well, what does the immigration bill do for job growth? Page 4 of the \nCBO report says that the bill will increase the number of jobs in the \nU.S. economy by about 6 million.\n  What about economic prosperity? On this front, page 3 of the CBO \nreport says ``the rate of return on capital would be higher under the \nlegislation than under current law. . . .'' That means Americans would \nhave more savings and a more secure safety net.\n  This means that passing immigration reform would accomplish the \nRepublican Party's top priority far better than any piece of \nlegislation the Republicans currently have before Congress.\n  What about the second stated priority of the Republican platform? \nThat priority says that ``small businesses are the leaders in the \nworld's advances in technology and innovation, and we pledge to \nstrengthen that role and foster small business entrepreneurship.''\n  Do you know what the best way to foster small business \nentrepreneurship is? Immigration reform.\n  According to a study from the Kauffman Foundation, immigrants were \nalmost twice as likely to start small businesses in 2012 as native-born \nAmericans. Madam President, 27.1 percent of new entrepreneurs in 2012 \nwere immigrants. That is up from 13.7 percent in 1996.\n  More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by \nimmigrants--90 companies--or by their children--an additional 114 \ncompanies--because a lot of these small businesses become big \nbusinesses. The immigration bill has an entrepreneurship visa where \nimmigrants who have raised money from legitimate investors will be \ngiven a green card to come here, open companies, and hire Americans.\n  Why will this happen? Because immigrants have always provided the \nenthusiasm, hard work, and determination to reenergize America. They \nperform very important jobs at the lower end of the economic spectrum \nwithout complaint to make a better life for their families and they \nprovide innovation and new ideas at the higher end of the economy to \ncreate the latest big inventions that fuel our growth.\n  But that is only scratching the surface of what this immigration bill \ndoes. The next priority on page 3 of the Republican platform is \n``balancing the budget.'' What is the bill that Congress can pass this \nyear that best balances the budget? Immigration reform.\n  According to CBO, passing immigration reform would ``reduce budget \ndeficits by $197 billion over the 2014-2023 period and by about $700 \nbillion over the 2024-2033 period.'' That is $1 trillion in savings \nthat we can achieve by passing immigration reform.\n  Finally, with regard to immigration itself, the Republican Party \nplatform says ``our highest priority is to secure the rule of law at \nboth our borders and at ports of entry.''\n  Under the Senate immigration bill, anyone who wants to try and cross \nthe border illegally will have to figure out a way to get over an 18-\nfoot steel pedestrian fence, get past the border agents standing every \n1,000 feet apart from Brownsville to San Diego 24 hours a day, and then \nevade the sensors, cameras, and drones that will track the crosser \nuntil they are caught by a border agent or local police.\n  That is an amendment proposed by our Republican colleagues but we put \ninto the bill. If you try to overstay your visa, your name will be \nplaced on a list given to immigration enforcement officials to find \nyou, detain you, and deport you. If you try to work here illegally, you \nwill never be able to get a job because you will not have a name, a \nSocial Security number, and a matching picture that will pop up on our \nnew E-Verify system when you apply for a job. Future waves of illegal \nimmigration will be prevented if this bill is passed.\n  So for all of the railing from the hard right about stopping illegal \nimmigration, no one--no one--can deny there have been huge improvements \nover current law.\n  Let's take an inventory of what this bill does: Stimulate the \neconomy. Check. Create jobs. Check. Help small businesses. Check. \nReduce the debt. Check. Secure the border. Check. End visa overstays. \nCheck. End illegal employment. Check.\n  These are all of the things Republicans claim they want to do, all in \none bill. So why is it that all of these positive benefits to passing \nreform and all of the costs we pay for doing nothing, why is it that \nwith that the House of Representatives, and the House Republicans in \nparticular, refuse to do anything to fix our broken immigration system? \nWhy do House Republicans not pass our bill to fix our broken \nimmigration system, not change it, not pass a good law? This question \ncan be answered with one simple word: Fear. One simple word. Fear.\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n  Fear is what often causes people to do what is counter to their self-\ninterest. Fear makes people succumb to their basest instincts instead \nof rising to their noblest ambitions. Fear paralyzes us during times \nwhen we need to be taking action. House Republicans are afraid of \nimmigration. They are not only afraid of voting on an immigration bill, \nthey are even afraid of introducing legislation on immigration.\n  Let me give you some examples. June 2013, Congressman Joe Heck says \nhe was going to introduce immigration reform that would address our \nbroken system. In December of 2013, Republican Congressman Heck \nannounced he would not be introducing any immigration bill of any kind.\n  April 2014. Congressman Joe Barton said he was going to introduce \nmajor immigration legislation. The bill was never introduced. Eric \nCantor, who just this week claimed that his position on immigration \nnever wavered, said last year he was going to introduce legislation to \n``deal with the kids who did not break any laws and themselves came \ninto this country in many cases unbeknownst to them.'' This legislation \nwas also never introduced.\n  Finally, House Republican leadership has repeatedly announced they \n``think we finally have the policy right on immigration.'' But again, \nwe have seen no bill even introduced, much less voted on. House \nRepublicans are so afraid of immigration that they have handed the \npolicy and leadership gavel to Steve King, who compares immigrants to \ndogs and livestock and who claims immigration is a slow-motion \nholocaust.\n  Eric Cantor is actually right that his position on immigration reform \nnever wavered. His rhetoric was often proreform, but his legislative \nand voting record was always antireform. Cantor never introduced or \nvoted for a single immigration bill that would help a single immigrant. \nBut he loved to vaguely reference the need for immigration reform when \nasked about it. That has been the real Republican Party position on \nimmigration: pretending to be pro-immigration reform rhetorically, but \nnever, never permit a Republican to actually introduce immigration \nreform legislation and definitely never allow immigration reform \nlegislation to come to a vote. This is because House Republicans may \nclaim to disagree with Steve King's words, but they certainly do not \nseem to disagree with Steve King's policy objectives. They do not want \nimmigration reform that will rationalize our legal immigration system \nand create a path to legality for those who are already here. Instead, \nthey support the failed and tragic policies of self-deportation for the \npeople who are already here, and they want to reduce legal immigration \nto a trickle for the people who wish to come here and contribute to our \nsociety.\n  Two nights ago, when I watched our gritty U.S. soccer team win an \namazing game against Ghana, I saw an amazing team effort coached by an \nenergetic German immigrant whose tactics and decisions helped the \nUnited States prevail in the final stages of an incredible, compelling \ngame.\n  Did Republicans watch the same game and ask: Why is an immigrant \ncoaching our team? These last 2 weeks, I watched the San Antonio Spurs \nplay some of the greatest team basketball anyone has ever seen with \nplayers from France, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Canada, and, \nof course, the United States. Did Republicans watch those same games \nand ask: Who cares about the quality of the basketball being played? \nWhy are immigrants allowed in the NBA?\n  This is the problem the Republicans face. Republicans have a very \nimportant choice to make the next few days. If they continue on the \nsame path they are on now, where they feign sympathy for immigration in \ntheir rhetoric but do not vote on or even introduce legislation to fix \nour broken system, it will be impossible for the average voters to \ndistinguish between any Republican and Steve King. Republican words of \nsympathy will not matter to people whose families are suffering, whose \nbusinesses cannot find the workers they need or whose churches are \nseeing their members deported. They will know that Republicans are to \nblame for doing nothing on immigration reform. Even worse, Republicans \nwill get the worst of both worlds in this scenario. Their most strident \nrightwing voters will actually punish them for their Machiavellian \nefforts to feign sympathy for immigration reform.\n  So what is the real answer for Republicans? Well, Lindsey Graham \nshowed us the way by being a man of principle. This weekend he said it \nbest. He said:\n\n       I don't think Eric got beat because of his stand on \n     immigration, I think he got beat because of his lack of \n     defining himself on immigration. Republicans nationally will \n     accept an earned pathway to citizenship if you secure the \n     border. For our party to let the 35 percent tell us how to \n     engage on immigration, we will lose a natural ally in the \n     Hispanic community.\n\n  That is from Senator Graham who just won his election with 59 percent \nof the vote, while defending back at home in a conservative Republican \nState, South Carolina, immigration reform.\n  In conclusion, to Speaker Boehner, Majority Whip McCarthy, and others \nin the new House leadership, the choice is yours. Join with us, the \nevangelical community, the Catholic Church, American farmers, American \npolice chiefs, America's business community, and 65 percent of American \nvoters in supporting tough, fair, practical immigration reform \nlegislation or, alternatively, you can ignore the benefits of \nimmigration reform and continue to fail to address our broken \nimmigration system because of your fear, and you can eventually watch \nyour party go into the dustbin of history. Those are your two choices, \nRepublicans.\n  There is no doubt that at the moment Steve King is winning. \nRepublicans are implementing his policy objective of inaction to \nperfection because they are so fearful. But hopefully, just like the \nU.S. team, House Republicans can overcome their fears, appeal to their \nmore noble aspirations, and we can pull victory from the jaws of defeat \nat the very end here and pass the immigration reform legislation our \ncountry so desperately needs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have been on the motion to proceed to \nour three appropriations bills since 10 a.m. this morning. It has \nalmost been 4 hours, and it is true, under the cloture, there is 30 \nhours of debate. We could let this go on until 11 p.m. tonight--we \ncould. Actually, Members have had an interesting day speaking about \nissues related to Iraq and to immigration, but we would like to focus \non the bills beforehand: agriculture, FDA--how do we feed people in our \nown country, save the family farm, and be able to export food.\n  We would like to bring up a bill that funds FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, that looks out for food safety, but also the safety and \nefficacy of life-science products such as medical devices, biotech \nproducts, and pharmaceuticals, which I know are important to the State \nof the Presiding Officer.\n  We want to be able to bring up Transportation, Housing, and Urban \nDevelopment. The highway trust fund is going to run out.\n  In my own home State we need the transportation money. We need it for \nthe formula funding that will be important to roads, but we also need \nthe money in there that looks out for small airports, such as the \nHagerstown airport, the Frederick airport, which the President's plane \nneeds to get to Camp David.\n  Right up the road is the Hagerstown airport, for which there is a \ngrowing manufacturing hub, of which there is small manufacturing \nemploying 300 to 400 people. Some make trucks, some make the heavy-duty \nequipment to be sold, that are also export products. One company \nactually puts in the avionics to the airplanes guarding our border.\n  If we put all that together, it is close to 900 to 1,200 jobs. Hello, \nthis is what we are talking about--public investment that creates \nprivate sector jobs and does public safety.\n  So we are saying to those who are considering how we could move \nahead, we encourage them now. I suggest we follow the model when we \nwere on the floor 3 years ago. That was the last time we had these \nappropriations on the floor. We had an amendment process.\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\n  The managers of the bill, such as my vice chairman Senator Shelby and \nI, worked with Members on a defined list, some we could actually take. \nThere were some excellent ideas where Members wanted to improve on what \nwe had done.\n  For those who have concern about spending, they can actually come and \noffer cuts or they can offer replacements. This is the place where if \nyou want government to work your way, it is your day and you do it \nthrough the amendment process.\n  Most Americans don't understand that in order to debate a bill on the \nSenate floor, you have to first file a motion to proceed. That is \nasking permission to come to the floor to take up the bill. So we had \nto have a cloture vote on it. OK, it passed 95 to 3. I think it is the \nwill of the Senate to get it going, and let's get these amendments--get \nit on with the amendments.\n  Are there anxieties on both sides about the nature of those \namendments? Sure. But that is what amendments are. Some we can take, \nsome we need to debate.\n  We are the greatest deliberative body in the world. We have to start \ndeliberating.\n  I say to my friends who are pondering how to proceed, the best way to \nproceed is look at the agreement we had in 2011 that allowed for \namendments, a regular order, a methodical process for considering those \namendments, and then we would be able to get on them, be able to debate \nthem. My suggestion would be that we would alternate sides, a \nDemocratic amendment, a Republican amendment--hey, maybe even a \nbipartisan amendment.\n  I hope we do not spin our wheels and spin the clock for 8\\1/2\\ more \nhours, because the American people know that after all is said and \ndone, more gets said than gets done.\n  I am suggesting--really--let's follow the regular order. The process \nI am recommending is not new. There are no surprises, there are no \nstunts. It is a process we have followed in the past. I am suggesting, \nalong with Senator Shelby, the exact model we used 3 years ago, the \nlast time appropriations were on the floor.\n  There are those who say in this country we have a spending problem. \nIf you think we have a spending problem, this is the time to come to \nthe floor and debate. If you think we have a spending problem and we \nare spending too much on the Justice Department--if you think it is too \nmuch money on bulletproof vests for cops or shelters for battered \nwomen, come on. If you think there is too much money in the space \nprogram, you don't like this rocket ship or that satellite, this is the \nplace to come. Offer amendments. We are ready to debate.\n  I speak for my two other subcommittee chairs, Senator Murray on \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies, and \nSenator Pryor on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies. We are already in consultation \nwith the other side of the aisle. Senator Collins on transportation and \nSenator Blunt on agriculture are also ready to debate.\n  I would hope we could move forward, have a method for moving forward \nthat promotes regular order. If we do that, I think Members who haven't \nexperienced too much--because of our gridlock and deadlock and the lock \non amendments that we actually--I think they are going to like it \nbecause they like democracy. If you like the Constitution, if you like \ndemocracy, this is the place where we can put it into place today.\n  Before I yield the floor, I note that the leadership from the \nRepublican side is in conference with Senator Shelby. I hope that is \ngood news.\n  Then for those on both sides of the aisle watching the process on the \nfloor, if you have amendments, start to gear up and get ready to bring \nthem over. Senator Shelby and I are here. We are ready to receive them. \nWe are ready to get ready to do them, we are ready to talk about them, \nand set the stage for hearing them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with what is happening in Iraq, what is \nhappening with the claim of lost IRS emails from Lois Lerner, what is \nhappening in the developments of the Benghazi investigation, what is \nhappening in Ukraine, and what could happen in Afghanistan, it is \neasy--perhaps too easy--to overlook a crisis occurring right here in \nAmerica on our southern border. That crisis is easily described as a \nwave of humanity coming across our southern border from Central \nAmerica.\n  Tragically, tens of thousands of the people coming across our borders \nseeking refuge in the United States are children--unaccompanied \nminors--from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The question we \nshould ask ourselves is, Why are we seeing this unprecedented increase \nin the number of unaccompanied minors coming across our southwestern \nborder?\n  As we can see, in 2011 there were 6,560 detained. But that number has \ngrown steadily, from 2012, 2013, and now 2014. So far 47,000 minors--\nunaccompanied children--have been detained coming across our border, \nprimarily from Central America. It is estimated that this 60,000 number \nwill likely double next year unless something is done.\n  These children--and their parents are enabling this--are crossing the \nborder because of a widespread perception that they will be allowed to \nstay here. The reason for that perception is a series of events--a \nseries of stated changes in policy--which have given the impression \nthat President Obama does not have a commitment to enforce our \nimmigration laws.\n  None of us denies that Central America's Northern Triangle is plagued \nby drug cartels, street gangs, rampant violence, and deeply entrenched \npoverty. There is no doubt about it. The fact is that the majority of \npeople coming across the southwestern border these days are not from \nMexico; they are from Central America. They are coming through a 500-\nmile strip of border between Guatemala and Mexico, making their way up \nthe Mexican coast in areas largely controlled by the Zetas--a criminal \norganization, a drug cartel which has basically figured this is another \nway to make money. In other words, they not only traffic in drugs, they \ntraffic in people, and now, quite honestly, they are trafficking in \ntens of thousands of children.\n  The massive spike in unaccompanied minors, of course, seemed to start \nto take off when President Obama announced in 2012 his so-called \ndeferred action plan. To be clear and to be fair, this deferred action \nannouncement where the President said he would not deport certain \ncategories or classes of children would not apply to the children \ncoming across the border today. So we might wonder, why in the world do \nthey keep coming?\n  Well, that was not an isolated event in 2012. Just to remind my \ncolleagues, this deferred action announcement came 2 years after John \nMorton, who was the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or \nICE, circulated a memo declaring that the enforcement of U.S. \nimmigration laws against most illegal aliens was now a lower priority. \nThat memo went out in June of 2010.\n  A few months later several colleagues and I sent a letter to then-\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano expressing \nour concern that the administration's selective enforcement of our \nimmigration statutes was jeopardizing public safety and breeding \ncontempt for the rule of law. That letter read, in part:\n\n       Numerous criminal aliens are being released into society \n     and are having proceedings terminated simply because ICE has \n     decided that such cases do not fit within the Department's \n     chosen enforcement priorities. It appears that ICE is \n     enforcing the law based on criteria it arbitrarily chose with \n     complete disregard for the enforcement laws created by \n     Congress.\n\n  Then, in the second Morton memo the following June, then-Director \nMorton sent around another memo which further advised U.S. immigration \nauthorities to systemically reconsider hundreds of thousands of \nimmigration cases and to make them low priorities to enforce \nimmigration laws against millions of people illegally present in the \nUnited States. That second Morton\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nmemo went even further than the first in looking at everyone--all the \nundocumented population here in the United States--and saying: We are \ngoing to reconsider our priorities in terms of repatriation of those \nindividuals should they be detained by ICE. That June 2011 memo laid \nthe groundwork for the deferred action program the President announced \na year later, which was 2012, and these programs were extended earlier \nthis month.\n  The average was about 6,500; then it doubled in 2012; and then it \ndoubled again in 2013; and then it is scheduled to double again in \n2014.\n  The administration has continued to treat the vast majority of \nillegal immigrants as low-priority offenders, thereby creating perverse \nincentives for people to cross the border. If people don't believe \nthere is any consequence associated with entering the country in \nviolation of our immigration laws, they are going to continue to do it. \nAs the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, law enforcement has more \nthan just what I would call a goal-line defense priority. In other \nwords, deterrence is very important. Obviously, people are not being \ndeterred.\n  Perversely, people are being encouraged by this series of events to \nshow up at the border--and, of course, in huge numbers--overwhelming \nBorder Patrol, which is now no longer looking uniformly at drug dealers \nand human smuggling operations. Now they are trying to take care of \nchildren and trying to get them to a safe place to live and to take \ncare of them.\n  John Sandweg, who served as the ICE Director from 2013 to 2014, \nrecently told the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your \n     odds of getting deported are close to zero.\n\n  It is just unlikely to happen. That message has obviously gotten \nthrough to folks in Central America, who, admittedly, are living in a \nvery tough neighborhood, and it has encouraged many of them to risk \ntheir lives and their children's lives on an extremely dangerous \njourney through this region of Mexico covered by the drug cartels.\n  Actually, it is part of the business model of the drug cartels to \nencourage this flow of illegal migration from Central America through \nMexico because they effectively get paid a tax by the coyotes and human \nsmugglers who smuggle people through this dangerous region. One of the \nways they come is on the top of one of these trains.\n  This is a shot of a train they call The Beast. It has been well \ndocumented and written about by a Salvadoran journalist, Oscar \nMartinez, in a book he wrote in 2013 which is chilling, but it \ndescribes the journey from Central America through Mexico on the top of \none of these trains and the risk of accident, the likelihood of sexual \nassault--6 to 8 out of 10 migrant women are sexually assaulted--people \nwho are kidnapped for ransom, and people who are killed who don't \ncomply with the dictates of the drug cartels.\n  Don't take just my word for it.\n  Last week the Washington Post confirmed that the influx of \nunaccompanied minors:\n\n       . . . is being driven in large part by the perception that \n     they will be allowed to stay under the Obama administration's \n     immigration policies.\n\n  The New York Times recently told the story of a 13-year-old Honduran \nboy who was detained in Mexico while trying to reach the United States. \nLike so many others across Central America, the Times reported this boy\n\n       . . . said his mother believed that the Obama \n     administration had quietly changed its policy regarding \n     unaccompanied minors and that if he made it across he would \n     have a better shot at staying.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Maryland is here.\n  Not only is this affecting States such as Texas, but these children, \n1,000 of them, are being effectively warehoused in Lackland Air Force \nbase in San Antonio, TX, some are being shipped to Arizona and \nCalifornia, and some are being sent--or at least the plan is to send \nthem--to Virginia and Maryland, because these 47,000 children who have \nbeen detained since October of last year are overwhelming the capacity \nof local communities and State and Federal authorities to deal with \nthem. As I said, The Beast, which transports people 1,000 miles or so \non a trip from southern Mexico up to the southern border of Texas, is a \nhorrific way to transit that huge expanse.\n  Migrant women are preyed upon by drug cartels such as the Zetas. \nOfficials from the mayor's office in Ciudad Hidalgo told Oscar \nMartinez, the author of the book ``The Beast,'' in Ciudad Hidalgo the \nZetas control all trafficking, sending men to recruit women in Central \nAmerica, and sometimes even kidnapping migrant women riding the buses. \nThey sell the women to truckdrivers for a night, and then throw them \naway like unwanted scraps.\n  My point is, there is nothing humane about encouraging people to \ntravel through cartel-dominated smuggling routes in the hopes of \nreaching the United States. Yet that has been the effect of the \nperception that the President and his administration are not committed \nto enforcing our immigration laws. I know that wasn't their intention \nbut that has been the consequence. Even before the ongoing border \ncrisis erupted, people were taking notice of the President's disregard \nfor the rule of law.\n  Last December, for example, a Federal district court judge in \nBrownsville, TX, absolutely excoriated the Obama administration for \nmaking a mockery of enforcement, noting that the President's policies \nwere incentivizing human traffickers and endangering the lives of \nchildren. Here is what Federal Judge Andrew Hanen said:\n\n       By fostering an atmosphere whereby illegal aliens are \n     encouraged to pay human smugglers for further services, the \n     government is not only allowing them to fund the illegal and \n     evil activities of these cartels, but is also inspiring them \n     to do so.\n\n  That is a Federal district judge in Brownsville, TX.\n  One final point. Some of my friends across the aisle have argued that \nif only Congress would pass President Obama's preferred immigration \nreforms, the current border crisis would never have happened. That \nignores the fact that none of these children qualify for any of the \ndeferred action policies either ordered in 2012 or any of the others I \nmentioned. But there is the perception caused by the first Morton memo, \nthe second Morton memo, then the deferred action announcement, and now \nthe widely publicized news that the President has instructed Jeh \nJohnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, to reconsider the entire \nrepatriation and deportation policy, and it is clear this is related to \nthe upcoming midterm election and the President's desire to try to make \na point.\n  The problem is his point is backfiring. It is victimizing the very \nsame people the President believes, I think, that he is trying to help. \nThat is what happens when the rule of law is no longer your priority--\nunintended consequences. As I explained today, the President's actions \nhave helped cause this humanitarian crisis.\n  I know the Finance Committee has in subcommittee appropriated I think \nroughly $2 billion to help the Federal authorities to deal with this \nhumanitarian crisis. Unfortunately, unless we are able to process \nappropriations bills across the floor of the Senate, I don't know when \nthat money is going to be available, and that is another problem.\n  But the most fundamental problem is the American people's confidence \nthat the Federal Government will enforce the laws, until such time as \nthose laws are changed, has been undermined. Passing new legislation \nwill do nothing to fix that unless the President is willing to enforce \nlaws that have already been passed by Congress. This isn't a problem of \npassing some more laws; this is a problem of the President and his \nadministration effectively conveying the message that they are not \ngoing to enforce the laws they don't want to enforce. Unless we send a \nclear, unambiguous message that our border is secure and our \nimmigration laws are being enforced, we can expect more and more \nCentral American migrants to embark on the harrowing journey from \nCentral America up through Mexico, which means more of them will be \nrobbed, kidnapped, raped, and killed. We don't know how many start out \non this journey. All we know is how many show up on the border. We \nought to be concerned about that.\n  To be clear, I remain personally committed to fixing all aspects of \nour broken immigration system, but I cannot and will not support any \npolicy that effectively empowers human traffickers and endangers the \nlives of these children.\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator from Texas leaves--\nand I know we have other matters to discuss--first I want to make a \ncomment and then I have a question.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for that very compelling \npresentation. I might not agree with every sentence, but I think the \nSenator painted a picture of what is happening at the border. We do \nhave a humanitarian crisis.\n  As chair of the Appropriations Committee, I was made aware of this \nlast year by Secretary Sebelius when they asked for more money to help. \nI said, yes, more money to help, but we needed to plan. What were we \ngoing to do with this? So now these numbers have surged, and what it \nhas become is these children effectively function as refugees.\n  This portrait the Senator has portrayed--the horrific sense of The \nBeast, and human beings, women and children, and boys, as well, being \nsold as if they were commodities? Commodities. It gives you goosebumps. \nThe Senator has painted a very compassionate and compelling picture.\n  My question, though, is we have to deal with the immediate crisis \nnow. But as the Senator talks about the enforcement on the border, what \nwould the Senator recommend we do?\n  In other words, the pictures I have seen--and I hope I will go down \nand see this for myself--is the children come up to the border control \nguy, some as young as 4 and 5 years old and some go up to the early \nteens. Some teens carry their younger siblings. Is the Senator saying \nwe should turn them away? These are not provocative questions. We have \nto work across the aisle to deal with this issue constructively, \nhumanely, and effectively.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may respond to the distinguished \nSenator's question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the Senator's leadership and big heart. This \nis not a political issue. The first and most important thing we need to \ndo is to pursue the best interests of these children, but we cannot \nsimply deal with our immigration problem, illegal immigration problem, \nat the border. It has to start back in Central America. That is one \nreason I am glad Vice President Joe Biden is traveling to Guatemala, as \nI know Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security has, to try to \nsee what they can do.\n  We then need to try to persuade our friends in Mexico to commit more \nresources. Perhaps we can persuade them to deal with the 500-mile \nsouthern border that is basically controlled by the cartels. But the \ncartels are making money. So this is a governance issue in Central \nAmerica and Mexico as well.\n  I might point out that perhaps with the same reservations the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland made about not agreeing with \neverything I said, but much of what I said, what I have said has I \nthink pretty much been echoed by my friend Representative Henry Cuellar \nfrom Laredo, TX, who obviously by virtue of where he lives and was \nraised is very knowledgeable about the border around Laredo and Mexico \nand Central America.\n  I saw an interview with our former First Lady Hillary Clinton, that \nunless we send a very clear and loud message to people in Central \nAmerica that you should not come, you should not risk your children \nmaking this long, harrowing journey because they will not be able to \nstay, then they are going to keep coming, because right now when these \nchildren come here, as the Senator knows, our capacity to deal with \nthem is overwhelmed at the local level, at the State level, and at the \nFederal level, and they are essentially being treated like refugees and \nwarehoused in places such as Lackland Air Force Base and other places \naround the country.\n  You can imagine the impact in the long run not only on the health \ncare system, on education, and other services that would be required to \ntake care of these children until they can be repatriated. But I would \nalign myself with what former Senator Clinton, the former Secretary of \nState, said: The President and the administration need to send a very \nclear and loud message that anyone who comes to the United States will \nbe returned to their country of origin once a safe family member can be \nidentified to repatriate these children. But right now the system is so \noverwhelmed that we don't even know who these children are being placed \nwith in America. They may be some claimed family member, but I am not \nsure whether there are background checks being done for criminal \nhistory or perhaps sex offense.\n  This is overwhelming the whole system. I am sure working together we \ncan come up with an improvement over where we are now, and I would \npoint out this is not a partisan issue, but it is a very harsh reality \nand my concern is it is being overwhelmed by the news out of the Middle \nEast and other concerns here in Washington when it is very much front \nand center back home in Texas.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the senior Senator from Texas, a former \nattorney general, as I recall. The Senator knows the law, he knows the \nborder, and he knows what is going on.\n  This Senator looks at this too as not only the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee but as a social worker. The care of the \nchildren even in our own country gives me pause.\n  They were originally looking at a closed Social Security building to \nhouse these children, with no bathrooms except down the hall, putting \nthem in little office cubicles. So we have a very serious problem.\n  I want the Senator from Texas to know I agree with the holding that \nwe need to have the strong and clear message in Central America, first \nof all, that these rumors are false.\n  Today is not the day to do this. I thank the Senator for his \ncompelling comments. I would like to work with the Senator from Texas \nand also continue to work with the administration to focus on this. But \nthe message does have to go to Central America. I think we are fair \ngame in Central America. From what I have heard, there are all these \nradio ads and so on that are truly exploiting this. There is violence, \nthere is ghoulish, grim violence against children in Central America. \nDesperate mothers and grandmothers are trying to look for a way out. \nThey are being exploited. I am going to work with the Senator in any \nway I can to stem the flow, deal with the humanitarian crisis, and get \na long-range solution. I appreciate this conversation going forward.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and look forward to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I rise today not only as a Senator from \nMontana, but as a veteran of the long and difficult war in Iraq. Like \nmost Americans, the increasing instability in Iraq and the \ndisintegration of the country along sectarian boundaries has me deeply \nconcerned. This past weekend when I was home in Montana and talking to \nMontanans, they were very concerned about what was going on in Iraq; \nthey express their interest to me about Iraq on a regular basis.\n  The heinous advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, their \nsystematic execution of Iraqi soldiers, and the murder of innocent \ncivilians gives pause to people everywhere.\n  I stand here today as a veteran and as a father whose son has been \ndeployed multiple times. I wish to recognize my son today, who is with \nme today. I ask that my son Michael stand and be recognized.\n  We fought in the war that Washington began based on false \ninformation--a war that ended and from which we must move on.\n  I led an infantry battalion--the 1st Battalion, 163rd Infantry--into \ncombat, which was made up of more than 100 of Montana's finest. Our \narea of operation was from just north of Tikrit--from Baiji--to Kirkuk, \nwhich is the very same area being fought over today.\n  It was late 2004 and the country had fallen into a bitter sectarian \nconflict--a conflict that unfolded after the dismantling of the \nBaathist-led army and fueled by ancient divides between the Shias and \nSunnis. Those same disputes are again boiling over in Iraq today.\n  From the end of 2004 to late 2005, my unit fought to hold ground, \nsecure roads, and build infrastructure. We worked with local sheiks and \nkey leaders to forge a path to peace. We helped return Iraq's \ngovernment to its people. While there we oversaw two successful \nelections and watched with hope and\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\ngreat satisfaction as the Iraqis ratified their constitution. It was \nduring this time that I also dispatched a team from the battalion to \nfocus solely on training and assisting members of the newly formed \nIraqi army.\n  During our unit's entire deployment in Iraq while fighting the \ninsurgency, we faced rocket attacks, snipers, and improvised explosive \ndevices on a daily basis. Four of my men were killed in action, and \nthere is not a day that goes by that I don't think of those men and \ntheir families: MSG Robbie D. McNary of Lewistown, MT, died on March \n31, 2005; SSG Kevin Davis of Lebanon, OR, died on April 8, 2005; SGT \nTimothy Kiser of Tehama, CA, died on April 28, 2005; and SGT Travis \nArndt, died on September 21, 2005. Travis was from Bozeman, MT. Scores \nof other soldiers were injured.\n  One of my soldiers died by suicide after returning home to Montana. \nHe was a victim of the invisible wounds of war.\n  Nearly 4,500 Americans have been killed in Iraq, among them 28 \nMontana heroes. Some 32,000 Americans have been wounded. The war cost \nus more than $2 trillion--I say more than $2 trillion--most of which \nCongress put on a credit card so our grandchildren can pay the debt.\n  Because this Nation has failed to prepare for new veterans returning \nhome, we now have a crisis of care within our VA health care system--a \nsystem that is overwhelmed after more than a decade of war.\n  Today we are seeing 22 veterans die by suicide each and every single \nday across this country. These are the true costs of war. Montanans \nunderstand this, and Americans understand this.\n  Because I work for Montanans, and I am listening to them, I call on \nPresident Obama to use extreme caution when considering options to deal \nwith the sectarian violence that we are seeing take place in Iraq \ntoday. America cannot afford another Iraq financially or the human \ncosts that are associated with war. We did our job there, and we did it \nwith honor and integrity. Our men and women should be very proud of \ntheir success, and the citizens of this country should be proud of the \naccomplishments of the men and women who served in our armed forces.\n  Today some are suggesting we make an open-ended commitment to Iraq \nand keep American troops on the ground indefinitely. Sending thousands \nof America's young men and women back into Iraq to step into the middle \nof a civil war is not a solution.\n  To my fellow Members of Congress, I urge temperance as we navigate \nthis difficult terrain because I know that foreign policy failures made \nin Washington fall disproportionately on the backs of young men and \nwomen from the small towns across Montana and the country.\n  I have seen war up close and, like too many American families, I have \nseen the cost of war up close on families and on communities all across \nthis country.\n  I believe it is now time for the Iraqis to secure and defend their \nown nation. The embrace of their own self-determination is the only \npath to a true and everlasting peace in Iraq.\n  I wish to remind the American people of the costs that have been \nassociated with the war in Iraq. We are dealing with a crisis within \nthe VA health care system. At one time over a year ago, we had over \n450,000 men and women on a backlog list trying to get in to see a \nhealth care provider.\n  Today that backlog has been significantly reduced, but we still have \na problem within the VA health care system. We put over 2 million \nAmerican veterans into that health care system without making sure that \nthe system was ready for them when they came home. Can you imagine \nsending over 2 million American servicemembers into Iraq or \nAfghanistan--or anywhere else in the world--whom we didn't train, \nequip, or provide the resources for them to go into Iraq?\n  When people talk to me about the cost of war, I think this is a cost \nthat we sometimes overlook because when our men and women return from \nIraq, the war is not over. We will be dealing with this cost for many \nyears.\n  As we talk about the men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan and \ncontemplating our extension of deployment in Afghanistan, a figure has \nbeen thrown around as to the costs. Today it costs approximately $1.2 \nmillion for a soldier in Afghanistan. When we reduce the number of \nsoldiers in Afghanistan from 32,000 to less than 10,000, that cost goes \nup to $2.3 million. Again, we are planning to put that cost on the \ncredit card.\n  We have a responsibility, and that responsibility lies on the \ncitizens of this Nation and on the citizens of Montana. We must \ncontinue to look out for these people.\n  I don't want to be an isolationist. I understand there are problems \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, but we have to take care of our problems here \nin Washington, DC.\n  As I travel back to Montana and talk to Montanans, they are concerned \nabout our debt. They know we have a spending problem, and we have to \ntake care of that spending problem. But sending our soldiers to Iraq or \nextending their stay in Afghanistan is not going to solve the problems \nwe are dealing with there.\n  Again, America cannot afford another Iraq financially or the human \ncosts that are associated with Iraq. We owe it to the citizens of this \nNation.\n  The Members of the Senate need to ask themselves: If it were my son \nor daughter who was going to be sent into Iraq to fight in a sectarian \nconflict, would I be as willing to do that as I am today without having \nsomeone I care for sent over there?\n  We hear about suggestions on a daily basis about what we should be \ndoing in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I know we are dealing with a \ndifficult situation there, but we have to make the right decision. We \nhave to look out for the United States of America and what is happening \nhere in America.\n  I think that too many of my fellow Members of Congress are too abrupt \nand think too quickly about what we should do in Iraq. I believe they \nneed to take a step back and think about the impacts--the second and \nthird order of effects of continuing to send our men and women back \nover to Iraq.\n  As I said, I know that foreign policy failures made in Washington \nwill fall disproportionately on the backs of smalltown America--towns \nlike Culbertson, MT, Livingston, MT, and Boulder, MT. It is not the \nlarge cities that will bear the burden of sending men and women back \ninto Iraq.\n  I have also mentioned I have seen war up close. I still recall the \nramp ceremonies we held shortly after the deaths of the men and women \nin Iraq. We had to have those men and women out of there within a 12-\nhour period. Those were very difficult times to deal with not only for \nme but for the other 700-plus men and women who were deployed with me \nto Iraq.\n  Again, I cannot overemphasize how important I think it is that we \nreally step back, take a look at what is happening in Iraq and \ndetermine if this is really the best thing for the United States of \nAmerica. Is it the best thing for our military to have to deal with?\n  We have been at war for over 13 years in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our \nmilitary will do whatever we ask of it, but we also have to think about \nthe families of our service men and women, the impacts that the wars of \nIraq and Afghanistan have had on them with the number of divorces, \nbroken marriages, and broken families. Those are also the costs of war \nwe are having to deal with.\n  There are no easy answers to what is happening in Iraq, and I know we \nwill come together and come up with a solution, and I hope it is the \nright solution because these are very important times. Who knows what \nwill happen next? Will it happen in the Middle East? Will it happen in \nEurope? I don't think that anyone knows, and we have to be prepared.\n  Again, I have said it once and I wish to emphasize this point again: \nI believe it is time for the Iraqis to secure and defend their own \nnation. We heard they have over 17 divisions. Think about the size of \nthose divisions. A division of the United States is nearly 20,000 \nsoldiers, and I am sure that an Iraqi division is somewhere in that \nsame capacity. They have 17 divisions--4 of which we hear have dropped \ntheir weapons and fallen back, but that still leaves 13 divisions they \nwould have to fight, and so they can make a stance to protect their \ncountry.\n  I am calling on the Members of this Senate to ask the Iraqi people to \nstand up and fight for their country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make an \nobjection, if necessary, to an effort to submarine the President's \nclimate change initiative, which two-thirds of all Americans support \nand which a huge number of major name-brand American corporations \nsupported and which is supported by those whom we trust to lead our \nnational defense and our national security interests. But something \nabout this building, something about this place makes it a place where \nthe polluting interests have wildly disproportionate sway, so we keep \nseeing these attacks on environmental regulations. So it is actually \nkind of fortunate timing that I am here because it gives me a chance, \nfor the 71st time, to try to wake this body up to the harm carbon \npollution is causing to our oceans, to our economy, to our wildlife, \nand to our health.\n  I traveled recently to New Hampshire. I have been traveling around \nthe country, going to States that are facing the carbon predicament and \nseeing how they are doing it.\n  I can tell my colleagues that Granite Staters are facing up to the \ndaunting challenges of climate change. Rhode Islanders understand that \nNew Hampshire's challenges are like our own. We see similar threats in \nour own State. At the Newport, RI, tide gauge, right at our naval \nstation, sea level is up almost 10 inches since the 1930s. In the \nwinter, we are three to four degrees warmer in Narragansett Bay. The \nrecent ``National Climate Assessment'' report concludes that Rhode \nIsland will see even more rising sea level, warmer temperatures, and \nextreme weather.\n  New Hampshire showed that there is plenty of Yankee good sense up \nthere as well. The people of New Hampshire get it, and they are taking \nsteps to tackle climate change. Let me first say that no one pretended \nit isn't real. The first line of defense on the other side of the aisle \nis that climate change isn't real. No one I spoke to in New Hampshire \nis pretending it isn't real.\n  University of New Hampshire expert Cameron Wake told me that New \nHampshire is ``getting wetter and getting warmer,'' and they pointed \nout that it is happening fast. The ``National Climate Assessment'' \nshows that due to climate change, the Northeast already has seen 70 \npercent more extreme precipitation in recent years--dramatic downpours \nthat increase the risk of flooding. This University of New Hampshire \ndata shows an even more severe problem for New Hampshire. Dr. Wake told \nme that he and his University of New Hampshire colleagues have \ncollected data from southern New Hampshire on what they call ``extreme \nprecipitation events''--what we might call a rain burst, where over 4 \ninches of rain falls in just 48 hours. The data show these rain bursts \nhave increased 4 to 10 times since 1960, and they will only grow more \nfrequent through the rest of the century, Wake and his University of \nNew Hampshire colleagues report.\n  That brings us to the warmer part of the wetter-and-warmer equation. \nThe University of New Hampshire's recent studies show the State's \ntemperature has increased by twice the global average, happening in \nlarge part due to what Dr. Wake calls ``snow dynamics'': Warmer \ntemperatures during New Hampshire's winter mean less snow. Less snow \nexposes more dark ground underneath. The dark ground absorbs more heat, \nand it warms faster than if it were covered in reflective snow--what \nscientists call high albedo snow. So the ground then warms the air--and \non goes the cycle.\n  At Plymouth State University, the Appalachian Mountain Club has data \nwhich show temperature increases in Pinkham Notch in New Hampshire's \nWhite Mountains. The average increase in temperature has climbed over \n75 years. Then, if we look at the average over 50 years, we see that \nthe line has steepened and it is accelerating, and if we look at the \nline for the last 25 years, it has steepened again and the increase is \naccelerating further. So New Hampshire's temperatures aren't just \nrising, they are rising faster.\n  What do these temperatures mean for Granite Staters? Well, big \nchanges to their winter industries, such as skiing. Six years ago Ben \nWilcox, who is the general manager of the ski resort Mount Cranmore in \nNorth Conway, NH, was using 40 to 50 snow guns to cover his ski \nmountain. Now he is using 150. In the last 5 years, Wilcox reports, ski \nmountains in his region have invested in over 1,700 new top-of-the-line \nsnow guns, capable of making three to four times the amount of snow of \nprevious models, so they can offset the snowpack loss from the shorter \nwinters. That makes them lucky. But when people down the mountain don't \nsee snow, they don't think about skiing, so they don't go.\n  Stefan Hausmann is the owner of Zimmermann's Ski and Snowboard Shop \nin Nashua, NH. He told me his business sees this in fewer new skiers \nand snowboarders buying their equipment at his store. He is still \nselling the higher end skis to established skiers at a pretty good \nclip, but he is selling less equipment to beginners. Those lower end \ncustomers just aren't coming in the door, says Hausmann.\n  Of course, New Hampshire's winter tourism industry goes far beyond \nskiing. The New Hampshire Department of Travel and Economic Development \nsays 34 million visitors travel to the Granite State and spend roughly \n$4.6 billion. This makes tourism the State's second largest industry, \nand climate change hits a lot of it.\n  For instance, snowmobilers and Nordic skiers come to New Hampshire's \nbackcountry for more than 7,000 miles of trails. If you are a ski \nmountain, you can crank snow out onto your busy ski slopes. It is not \nso easy when you are talking about snowmobile trails or Nordic skiing \ntrails. So the ski business of trail skiing and the snowmobile business \nis taking a hit.\n  The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, based in North Woodstock, NH, \nhas found that snow cover has decreased by 22 days since I was born in \n1955, and the frozen lakes included in those trail systems that \nsnowmobilers and Nordic skiers use are covered in ice less of the \nyear--33 less days on Mirror Lake just since 1967, for example. As one \nGranite Stater told me, this hit not just the trails but the hotels, \nrestaurants, snowmobile shops, and outdoor outfitters who depend on \nthat market.\n  Of course, it is not just sports. Jamey French of Portsmouth, the CEO \nand president of Northland Forest Products, told me how climate change \nis affecting two of New Hampshire's most valuable hardwoods--the sugar \nmaple and the yellow birch.\n  Sugar maples, of course, support New Hampshire's maple sugar \nindustry, but they also draw leaf peepers who travel to view the \nspectacular foliage that blankets the New Hampshire landscape in the \nautumn. As New Hampshire and neighboring States get warmer, the trees' \ngeographic range moves north. Scientists predict that future warming \nwill exacerbate this trend, meaning more production of maple syrup in \nCanada and less in the United States--bad news for New Hampshire's \nmaple sugar houses.\n  As for the yellow Birch, Mr. French points out that in the 1940s and \n1950s, most of the furniture in New England was made out of yellow \nbirch, and yellow birch remains a valuable hardwood, drawing good \nprices for New Hampshire's timber business.\n  French fears the consequences for his industry if yellow birch and \nsugar maples are pushed northwards and out by warmer-weather trees. \n``Will there be a wood product industry?'' he asks. ``Will there be a \nmaple sugar industry in a climate-changed New England? There is going \nto be a lot less of one,'' he concludes.\n  New Hampshire biologist Eric Orrf is witnessing one of the most \ndramatic changes. He studies the moose--an animal that is bred to \nsurvive harsh northern winters. But what Orrf sees is a catastrophic \ndecline in moose population mostly due to the success of moose ticks. \nThis is going to get a little bit gross, so forgive me. Moose ticks \nbreed more easily and they survive longer in milder winters. Orrf \nexplains--these are his words:\n\n       What happens when we have an early spring, when winter \n     ticks fall off on bare\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\n     ground, is they thrive. They lay their eggs. They are \n     successful at reproducing. Then, in the fall, in November, \n     when the baby moose ticks are hanging together, if there is \n     no snow, then by the thousands, tens of thousands, they get \n     on the calves. Now for these calves, they'd literally have to \n     resupply their blood supply two times over to survive the \n     winter. They suck them dry.\n\n  I think one tick is pretty revolting. The idea of tens of thousands \nof ticks on a moose calf, sucking the blood out of the calf so fast \nthat it can't keep up, is a truly grisly thought. They literally ``suck \nthem dry,'' according to Orrf.\n  Jim O'Brien of the New Hampshire Audubon Society told me how climate \nchange is affecting the State's bird. New Hampshire's State bird is the \npurple finch. It is the official bird of New Hampshire. It is a cold-\nweather bird with a range up to Canada. He said this:\n\n       The purple finch is at the southern end of its range, and, \n     in all likelihood, our state bird isn't going to be found in \n     the State of New Hampshire anymore.\n\n  So while we dawdle and delay in Congress thanks to the influence of \nbig polluters, there is work to be done out there. Thankfully, States \nacross the country, knowing the risks of doing nothing and knowing the \ncosts of doing nothing, are starting to act.\n  I have been to the Southeast coast. I have been to the Midwest. I \nhave seen wind parks in Iowa with 500 wind turbines generating more \nthan a quarter of the State's electricity. I went South. I saw \nRepublican mayors and county officials in the Southeast putting climate \nand energy policy at the center of their government's plans.\n  I saw it again in New Hampshire, Granite Staters who understand the \nrisks all too well. The University of New Hampshire recently released \ntwo--not one but two--comprehensive reports about climate change, one \nfor northern New Hampshire and one for southern New Hampshire. I have \nthem with me. New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan has played a pivotal \nrole in making sure this work gets done and in developing and operating \nNew England's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which we call \n``Reggi,'' which is already at work reducing our region's carbon \npollution and providing a model for how other States can succeed under \nthe powerplant regulations.\n  We are already seeing our States--our laboratories of democracy--\ntaking sensible steps down the path to reducing carbon emissions. The \nEPA rule for carbon pollution from powerplants will encourage that \nState role. Just this morning the Wall Street Journal and NBC News \nreleased polling saying two-thirds of Americans support President \nObama's new climate rule, and more than half say the United States \nshould go for it and deal with global warming even if it means higher \nelectricity bills for them. People in America get it. It is only this \nbuilding that is isolated by polluter influence.\n  It is time for Congress to wake up, and we will if the American \npeople will give us a good shake. It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Brianna Vance\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a remarkably brave, \nvery young West Virginian, 10-year-old Brianna Vance, who helped save \nher father's life just last week--truly amazing. It was on Twitter, all \nover the pages.\n  On June 10, as a severe storm--and with all of the severe storms we \nhave been having all over the country--tore through her neighborhood in \nHenlawson, WV, Brianna's father Gregory and two of his friends were \nsitting on the porch when lightning struck a nearby very large tree \nthat crashed down on top of them and their home.\n  Brianna tried to use her phone to call for help, but the storm had \nknocked out all of the cell services. She had nothing. She could not do \na thing. Remarkably, she was still able to access the Internet and \nquickly logged onto Facebook--just by a miracle.\n  In an extraordinary demonstration of courage and resourcefulness, \nBrianna posted a video, and I have seen this video. If you haven't, \nplease go to Brianna's Facebook page, ``Brianna Vance,'' and look at \nit. She asked anyone who had cell phone service or access to a phone to \nplease call 911 and send an ambulance to her yellow house to save her \ndaddy.\n  She thought, had enough presence about her during this very trying \nand emotional time. When people see the video, I think it will explain \nand speak for itself.\n  Thankfully, someone saw her post and a rescue team was able to save \nthe three victims, including her father, because of that Facebook post.\n  When all other options failed, Brianna did not give up. She still had \nthe presence of thought and her desire to help her father and his \nfriends.\n  Because of her sharp wit and resourcefulness, her father is alive and \nrecovering today--just in time to celebrate Father's Day together, as \nwe just finished up this past weekend.\n  I am so proud of Brianna, and I know her family and community are as \nwell, as can be expected when we have situations not just in West \nVirginia but in the Presiding Officer's own State of Ohio and all over \nthis great country, where we have family bonds such as this and we have \nfamily stories that have good outcomes that we do not hear enough of.\n  I thank Brianna for her heroism that helped save the lives of her \nfather and his friends. She should be recognized for her bravery.\n  So I say, Brianna, on behalf of the grateful State of West Virginia, \nthank you for what you have done for your father and his friends and \nshowing the courage you have as a young West Virginian.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon because \nthis week the Senate has a chance to take another crucial step away \nfrom the political cliffs and manufactured crises of previous years and \nto get back to the regular order--to get back to the considered, \nmeasured, orderly process on this floor that for so long was \ncharacteristic of this body, in the past considered the greatest \ndeliberative body on Earth, but in recent years it has ground to a \nhalt.\n  It is critical that we return to regular order and that we return to \nthe steady consideration of appropriations bills in a way that will \nmove not just the Senate and this Congress but this country forward.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenators Mikulski and Shelby, for their leadership and their steadfast \ndetermination to work in a bipartisan manner and bring us back to \nregular order.\n  We are considering today a collection--or what is called today a \n``minibus'' instead of an omnibus--of three appropriations bills: \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration; \nCommerce, Justice, and Science; and Transportation and Housing and \nUrban Development--an unbelievable scope across these three \nappropriations bills that could in combination make a real and \nsignificant difference for our communities, our States, and our \ncountry. This is an opportunity for this Congress to carry out its \nduties to provide oversight and direction and to help all the different \nagencies I just named move forward and address some of our most \nimportant priorities.\n  As a member myself of the Appropriations Committee, I have advocated \nfor some of what are our Nation's top priorities embedded in these \nthree important bills. So I wish to speak for a few minutes about how \nthese bills will, first, help my home State of Delaware; second, help \nour country; and then, third, the important obligation we have as \nSenators to return to regular order and to use the appropriations \nprocess for oversight and for management of this whole Federal project.\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n  For Delaware, these three bills invest in a number of areas. I could \ntalk about literally dozens of matters critical to my home State, but \nlet me focus on two--public safety and infrastructure.\n  When we think about it at the local level--where I served for a \ndecade in county government--these are the foundation of what \ngovernment does and does well: Keep our people, homes, communities, and \nfamilies safe, and provide for the sewer water, drinking water, and the \nhighways and tollways and bridges and ports that are critical to moving \ncommerce and our country forward.\n  This bill extends children's advocacy centers. Let me talk for a few \nminutes about what children's advocacy centers are and why it is so \nvital to public safety.\n  Children's advocacy centers allow communities to bring child abusers \nto justice without retraumatizing their victims. Children's advocacy \ncenters are unique because it is a model that brings together, under \none roof in one place, law enforcement, prosecutors, counselors, and \nchild service professionals--all focusing on how to best care for and \nmove forward with a child who has been a victim of abuse.\n  In Delaware we have three centers--one in each of our three counties. \nAnd although I wish we didn't need them, the fact is they are \nindispensable. In my experience in a decade of local government, I was \nexposed over and over to the critical role they play in helping law \nenforcement secure critical evidence and move forward to conviction \nagainst the monsters who commit abuse against our children.\n  Since the creation of these centers, they have transformed our \nNation's response to child abuse, giving families hope and guidance in \ntheir darkest moments and delivering justice to those who have endured \nthe worst.\n  As we work together to continue to try our best to keep our children \nsafe, this bill allows us to continue to fund child advocacy centers so \nwe can have a more efficient, more effective, more federally sponsored \nand coordinated way to deliver at a very modest cost this vital \nresource for our children.\n  Second, as we work to keep our children safe, this bill also allows \nus to protect those who protect us. Every day more than 1 million law \nenforcement officers across this country accept risks to their personal \nsafety. As they leave their families at dawn and head off to their \njobs, they know that what they accept as part of their mission is the \nrisk they may not come home that night. That is why it is so important \nthis bill also funds the bulletproof vest partnership.\n  In Delaware we know its value all too well. Last February at the New \nCastle County Courthouse in my hometown of Wilmington, DE, a gunman \nunleashed a hail of bullets into a courthouse lobby, tragically killing \ntwo. On what was a difficult morning in Wilmington, two lives were also \nsaved--those of Sergeant Michael Manley and Corporal Steve Rinehart--\nmembers of the Delaware Capitol Police--officers who were wearing \nbulletproof vests funded by the Federal Bulletproof Vest Partnership. \nThis is a partnership launched by my predecessor, now-Vice President \nBiden. It has been sustained on a bipartisan basis for many years, but \nwithout this appropriation, this vital Federal-State-law enforcement \npartnership would grind to a halt.\n  Vests work. They save lives. They save officers' lives, and with this \nbill we will be able to ensure even more officers all across this \ncountry have lifesaving bulletproof vests.\n  Those are two areas where in law enforcement and public safety this \nbill continues critical investments in partnership from the Federal \nGovernment to State and local governments.\n  In recent weeks in Delaware we have also been reminded of just how \ncritical our infrastructure is--our bridges, our roads, and highways.\n  There is a bridge on I-495 that goes across the Christina River. This \nis a vital highway for Wilmington and for the whole mid-Atlantic \nregion. It carries 90,000 drivers a day, but 2 weeks ago it was closed \nindefinitely when workers nearby noticed four of its pillars were off \nplumb, were slanted, and then upon further investigation discovered \nthere were cracks in the very foundation holding this bridge 50 feet in \nthe air. Its closure is hurting families, businesses, and commuters, \nand it is just one in a string of recent emergencies all across our \ncountry that demonstrate the need for investment in fixing America's \nroads and bridges.\n  The funding we are considering this week in this bill recognizes that \nand takes steps to address some of our most urgent needs across this \ncountry. It continues to invest in two innovative funding vehicles: One \ncalled TIGER grants and another called TIFIA loans. These are acronyms, \nbut they are inventive ways to mobilize private capital in partnership \nwith States and the Federal Government, to get us moving again in \nrepairing and upgrading the roads and bridges of America. They help \nState and local governments pay for new highways and bridges, public \ntransit projects, railways, and ports.\n  In Delaware, the Port of Wilmington--a critical economic engine for \nour State and region--secured a $10 million TIGER grant last year to \nrenovate facilities built in 1922. On U.S. 301, a little south and west \nof Wilmington but still in Delaware, TIFIA grants are helping us to do \ncritical work to relieve congestion.\n  In southernmost Delaware at Georgetown, at the Sussex County Airport, \nwe have also seen the vital role and the value of Federal investment. \nSince 2012, the Sussex County Airport has received $4 million in \nairport improvement grants to expand its runway and improve safety and \nto help grow manufacturing jobs at that Georgetown Airport. With this \nweek's bill, we will be able to continue making these kinds of critical \nimprovements at airports in Delaware and across our country.\n  I relatively rarely get to fly, but I commute virtually every day \nback and forth from Wilmington, DE, to Washington, and I ride on Amtrak \nwhen I do so. Today, ridership levels are at a record high, and \nDelaware's region in the Northeast corridor brings in $300 million in \nprofits alone. So it is good this bill maintains Amtrak's national \noperations and investments in its capital needs, but I believe we need \nto do more. We need to step up and do more federally to invest if we \nwant to keep these results, not just in the Northeast but across the \ncountry.\n  We have a more than $6 billion backlog to reach a state of good \nrepair for Amtrak. As our bridges, tunnels, and rail lines get older \nand older, fixing them will only become more expensive. That is why I \nintend to offer an amendment to this bill to further increase our \ninvestment in the capital needs of Amtrak. This is critical. It is \nsomething we need, and we need to start chipping away at this long \noverdue debt we have, this unaddressed infrastructure debt, if we are \ngoing to continue to serve our communities.\n  There are many other great provisions in these incredibly broad bills \nthat are of national and international importance. Let me just briefly \nreference a few.\n  At home manufacturing continues to be critical to our economy and our \nfuture, and biomanufacturing plays an increasingly important role; the \nmanufacturing of products and materials from renewable sources, from \nplant-based sources rather than petrochemicals. For the first time, \nthrough this bill, we will dedicate $15 million to the National Science \nFoundation's budget for new biomanufacturing initiatives that will \nallow us to deploy in the marketplace new inventions and innovations.\n  Our competitors aren't holding back on doing so. Countries from the \nUnited Kingdom to China are ramping up their investments in new \nbiomanufacturing. In my view it is time for the United States to \nrefocus our research, to reprioritize our investments, and to stay \ncompetitive in this vital field.\n  Finally, I am proud these appropriations bills also support in the \nhousing area funding for Community Development Block Grant--CDBG--\nPrograms. We used them when I was in county government in Delaware to \nhelp rehabilitate homes, to help provide for affordable homes, and to \nhelp strengthen and sustain jobs in our communities.\n  In 2013, so-called CDBG, or Community Development Block Grants, \nhelped 225 families. Some in this body have tried to cut CDBG, but I am \nthrilled we have been able to successfully move forward and sustain its \nsupport in this bill.\n  While we invest at home, these appropriations bills also make \nimportant\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\ninvestments abroad. One I would like to briefly highlight is in our \ninternational food aid program, where we feed millions but can do more. \nThis bill provides for flexibility of our food aid that will allow it \nto be delivered more efficiently, more quickly, and to feed more who \nhunger around the world.\n  As businesses also look abroad from the United States, we are doing \nmore to open new markets for them. One of the investments I most value \nthat is in this bill in this regard is the expansion of the Foreign \nCommercial Service at the Department of Commerce--in particular, its \nexpansion in Africa, where 7 out of 10 of the fastest growing economies \nin the world are currently growing but where the United States isn't \ndoing enough to take advantage of these burgeoning export markets for \nour products.\n  As chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee, I have had a chance to \nsee up close the great opportunities for growth and partnership that \nAfrica offers. There will be four new Foreign Commercial Service \noffices in Angola, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Mozambique, as well as \nexpansion in Kenya, Ghana, Morocco, and Libya. Now we can make \ninvestments in them jointly so our growing partnerships in the Sub-\nSaharan countries I listed can thrive.\n  As I close, I also make one brief point about why this whole process \nis important--why we need to pass these appropriations bills rather \nthan just continuing resolutions, which go on from year after year, \nthat sustain funding but do not engage the minds and skills of the \nMembers of this body in doing oversight of the Federal Government.\n  As the Federal Government changes, as our Nation's needs change, we \nneed to be able to ensure that our spending and our focus adapts as \nwell. A great example from this particular minibus bill that is on the \nfloor today is the Crude By Rail Safety Initiative. Within the last \nyear there have been a number of accidents on our rail networks that \ndemand our action. America is moving more and more oil and hazardous \nproducts by rail every year, so we are putting in place an approach to \ndo it safely.\n\n  The Department of Transportation and Transportation Secretary Foxx \nhave done a great job responding with the resources and tools they \nhave, but Congress needs to do more. That is why this bill adds 20 new \nrail and hazardous materials inspectors, adds $3 million to ensure that \noil routes are safe and sound, creates a new short-line safety \ninstitute, improves classifications, and extends training for first \nresponders.\n  Without this appropriations bill and regular order, new and timely \ninvestments such as these that are responsive to conditions of the \nworld wouldn't happen. Thus, if I might say in closing, while our \neconomy changes, we need to change, and we need regular order and \nregular appropriations bills to be able to do that.\n  I again thank the chair and vice chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senators Mikulski and Shelby, for their leadership and their \nefforts to shepherd a bipartisan process forward. It is critical to our \ncountry, our economy, and our future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto deliver my remarks in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator Brown be permitted to speak immediately following \nmy remarks for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                          Guantanamo Releases\n\n  I rise today out of serious concern about the release of the five \nsenior Taliban commanders detained at Guantanamo and the way in which \nthe Obama administration has accomplished it.\n  These individuals that the Taliban successfully demanded the release \nof in exchange for SGT Bowe Bergdahl were some of the most dangerous \nterrorists in our custody. Some had close operational ties to Al Qaeda. \nOthers perpetrated horrifying war crimes. All were senior leaders in \nthe Taliban--a group with whom we remain at war.\n  These former detainees, the Taliban five, are only subject to a 1-\nyear international travel ban. It seems shockingly unrealistic to \nexpect that they will not seek to undo everything our brave men and \nwomen in uniform have fought and died for in Afghanistan.\n  However foolish, the prospect that we might release the most \ndangerous Guantanamo detainees has been a matter of national debate for \nsome time. President Obama and his subordinates have long espoused a \nsingular devotion to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo. Many \nof us in Congress have remained decidedly less sanguine about this \nlongtime leftwing fantasy. We are wary of the dangers, \ninappropriateness, and oftentimes the impossibility of prosecuting \nbattle-hardened terrorists in civilian court as if they were common \ncriminals. We are frustrated by the procedural roadblocks to pursuing \njustice through military commissions. Above all else we are alarmed by \nthe more than one in four released detainees who have apparently \nrejoined the fight. And unlike the administration, we have long been \ndisabused of the notion that our enemies and perennial critics would \nsomehow fall in love with America if we simply close Guantanamo.\n  With these concerns in mind, we exercised our rightful legislative \nauthority under the Constitution to prevent the transfer of any further \ndetainees out of Guantanamo. Nevertheless, the Obama administration \nbitterly opposed any release restrictions. Facing incessant and intense \npressure from the administration to repeal our ban, Congress acted on a \nbipartisan basis to reach a compromise--a compromise that was \nextraordinarily generous to the administration's position.\n  Under the new law in effect--section 1035 of last year's National \nDefense Authorization Act--Congress must be notified 30 days before any \ndetainee transfer. The notification must contain a detailed statement \nof the basis of transfer, an explanation of why the transfer is in the \nnational security interests of the United States, and a description of \nthe actions taken to mitigate the risks of detainees returning to the \nfight. Our subsequent funding legislation also banned the Obama \nadministration from using any of the appropriated money to transfer \ndetainees except in accordance with these agreed-upon procedures.\n  Despite this good-faith effort on the part of Congress to find common \nground with the President, he chose to simply disregard his statutory \nobligations to inform Congress of this highly controversial release of \nthe Taliban five. While we should celebrate the return of any American \nfrom Taliban captivity, the President's actions carry very troubling \nconsequences.\n  When a lawmaker animatedly denounces the President's violation of a \ntechnical provision so wonky and seemingly unimportant as a statutory \nnotification requirement, many Americans might understandably dismiss \nsuch a concern as a petty turf war--if their eyes don't glaze over \nfirst. Although perhaps intuitive, such an impression couldn't be more \nwrong.\n  First, notification requirements such as this one have proven \ncritically beneficial to national security decisionmaking, particularly \nin the national security context. The most prominent example is our \noversight of the intelligence community. For more than 30 years, prior \ncongressional consultation has been a key foundation of ensuring \neffective policymaking on intelligence-gathering activities and covert \noperations.\n  On these incredibly sensitive and weighty issues, the executive \nbranch is required to brief certain members of the legislative branch \non all such proposed activities before they happen. The discussion of \nsuch highly classified information necessitates a strict observance of \nsecrecy, which Congress has a long tradition of respecting. Discussions \nbehind these closed doors provide the benefits of deliberation outside \nof the fishbowl of the ordinary policy process. In this setting concern \nabout national security and the wisdom of the contemplated action \ndominate. Politics takes a back seat. The administration can modify or \ncancel proposed actions without the costs that attach to public policy \npronouncements. And by assuaging our concerns before execution, the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\ngets the congressional buy-in that is so necessary when these sorts of \ndifficult decisions are taken.\n  Although the system certainly has its critics on all sides, I remain \na passionate believer in its overall effectiveness. I should know: I \nserved on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence longer than any \nother Republican ever has. For years I was intimately involved in this \nprocess and witnessed up close just how well it works to produce good \npolicy. In the context of national security--an area in which our \nNation regularly faces so many critical and difficult decisions--we \nneed a well-functioning congressional oversight process to ensure our \nsafety and security, now more than ever.\n\n  But even beyond improving an administration's national security \ndecisionmaking, we should genuinely concern ourselves as a nation that \nformal restraints on power be observed by the coordinate branches of \nour government. Whether the administration agrees with the restrictions \non its power to release Guantanamo detainees, those restrictions remain \nenshrined in a duly-enacted Federal statute, and the President remains \nobligated to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  To ignore the law and the President's constitutional obligation to \nsee that the law is enforced may seem enticing in an instance of \napparent pressing need, but our Constitution provides no such \nauthority.\n  Consider the wisdom of Justice Jackson in his seminal concurrence in \nthe Steel Seizure case:\n\n       The appeal . . . that we declare the existence of inherent \n     powers [out of necessity] to meet an emergency asks us to do \n     what many think would be wise, although it is something the \n     forefathers omitted. They knew what emergencies were. . . . \n     [T]hey made no express provision for exercise of \n     extraordinary authority because of a crisis. I do not think \n     we rightfully may so amend their work, and, if we could, I am \n     not convinced it would be wise to do so. . . .\n\n  Indeed, the central organizing principle of the Federal Government is \nthe division of powers and authorities between the different branches. \nAs a 21st-century American, it is far too easy to treat the separation \nof powers as a cliche confined to the civics classroom rather than a \nmeaningful cornerstone of our liberty. But we should recall Madison's \nwarning in Federalist 47 that ``[t]he accumulation of all powers, \nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of \none, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or \nelective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  To disregard these central precepts of constitutional government is \nto vitiate the barriers protecting us from arbitrary government action \nand to undermine the rule of law.\n  We in the Congress should make no apology for zealously guarding the \nlegal prerogatives of the body in which we serve, for, as Madison also \nwarned in Federalist 51, ``[T]he great security against a gradual \nconcentration of the several powers in the same department consists in \ngiving to those who administer each department the necessary \nconstitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of \nthe others.''\n  Nevertheless, out of respect for a coordinate branch of government, \nthe Obama administration's arguments excusing its action in releasing \nthese five dangerous Taliban detainees merits thoughtful consideration \nand analysis. I have never been shy about defending the powers of the \nPresident when exercised lawfully, no matter how unpopular. \nNevertheless, such an examination of the Obama administration's \nexplanations reveals not only the ridiculousness of its arguments but \nalso demonstrates deeply concerning attitudes and priorities that \nguided the administration's action.\n  The Obama administration has advanced multiple distinct arguments \nabout the legality of its move to release these senior Taliban leaders. \nAdvancing multiple, sometimes contradictory arguments does not exactly \ninstill confidence in the administration's commitment to its legal \nobligations. Some have been patently absurd, such as the suggestion \nfrom the White House Press Secretary that briefing Members of Congress \nmore than 2 years ago about the potential for the detainee exchange \nconstituted sufficient compliance with the detailed statutory \nnotification requirements for an actual decision to transfer.\n  I want to examine the two more sophisticated rationales advanced by \nthe administration because it is in the details of these arguments that \nmy gravest concerns arise.\n  First, I want to consider the National Security Council spokeswoman's \nwritten statement to the press asserting that ``Congress did not intend \nthat the Administration would be barred from taking the action it did \nin these circumstances.''\n  Trying to read Congress's mind when interpreting the law, as the \nadministration purports to do, has always struck me as absolutely \nabsurd. Article I of our Constitution creates a legislative process \nthat today includes 536 different individuals. To assume the existence \nof a single intent among so many different minds--all with different \ninterests, different purposes, different philosophies, and different \nmethods--runs counter to basic logic, not to mention the theory of \nrepresentative government at the foundation of our Constitution. This \nnotion that we should be governed by easily manipulated arguments about \nwhat Congress supposedly would have wanted long justified the hijacking \nof the law to undermine the clear meaning of the text.\n  Fighting this abuse of the law and the Constitution has animated so \nmuch of my work over the past 38 years. We have made enormous progress \nin reestablishing the bedrock principle that we are governed not by \nvague claims about intent but, rather, by the words themselves--words \nthat have a fixed and discernible meaning, with the power to bind us \nall--including the President. I will continue to fight for this \nprinciple as long as I have the honor to serve our people in this \ncountry.\n  In this light, a proper reading of the detainee transfer and release \nnotification requirements includes no such exception that the Obama \nadministration imagines exists. We should always be skeptical of \narguments assuming unwritten exceptions to laws, and here the relevant \nfactors counsel strongly against assuming such an exception into \nexistence.\n  The statute uses strong universally applicable language: ``the \nSecretary of Defense shall notify''; ``each notification shall include, \nat a minimum''; ``the Secretary of Defense may transfer . . . only if'' \nand the like.\n  The text of the provision is particularly detailed. This detail, \nespecially when read in conjunction with the numerous other incredibly \ndetailed provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act and its \nmany predecessors--many of which contained detailed exceptions--\ndemonstrates that Congress is quite capable of creating exceptions to a \nprovision like this one but instead actively chose not to include one \nhere.\n  Finally, as had been clearly established, lawmakers were aware of the \nadministration's desire to conduct exactly this sort of a transaction \nbefore the beginning of the legislative process. To assume such an \nexception, when the Congress was aware of the administration's desire \nand proffered need for such a provision but chose not to provide one, \nwould completely undermine the notion that Congress has the power to \nchoose its preferred policies by legislation.\n  Put another way, how could Congress have been clearer that no \ndetainee transfers could be accomplished outside its established \nprocess? If Congress's bright-line rule can be wished away by the Obama \nadministration in this case, when can the Congress act to establish a \npolicy to which the administration cannot carve out exceptions--\nexceptions that destroy the very core of the law?\n  In advancing this rather ridiculous attempt to misconstrue the \ntransfer and release notification requirements, the Obama \nadministration is simply avoiding making their more controversial \nargument explicit. The administration's Pentagon General Counsel \nadmitted as much last week.\n  This argument centers on the President's contention that ``in certain \ncircumstances'' the transfer and release notification requirements \n``would violate constitutional separation of powers principles.''\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\n  Other senior administration officials have made statements, albeit \nhesitantly, invoking the President's authority under the Constitution \nto disregard the statute. Although the administration attempts to cloak \nit in the complex obscurity of statutory construction, this is the real \nissue at hand.\n  As a threshold matter, the rule of law and the separation of powers \nboth depend on the longstanding notion that an unconstitutional statute \nis no law at all. We should take the Obama administration's arguments \nabout the constitutionality of the notification requirement as applied \nto the Taliban five trade very seriously.\n  When appropriate, I have defended the President's authority to act in \ncontravention of certain statutes. And I absolutely stand by the \npositions I have taken before--no matter how unpopular they have \nsometimes been.\n  I feel it is incumbent upon me to lay out my case of why I am so \ndisturbed by the administration's actions here not to deflect any \ncharge of hypocrisy for personal benefit but because I feel so \npassionately about the Obama administration's overreach in this and so \nmany other cases. To risk having these arguments dismissed without \nserious consideration of their merits would be unbearable. I feel \ncompelled to lay out my case in some detail.\n  Here, the Obama administration's arguments fail on the \nadministration's own terms and in so doing demonstrate some disturbing \ntrends at work within this administration.\n  Now, the Obama administration has not advanced the notion that the \ntransfer and release notification requirements are always \nunconstitutional. Instead, the administration has been very careful to \nsuggest that the notification requirements unconstitutionally \nencumbered the executive branch because of the specific circumstances \nat issue in the Taliban five trade. The general terms of the Obama \nadministration's rationale initially seemed potentially reasonable: \nthat it feared Sergeant Bergdahl would be endangered unless the \nadministration moved swiftly and secretly to make the trade, and \ncompliance with the notification requirement would have prevented the \nPresident from exercising his lawful authority to order the detainee \nswap.\n  However, the logic of the administration's rationale falls apart \nunder closer inspection of the two key factors that were cited as \ncreating the specific circumstances in disregarding the statute: the \nneed for swiftness and the need for secrecy.\n  First, the need for swift action. The Obama administration has--at \nvarious times--suggested that Sergeant Bergdahl's health was in rapid \nand accelerating decline to the point of necessitating immediate \nrescue, and that the Taliban would refuse to agree to Bergdahl's \nrelease unless the administration executed the trade quickly. After \nexamining what evidence the administration provided us, a number of my \ncolleagues from both parties, including the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nhave expressed significant doubt about these claims.\n  But even if we accept the Obama administration's claims that there \nexisted a need for swift action, that when faced with this realization, \ncompliance with the 30-day notification requirement would have \nendangered the potential for recovering Sergeant Bergdahl, and that \nthese are the sort of circumstances where the Constitution authorizes \nthe executive branch to act in defiance of a notification requirement--\neven if we accept everything the administration suggests, their \nargument doesn't totally nullify the administration's obligations under \nthe statutory notification requirement.\n  Under the administration's own logic that the notification \nrequirement is not unconstitutional per se but, rather, only under \ncertain circumstances, the executive branch still has a duty to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. Thus, even if it is \nauthorized to order a transfer or release of detainees in less than the \n30 days mandated by the statute, the President remains obligated to \ncomply as substantially and faithfully as possible, mitigating any \nanticipated breach by keeping Congress abreast of negotiations and \ncomplying with the notification requirements as soon as any transfer \ndecision is made or undertaken.\n  But that clearly is not the case here. Instead, we know from the \nstatements of senior administration officials that the administration \ndeliberately withheld notification from Congress until after the trade \noccurred--months after negotiations to make this trade resumed and \nintensified, weeks after the detainee transfer agreement with Qatar was \nsigned, and days after the final decision itself was taken. Given that \nthe administration accepts the constitutionality of the legality of the \nnotification requirement generally, its actions represent a direct \neffort to undermine the obvious core purpose of the law: giving \nCongress the opportunity to raise its objections and lobby against an \nill-advised release or transfer before it happens.\n  This is not maximally faithful compliance. This is outright flouting \nof the statute.\n  The administration, though, has also claimed a need for secrecy--\nspecifically, that informing Congress would endanger the prospects for \nSergeant Bergdahl's safe return. I take this concern for secrecy \nextraordinarily seriously, and I know that every one of my colleagues \ndoes as well. Preserving secrecy as not to endanger ongoing operations \nremains an absolutely vital cornerstone of congressional oversight of \nnational security issues, and my long service on the intelligence \ncommittee engendered in me a particular appreciation for how necessary \nit is.\n  But administrations have for decades briefed Congress on \nextraordinarily sensitive matters. Take the Bin Laden raid. It is hard \nto think of an operation more sensitive than that. In both the Taliban \nfive swap and the Bin Laden operation, the mission objectives as well \nas the safety of our troops would have both been completely \nunattainable if details leaked. Yet, even before the Bin Laden \noperation, the administration kept Congress regularly briefed as \nrequired by law, which is, to me, testament to the extraordinary \nresiliency of our oversight structure.\n\n  Even those of us who have long defended robust executive powers in \nthe national security context have long asserted that:\n\n       The constitutional basis for withholding notification can \n     only be invoked credibly, by its own terms, in very rare \n     circumstances. A generalized fear that Congress might leak \n     would not by itself suffice, because the same fear could be \n     invoked equally from all [secret operations].\n\n  In the case at hand, the Obama administration accepts the \nconstitutionality of congressional notification requirements in most \ncircumstances. Yet it has also failed to articulate any particular \nreason why notifying Congress would impose a particular problem when \ncompared to other sensitive operations. But the implication that it did \nnot notify Congress just because of a generalized fear of leaks not \nonly disregards decades of successful congressional oversight of \nintelligence collection and covert operations but also makes an \nexceedingly radical argument that would give the President essentially \narbitrary power to ignore what he acknowledges is a valid law.\n  In this case, though, the administration's actions wholly undermine \nthe notion that there was an unusual secrecy concern at issue here. \nFirst, consider that the administration itself estimated that between \n80 and 90 executive branch officials were told of the decision to \nrelease the Taliban five ahead of time--in an administration that leaks \nsensitive national security information like a sieve, but zero--zero--\nMembers of Congress were informed.\n  The Secretary of Defense and his General Counsel even admitted that \nJustice Department lawyers were told of the upcoming trade for the very \npurpose of keeping even a few key Members of Congress in the dark. In \nlight of the statutory requirement to notify just a key handful of \nMembers of Congress, this situation appears flatly absurd and certainly \ninconsistent with maximally faithful compliance with the statute.\n  Furthermore, the administration had already discussed with Congress \nthe potential for such a deal. They ran into bipartisan opposition, as \nexpressed in the bipartisan letter of early 2012 signed by the top \nDemocrat and top Republican on both the House and Senate intelligence \ncommittees. In response to that letter, media reports indicate that the \nthen-Secretary of State\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nand former Senator from New York promised the administration would \npursue further congressional consultations before making the exchange. \nAnd in 2013 the White House Press Secretary responded to a question \nabout trading Sergeant Bergdahl for Taliban detainees in stark terms \npromising: ``We would not make any decisions about transfer of any \ndetainees without consulting Congress.''\n  So why the more than 2 years of radio silence from the Obama \nadministration? Why the disregard of the Federal statute when the \nadministration's arguments for doing so in this case are so \ndisturbingly unconvincing? Why wait until after the decision could not \nbe challenged before telling Congress?\n  After reviewing these events, the answer seems obvious. President \nObama and his subordinates illegitimately chose not to inform Congress \nuntil after the decision was irrevocable because they knew that \nCongress would object. Two administration officials told Bloomberg News \nas much: The failure to notify key Members of Congress in advance was a \ndeliberate move to skirt opposition to releasing the five Taliban \nprisoners.\n  While the vigor of the Obama administration's defense of the deal has \nshocked many, it has not shocked me. To this President, this deal \nrepresents the apex of responsible winding down of the conflict in \nAfghanistan--not only in returning Sergeant Bergdahl but also in \nreleasing the Taliban five, whom the administration has eagerly sought \nto release so often before.\n  Just take it from the majority leader who said he was ``glad to get \nrid of these five people.'' And for a President and an administration \nthat have demonstrated endless reservoirs of faith in the goodwill of \nhostile forces abroad, there is also surely hope--no matter how \nridiculous--that giving into the Taliban's demands will somehow inspire \na renewed interest on the part of the Taliban in peace talks, as if \nthat did anything but demonstrate how the Taliban's current tactics \nwill get them concessions from the Obama administration.\n  President Obama has on many occasions annunciated very clear beliefs \nof our detention operations at Guantanamo, articulating a nearly \nreligious conviction that detention of Taliban, Al Qaeda, and \nassociated forces under the law of armed conflict is a beacon of this \nnation's evils to the world. And although the administration has faced \nimmense political pressure to reconsider from many of us, I have \nabsolutely no doubt President Obama intends on following through with \nhis long-time, recently repeated promise to make every effort to close \nGuantanamo during his remaining time in office.\n  Many of my colleagues and I share a diametrically opposed view from \nthe President's--one that is more focused on securing the stability of \nthe Afghan Government that our men and women in uniform fought so hard \nto establish. But in our honest disagreements, President Obama only \nsees reflexive intransigence. On Guantanamo and on so many other \nmatters, President Obama has proven himself unable to accept good-faith \ndifferences with those of us elected to a coordinate and coequal branch \nof government. This frustration has motivated the President to enact \nhis agenda unilaterally. In doing so, he not only poisons the well of \ncongressional oversight of sensitive national security matters, as \ntroubling as that is, but also by arrogating power with casual \ndisregard for the structural restraints of the Constitution, he \nstretches our longstanding laws and norms past the breaking point.\n\n  My allegiance to constitutional government and the rule of law \ncompels me to stand up to this overreach by President Obama and the \nexecutive branch. I will continue to speak out against what I strongly \nbelieve are serious instances of overreach by this administration--as I \nhave already done on immigration, sentencing, education, Benghazi, and, \nof course, ObamaCare. I urge all of my colleagues to join me, for what \nis at stake is not just our rightful authority to get done what our \nconstituents sent us here to do but also the very precepts at the core \nof our Constitution.\n  That is why I have joined my colleague, the junior Senator from Ohio, \nto cosponsor a resolution declaring that the Obama administration \nviolated the statute and calling for an investigation into the matter. \nWith all that is at stake, registering our objection in this way could \nnot be more important.\n  Additionally, in light of these troubling events--which also involve \nthe Justice Department, which should hold the separation of powers in \nthe highest regard--I should note I found myself now unable to support \nthe nomination of Peter Kadzik to be Assistant Attorney General for \nLegislative Affairs. My deference to the administration's choice of \nappointees can only go so far, and I cannot support a nominee who has \nso persistently refused to share the Department's memos on the release \nof the Taliban five. Absent a real commitment from Mr. Kadzik and the \nJustice Department to respect Congress's role under the Constitution, I \nfelt compelled to oppose his nomination.\n  On their own terms, the Obama administration violated the law by \nreleasing the Taliban five--dangerous men who are sure to return to the \nfight. In doing so, he not only endangered the lives of our men and \nwomen in uniform but also jeopardized everything they fought and died \nfor in Afghanistan. My commitment is to them and to the Constitution's \ndivision of powers and authorities amongst the coordinate and coequal \nbranches of government which they fight to protect. These loyalties are \nwhat have compelled me to stand up to the Obama administration.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, regardless of party, to join me in this \nfight. Too much is at stake to let petty partisan concerns and blind \npolitical loyalty to the President take precedence over the weighty \nmatters of national security and constitutional authority that are at \nstake, and especially when one considers how much this branch of \ngovernment is being ignored on almost a daily basis by this out-of-\ncontrol White House.\n  Democrats and Republicans have to put a stop to this, and they have \nto start standing up on these issues or we are in danger of losing the \nConstitution itself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday I chaired, along with Congressman \nSmith, a Republican from New Jersey, the Congressional-Executive \nCommittee on China. At this hearing, Terry Sefranek, a Clevelander \nactually from Brooklyn Heights, OH, a suburb of my city, submitted \nwritten testimony. The hearing was to address the concerns that \nAmerican consumers, pet owners, farmers, and parents have about the \nsafety of pet food, pet treats, processed chicken, and animal feed from \nChina. Ms. Sefranek joined me then today on a call with some national \npress to talk about this issue. I wish to share briefly the actual \nwords of Ms. Sefranek's testimony. She said:\n\n       In December of 2011, my little Sampson, a healthy, lively \n     and hilarious fox terrier mutt was showing signs that he was \n     not well. He seemed withdrawn, and his appetite was \n     decreasing, and all he wanted was to drink water and urinate. \n     His health rapidly decreased.\n       We took him to the veterinarian 3 times in the next two \n     weeks. Finally, blood tests revealed horrible results. \n     Sampson was in acute renal failure.\n       The Doc gave him intravenous fluids for six long, \n     tormenting days. And then, the agonizing decision, the \n     hardest, most heartbreaking decision. With my husband and \n     children around us, I held my little buddy in my arms for the \n     last time, as he was euthanized.\n\n  Ms. Sefranek continues:\n\n       One day during this time, I saw a local family on the news, \n     holding up a bag of Waggin' Train Chicken Jerky Treats. Their \n     dog had eaten them and died of renal failure a few weeks \n     earlier. Their new little puppy was fed leftovers from the \n     same bag--and became ill right away. As soon as they stopped \n     the treats, he recovered.\n       I was floored. It was the exact same treat that Sampson had \n     eaten; it has been his new favorite, and I was giving him \n     them as a treat for about a month. I'm sure that was the only \n     major change in his diet.\n\n  Sixty-two million households in this country have a pet. Americans \nraise 83 million dogs and 96 million cats whom, as is the case with my \nwife's and my dog Franklin, we treat, in many ways, as members of the \nfamily. That is why it is alarming that since 2007, the FDA has been \naware of the deaths and illnesses of thousands of pets, but we still \ndon't know what is causing it.\n  Last month the FDA said that reports of illnesses had increased to \n5,600\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\npets, including 1,000 dog deaths, and now three human illnesses.\n  Pet owners shouldn't have to worry about the safety of the food they \ngive their pets. When we go to a pet store, go to a grocery store and \nbuy pet food, we shouldn't have to worry that pet food could actually \nendanger that dog's, that cat's health.\n  While no cause has been identified, the illnesses many think are \nlinked to pet treats from China, which raises questions. If something \nsays it is made in China, can we be assured that it is safe? If it says \n``made in the USA,'' what exactly does that mean? Is everything being \ndone to keep these pet treats safe?\n  Last year the USDA declared that China can export processed, cooked \nchicken into the United States. This paves the way for chicken sourced \nin the United States to be shipped to China for processing and then \nsold back to American consumers. While no such chicken has yet entered \nour shores, it is possible that very soon this processed chicken could \nend up on our dinner tables and in our school lunchrooms.\n  Researchers are exploring a possible link also between animal feed \nfrom China and the PEDv that has wiped out 10 percent of piglets--10 \npercent of our young pig population. It has been a year already and no \ndefinitive cause has been identified.\n  Americans want and require better answers. We want and require \nclearer labels and the peace of mind that the foods we import from the \nPeople's Republic of China are safe.\n  This is why I am introducing an amendment to the agriculture \nappropriations bill to ask the Food and Drug Administration and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture about the status of inspectors' visas to \nChina and how many are currently inspecting there.\n  We heard in testimony yesterday an uncertainty from FDA and USDA \nabout our ability to get the number of inspectors we need into China to \ninspect the processing of chickens in China. I urged the FDA to \ninvestigate and determine the cause of these pet illnesses and PEDv, \nand the companies to ensure the highest safety standards.\n  When we buy something that says ``made in the United States of \nAmerica,'' whether it is food for human consumption or whether it is \nprocessed food for human consumption or whether it is processed food \nfor our pets, we should be confident that food is actually made, \nprocessed, and put together in the United States of America. In our \ntestimony yesterday, we couldn't quite be 100 percent sure that is the \ncase.\n  A couple of things need to go on there. One, the packaging and the \nlabeling needs to be believable and credible and it needs to be true. \nSecond, those companies that import--it used to be that companies would \nproduce in the United States with food safety rules we have in the \nUnited States--drug safety, food safety--customers, buyers, and \nsupermarkets that buy this food with ``made in the USA'' labels knew \nthat because we have a good FDA, because we have a good U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, because we have good food safety rules in our country--\nwe knew that ``made in the USA'' was a label we could trust.\n  Then companies in this country began to do something in the last 20 \nyears--especially since Congress passed Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with China. Companies began to shut down production in places \nsuch as Rocky River and Maple Heights and Garfield Heights and Brooklyn \nHeights, OH, and move that production to Wahan or Shihan or Beijing, or \nShanghai, China, and then sell those products back to the United \nStates. If companies are going to do that, costing our communities jobs \nin far too many cases, hurting families and workers who lose those \njobs--if companies are going to do that, they need to be responsible in \nthe production in those countries. They need to be responsible when \npharmaceuticals are made in China by U.S. companies and then shipped \nback to the United States. Those pharmaceuticals need to be safe.\n  We know in the case of a drug called Heparin which people in Toledo, \nOH, took, and a number of people died from it. All over the country \nthey took this drug. It was a blood thinner made in China by a company \nthat, frankly, didn't know--couldn't reach back and determine and find \nout where all the ingredients for these drugs were made.\n  So there are a couple of points. One is whether it is dog treats, \nwhether it is food that humans consume in our country or whether it is \npharmaceuticals, our regulatory structure needs to make sure these are \nsafe. If they are made in the United States, we are much more confident \nthey are safe, because government rules and regulations in the United \nStates--despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nalways like to say about government regulation--we know our food supply \nis pretty darn good. But if companies are going to outsource that \nproduction, move it to China and then sell it back to the United \nStates, we need these rules in place. We need these companies to be \nreliable and liable ultimately in what they are doing. So if a company \nis going to bring a drug into the United States--an American company \nproducing in China and bringing it back to the United States--they are \nresponsible for the contents, and they are responsible for the safety \nof those drugs. Their executives, those companies, should be liable if \nthey are producing that food. Whether it is for human consumption or \nwhether it is for pets or whether it is pharmaceuticals, all of that \nmatters.\n  Americans, again, should not be worried about the safety of the food \nthey put on the dinner table nor the safety of the pet food they give \nto their dogs and cats.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Children's Health Insurance\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about children's health \ninsurance, an issue we hear about periodically but not nearly enough \nand an issue that will fast become a critically important question \nbefore both bodies, the Senate especially, because of what could happen \nto the Children's Health Insurance Program, which we call at the State \nlevel the CHIP program, known more commonly in Washington as S-CHIP, \none of the great advancements in health care in recent American \nhistory.\n  We can go back 25 or 50 years, and other than Medicare and Medicaid \nand maybe a few other examples, VA health care, children's health care \nhas been a great success and I would say forthrightly a bipartisan \nsuccess, but we need to keep it that way. I have a particular interest \nin this program because of the experience we have in Pennsylvania, as \ntens of thousands of families have benefited from the Children's Health \nInsurance Program that was signed into law and advocated strongly by my \nfather when he served as the Governor of Pennsylvania. At the time \nPennsylvania was a model for the country. This was the early 1990s I am \ntalking about.\n  When he signed that bill into law, Pennsylvania became one of the \nlargest States with a new Children's Health Insurance Program which \nthen became a model for the Nation. Here is how that happened. In 1997, \nCongress passed the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program \nsigned into law in August of 1997 by President Clinton. The original \nbill was cosponsored by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, from \nMassachusetts of course, and the Senator from Utah, still serving, Mr. \nHatch.\n  They worked together, along with many others in a bipartisan fashion \nto produce important legislation for our children. Since that time this \nprogram has worked as a remarkable public-private partnership to \ndeliver critical health care to children. So in addition to being \nbipartisan, it was public and private together.\n  Care such as well child visits, immunizations, physical and \noccupational therapy, home health care and medical equipment and more \nwere all available for the first time for many families. So it helps \nchildren not only have health insurance and health coverage, but it \nhelps them be well and to stay well\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nover a long period of time, providing them with care they need and \ngiving their parents something government does not do enough; it \nprovides a measure of peace of mind to parents and to families.\n  In 2009, the President signed into law a bipartisan reauthorization \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program. The most recent year of \ndata indicates that CHIP covered over 8.1 million children over the \ncourse of a year. Consider that. With this program more than 8.1 \nmillion children have health care that would not have it any other way \nin the absence of this program.\n  Even with the progress we have made in providing new health insurance \noptions in the last couple of years as a result of the Affordable Care \nAct, the rate of uninsured Americans overall is still over 13 percent. \nThat is the lowest rate since 2008 but still too high. The rate of \nuninsured children is 9 percent, a much lower rate obviously than the \noverall rate but still too high.\n  CHIP has played an important role in increasing access to insurance \nfor children. The Web site for the Pennsylvania program, which is \nwww.chipcoverspakids.com, discusses several stories from Pennsylvania \nparents about how this Children's Health Insurance Program in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania has helped one particular family, in this \ncase, and many others. As you read the stories--here is one story. I \nwill sum it up briefly. The CHIP program has been great.\n  So said one family member:\n\n       We know that this is quality insurance and we are finally \n     able to sleep at night knowing that our kids can be seen by \n     excellent pediatricians. I do not know what we would have \n     done without CHIP. Now my children can play sports and go \n     away to camp like other kids and if they get hurt, CHIP is \n     there for them.\n\n  So said a parent. That is probably the best summation or the best \nrecitation of all of the reasons it is so important to make sure we \npreserve the Children's Health Insurance Program and preserve the \nfunding for it and preserve any strategy that will ensure that children \nhave the health care they need.\n  So CHIP is always going to be there for those kids. That is what we \nneed to make sure that we hold on to. I, similar to so many here and \nmany in both parties, have consistently advocated for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. I am pleased it has been authorized through \nfiscal year 2019. However--this is why I am standing here today. \nHowever, we were able only to secure funding through 2015. So the \nprogram is reauthorized to 2019 but funded only through fiscal year \n2015.\n  That deadline is approaching. Now is the time to act, again in the \nright bipartisan way, to preserve the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. It is time to make sure we ensure that CHIP will continue to \nbe funded through the authorization, at a minimum, through fiscal year \n2019.\n  Senator Rockefeller, one of the great champions of this program over \nmany years now, decades literally, introduced legislation last week \nthat I wholeheartedly support. That is an understatement. There is not \na Senator in this Chamber who should not support his legislation, the \nCHIP Extension Act of 2014, S. 2461.\n  The legislation extends funding for CHIP through fiscal year 2019, \nbringing the funding in line with the authorization. I cannot stress \nenough the need to pass this legislation this year, pass this 2014 \nlegislation that deals with this 2015 problem. State budget cycles are \nsuch that if we wait until next year, when the funding is about to \nexpire, we will be jeopardizing health insurance for millions of \nAmerican children.\n  States need time to plan their budgets and cannot operate under the \nuncertainty of a funding threat to such an important program. I thank \nSenator Rockefeller for his tireless commitment to the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program over many years--as I said, over several \ndecades. I thank him for his work in introducing this legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in both parties to support Senator \nRockefeller's legislation, the CHIP Extension Act of 2014, S. 2461, to \nmake sure children's health insurance will always be there for the \nchildren who are covered by that program.\n  In conclusion, this is very simple. We have people in both parties \nwho have spent a lot of their careers saying how much they care about \nchildren. They give speeches, they campaign, they talk about kids. We \nall talk about kids in very positive ways. That is wonderful. But the \ntest is how we act and what actions we take. That usually means how we \nvote. So if someone votes for this bill, they can stand and say they \nhave taken a substantial step in the direction of ensuring that \nchildren will have the health care they need. If they do not, and they \nvote against it, I do not think they can say that.\n  If someone votes against it, I think they have to have a substitute \nfor it, some measure that will provide the same coverage for the same \nnumber of children by a different method. If they cannot come up with \nthat, they cannot stand and say they are for kids. They cannot stand \nand say they care about our children and their future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great grief and a heavy \nheart that I report to my fellow Senators the passing of Mrs. Nelda \nBarton-Collings. A native of my home State, the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, Nelda was an accomplished businesswoman, a dedicated public \nservant, and a joy to all of those who have had the pleasure of knowing \nher. She died in her home last Friday at the age of 85.\n  Nelda was born and raised in Providence, KY, and she graduated from \ncollege just a few counties over at Western Kentucky University. After \ngraduation she began what was to be a successful career in business. \nAmong her many achievements, she expanded her family's nursing home \nbusiness by opening new homes across the State and founded several \ncommunity banks that were eventually consolidated into the Lexington-\nbased Forcht Bank.\n  Nelda's pursuits were not limited to business ventures, however. She \nexhibited a passion for public service and was heavily involved in the \nRepublican Party throughout her life. She was the first woman to chair \nthe Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, and she served for 28 years as \nKentucky's Republican National Committeewoman. She worked tirelessly to \nbetter the lives of her fellow Kentuckians--a quality that elevated her \nto the national stage.

She was 85.\n       Her death elicited comments from several of Kentucky's top \n     Republican officials.\n       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Louisville said, ``As a \n     pioneer in business and politics in Kentucky, Nelda was a \n     fantastic force for good and gave the state she loved a \n     lifetime of service.

Mr. President, Senator Vitter and I wish to recognize \nand honor Charlie McBride, a native son of Louisiana who has given so \nmuch of his time and energy towards the goal of educating this Nation's \nyouth in civic and community responsibility. Through his service and \ncommitment to the Close Up Foundation, Charlie has led an organization \nthat for the past 43 years has significantly impacted and provided \ncitizenship education to nearly 800,000 high school and middle school \nstudents and educators from around the country and U.S. Territories. On \nbehalf of the Senate and the State of Louisiana, we, as former Close Up \nparticipants applaud Charlie for his devotion to Close Up and the civic \neducation of our youth.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, as you know, Close Up is a nonprofit, \nnonpartisan organization that promotes responsible participation in our \ndemocratic process. Its mission is to inform, educate, and inspire \nstudents to exercise the rights and accept the responsibilities of \nbeing a citizen in our democracy. Through experiential civic education \nprograms based in Washington, DC, and other local communities, and \npublication of classroom resources to help educators teach students \nabout public policy issues, Close\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nUp impacts the lives of students every day.\n  Both of us are testament to the profound impact these programs have \non our youth, as we participated in the Close Up program in its early \nyears, an experience that incited our first thoughts of a career in \npublic service. We commend and congratulate Close Up on its important \nwork.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Charlie McBride is no stranger to public policy. He \nworked for 12 years on personal and committee staffs in the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives. Since then, as a government relations and \nbusiness consultant, he has represented a myriad of clients in \nvirtually every policy field, for which he is known and well-respected \nby our colleagues. His experiences have instilled in him a strong \nappreciation of the need for knowledgeable and thoughtful citizens, \nparticularly in our legislative processes. For this reason, he has \nenthusiastically embraced Close Up's efforts to develop an informed, \neffective, and responsible citizenry among this Nation's youth.\n  Mr. VITTER. Charlie was first introduced to Close Up in 1974 when he \nwas chief of staff for Senator Bennett Johnston and helped secure \nfunding for the Allen J. Ellender Fellowships that served to provide \nsupport for economically disadvantaged students and teachers to \nparticipate in Close Up programs. After working closely with Close Up \nfor many years, he joined its board of directors in 1988 and has served \nas the vice chairman for the past 10 years. During his service, Charlie \nhas provided leadership and assisted Close Up in its relations with \nMembers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We are proud that Louisiana students and teachers have \nparticipated in Close Up programs since the organization's inception \nand that a good friend and fellow Louisianan has contributed so much \ntime and effort to this great organization. Thanks to people like \nCharlie, students are provided the unique opportunity to learn about \nour government by meeting lawmakers, representatives of public interest \ngroups, journalists, and people from all branches of government, and to \nunderstand how they can make a positive contribution through \nparticipation in our democracy. Charlie's presence at Close Up will be \nsorely missed. We are privileged to formally recognize Charlie's \ncommitment and efforts to this great endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3807-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY HOWARD\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to \nJeffrey R. Howard, a key member of my staff on the Select Committee on \nIntelligence for his distinguished service to the Senate. Jeffrey will \nleave us shortly to join the new office being opened by Ionic Security \nin Maryland, where he will serve as the chief technology officer's \nchief of staff. I am honored to have the opportunity to publicly thank \nJeffrey and note my appreciation for his outstanding service to the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence during the past 4 years.\n  Since becoming the vice chairman of the committee in 2011, I have \noften relied upon Jeffrey's impressive technical expertise and teamwork \nskills on a wide range of oversight issues. He has provided us with his \nexpert advice in matters relating to science, technology, and \nengineering, including cybersecurity, oversight of the National \nSecurity Agency, and information technology programs.\n  Jeffrey is well known on the Hill and by the private sector as one of \nthe leading congressional staff experts on cybersecurity legislative \nissues. He has worked tirelessly with my team to develop and negotiate \nlegislative proposals consistent with my strong desire to get an \neffective cybersecurity information sharing bill enacted into law. \nDuring the 112th Congress, Jeffrey was a crucial participant in the \nnegotiations that led the ranking members of eight Senate committees to \nco-sponsor S. 2151 and S. 3342, the Strengthening and Enhancing \nCybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, and Technology \nAct of 2012, more commonly known as ``SECURE IT.'' During this \nCongress, Senator Feinstein and I have been working very hard to \ndevelop a bipartisan cybersecurity information sharing bill that we \nbelieve will be well-received by the private sector and our colleagues \nin the Senate and the House of Representatives. We are finally quite \nclose to being able to mark up our cybersecurity information sharing \nbill and Jeffrey played an integral role every step of the way.\n  Jeffrey even has a superpower--he has the ability to translate \nextremely complicated technical topics into clear and concise \nexplanations that can be used to solve difficult, real-world problems. \nHe is also the undisputed staff champion at documenting the extent of \nhis oversight efforts. He has filed more memoranda for the record \nduring his tenure than half of the professional staff members combined. \nI dare say that Jeffrey may know more about the National Security \nAgency than some of the senior executives who have served there. \nJeffrey's inexhaustible work ethic and sound judgment have made him an \nindispensable member of the committee staff and an invaluable resource \nto other congressional committees. His sly wit and good humor make him \na pleasure to work with. He is the consummate team player who improves \nthe performance of everyone around him.\n  My colleagues and I trust Jeffrey's judgment implicitly. His \ndedicated public service and exceptional day-to-day performance on the \njob have earned our respect and admiration, and it inspired a \ngeneration of staff who had the privilege to work alongside him. There \nis no doubt that Jeffrey has a bright future at Ionic Security; \nhowever, should the right opportunity present itself, I would strongly \nencourage my Senate colleagues to entice him back into public service. \nWe will miss Jeffrey deeply, but his legacy will remain a part of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3807-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NORMA LOVE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Norma Love--a \nvenerable Associated Press reporter who is retiring at the end of the \nmonth after a long career covering government and politics in the \nGranite State.\n  Norma's name is well-known to anyone in New Hampshire who has picked \nup a newspaper in the past three decades. She started in the AP's \nConcord bureau 31 years ago, and she has covered the statehouse for 29 \nof those years--spanning the administrations of seven Governors.\n  It was at the statehouse where I first had the privilege of meeting \nNorma. We crossed paths on more times than I can count during my years \nin the attorney general's office. Whenever Norma called, I always knew \nthat I would be talking to a consummate professional who holds herself \nto the highest standards of journalism.\n  Norma understands that journalists have a responsibility to ask tough \nquestions. She has always taken a firm--but fair--approach to her \nreporting, and that is why she is so deeply respected by public \nofficials on both sides of the aisle.\n  Norma could have been a reporter anywhere in the country, but she \nchose New Hampshire. During her decades of diligent reporting, she has \nbeen a witness to history--chronicling the people and places of her \nadopted State. While much has changed in the Granite State, and in \nnewsrooms, since Norma arrived at the AP, her commitment to excellence \nin journalism has never wavered.\n  The people of New Hampshire are so fortunate that Norma Love has been \nasking hard questions on their behalf for the past 31 years. Norma \nbrings tremendous credit to the profession that she loves, and she will \nleave behind big shoes to fill in the statehouse press room.\n  I am pleased to join with Norma's colleagues and many friends in \nwishing her the very best as she makes this transition and looks to new \nhorizons. As we thank her for her many years of dedicated reporting, we \nsend her every good wish for a long, full, and happy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3807-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3807-S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BOONE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\ndevelopment, make smart investments to expand opportunity, and take the \ninitiative to improve the health and well-being of residents. Over the \ndecades, I have witnessed the growth and revitalization of so many \ncommunities across my State. And it has been deeply gratifying to see \nhow my work in Congress has supported these local efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Boone County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Boone County worth over $5.7 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $7.3 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \ncommunity's tremendous success in obtaining more than $3.3 million from \nthe Federal Aviation Administration for improvements to the airport. As \na strong supporter of small community airports, I have long fought for \nfunding from programs that support service to small communities and \ninfrastructure support to keep these airports modern.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Central Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Boone \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Boone \nCounty, I have fought for funding for more than $5.9 million in Defense \nDepartment funds for Iowa Thin Film Technology, helping to create jobs \nand expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Boone County has received $339,299 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Boone County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $194,051.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Boone County has received more than $2.5 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Boone County's \nfire departments have received over $699,392 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Boone County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $236,000.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Boone County, both those \nwith and without disabilities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Boone County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Boone \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3808-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3808-S3809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BLACK HAWK COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that \nhas leveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole \nripple effect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with \nmayors, city council members, and local economic development officials \nin Black Hawk County, I have fought for over $100 million to construct \nthe Avenue of the Saints, $10 million to improve US-63, $35 million to \nimprove Waterloo's sewer system, and more than $1.9 million for the \ncleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, helping to create jobs and \nexpand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nWaterloo and Cedar Falls to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that Black \nHawk County has earned $440,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings. They build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

Over the \nyears, Black Hawk County has received over $7 million in Harkin grants. \nIn addition, since 2001, I have helped to provide more than $80 million \nin Federal funds to the University of Northern Iowa, including support \nfor projects such as a transit hub, the National Ag-Based Lubricants \nCenter, Project SOAR, and many others.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nBlack Hawk County has received over $22.9 million to remediate and \nprevent widespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. Cities in Black Hawk County received over \n$2.3 million in Community Oriented Policing Services and Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grants. Since 2001, Black Hawk County's fire departments \nhave received over $1.6 million for firefighter safety and operations \nequipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces.

She is also a close friend who \nhas never been shy in using her formidable voice to let me know how we \ncan do more to help those in need.\n  Margaret Louise Carter may be poised for retirement, but that does \nnot mean she is going to stop adding to an impressive list of \naccomplishments and building on her legacy of hard work and determined \nadvocacy.\n  Margaret Carter is a true force of nature. A single mother of nine, \nshe graduated from Portland State University with a B.S. in education. \nShe later earned her Master's in Educational psychology from Oregon \nState University, which led to a career as teacher and counselor at \nPortland Community College.\n  Out of concern for the most vulnerable in her northeast Portland \nneighborhood, she used her compassion, natural leadership ability and \ntenacity to win a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives in 1984, \nbecoming the first African-American woman elected to the Oregon State \nLegislature.\n  She did not stop there. She went on to serve in the Oregon Senate, as \nchair of the Democratic Party of Oregon, became president and CEO of \nthe Urban League of Portland and president of the National Organization \nof Black Elected Legislative Women. She helped establish the Job Skills \nCenter for Portland Community College's Cascade Campus, where the \nTechnology Education Building was renamed in her\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nhonor, making it the first building in PCC's 50 year history to be \nnamed after a woman.\n  Margaret accomplished many notable things while in office, including, \nbut not limited to, helping create a permanent Head Start program in \nOregon, co-sponsoring a bill to create parity for mental health \nservices, establishing a State holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. and co-founding the Oregon Youth Conservation Corps.\n  While Margaret may be leaving the world of work, those of us who know \nher know that there is no way she is leaving the world of community \ninvolvement. Whether it is advocating for affordable home-ownership \noptions for low to moderate-income families, organizing a kids choir to \nperform at community events, or entertaining friends with a singing \nvoice that is just as strong as her personality, you can rest assured \nthat Margaret will be there.\n  After a life of service to others, it is fitting that Margaret is \nretiring from her position at the Oregon Department of Human Services. \nIt is with great pride, both personally and professionally, that I \nextend my congratulations to Margaret Louise Carter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3810-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 43.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease access for the uninsured to high quality physician care; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, one of the greatest issues impacting the \nAmerican health care system is the lack of access to high quality care \nfor the uninsured. According to a 2012 CBO study, 26-27 million people \nwill not have health insurance in 2016, with other studies suggesting \nthat number may be closer to 30 million. Recent data from the Health \nResource and Services Administration, HRSA, shows that close to 20 \npercent of Americans live in areas with an insufficient number of \nprimary care physicians. According to the Association of American \nMedical Colleges, AAMC, it is expected that there will be a shortage of \n45,000 primary care physicians in the US by 2020, further limiting \naccess to care.\n  An immediate way to improve access to high quality health care for \nthe uninsured is to engage the physician community to provide greater \nlevels of charity care. Currently, there is little incentive for \nphysicians to provide charity care outside of their normal scope of \npractice, and the percentage of physicians providing charity care has \nbeen in a state of steady decline. Due to reimbursement changes over \nthe years, physicians are currently forced to maintain a certain amount \nof private, Medicare, and Medicaid insured patients in order to ensure \ntheir practices can remain profitable. This often leaves no opportunity \nto care for patients who lack insurance and who are often the most \nvulnerable and sick.\n  The Charity Care Expansion Act would create a much needed incentive \nfor doctors to deliver uncompensated care, thereby improving and \nexpanding access to care for the uninsured.\n  The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and allows for \nphysicians to have a tax deduction for the taxable year at an amount \nequal to the amount the physician would have otherwise been paid.\n  For example, if Medicare would have reimbursed at $100 for a service, \nthe physician would be able to deduct for $100. None of the deduction \namounts would be arbitrary.\n  To qualify for the tax deduction, the bill would require physicians \nto have a pre-existing relationship with a health care clinic or \nanother organization providing health care which is targeted to serve \nlow income individuals. Through this coordination, the patient would be \nplaced into the healthcare system with follow ups and health care \nprofessionals to see, instead of getting lost in the system after \ntreatment. This would also prevent the use of the tax deduction as a \ntool to write off bad debt.\n  The limitations on the deduction are 10 percent of gross income of \nthe taxpayer for the taxable year derived from the taxpayer's provision \nof physicians' services. For retired physicians, no more than a $10,000 \ndeduction would be allowed.\n  While I am still waiting for a cost estimate on the bill, I repeal \nthe Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant, PHHSBG, which \nwas included in the President's budget as a recommended cut, to provide \nan offset.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/18/senate-section/article/S3813-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3813-S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 478--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \nTO ENHANCED RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA AND SUPPORT FOR THE \n              REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Murphy) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S.
