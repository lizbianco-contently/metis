Mr. President, Kimberly Cates is no stranger to the \nstruggles that come with living without health insurance in America. \nShe works at a health clinic that treats uninsured Kentuckians. The \nclinic does not provide its employees with health insurance. Over the \nlast few years she has racked up $15,000 in medical bills and recently \nfiled for bankruptcy. Last week, after a month of considering her \noptions, Mrs. Cates signed up for health insurance for the first time \nin many years. The plan will cost $17 a month--I repeat, $17 a month--\nand every hospital near her home will accept her new insurance. This is \nthe difference ObamaCare is making, and Mrs. Cates is only one example \nof the success of Kentucky's new health insurance exchange created \nunder the Affordable Care Act.\n  More than 1,000 Kentucky residents have signed up for affordable \nhealth insurance every single day since the exchange opened, according \nto the Huffington Post, which reported Mrs. Cates' story.\n  Across the country, in States such as Kentucky that have opened their \nown exchanges, Americans are signing up for quality, affordable, \ninsurance plans, often for the first time in many years.\n  The national rollout of the ObamaCare Web site was rocky, to say the \nleast. Problems with the site must and will be fixed. But we should not \nlose sight of important victories happening in living rooms and \nlibraries and community centers across the country, victories like the \none Mrs. Cates celebrated last week. ObamaCare is more than a Web site. \nFor tens of millions of Americans who have been living without \ninsurance, ObamaCare is a lifeline. But rather than work with Democrats \nto fix the problems in this landmark law, Republicans in Washington are \nbusy complaining about it instead. Meanwhile, Republican Governors in \nStates such as Nevada, Ohio, New Jersey, and Michigan are helping more \nresidents of their States access health care by expanding Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  One Nevada woman contacted my office saying that she is counting the \ndays until January, 2014, when her new health insurance plan will take \neffect and she can finally go to the doctor.\n  In the past she has been denied health insurance because of a \npreexisting condition, but now she qualifies for a plan she can afford \nunder Nevada's Medicaid expansion, led by Republican Governor Brian \nSandoval. Thanks to ObamaCare, Americans like her can no longer be \ndenied insurance because they are a cancer survivor, a woman, a \ndiabetic, or had acne when they were younger. That is one of the many \nbenefits of this new law.\n  Under ObamaCare, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to \ncancel your policy when you get sick or because you are a woman or set \nan arbitrary limit on the care you receive. In Nevada alone, tens of \nthousands of seniors have saved tens of millions on medicine because \nObamaCare closed the gap in prescription drug coverage.\n  More than 3 million young people, including 33,000 young adults, \nstayed on their parents' health insurance plans because of ObamaCare, \nand hundreds of\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nthousands of businesses that already offer their employees health \ninsurance are getting tax credits for doing the right thing because of \nObamaCare.\n  A new study shows 17 million Americans have also qualified for tax \ncredits to purchase coverage and many more are eligible for Medicaid \nbecause of ObamaCare.\n  Unfortunately, 5 million people living in States that did not expand \nMedicare eligibility are left out in the cold. It is shameful that \nAmericans who simply want access to lifesaving medical care will be \ndenied insurance for political reasons.\n  There is no better example of that than Texas. They have far more \npeople who are eligible for Medicaid coverage who will not get it. That \nis unfortunate. We know that healthcare.gov is not perfect. I know that \nObamaCare is not perfect. But ObamaCare is worth more than a Web site, \nand whenever Republicans are willing to stop complaining and are \nwilling to start working to improve the law, Democrats are ready and \nwilling to work with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7838-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, nearly every day we see evidence of \nmore Americans losing their health coverage. Just take a look at this \nmap right here to my right--105,000 losing their coverage in Idaho; \n215,000 in Pennsylvania; 330,000 in Florida. Out in California it is \ngetting close to 1 million. All of these people have lost their health \ncoverage.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, which has been frequently referred to \nby some as a success story, let's get the facts straight: 280,000 \npeople--probably on a per capita basis more than any other State in \nAmerica--280,000 folks are losing their private insurance as a result \nof ObamaCare, despite the President's repeated promises that such a \nthing could not possibly happen. That compares, by the way, with only \nabout 5,000 who have been able to sign up for new private care on the \nKentucky exchange.\n  Let's go over that again. In my State, 280,000 people have lost their \nhealth care policies while 5,000 have signed up on the exchange. Most \nof the people in Kentucky who are signing up for something new are \nsigning up for Medicaid, for free health care. I think we can stipulate \nthat if you are giving out free health care, you are going to have more \npeople sign up. But on the exchanges in Kentucky, 5,000 have signed up, \nand 280,000 have lost their policies. In other words, so far about 56 \ntimes as many Kentuckians have lost their private insurance plans as \nhave gotten new ones on the State exchange. That is hardly what most \npeople would define as a success.\n  But, if ObamaCare has gotten off to a troubled start in Kentucky, the \nsame is also true in many other parts of the country. That is why one \nof the most senior Democrats just said that ObamaCare is facing ``a \ncrisis of confidence.'' I certainly agree with her.\n  She cited the ``dysfunctional nature of the Web site'' as just one \nreason for the ebbing confidence. She also pointed to the \n``cancellation of policies'' and ``sticker shock'' as two additional \npoints of concern--cancellation of policies and sticker shock.\n  She is right. Americans are far less concerned about a Web site than \nthey are about the availability and affordability of their health care. \nThe White House has tried to dismiss stories about folks losing \ninsurance by saying they had lousy plans to begin with and that those \nAmericans should be happy--they should be happy that the government is \nnow forcing them to get a different one. In other words, the government \nis smarter than they are. You had a lousy plan to begin with, so I am \ngoing to make you get a different one.\n  But what so many have discovered is that ObamaCare is actually worse. \nTake Matthew Fleischer. He is 34 and recently wrote to the Los Angeles \nTimes to share his experience with ObamaCare. Matthew recently found \nout he would be one of those 1 million or so Californians losing their \nhealth insurance. He says he is being funneled into an exchange plan \nthat would drive his premiums up by more than 40 percent. Here is some \nof what he wrote:\n\n       My old plan was as barebones as they came, so I assumed \n     that even though the new plan would cost more, my coverage \n     would improve under ObamaCare, at least marginally. It did \n     not.\n       Under my old plan my maximum possible out-of-pocket expense \n     was $4,900. Under the new plan, I'm on the hook for up to \n     $6,350. Copays for my doctor visits will double. For urgent \n     care visits they will quadruple. Although slightly cheaper \n     plans exist if I tried to shop around on the exchange, I will \n     lose my dental coverage [if I choose] to switch. Needless to \n     say, I am not pleased.\n\n  He is one of numerous people who have been blind-sided since \nObamaCare's debut last month. Look, our constituents are worried. They \nfeel deceived. They are very upset, and they should be--not only with \nthe law itself but with the way the administration has basically \nbrushed their concerns aside, just brushed their concerns aside, \nconcerns it does not seem all that interested in solving.\n  If the past 2 weeks are any indication, the administration seems far \nmore concerned with shifting the blame. That is why the President's PR \nteam has been scrambling to readjust his now-debunked promise, ``If you \nlike your plan, you can keep it.'' How many times did we hear the \nPresident say that over the last 3 years? But every new variation \nbasically amounts to this--this is what it really amounts to: If the \nPresident likes your plan, you can keep it. That is the truth. If the \nPresident likes your plan, you can keep it; not if you like your plan, \nyou can keep it.\n  The truth is, all these rhetorical adjustments only prove the point. \nThey are a tacit admission that the administration did in fact mislead \nthe public about ObamaCare in order to pass it. Many of our friends on \nthe Democratic side are starting to realize this too, and they are \nstarting to panic. We have seen some of the most vulnerable Senators \neven putting forward proposals that might allow some folks to keep \ntheir plan.\n  From a policy perspective, we Republicans welcome that. We have long \nargued that Americans should be able to purchase the plans that suit \ntheir needs, not just the plans that meet with the President's \napproval. But the concern these Democrats are now showing seems hard to \ntake seriously when you consider that they have continued to support \nObamaCare for so long, even as Republicans, health officials, and \npolicy experts across the country warned that exactly what is happening \nwould happen. The fact is that back in 2010 the entire Democratic \ncaucus voted against legislation that would have specifically allowed \nthe Americans now losing their plans to keep them. I will say that \nagain. Back in 2010 the entire Democratic caucus voted against \nlegislation that would have specifically allowed the Americans now \nlosing their plans to keep them.\n\n  This doesn't mean Republicans won't now consider good legislative \nproposals. Of course we will. But for Senators looking to absolve \nthemselves of past ObamaCare mistakes, there is only one escape, and it \nbegins with repealing ObamaCare, and it ends with working together on \nbipartisan reforms that can actually work.\n  The White House keeps promising Americans that once healthcare.gov is \nfixed, everybody's going to love ObamaCare, but it is hard to see how \nthat could possibly happen. An IT guy is not going to give Americans \ntheir health care plans back. An IT guy is not going to make ObamaCare \npremiums any more affordable or its coverage any better. An IT guy is \nnot going to allow Americans to keep seeing the same doctors they like \nor continue to go to hospitals that deliver the care they want. Let's \nnot forget that there is no software fix for undoing the damage this \nlaw has already inflicted on the paychecks and lost hours of our \nconstituents. There is no string of code for repairing ObamaCare's harm \nto jobs and to our country.\n  The President could not be more right when he says ObamaCare is about \nmore than a Web site. It sure is. I could not agree more. It is about \npeople. It is about the people we represent, folks such as Matthew \nFleischer and Edie Sundby, whom I mentioned. Edie is\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nbattling stage IV gallbladder cancer and says that because of ObamaCare \nshe is about to lose access to the kind of affordable care she credits \nwith keeping her alive for the past several years. It is about folks \nlike a 40-year-old constituent of mine named Mark. Mark owns a small \nbusiness and thought he would be able to keep his current insurance, \nbut then he got a letter from his insurer terminating the plan anyway. \nAfter looking at his options on the Kentucky exchange, he discovered \nthat his Kentucky premiums would rise by 300 percent. It is not right, \nand it is not fair.\n  Here is an important lesson: ObamaCare would not be law today if the \nPresident and his allies in Congress had told the truth about the \nconsequences it would bring. People like Edie, Matthew, and Mark would \nnot be in the troubling circumstances they are in now if the President \nhad simply been honest about ObamaCare.\n  The President can keep talking about a Web site if he wants, but \nRepublicans are going to keep fighting for the middle-class Americans \nwho are suffering under this law because that is where the focus should \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7839-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In the last 40 years no member of the Congress has been more \ndedicated to America's defense and those who defend it than my good \nfriend and former colleague Ike Skelton.\n  Growing up in Lexington, MO, his dream of joining the military like \nhis father was cut short when he was diagnosed with polio. A true sign \nof his determination occurred when he overcame this hardship and went \non to serve his Nation in a way he could never have imagined as a young \npatient at Warm Springs, GA, at a center founded by President Franklin \nRoosevelt and focused on their common challenge of how to overcome \npolio.\n  Ike served in the Missouri State Senate for 4 years. He was \nencouraged by a family friend, another Missourian named Harry Truman, \nto represent Missouri at the national level. A few years after that \nencouragement he eventually followed President Truman's advice and was \neventually elected to the House of Representatives, where he started to \nserve in 1977 and continued to fulfill his dream of protecting America.\n  As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Ike Skelton \nsuccessfully led an effort that transformed Whiteman Air Force Base to \nhouse one of the most iconic military aircraft in U.S. history, the B-2 \nBomber. Fort Leonard Wood grew from a training base for the newly \nenlisted to a center for many of our military schools and the Army \nCorps of Engineers. By ensuring military bases remained in Missouri, \nIke Skelton's legacy continues to protect our Nation's military and \nprovide hundreds of jobs in our home State.\n  From the time he was a young boy, Congressman Skelton loved our \ncountry and its history, and now after years of service he has earned \nhis own spot in our Nation's history. It was truly a great privilege to \nserve Missouri in the Congress with him and to benefit from his \nfriendship and advice.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7842, November 6, 2013, in the first column (in four \nplaces), the following language appears: . . . \nSkeleton\n\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . .

Senator Truman}s . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . President Truman}s \n. . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Madam President, I would like to talk about another topic. I am sure \nit is no surprise to anybody that it has been more than a month now \nsince the embarrassing Web site rollout of the President's health care \nplan and it still is not working. The Obama administration has been \nforced to take down the Web site on numerous occasions, and it often \ndidn't work at a critical moment when they were trying to explain how \nit was finally beginning to work. While reports have surfaced showing \nthat only six people managed to enroll on the first day, the \nadministration still refuses to put out any real numbers about how many \npeople have actually signed up for coverage.\n  I have sponsored a bill demanding that we have more transparency and \nmore answers about how $400 million has been spent on an exchange that \ndoes not work. They had 3\\1/2\\ years to get ready, interjecting \nourselves into 16 percent of the economy and everybody's health care \ncoverage, and it is still not working. The administration acted \nsurprised. President Obama claimed the system was temporarily \noverwhelmed by a large volume of interested shoppers. Another person in \nthe administration estimated that there might have been hundreds of \npeople online before the Web site crashed. In a time like this, the Web \nsite crashing for any reason is really not a very good excuse.\n  Prior to the launch, HHS officials insisted that the exchanges were \non track. They insisted they had been tested. They insisted it was \nworking the way it was supposed to work, just as people are now \ninsisting the President's health care plan is going to work the way it \nis supposed to work. At recent committee hearings in the House, Marilyn \nTavenner, the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, and Secretary Sebelius each testified they were confident \nthat these glitches, as they called them, would be improved by the end \nof November. These were the same people who were saying it would work \non the 1st of October.\n  It is long overdue for the President and the administration to level \nwith the American people. It is also important to understand that the \nWeb site is the easiest thing they are going to be asked to do.\n  The President recently said during his White House Rose Garden \nspeech: ObamaCare is not just a Web site; it is much more. Well, I \ncould not agree more. I will say again that the Web site is the easiest \nproblem they will be asked to solve. It should not become a proxy for \nwhether this plan should work, and I think most Americans are going to \nfigure that out.\n  As Senator McConnell said earlier about the Kentuckians he has heard \nfrom, I heard from all kinds of Missourians who have seen their work \nhours reduced and their health care premiums rise. We know this is not \ngood for the workforce. We have seen too many people responding with \npart-time work and trying to keep numbers under 50 so they don't have \nto comply with a law they don't think they have to comply with.\n  In 2009 the President famously promised: If you like your health \nplan, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. He was still saying that in 2012 when he said: If you already \nhave health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case for the 3.5 million people in the \nindividual market who have already received letters saying they are not \ngoing to be able to keep their health insurance. The Washington Post's \nFact Checker gave the President four Pinocchios for his repeated pledge \nthat you can keep your policy if you like it, and maybe that is because \nfive Pinocchios aren't possible and four is all they can give for a \nstatement that turns out to not be correct. NBC News reported last week \nthat 50 to 75 percent of at least 14 million consumers who buy their \ninsurance individually can expect to receive a cancellation notice.\n  Now the administration comes up with a response such as, well, this \nonly affects 5 percent of the people in the country. If it affects your \nfamily, it affects 100 percent of the people in your house. And if 5 \npercent of the people in the country is 14 million people and whoever \nis insured under their policy, we shouldn't act as though there is no \nconsequence at all.\n  It is no surprise. They had plenty of time to prepare.\n  The Springfield News-Leader, my hometown newspaper, recently reported \non Becky Supak, who is 63. She suffers from blood clots, and she had \ninsurance through the Missouri high-risk pool. One of the things \nRepublicans wanted to do, the conservatives wanted to do when this bill \nwas passed was figure out a way to expand these high-risk pools. The \nidea that there were no other ideas out there is just wrong. The \nMissouri high-risk pool, as do all the others, will go out of existence \nas of December 31. Becky's insurance has been costing her premiums of \naround $650 a month. She has a preexisting condition. She hadn't had \ninsurance before she got into the high-risk pool, but she was in that \npool and it was serving her needs. Now she has been told her insurance \nwill cost her $1,043 a month--a $400 increase on a working salary--and \nthat would allow her, she hopes, to keep the same doctors she has now.\n  One of my constituents said his wife, who had a preexisting \ncondition, will lose her policy the same way. Thanks to what is \nhappening here, they don't know whether they can get more coverage. \nThey are going to have to close the high-risk pool, look for coverage \nother places, and it is almost certain that coverage is going to be \nhigher than they had and almost certain to have less coverage than they \nhad.\n  Greg, a pastor from Poplar Bluff, MO, said he received a letter from \nhis health care provider of over 10 years announcing it will no longer \nbe his health care provider as of January 2014. He was happy with his \nold insurance. He is now forced to find another plan. He wants to know \nwhy they canceled, but the only explanation he can get is the machine \nthat says that due to health care regulations, they are being forced to \ndrop some of their older clients.\n  Sara of Hannibal, MO, comes from a family of quintessential small \nbusiness owners. If their business had been affected, their choice \nwould have been to close the business. Sara recently received a letter \nstating that after this year her current choice of policies won't be \navailable.\n  So it turns out that it is actually only if the White House likes \nyour\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\nplan, you get to keep your plan. This idea that you should ``just shop \naround,'' the idea that it is going to be less expensive, doesn't work.\n  This morning the Wall Street Journal talked about States that are \nbeginning to tell insurance companies: No, you really need to offer \nthese policies for at least another 3 months. And in California, if \ntheir insurance commissioner is right, 3 months of additional offering \nof the 115,000 policies that have already been canceled would mean \nthose policyholders could save as much as $28.6 million in 3 months. So \nwhoever thinks these costs are going to go down, apparently the \ninsurance commissioner in California says costs for these people are \ngoing to go up annually by over $100 million. Maybe that is why we are \ngoing to find out a lot more once the Web site starts working.\n  In Missouri and in all States, we are seeing more Americans receiving \ncancellation letters announcing their dropped coverage. Some people \nwill also be forced to pay higher premiums. I think we are going to \nfind that most people will be forced to pay higher premiums.\n  Now is the time to work together. Now would be the time to start over \nand come up with good plans to make the best health care system in the \nworld work better. As my colleague from New Hampshire--a Senator and a \nmom--Senator Ayotte has said as maybe only a mom can say it, it is time \nfor a time-out for ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                                  ENDA\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, there is no shortage of reasons why I \nam proud to represent my home State of Washington. Our State is an \neconomic leader. We are home to the American aerospace industry and a \nthriving agricultural sector. Dozens of companies create new products \nand new jobs with cutting-edge technology. We are a leader in \nprotecting the environment and educating our children. Washington State \nis a place tens of thousands of servicemembers and veterans call home. \nI am here today because I wish to speak about another way Washington \nState has set an example for the entire country; that is, our State's \nproud history of protecting the rights of all of our citizens, \nincluding members of the LGBT community.\n  In 2006 Washington State passed one of our country's strongest \nantidiscrimination laws--one that serves as a model for the Federal \nlegislation we are considering here today. In 2007 and 2008 we passed \nadditional legislation to further protect the rights of same-sex \ncouples, and 1 year ago today our State voted proudly to uphold \nlandmark marriage-equality legislation. What we have to show for it is \nreally two results. First, we have a thriving LGBT community made up of \nindividuals and families who can feel safe and respected and valued as \ndoes anyone else. Second, we have a growing economy that is anchored by \nbusinesses that respect their employees and judge them by only that \nwhich matters: their hard work and ability.\n  I rise today to simply ask my colleagues who don't yet support this \nlegislation to take a look at my home State of Washington because in \nplaces such as Seattle and Spokane, we are proving every day that \nprotecting the rights of our LGBT friends and neighbors isn't just the \nright thing to do; it works and it makes our country stronger.\n  Some of my colleagues have said that extending employment protections \nfor our LGBT friends and family members is too hard. Some of them said \nit will create problems for businesses and communities. Well, I invite \nthem to come to Seattle and ask businesses there whether it has been \nproblematic to respect their employees' rights. I would invite them to \nvisit Amazon or Starbucks or Nordstrom or Microsoft--just a few of our \nState's successful businesses that have taken the lead in protecting \nthe rights of their LGBT employees. We know in Washington State that it \nis wrong to discriminate against people. We know that a person's race \nor religion or gender has nothing to do with their ability in the \nworkplace, and we know that sexual orientation and gender identity \ndon't either.\n  Most all of our constituents--four out of five Americans--falsely \nbelieve LGBT Americans already have the protections included in this \nbill, and most people believe that because denying Americans their \nrights doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense that some men and \nwomen can be fired from their jobs just because of who they are or whom \nthey love. We know it is not fair in my home State of Washington, but \npeople in every State--from Virginia and Mississippi to Arizona and \nIdaho--know the same.\n  Many of my colleagues have cited these statistics, but they are worth \nrepeating. Two-thirds of all Americans, including a majority of \nRepublicans, believe in protecting LGBT citizens from employment \ndiscrimination. Despite that, more than half our country lives in \nStates in which their rights are not protected. I am proud my State \ndoes protect those rights, but we can't stop working until the same is \ntrue in all 50 States. So for any of my colleagues who still aren't \nconvinced that LGBT Americans deserve the same rights as all of us, my \ninvitation to visit Washington State stands because it is not enough \nthat my constituents are free from discrimination, their constituents \ndeserve the same.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Basic Functions Of Government\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise this morning in high hopes but with \ndeep concern. The high hopes are that a budget conference at long last \nis taking place, that representatives of the Senate and the House are \nmeeting together--met last week and I know have been meeting informally \nthis week--in order to try to achieve, finally, a budget for this \nfiscal year. My concern is that it has been so hard to get here, it has \nbeen so difficult, and that we are now in a process where we do not \nseem to be able to function.\n  I am worried about the country. I am worried about whether we are \ngoing to be able to address our problems. This is not a speech about \nsubject matter. It is not about global climate change or employment or \nthe minimum wage or health care, but it is about whether this \ninstitution can function in order to confront any of those problems.\n  When I was a young man, there was a famous book. It was kind of a \ncult favorite called ``Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.'' \nSometimes I feel as though that is where we are here. This institution \nhas been so compromised in its ability to function that it has become \nthe norm and people have low expectations, even people who are here.\n  I remember being on the floor a few months ago when one of the \nSenators stood up and said: This amendment should be subject to the \nnormal 60-vote requirement, and my head snapped back because there is \nno such thing as a normal 60-vote requirement. For 200 years, we did \nnot function with a normal 60-vote requirement. That has become a \nrather new innovation. I am not going to talk about the filibuster or \nthe 60-vote requirement, but the idea that this Senator asserted it was \nnormal indicates a change in attitude about the way this place \nfunctions.\n  Another example is that, to my knowledge, the conference committees \nthat are going on now on the budget and on the farm bill, I believe, \nare the first two conference committees convened in this entire year. I \nworked here as a staff member 40 years ago and remember going to \nconference committees rather frequently--walking through the Capitol \nwith my boss and going to the meetings and seeing the Senators and the \nCongressmen sit down and argue and disagree and agree and compromise \nand reach settlements on legislation on a fairly regular basis.\n  It is cause for celebration. It took a government shutdown, in \neffect, to produce a simple conference committee. Statistically, I am \ntold this is the least productive Congress in American history thus \nfar--no budget in 4 years. A budget is the basic function of any \ngovernment. I understand there has been 1 appropriations bill out of 48\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nin the last several years. The result has been a complete and total \nloss of confidence from the public.\n  That has significance. That is important because in our economy \nconfidence is the mainspring. This is not an academic concern. I am not \ngiving a lecture about civics. The lack of functionality of this \ninstitution is damaging the country. For example, we know from studies \nthat just the shutdown cost our economy $24 billion, for no purpose \nthat I could discern. But there is an untold broader cost.\n  The reality is that two-thirds of the American economy is driven by \nconsumer spending. Consumer spending is driven by confidence, by the \nmillions of individual decisions that people make in their daily lives, \nbased on how they feel about their future, how they feel about their \ncountry, how they feel about their personal situation.\n  Part of that is whether they feel they have representatives in \nWashington who are representing their interests and, in fact, are \ncapable of serving the needs of the country. Ironically, this lack of \nconfidence that is generated by events such as the shutdown harms the \neconomy and therefore makes the deficit worse. The very best way to \nsolve the deficit problem is not necessarily taxes or cuts, it is \ngrowth in the economy. If the economy grows, the deficit shrinks. That \nwas part of what happened in the late nineties, the last time we had a \nbudget surplus, because the economy was roaring along.\n  It is also about national security. I was provoked to come to the \nfloor by reading a speech made recently by Robert Gates, one of our \nmost distinguished public servants, the former Secretary of Defense. He \ntalked about the defense posture of the country and the national \nsecurity situation. Here is what he said toward the end of his speech:\n\n       Let me close with a word about what I now regard to be the \n     biggest threat to national security--\n\n  The biggest threat to U.S. national security.\n\n     the political dysfunction within the two square miles of \n     Washington, D.C. encompassing the White House and Capitol \n     Hill.\n\n  Those are strong words. He is not talking about Al Qaeda. He is not \ntalking about a resurgent China. He is not talking about a world threat \nof terrorism. He is talking about us as the greatest threat to U.S. \nnational security. He went on to say:\n\n       American politics has always been shrill and ugly business \n     going back to the Founding Fathers. But as a result of \n     several polarizing trends we now have lost the ability to \n     execute even the basic functions of government, much less \n     solve the most difficult and divisive problems facing this \n     country.\n\n  Basic functions of government: passing a budget, operating the \ngovernment itself, paying our bills--the basic functions of government. \nSecretary Gates said:\n\n       Looking ahead, it is unrealistic to expect partisanship to \n     disappear or even dissipate. But when push comes to shove, \n     when the future of our country is at stake, ideological zeal \n     and short-term political calculation on the part of both \n     Republicans and Democrats must yield to patriotism and the \n     long-term national interest.\n\n  This lack of functionality, this chaos, if you will, also affects us \ninternationally. Tom Friedman, this weekend, had a column. I thought \nthe title was rather provocative. It was, ``Calling America: Hello? \nHello? Hello?''\n  ``Few Americans,'' Friedman says, ``are aware of how much America has \nlost in this recent episode of bringing the American economy to the \nedge of a cliff. . . . ''\n  People always looked up to America. He quotes a citizen of Singapore.\n\n       People always looked up to America as the best-run country, \n     the most reasonable, the most sensible. And now people are \n     asking: ``Can America manage itself and what are the \n     implications. . . . '' [for the rest of the world]?\n\n  Our Constitution has always been based upon two somewhat competing \nprinciples in tension with each other. One is the fundamental purpose \nof the Constitution, which is to create an effective government. The \nConstitution was not what ran this country immediately after the \nAmerican Revolution. We experimented with something called the Articles \nof Confederation. It did not work. The chaos and the economic problems \nof that period is what led the Framers to draft the Constitution in \nthat blessed summer of 1787.\n  But the one principle in the Constitution is right in the preamble: \nTo form a more perfect Union, to establish justice, to provide for the \ncommon defense, to ensure domestic tranquility and promote the general \nwelfare. That is government.\n  At the same time, the Framers were concerned about the ancient \nquestion of who will guard the guardians; how do we control the \ngovernment we just created in order to protect ourselves from its own \nabuse?\n  They built this elaborate system of checks and balances. They had \nnever heard of Rube Goldberg in 1787. But if they had, that is what \nthey did. They created an elaborate, cumbersome, slow system. They \nwanted it to be that way in order to curb the excesses of the \ngovernment they had created. They wanted it to be slow and cumbersome. \nThey succeeded beyond their wildest imagination.\n  Those two principles, governing and checks and balances, as I say, \nare in tension in the Constitution. The problem is, we seem to have \nreached a moment in time where the governing part has been taken away \nand all we have left are checks and balances. We have a system that is \nridiculously easy to monkey wrench if you do not have the basic \ncommitment to governing. That is the problem we face today.\n  So what do we do? We have to do something. That brings me back to \nwhere I began at the budget conference. This budget conference is very \nimportant. This is not one of many conferences that are going on. This \nis a--I do not want to say a last chance, but it is one of our last \nchances to show the American people we can govern. It is almost less \nimportant what is in the deal than that there be a deal, that the \nparties show they can come together, that they can solve a problem.\n\n  Just the fact of the headline, ``Congress passes a budget which the \nPresident signs'' would electrify the country. It would be the most \npositive thing we could possibly do for the economy. By the same token, \na headline that says, ``Congress once more fails to act'' will be one \nmore weight on the future of the country, one more stone in the pile of \nevidence that we can no longer function; that this system which has \nserved us so well for so long can no longer serve us as it must.\n  What do we do to get there? As I say, we do something. I hope and \npray and urge and support the chair of the Budget Committee, the House \nchair of the Budget Committee, the members of that conference to try to \nfind solutions that will not make everybody happy, by definition, but \nat least will show we are able to do the most basic function of \ngovernment.\n  How do we get there? We listen. We have a company in Maine that has a \nsign on the wall that I think we ought to put in this room. It says: \nAll of us are always smarter than any of us. The wisdom of the group--\nthere is tremendous experience and wisdom in this institution if we can \nbring that to bear, but it does not work if people are not listening. \nIf people say: I know the answer, I have all the results, I do not need \nto listen, I do not have anything to learn, we will never get there if \nthat is the idea.\n  When people say to you: I am not going to compromise, what they are \nsaying is: I have all the answers. I am entirely right.\n  I have never known anyone that was entirely right. So we need to \nlisten. Yes, we need to compromise. We need to remind ourselves of the \npretty simple oath we take. The oath that we take when we come into \nthis place is to the Constitution of the United States. It is not to a \npolitical party. It is not to an ideology. It is not to a particular \nissue, no matter how precious to us or our constituents, it is an oath \nto the Constitution of the United States.\n  I hope and pray that if we can hold to that and remind ourselves why \nwe are here and the heavy weight of responsibility that we bear, we can \nfind solutions, we can solve problems, we can begin to rebuild the \ntrust the American people want to have in their government, if we can \nonly prove ourselves worthy of it. It is a heavy responsibility. It is \none, I believe, we can meet and do so with honor and good faith to that \noath we all took.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I see the Senator from the Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts is on the floor. I would inquire, through the Chair, \nhow long she is seeking to speak. We were about to proceed to the \nconsideration of the amendment that has been filed by Senator Portman \nand cosponsored by Senator Ayotte, Senator Heller, and Senator McCain.\n  This is a rather complicated parliamentary situation. Then there is \ngoing to be a debate. If the Senator from Massachusetts is going to \nspeak very briefly, I would withhold. If she is going to speak at \nlength, then since we have Members on their way, I would proceed.\n  Ms. WARREN. I would tell the senior Senator from Maine, my plan had \nbeen to speak for less than 10 minutes. But if that does not work, I \ncertainly will yield to the Senator from Maine and do what she \nrequests.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Massachusetts be permitted to speak for no longer than 10 \nminutes. If she were a little shorter than that, it would make me very \nhappy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ENDA\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Maine. \nI will do my very best.\n  I rise to speak about the importance of passing the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, a bill I am proud to cosponsor and to support. It \nhas taken us far too long to arrive at this day. For nearly 40 years, \nMembers of Congress have worked to pass legislation that would protect \nLGBT Americans from discrimination in the workplace.\n  Much has changed since Bella Abzug introduced the Equality Act of \n1974. Equal marriage is now the law in 14 States--21 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have enacted laws to protect against employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. Sixteen States and the \nDistrict of Columbia also protect against gender identity \ndiscrimination.\n  The Supreme Court has rejected DOMA, a law that legalized \ndiscrimination against same-sex spouses by calling that law exactly \nwhat it was: unconstitutional. In the private sector, a majority of \nFortune 500 companies have adopted policies to protect workers from \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Polling \ndata shows that a majority of small businesses have similar policies in \nplace.\n  By nearly every measure, we have made progress in a long march toward \nequality. Yet in the face of all of this progress, nearly one-half \ncentury since Congress first enacted title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nprohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, \nsex, and national origin, we still have not extended these basic \nFederal protections to LGBT Americans.\n  The failure to treat all our citizens with the same dignity is \nshameful. In America, equal means equal.\n  Many have tried hard to reach this day, and our legislators from \nMassachusetts have long been leaders in this fight. Senator Ted Kennedy \nand Congressman Barney Frank both spent decades working on this issue. \nSenator Paul Tsongas from Massachusetts introduced the first Senate \nbill to prohibit employment discrimination against LGBT Americans all \nthe way back in 1979.\n  Progress has been slow. The last time the full Senate voted on ENDA \nwas 1 year ago, when a version of the law championed by Senator Kennedy \nfailed to pass by one single vote, 49-50, back in 1996. In 2007, the \nHouse passed a version of ENDA introduced by Congressman Frank, but the \nbill made no progress in the Senate. Today, there are 55 cosponsors of \nENDA in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, representing the broad \nmajority of support for the bill and signaling the tremendous progress \nthat has been made.\n  It is all the more shameful that it has taken us this long to arrive \nat this day because Americans believe in equality. According to one \nsurvey, some 80 percent of Americans believe it is already illegal to \ndiscriminate against workers based on their sexual orientation, gender, \nor identity. Unfortunately, however, this is one rare instance where \nthe American people are giving Congress way too much credit, because \nthe truth is we haven't acted yet. The consequences of congressional \ninaction remain all too real for millions of LGBT Americans.\n  Despite the successful efforts in many States to pass \nnondiscrimination measures, Americans living in over half the country \ncan still be discriminated against in the workplace based on sexual \norientation or gender identity. It happens. Between 15 and 43 percent \nof LGBT individuals have reported experiencing discrimination or \nharassment in the workplace. A quarter of transgender Americans have \nreported being fired from a job due to their gender identity, and a \nwhopping 90 percent have reported experiencing harassment and \nmistreatment. There has been a lot of progress toward a more inclusive \nnation, but for LGBT workers a law to stop employment discrimination \ncan't come fast enough.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act pending in the Senate will \nprotect LGBT individuals in the workplace, update the law to reflect \nwhat the vast majority of Americans already believe to be the law, and \nhelp fulfill our constitutional responsibility to protect equality in \nour Nation. ENDA doesn't provide any special rights to any particular \ngroup of Americans. It does not compel any religious organization to \nchange its views. It just creates a level playing field for LGBT \nworkers. It makes sure all workers are judged by the work they do, not \nby who they are or who they love.\n  America is ready for this day. An overwhelming majority of voters, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, support the enactment of this law. They \nknow it reflects the values of our Nation.\n  America's businesses are ready too. Recent polling shows that a large \nmajority of small businesses support the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct. As for big businesses, 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have \nalready implemented policies prohibiting discrimination against gays \nand lesbians in the workplace.\n  Raytheon, one of the Nation's top defense contractors and a proud \nMassachusetts-based company, bars LGBT discrimination. One executive at \nRaytheon is quoted as saying the organization's ``culture of inclusion \nabsolutely gives us a recruiting edge'' when it comes to hiring the \nbest and the brightest.\n  Shortly before his death in March 2009, Senator Kennedy joined with \nSenators Merkley, Collins, and Snowe in what would be his final attempt \nto push this bipartisan legislation over the finish line. At the time \nSenator Kennedy eloquently explained his continuing support for ENDA by \nnoting that ``the promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as \njustice is denied to even one among us.''\n  Those words were true in 1974 when Bella Abzug introduced the \nEquality Act. Those words were true when the Senate came within one \nvote of passing ENDA in 1996, those words were true when Senator \nKennedy offered them in 2009, and those words are true today. The \npromise of America will never be fulfilled so long as justice is denied \nto even one among us.\n  We deal with a lot of different kinds of legislation in the Senate. \nThis week we have a chance to vote on a law that is a measure of who we \nare as a people and what kind of a world we want to build. I believe in \na world where equal means equal, and that is why I will be voting to \noutlaw employment discrimination against my neighbors and my friends.\n  Senator Kennedy, Senator Tsongas, and Congresswoman Abzug are no \nlonger with us, but, as so many others, they fought hard to get us \nhere--to get us one step closer to equality for all of us. It has taken \nus far too long to arrive at this day, but we are here now, and we are \nnot going back.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for giving me this time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7846-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2013\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, S. 815 is pending, and amendment No. 2013 \nis withdrawn.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2012) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2013\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I call up Reid amendment No. 2020.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2020 to amendment numbered \n     2013.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       This Act shall become effective 1 day after enactment.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Reid \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Antiretaliation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that an amendment was \nnegotiated to clarify the exemption provided to religious organizations \nin this legislation. This is Senate amendment No. 2012.\n  I understand that the intent of the antiretaliation provision in the \nlegislation is to strike a balance between providing important \nprotections for religious organizations because of their exemption \nunder section 6(a) of pending legislation and to ensure that this \nprovision does not undermine in any way current or future Federal, \nState, or local civil rights protections, such as those protections \nafforded under the laws of my home State of Vermont.\n  The language of the antiretaliation provision states clearly that \nnothing in the provision can be construed ``to invalidate any other \nfederal, state, or local law or regulation that otherwise applies to an \nemployer'' that is found exempt under section 6(a) of ENDA. As I \nunderstand it, this means that an exemption for a religious \norganization under ENDA does not equate to exemption from compliance \nwith any other Federal, State, or local civil rights requirements.\n  In addition, this provision bars retaliation against a religious \norganization on the sole basis that the organization is exempt under \nENDA. Application of Federal, State, or local civil rights protections \nto a religious organization exempt under Section 6(a) of ENDA may only \nbe considered retaliation under Section 6(b) if the religious \norganization demonstrates that the application--through monitoring, \nenforcement or other means--is solely due to the religious \norganization's exempt status under ENDA.\n  Based on this understanding, I would like to ask Chairman Harkin if \nanything in that amendment would modify the important nondiscrimination \nprovision in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act that this \nCongress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support earlier this year.\n  That provision was a critical component of the reauthorization, and I \nwant to make sure that nothing here overrides what is currently the law \nof the land. I also want to make sure that States like Vermont can \nstill enforce their own nondiscrimination laws for violations within \ntheir jurisdiction, regardless of whether an entity is exempt under the \nnational ENDA legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his question. He is correct, \nnothing in this amendment would modify the nondiscrimination provision \nthat was included in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. \nWhat this amendment does is say that you cannot retaliate against an \norganization for discrimination in its hiring, firing, compensation, or \nother terms or conditions of employment if you are an organization that \nqualifies for the exemption under section 702(a) of title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act. ENDA's religious exemption does not create new \ngrounds for liability or penalty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7846-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7846-S7864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 3204.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. That was an extremely complicated parliamentary request. \nPerhaps it would be helpful to my colleagues if I gave a little bit of \nexplanation of what occurred.\n  The good news, in my judgment, is that the Senate has adopted by \nvoice vote an amendment proposed by Senators Portman, Ayotte, Heller, \nHatch, and McCain. I very much appreciate their willingness to work \nwith the cosponsors and sponsors of this legislation.\n  Many of the sponsors of this amendment are tied up in hearings, but I \nexpect them to be coming to the floor very shortly to debate this \namendment after the fact.\n  I wish to explain about what the Portman, Ayotte, Heller, Hatch, and \nMcCain amendment does. The underlying bill, ENDA, includes a pretty \nbroad exemption for religious organizations based on current law in \ntitle VII. What the Portman, et al., amendment does is it ensures that \nFederal, State and local government agencies will not be able to \ndiscriminate against these exempt organizations. For example, the \namendment would ensure that exempt religious organizations cannot be \ndenied grants or contracts for which they would otherwise qualify from \ngovernment agencies. It also protects them from discrimination by \ngovernment agencies from participating in government-sponsored \nactivities.\n\n  I believe this amendment improves the bill. It ensures these \norganizations--these religious-based organizations that are exempt \nunder ENDA--cannot be suddenly penalized for having that exemption by \nbeing denied grants, contracts, other licenses, fees, or whatever, that \nthey would otherwise be entitled to just solely based on the fact they \nare exempt under ENDA.\n  I want to commend Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, Senator Heller, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator McCain for making sure these important \nprotections are in place, and that if an organization has a legitimate \nexemption under this bill, the Federal Government or State government \ncannot discriminate against that organization that is legitimately \nclaiming an exemption under ENDA.\n  I believe this amendment improves the bill and provides a significant \nprotection for exempt religious organizations, and I am very pleased it \nwas accepted by a voice vote.\n  I know Senator Portman and Senator Ayotte are on their way and want \nto speak on the amendment we just adopted.\n  Let me explain the second part of the very complicated parliamentary \naction we just took. At least I will attempt to.\n  What we have done is to preserve Senator Toomey's right to get a vote \non his amendment. It is my understanding that vote will require 60 \nvotes of the Senate in order to be approved, but it essentially \nguarantees he is next up. He is next in line for a vote. So his \namendment will be the pending amendment.\n  Again, I know this was a complicated process, and I want to thank the \nChair who was presiding over the Senate, as well as the floor staff on \nboth sides of the aisle, Senator Reid's staff and Senator McConnell's \nstaff, in making sure\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nwe protected everybody's rights in this debate. I think that is very \nimportant when we are talking about a bill as significant as ENDA.\n  Madam President, as I said, I know some of the sponsors are on their \nway. But since they have yet to reach the floor, rather than filibuster \nthe successful conclusion of the Portman amendment, I will suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, first of all, I want to thank my \ncolleagues, and I will start by thanking my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, for the important work she \nhas been doing on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. I also want to \nthank my colleagues for supporting an amendment that was brought \nforward recently and passed by this body, the Portman-Ayotte-Heller-\nHatch-McCain amendment, to strengthen the protections within the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act for religious institutions.\n  I firmly believe people should be judged based upon the quality of \ntheir work. Discrimination has no place in the workplace. In my home \nState of New Hampshire, we have a long bipartisan tradition of working \nto advance commonsense policies, and New Hampshire already has in place \na State law preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation. I \nappreciate that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is legislation \nthat is important in terms of who we are, our values, and making sure \npeople are only judged based on the quality of their work in the \nworkplace. I also appreciate the legislation on the floor right now \nincludes important protections for religious institutions.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of the rights of conscience, of \nthe rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution to religious \nfreedom, and so these protections are very important within this bill. \nI was pleased to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to \nstrengthen those protections by passing an amendment that will help \nensure religious organizations cannot be retaliated against for \nexercising their religious freedoms.\n  Specifically, the Portman-Ayotte amendment affirms the critical \nimportance of protecting religious freedom in the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. It ensures that government cannot penalize a \nreligious employer because it qualifies as exempt from \nnondiscrimination requirements of the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct. The amendment protects religious institutions from adverse actions \nby the government on the basis of adhering to their religious tenets.\n  In practical terms, the government may not use activities protected \nby the religious exemption as a basis to deny a religious employer a \ngovernment grant or tax-exempt status or any other benefit that may be \nconferred by the government.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for passing this amendment which will \nstrengthen the protections for religious institutions within the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, and I thank the Chair for the \nopportunity to speak today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I again want to commend the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, for her excellent work on this \namendment. As I indicated earlier, I think the Portman-Ayotte \namendment, which is cosponsored by several other colleagues as well, \nprovides a very important protection against retaliation for those \nreligious organizations that are legitimately exempted under ENDA.\n  I also salute them for broadening the purposes section of the bill to \nrecognize not only the need to address a widespread pattern of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but also they have \nadded a new subsection to recognize that another purpose is to help \nstrengthen civil society and preserve institutional pluralism by \nproviding reasonable accommodations for religious freedom. I think both \nof those changes strengthen the bill, and I wish to commend the Senator \nfor her leadership on this issue.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I have come to the floor to give my \nviews on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act--better known as ENDA--\nbecause this is essentially a bill with a long history. It means a \ngreat deal to me personally because of the work I did in the city and \ncounty of San Francisco a long time ago.\n  Actually, nearly 40 years ago, in 1978, I was in my third term as \npresident of the board of supervisors when an ordinance to prohibit \ndiscrimination in both housing and employment on the basis of sexual \norientation was actually passed by the board. I think it was a vote of \n10 to 1. I introduced the legislation in my first few years as \npresident of the board, and it was the first such legislation \nintroduced in a major city anywhere in the United States. It was \ndifficult to pass. There was a long debate. I look back on the press \nand it was a 2-hour debate, but it did pass back in 1978.\n  It is true that I at the time had some concerns. So I have watched \nthe legislation implemented over the last four decades. It has \nprotected people's jobs and livelihoods from unfair treatment. It has \nbeen good for people and for business. I had some concerns. Would there \nbe a lot of objections?\n  Actually, in the time I was a supervisor and in the 9 years I was \nmayor, there were no objections. All of a sudden the city really came \nto see what equality meant. I knew then, and I know now, this \nlegislation is the right thing to do, and it is not going to result in \ninappropriate behavior in the workplace or any of the other hobgoblins \nthat the legislation's opponents raise.\n  In 1996, ENDA came to this floor. An up-or-down vote on this bill was \nnegotiated the same day the Defense of Marriage Act--or what we call \nDOMA--would have such a vote. These votes happened on September 10, \n1996. The defense of marriage bill passed. I was one of 14 Senators to \noppose it, 85 of my colleagues supported it, and President Clinton \nsigned it into law. As we all know now, what it essentially did was say \nthat any gay couple that was legally married could not access more than \n1,100 Federal rights that were accorded to married couples. Now some 14 \nStates have legalized gay marriage, and just recently it looks like \nIllinois is on its way to doing the same.\n  ENDA failed by a single vote back then. That was a vote of 49 to 50. \nToday things are very different, but there is still a long way to go. \nIn an historic decision in June, the Supreme Court struck down the core \npiece of the Defense of Marriage Act. But DOMA is not yet fully \nrepealed, and repealing it remains necessary. So, in my view, the \nDefense of Marriage Act must and will be one day repealed once and for \nall. Although such legislation as ENDA has been adopted in numerous \nStates, there is still no Federal end to discrimination. That means \nthat most gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals are without \ncritical protections against employment discrimination. In fact, most \npeople, over 56 percent of the population, live in the 29 States that \nhave not enacted employment protections for gays and lesbians. Over 66 \npercent of people live in the 34 States that have not enacted such \nprotections for transgender individuals.\n\n  There is no question, discrimination in the workplace against these \ngroups remains a big problem. Let me give just a few examples. There is \nthe case of Mia Macy, a case in which the Justice Department found that \nMs. Macy's transgender status played an impermissible role in the \nhiring process. She had, for 12 years, been a police detective in \nPhoenix, AZ. She was a veteran. She applied for an open position in an \nATF ballistics lab to do ballistics imagery work that she was certified \nto do. She was told she could have the position, subject to a \nbackground check.\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\n  Then Macy revealed her transgender status to the government \ncontractor staffing these positions. Her background check was ordered \nstopped by ATF soon thereafter. She received an email stating the \nposition was no longer available because of funding cuts, even though \nthere was no evidence that was the case.\n  It turns out that the number of positions available had hastily been \ncut from two to one, and the person hired for that one position lacked \nmuch of the experience Macy had.\n  Macy was, according to DOJ's decision, ``very likely better \nqualified'' than the individual actually hired for that position. So \nthis is wrong. Ballistics matching can be the difference between a \nshooter in jail and a shooter, who might kill again, walking the \nstreets of our neighborhoods. The person who was actually hired should \nbe the person who can do the best job, period, regardless of whether \nthe person is gay, straight, or transgender.\n  Another case involves a police officer from the city of St. Cloud, \nMN. According to a court opinion, the officer was an ``excellent'' \nofficer. He was consistently awarded marks as ``excellent'' or \n``competent'' on his performance reports. The officer got ``letters of \nrecognition and commendation for his accomplishments, including his \nwork on the Community Crime Impact Team, his work against drunk \ndriving, his performance in apprehending a sexual assault suspect, and \nfor his work in recovering a stolen vehicle.''\n  Then he came out as gay. After that, according to the officer, he \nalmost immediately ``was subject to increased scrutiny, increased \ndisciplinary measures, excessively thorough documentation and \nsurreptitiously recorded interventions'' as well as ``multiple internal \ninvestigations'' and removal from assignments.\n  The Federal court found that ``the almost immediate shift'' in the \ntreatment of this officer ``supports an inference of unlawful \ndiscrimination'' under the equal protection clause of the Constitution, \nwhich applies to State and local agencies. But if a private employer \nhad discriminated like this, there likely would have been no Federal \nprotection.\n  In a case out of Oregon, an individual who ran a production line for \nbattery separators was subjected to harassment on the job. He was \ncalled ``Tinker-bell'' and ``a worthless queer.'' He was described \nusing other phrases that I simply will not say on the Senate floor \nbecause they are graphic and beyond the pale. I think they would shock \nmany of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This harassment \noccurred on a daily basis, sometimes in the presence of a supervisor. \nThen, 2 days after reporting the harassment to human resources, the \nindividual was fired. In this case, the Federal court found the \nevidence credible enough to warrant a trial under Oregon law.\n  Sometimes discrimination is not as clear as it is in these cases. I \nam going to quote from a 93-year-old constituent of mine who called my \noffice urging full support for this bill. This is what he said:\n\n       I don't usually take the time to call my Senator but this \n     is important to me. I've lived in San Francisco almost my \n     whole life, and at 93 years old I have seen a lot. Even in a \n     liberal State like California, as a gay man I never felt \n     equal to my colleagues.\n\n  This is a quote.\n\n       I used to work at a bank, and I kept working until I was \n     79, to earn my retirement. I was afraid to bring my husband \n     to company parties, and I never wanted to seem too flamboyant \n     to my supervisors. It seems so ridiculous when I think back \n     on it, but people don't understand that this kind of \n     discrimination is subtle.\n       It broke my heart when I watched the Senate fall one vote \n     shy of passing ENDA back in the nineties. I hope the Senator \n     remembers what it used to be like, and fights to pass ENDA \n     today.\n\n  I do remember, and I do know that this bill will help stop \ndiscrimination in the workplace. The bill is simple. It says a person \ncannot be denied employment because of who that person is: Gay, \nstraight or transgender. The bill provides no special privilege--no \nspecial privilege. It creates no quota. It creates no exemption from \nthe codes of conduct or anything else. It does not allow inappropriate \nconduct in the workplace. In fact, the bill is narrower than title VII \nprotections in certain respects. In my view, the bill does provide \ncritical employment protections, and it is long past the time that it \nbe signed into law.\n  Three years ago we recognized that a person's merit, not sexual \norientation, is what matters for service in the military. The point is \nno different in this bill. If a person wants to be a ballistics expert, \na police officer, a firefighter, a bank teller, a lawyer, a factory \nworker or anything else, the question should simply be, can the person \ndo the job.\n  People have families, they have spouses, and they have children. They \nneed to put food on the table. They have college expenses for their \nchildren, student loans to pay, and unforeseen medical expenses. They \nmay have elderly parents that they care for and who need their \nassistance. All of this requires a job.\n  Should a person be denied that basic aspect of life, should a \nperson's spouse or children or parents be hurt, simply because that \nperson is gay or straight or transgender? For me the answer is simple; \nit is no.\n  That person should not engage in any conduct that would be unseemly \nfor one of a heterosexual couple. The conduct rules are also important. \nIf this legislation is enacted, which I hope very much will happen, \nthat will be the law of the land, and it will be long overdue.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and indicate some of the past and go \nback to 35 years ago when the first employment bill that would prohibit \ndiscrimination of this type was enacted. I am very proud to have \nintroduced it, and to have been a vote for it on the board of \nsupervisors in San Francisco.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support earlier today of an amendment that I offered \nstrengthening the protections for religious liberty in the ENDA \nlegislation, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This amendment was \ncosponsored by Senators Ayotte, Heller, Hatch, and McCain. I thank \nSenator Collins for the key role she played in its passage.\n  I firmly believe that no one should be subject to unjust \ndiscrimination, so I support the basic premise of ENDA, which is that \npeople should be judged by their experience, their qualifications, and \ntheir job performance, not by their sexual orientation. The bottom line \nis people should not be able to be fired just because they are gay.\n  I believe the legislation currently before this body will help create \nthat level playing field and ensure employment opportunities for all. \nBut it does not mean it is a perfect bill. It should be improved and my \namendment seeks to ensure that this legislation, designed to promote \ntolerance of one kind, doesn't enshrine intolerance of another kind.\n  Religious liberty is an important part of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act already. The underlying bill includes a significant \nexemption for religious employers. But we have to be certain that in \npursuit of enforcing nondiscrimination, those religious employers are \nnot subject to a different kind of discrimination that would be \ngovernment retaliation. My amendment seeks to ensure the government \ncannot penalize a religious employer because it qualifies as exempt \nfrom the nondiscrimination requirements of ENDA. It protects a church \nor religious charity or religious school from adverse action by the \ngovernment on the basis of adhering to its religious tenets, in a \nmanner that would otherwise be unlawful under ENDA. In practical terms, \nthis means the government cannot use activities protected by ENDA's \nreligious exemption as a basis to deny religious employers government \ngrants, contracts, their tax-exempt status, or other benefit.\n  My amendment prohibits the government from punishing a religious \ninstitution for adhering to its deeply held beliefs and thereby seeks \nto keep the State from intervening in matters of faith.\n  It does something else important too. The underlying bill specifies \ncertain broad purposes related to addressing employment discrimination. \nMy amendment adds to this introductory section an explicit reference to \nthe fundamental right of religious freedom. It establishes as a basic \npurpose of ENDA that workplace fairness must be balanced against and \nmade consistent with religious liberty. I believe the\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nprinciples of religious liberty and nondiscrimination go hand-in-hand. \nWhen we think about nondiscrimination, many of us think about the great \ncivil rights movements of the 20th century, but as we know the fight \nfor tolerance goes back further than that, really to the very \nfoundation of our Republic.\n  On my mom's side, some of my ancestors were Quakers. They came to \nthis country as so many before them in search of religious freedom. At \nfirst that was something hard to find in this country. When they \narrived, members of this new sect were often persecuted. Their views \nand practices were judged to be unorthodox, even strange. Sometimes \nthey were imprisoned. Their books were burned. Some of the colonies did \nnot want them inside their borders.\n  They knew a little bit about religious freedom, and they certainly \nknew something about discrimination. It was their experience and the \nexperience of so many other groups of different faiths that made \nfreedom of conscience a cornerstone of our founding documents. The \nFirst Amendment begins, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''\n  Religious freedom, therefore, is our first freedom and the amendment \nthat protects it is really our first nondiscrimination law. Any law we \npass which seeks to prevent discrimination will not succeed if it does \nnot at the same time protect religious liberty.\n  The religious liberty protections in ENDA are not perfect. My \namendment makes them better, and that is why I appreciate my colleagues \ngiving this amendment the support it deserves.\n  I am looking forward to the passage of this legislation with this \namendment and, again, I appreciate the work of the Senator from Maine \nand others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to commend the Senator from Ohio \nfor bringing forth this very worthwhile initiative, which the Senate \npassed without dissent just about an hour or so ago. His amendment is a \nvery important amendment. What it simply says is that if an \norganization is exempt from ENDA for religious reasons, then government \ncannot turn around and somehow retaliate against this employer based on \nhis claiming or her claiming a legitimate religious exemption as \nprovided by ENDA. That means that if the business or organization is \nentitled to compete for certain grants or contracts from the Federal, \nState or local government, that there cannot be this subtle \ndiscrimination against the employer for claiming the religious \nexemption, legitimately conferred, upon the business under ENDA.\n  I think that is really important. We do not want retaliation or \ndiscrimination or unfair treatment on either side. I commend Senator \nPortman for coming forward with this amendment. I believe that it is \nconsistent with the bill and that it strengthens the bill.\n  I congratulate him for his initiative. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith him, Senator Ayotte, and other Members of the Senate in support of \nthis initiative.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise to talk about the impact \nObamaCare is having on the people of my State, the State of New \nHampshire. It has been over 1 month since the health care exchanges \nopened, and in that short time we have already seen so many problems \nwith ObamaCare. Frankly, it is a mess.\n  The failure of healthcare.gov is a travesty that has revealed deeply \ntroubling incompetence in terms of implementing a Web site that people \ncan use and have access to and is secure and protects their private \ninformation. Frankly, we are in a position where the Web site is merely \nthe canary in the coal mine. The flaws in this law are much deeper than \nthe Web site.\n  Even former supporters of ObamaCare are telling me it is not working. \nI am hearing from my constituents about this, and frankly I feel very \nbadly for them because so much of what is happening to them is as a \nresult of how the law was drafted years ago.\n  For example, I heard from Maryanne in Lisbon, NH. She said:\n\n       We hope this would be a solution. But instead it will be \n     more of a financial drain.\n\n  The American people are the ones who are paying the price right now. \nThey are getting cancellation notices, seeing their premiums go up, and \nlosing their doctors.\n  Workers are suffering. Many of them have seen their hours cut to 29 \nhours because of an arbitrary mandate defining full-time workers as \nthose who work 30 hours a week. Others are fearful they will lose their \nemployer-sponsored coverage altogether. Business owners remain \nreluctant to expand--worried they will trigger the looming penalties \nfrom ObamaCare.\n  Most tragically, we now know that the law was sold to the American \npeople under false pretenses. The President said: ``If you like your \ninsurance plan, you will keep it.''\n  In fact, yesterday we checked the Web site and that claim is still on \nthere. I am hearing every day from New Hampshire residents who are \ntelling me they are seeing their health insurance policies canceled. In \nfact, in the newspaper this morning there was a headline in New \nHampshire that announced that about 22,000 individuals will see \ncoverage canceled at the end of the year.\n  Granite Staters have been writing to me. I wish to share their \nconcerns with the entire country because I know this is not just \nhappening to people in New Hampshire, but these are the real people who \nare being affected by ObamaCare.\n  Lynn in Greenland wrote:\n\n       The President was wrong. I can't keep my coverage if I like \n     it and I can't keep my preferred hospital and his plans are \n     the ones that are subpar . . . it's bringing me to tears on a \n     daily basis. Please help.\n\n  Edward in Marlow is self-employed. I feel so badly when I receive \nletters such as this. He has a rare disease and a high-deductible plan. \nHe wrote:\n\n       I received a notice from Anthem last week that they will be \n     canceling this policy. Is this what President Obama meant \n     when he said no one who currently has their own policy and \n     likes it will lose it. . . . I am devastated that I will now \n     have to go out and secure another policy somewhere which \n     could cost me significantly more.\n\n  Jennifer in Canaan wrote:\n\n       I received a letter from Anthem Blue Cross stating that my \n     current health insurance plan was being discontinued because \n     it did not conform to the law under the Affordable Care Act. \n     In other words, the plan I was promised I could keep was made \n     illegal by Washington politicians.\n\n  Michael in Atkinson said:\n\n       Kelly, we have been told this would expand options. The \n     fact is we are now being told what we can and what we cannot \n     do and where we can go. To say that I am upset would not \n     begin to describe how I feel.\n\n  Richard in Alton Bay said:\n\n       I am a small business owner in New Hampshire and have been \n     with my health insurance provider for over 10 years. I was \n     recently informed that the policy I have had for all of these \n     years (and I like quite a bit) will be canceled due to the \n     provisions in Obamacare. When I contacted the company, they \n     said they are planning to transition me into a plan that \n     costs more and offers substantially less benefits and \n     protection than my original plan. . . . I am outraged at \n     this. . . .\n\n  Jamie in Littleton wrote:\n\n       Today we received a letter from Anthem Blue Cross stating \n     my husband's individual health care plan, which he's had for \n     15 years, will be changing to conform to ACA laws and will no \n     longer be in effect come September 1, 2014.\n\n  Louis in Sunapee wrote:\n\n       What just happened? I received a cancellation notice from \n     my insurance company . . . and the coverage I am eligible for \n     is MORE expensive? Help me!\n\n  President Obama has made the promise that ``if you like your doctor, \nyou will be able to keep your doctor, period.''\n  For those who are seeing their plans canceled, we know that is simply \nnot the case. There is another issue that New Hampshire is facing, and \nthat is a matter of choice in keeping not only the doctor you want to \nkeep but also going to the hospital you want to go to. In New \nHampshire, there is only one insurer who is going to participate on the \nexchanges at this point, and to keep costs down, the insurer has \ndecided to limit its network, so 10 of our 26 acute care hospitals are \nnot part of the exchange and are excluded.\n  For example, the capital of New Hampshire is Concord. One of the \nhospitals that has been excluded is Concord Hospital. I worked in \nConcord for years. Concord Hospital is going to be excluded. All the \npeople in that area\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nwho rely on that hospital and had their children and treatments there \nwill now be excluded if they are on the exchanges. This is a real \nimpact on people's lives, and I feel very badly for my constituents.\n  A doctor in Peterborough said he was once a supporter of ObamaCare. \nHe described the consequences simply. In a letter to me he said his \npatients have one of three terrible options now, and that is because \nthe hospital in his area has been excluded from the exchange.\n\n  First, they can switch doctors and drive a considerable distance to a \nhospital that Anthem does include in the exchange; two, they can \npurchase insurance outside of the exchange at considerably higher rates \nthan they could this year; or, three, they can stick with their current \ndoctor, risk having no insurance and pay the government a penalty for \nbeing uninsured.\n  With the hospital he is associated with excluded from the exchange, \nhe said, it is the ``Less Affordable Care Act'' for his patients. This \ndoctor gave me a troubling practical effect of what his hospital being \nleft out would mean for his patients.\n  He used this example:\n\n       Consider the pregnant woman who has delivered all of her \n     current children at our hospital. She is now expecting in \n     February. She must now either drive our twisty New England \n     roads, in the dead of Winter, to a hospital 55 minutes from \n     her home to deliver her baby, or pay considerably higher \n     insurance premiums to stay where she is comfortable and safe.\n\n  He is one of numerous citizens across New Hampshire who has expressed \nsimilar concerns about local hospitals being excluded from the \nexchange. I wish to share some of the other concerns that have been \nwritten from my constituents.\n  Vicki in Seabrook wrote:\n\n       The list of doctors and medical facilities that will take \n     my insurance is limited and my Massachusetts doctors are not \n     on the list. . . . The one closest to me, Portsmouth \n     Hospital, is not on the list.\n\n  Kathleen in New Castle wrote:\n\n       The exchange choice will not allow me to use my docs, \n     including primary care who is affiliated with the Portsmouth \n     Hospital. All oncology physicians are located in Boston, not \n     covered.\n\n  Margaret in Strafford currently goes to Frisbie Memorial in \nRochester, which is not part of the exchange.\n  She explained the impact in this way:\n\n       I would no longer be able to go to Frisbie Memorial \n     Hospital, which is four miles away. I could no longer see the \n     gynecologist whom I trust. I could no longer use the surgeon \n     who saved my life when emergency surgery was required. I \n     could no longer visit the same internist. If I were to \n     develop heart problems, I could no longer go to Portsmouth \n     Regional Hospital.\n\n  Gregory in Rochester said his primary care physician is at Frisbie. \nHe said that means he will have to go to another hospital, he said, ``I \ndo not know and does not know my health condition.''\n  Robert in Strafford said he has gone to Frisbie for 40 years. He \nwrote:\n\n       I've had multiple different insurance companies but have \n     always been able to keep the same doctors. Now because of \n     ObamaCare, Frisbie is out of the loop. This is totally unfair \n     to all the people who live in the area. What gives?\n\n  Teresa in Peterborough said that none of her current physicians, \nincluding her primary care physician and her OB/GYN, are in the \nexchange. She wrote:\n\n       The nearest providers in this network are 45 minutes west, \n     60 minutes east or 90 minutes north. This will be very costly \n     to me in terms of time taken off to attend appointments at \n     these distant offices/hospitals. And since I am self-\n     employed, a day off to go to the doctor is one day without \n     income.\n\n  A single mother also from Peterborough wrote:\n\n       If my 17-year-old son does get sick this winter, I will be \n     required to take a minimum of \\1/2\\ day off to bring my son \n     to Keene or Manchester to find a primary care physician who \n     will accept the insurance through affordable care (not that I \n     can even afford that route).\n\n  I am also hearing heart-wrenching stories from New Hampshire citizens \nabout how their premiums are going up. As you know, when this law was \nbeing sold, it was sold as premiums going down, but that is not what I \nam hearing from my constituents.\n  Christopher in Rindge wrote:\n\n       My insurance is going to double on January 1, 2014. Even \n     the options that conform to the health act are double the \n     amount I am paying today. It doesn't make any sense that my \n     insurance would go up by double when this is called \n     ``affordable'' health care.\n\n  Rick in Pembroke wrote:\n\n       Last year, the sum total of my family's health care cost \n     $2,300. . . . I have been looking at health insurance for my \n     family. The lowest insurance will cost $566.40 per month. The \n     family deductible will be $11,500. Even if I spend the same \n     as last year on actual health care, I will have to pay an \n     additional $6,800. This isn't fair and it isn't \n     affordable. I don't know many people who can budget for an \n     additional $6,800 a year.\n\n  Brendan in Sanbornton said:\n\n       I am self-employed and my wife and I pay for our health \n     insurance through Anthem that provides coverage for us and \n     our 15 month old daughter. Presently, we pay about $580 per \n     month for a major deductible plan with a total family \n     deductible of $7,500. A couple of weeks ago, we received a \n     letter from Anthem informing us that our ``old'' policies \n     don't meet the requirements of the new ACA and therefore, we \n     were going to be canceled. When researching new options on \n     Anthem's Web site, we found that our deductible was now going \n     to be $12,000 per year at an increased cost of about $150 per \n     month! We feel as though the country has been misled about \n     being able to `keep their current coverage.'\n\n  Holly in Charleston wrote me:\n\n       I buy an individual policy to cover myself, but my policy \n     went up 25 percent on October 1st and one of the reasons \n     stated in the letter I received from Blue Cross was to cover \n     the implementation of ACA. As a result, I dropped down to a \n     less expensive plan and guess what? I got a letter telling me \n     I was okay until 2014 when that plan will no longer be \n     available because it doesn't comply with the new rules and \n     regs.\n\n  I heard from Patty in New Ipswich and she said that after her \ninsurance company told her to find a plan, she signed up for the least \nexpensive bronze plan available. She says:\n\n       Still not only will my premium be $75 a month higher for a \n     total of just under $600 per month for me, but in addition to \n     that, I have a $5,400 annual deductible. Also, the \n     prescription plan that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Pelosi mandated \n     also has a $5,400 deductible, so effectively that is not a \n     prescription plan at all. In fact, this plan is basically a \n     very expensive catastrophic plan and nothing more. It is not \n     affordable and I am disgusted.\n\n  Barbara in Merrimack and her husband don't yet qualify for Medicare. \nTheir existing plan is being phased out, so she checked the exchange. \nShe wrote:\n\n       The product that was closest to what we currently have is \n     Silver and is just too expensive. The cheapest coverage we \n     could find is in the Bronze category and will cost $1,228.32 \n     per month and will have a deductible of $5,950/individual and \n     $11,900/family. That means that all basic services and \n     medications will be out of pocket. Medications will be \n     covered at 40 percent of the copay. $1,228.32 equals \n     $14,739.84 per year and it is more than my mortgage!. . . . \n     Unlike the government, I can't raise my debt ceiling.\n\n  Anita in Sutton wrote:\n\n       What was supposed to help people like my husband and I who \n     are self-employed--and he has a chronic illness--only hurts \n     us. Our premium went up $2,287.70 per month and this is now \n     with a $4,000 single/$8,000 family deductible . . . nothing \n     like a 30 percent increase for one year . . . Having to hoist \n     yourself up each day and go to work and try to carry on is \n     hard enough with this chronic illness, now we have to pick \n     and choose what bills we can afford to pay . . .\n\n  Jane in Troy said she tried to enroll her son in the Federal program, \nand this is what she wrote to me:\n\n       The quote was $600 a month! Do you know of any 20 year old \n     who can afford $600 a month?\n\n  Tim in Merrimack wrote me:\n\n       Contrary to the original intent of the Affordable Care Act, \n     individuals who obtain insurance on their own are paying \n     radically escalating costs based on individual coverage for a \n     healthy, non-smoking 51-year old male available for January \n     1, 2014, on the healthcare exchange in NH, the results are as \n     follows: Premium--25 percent increase from $4,200 to $5,300. \n     Deductible--20 percent increase from $5,000 to $6,000. 82 \n     percent increase in less than 2 years--$2,900 in June of 2012 \n     to $5,300 in January 2014.\n\n  Then I heard from Erik in Hancock. He said he has seen a 46-percent \npremium hike. He wrote to me:\n\n       What has been done to our health care system? This is the \n     Unaffordable Care Act.\n\n  In some cases, the cost of insurance is rising because plans must \ninclude coverage for services that consumers don't want based on their \nindividual situation or don't need based on their individual situation. \nFor example, Jeff in Hudson says that his premiums will go up nearly 40 \npercent because of ObamaCare. He said:\n\n       It seems that some of the cost drivers are for coverages \n     which my wife and I do not need or want, but are required to \n     have due to the law. For instance, we must have maternity \n     coverage even though we do not plan\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\n     on having more children. (We are in our early 50s.) We \n     must have pediatric dental insurance, even though we have \n     no children under the age of 18.\n\n  Doug in Bedford wrote me:\n\n       The maternity issue is a trap for seniors.\n\n  Carol in Newport wrote:\n\n       Can anyone please explain to me why at 60 years of age I \n     need an insurance plan that requires maternity provisions? \n     Can anyone explain to me why I would be required to pay for \n     pediatric standalone dental when I have no children? Since \n     this is mandated by the government, why would I have to pay \n     an insurer fee, exchange fee, and reinsurance fee?\n\n  She said the most affordable plan she has seen has been $504.15 a \nmonth--which she can't afford--and a $6,350 out-of-pocket deductible. \nCarol asks:\n\n       If I cannot afford the premium, how can I afford the \n     deductible?\n\n  Others I have heard from are worried that their employers will drop \ntheir coverage, finding it cheaper to pay the fine than to provide \ncoverage for their workers.\n  Benjamin in Greenville wrote:\n\n       My portion, currently about $5,000 a year will jump to \n     $20,000+ per year to maintain my current coverage. I make \n     ``too much'' money to be subsidized. Tell me senator, where \n     do I find $15,000 a year, $1,250 a month, $288 a week in my \n     already tight budget?\n\n  He wrote me:\n\n       No more vacations. No more dance lessons for my kids. No \n     more family date night once a month. No more Christmas \n     presents.\n\n  Another theme I have heard in the letters I have received from my \nconstituents is a feeling that those in the middle are being squeezed \nthe most.\n  Donna in Newport wrote:\n\n       My employer is now canceling the company sponsored health \n     plan as of January 2014, which costs me $2,288 per year. In \n     shopping for a new plan, I am seeing the possibility of a $22 \n     subsidy to help me with a monthly cost of $400, an increase \n     in my health care costs I cannot afford. I am the middle \n     class, a tax paying and proud American that did not ask for \n     this Act and now suffering because of it.\n\n  Cheryl in Acworth wrote:\n\n       Not only do I have to pay twice the premium, but it will be \n     post-tax--a double hit. If I was poor, I would be okay or if \n     I worked for a large employer I would be okay but for those \n     of us trying to make a good living and be responsible \n     productive citizens, we end up carrying this . . . This is \n     not the American dream at all.\n\n  Joseph in Salem wrote to me:\n\n       On September 30th I received a letter from Anthem informing \n     me that my new payment to keep my current plan which I have \n     had for over 8 years will increase $212.47 on January 1st. \n     That is a $2,548.80 increase for 2014. This is what ObamaCare \n     is doing to the middle class.\n\n  Roberta in Nashua is like many of my constituents pleading for help. \nShe wrote:\n\n       Please hear my plea and see what you can do to allow people \n     like me and my husband to keep our care and not be forced \n     into purchasing exchange insurance which is so costly and \n     will be a financial hardship for us. IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE!\n\n  In addition to canceled policies, patients losing their doctors, and \nhigher premiums, I have also heard about another aspect and consequence \nof ObamaCare from people who are working hard, trying to make ends \nmeet, and those are workers who are seeing their hours cut. Under the \nlaw, employers must provide coverage for employees who work 30 hours or \nmore per week. Many of these employers, not surprisingly, have decided \nto reduce hours rather than comply with this new mandate. So this is \nwhat my constituents are writing me about--these hard-working people \ntrying to make a living.\n  I heard from an EMT from the Monadnock region who wrote to me and \nsaid:\n\n       My employer notified the 75 of us who work there that \n     effective January 1st, our hours will be cut due to \n     ObamaCare. So our incomes will drop and make it harder for us \n     to buy our own insurance.\n\n  An educator from the Upper Valley wrote:\n\n       Our school district and surrounding ones are cutting back \n     para-professional jobs to 29 hours. Many of these people were \n     full time. Instead they hired several part-time people to \n     cover the once full-time positions . . . Now they are no \n     longer entitled to any benefits. Many of these individuals \n     have worked 15 or more years with a school district as full-\n     timers.\n\n  I have heard from business owners as well. They have told me that the \nlooming mandates in the law are causing them to think about eliminating \ncoverage for their employees even though they don't want to do it. They \nwant to do what is right for their employees.\n  Steven in Nashua wrote me:\n\n       I am a small employer. I would be very tempted to dump my \n     plan for my employees, give them a few extra dollars and just \n     get out of the health care business.\n\n  I have also heard time and time again about how looming penalties \nunder ObamaCare are causing businesses to think twice about growing and \nadding new workers.\n  I heard from Matt on the seacoast. He wrote to me and said:\n\n       On a business level, I don't know if I will expand because \n     I would not be able to pay the penalties or the health \n     insurance for my staff members.\n\n  These are just some of the stories I am receiving from New Hampshire \nabout hardships ObamaCare is causing for people who are working hard, \nwho want to make ends meet, who want to keep the health care plans they \nhave now. I feel terribly bad for these people. It breaks my heart.\n  I have worked hard. I have sponsored many efforts and voted to repeal \nthis law. I have called repeatedly over the last several days for a \ntimeout from ObamaCare. We do need a timeout because of the concerns I \njust talked about in this Chamber that I am hearing from my \nconstituents and that I know many Members in this Chamber are hearing. \nWe need the President to call a timeout.\n  I came to the floor several times during the government shutdown and \nI said it was wrong to shut down the government to try to defund \nObamaCare because of the harmful impact of a government shutdown. I \neven took the step of calling on Members of my own party: Please, do \nnot go forward and shut the government down.\n  Now it is time for the President to see the impact of this law and \nunderstand from someone who in some instances has stood up to her own \nparty on the government shutdown--I am asking the President of the \nUnited States to hear from the people of this country who are being \nimpacted negatively by the health care law, and I say: Call a timeout, \nMr. President. It is not working. They are having difficulties with the \nWeb site. They are worried that their personal information will not be \nprotected on the Web site.\n  But, as I talked about today, the problems are much deeper, with \npeople receiving cancellation notices, with people receiving premium \nhikes they cannot afford, with hours being cut for workers who want to \nwork and make a living in this great country.\n  I would ask the President to call a timeout, to bring people \ntogether. This law was passed out of this Chamber on party lines. I \nwould argue the best way to address health care in this country and to \naddress real concerns I know people had with the status quo as well is \nto bring a bipartisan group together because what we are seeing now is \nnot working.\n  My constituents have also taken the time to point out to me--in \naddition to the major problems they see with ObamaCare, they have \nshared a few ideas with me as well about where they think we should go \nfrom here instead of ObamaCare. I want to share those ideas as well.\n  Many of them agree that competition in New Hampshire is effectively \nnonexistent. Let's face it. We have one insurer on the exchange. One \nsuggestion I saw--and it is one I agree with--is to allow for the \npurchase of insurance across State lines. Why shouldn't insurance \ncompanies have to compete on a national basis?\n  I also agreed with a constituent who said we need to place our focus \nwhere it belongs: crafting legislation that reduces health care costs \nrather than trying to create an artificial health insurance \nmarketplace.\n  Another constituent wisely pointed out that there should not be a \ncookie-cutter set of policies, such as the ones that result in seniors \npurchasing coverage that includes maternity care. Instead, people \nshould be able to shop for coverage that suits their particular needs, \nand we should respect that different people have different needs in \nhealth care.\n  There are many other ideas that I know we could work on together. \nThese are just some of the ones my constituents have written to me, and \nI know they have written me other great ideas as well.\n  Finally, an overarching theme I have heard is that Americans are \ntired of\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\nbeing victims of partisan gamesmanship, and I agree with them. We have \nhad too much partisan gamesmanship on so many issues in the Congress. \nThey are tired of the politics. They want us to work together to solve \ntough problems, and I agree with them.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I renew my call for a \ntimeout on ObamaCare. Let's have both parties come to the table and \nfind health care solutions that work for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in the midst of our \nbudget conference about a topic that has consumed a lot of time here in \nthis Chamber in the last number of months; that is, the effect of \nsequestration on the national economy and in particular the effect that \nsequestration is having on defense.\n  This was the subject of my first speech, my maiden speech as a \nSenator on the 27th of February, talking about the particular effect of \ndefense sequestration, cuts on Virginia and the Nation as a whole. I \nreturn to it today not just to be repetitive but because we now finally \nare at the table in a budget conference, and, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, I think this conference gives us an excellent opportunity to \nfind a better path forward for the Nation.\n  Sequestration, which went into effect in early March, has caused \nmajor damage to our economy and the capacities of our Defense \nDepartment. Our Defense Department is the most capable fighting force \nthe world has ever seen. It is vital to our security, and Virginians \nand citizens of Wisconsin and every other State understand that.\n  Sequester was designed to be so painful that it would force Democrats \nand Republicans to find an alternative. We know that did not happen, so \nthe pain that was never intended to come into effect has been in \neffect. We have seen the impact it has had on our economy since early \nMarch.\n  Fortunately, while we did not compromise in order to avert sequester, \nthere is still time to compromise. Now when we are doing the hard work \nof a budget conference for the first time in 5 years, when we are doing \nthe hard work of a budget conference in a divided Congress for the \nfirst time since 1986, it is now time to address these damaging cuts.\n  Let me talk for a second about the effect these cuts have first on \nVirginia but then on our national defense and preparedness. Our \nNation's Defense Department has been strung along prior to \nsequestration for a number of years, 3 years, with continuing \nresolutions. That is jargon that we understand here. For regular folks, \nit is as if you are into the next year in your household and you are \ntold: We cannot make a decision so we will spend this year exactly what \nwe spent last year.\n  Well, wait a minute. We had a child in college last year who is not \nin college. Well, still you have got to put money into tuition.\n  Well, what about a new need we have this year that we did not have \nlast year? Well, you cannot do it. You are limited to only what you did \nlast year.\n  That is what continuing resolutions for 3 years in a row have done to \nDefense, with the exception of some anomalies that are passed. It is \nrequired for Defense to spend on the same line items and not, for \nexample, invest more in important priorities. The one I always think of \nis cyber security. If you do continuing resolutions and you just spend \nwhat you spent a few years ago, we know we have a bigger need for cyber \nsecurity than we had a few years ago. There are attacks every day. No \none thinks the need to be diligent about cyber security is constant. \nNo, we ought to be spending more. Instead, the continuing resolution \nrequires our Defense and other departments to spend at yesterday's line \nitems--or 3-year-ago line items. That does not make much sense.\n  In hearing after hearing in our Budget Committee, in the Armed \nServices Committee and others, our Nation's uniformed and civilian \nmilitary leaders have emphasized the damage sequestration is having on \nour military. In every meeting with generals, admirals, Pentagon \nofficials, I am struck by their calls to us as Democrats and \nRepublicans, as Senate and House Members, to end this foolish policy. \nThe next hearing we will have tomorrow is in the Armed Services \nCommittee, when we will be hearing again about the effect sequestration \nis having on military readiness.\n  In Virginia, to pick one State, my home State has been hit very hard, \nin fact harder than any other State due to the large Federal workforce \nand many military bases. When you add to the sequestration and CR the \neffect of the shutdown we saw in September and October--the first 2 \nweeks of October--Virginians really feel it.\n  Today, a total of 177,982 Virginians are employed because of Federal \nfunding either directly with DOD or one of the service branches or \nthrough military contracts. For example, the talented men and women at \nthe Newport News shipyard are private contractors, but they manufacture \nthe largest items that are manufactured on planet Earth, nuclear \naircraft carriers. They do it to keep American men and women safe. This \nsummer over 70,000 DOD civilians in Virginia were furloughed. \nConstruction training and maintenance on military bases was delayed, \nwhich affected private contractors. If sequester continues, as some are \nsaying--some are fatalistic about it: Well, we cannot do anything about \nit--if sequester continues into 2014, 34 planned ship maintenance \navailabilities will be canceled in the new year. Each of these \nmaintenance projects is massive and employs so many people. As many as \n19 of these are on the east coast--34 is the national figure, 19 of \nthese are on the east coast, including Virginia. This will hurt the \nship repair industry in Hampton Roads, and could lead to a loss of \nabout 8,000 jobs nationally in the ship repair industry.\n  Not only have these cuts flowing from sequestration affected my \nState's economy, but probably more to the point for all of us in this \nbody, we ought to be concerned because they are affecting our national \nsecurity and they are degrading the capability of our military to deal \nwith challenges.\n  I wish I could say that since I was sworn in as a Senator with the \nPresiding Officer on January 3 the world has become a lot safer and \nmore peaceful and less complicated. But to the contrary. In the 10 \nmonths we have been here, sadly, we have seen more instances of danger, \nmore things to be concerned about, more problems we have to deal with. \nWe are not in a static situation. We are shrinking our budget at the \nsame time as the degree of challenges we have around the world is \ngrowing more dangerous.\n  Just this year, the sequestration cuts that went into effect in March \nhave grounded one-third of our U.S. combat aircraft. Think about our \nAir Force and how important it is in today's defense and planning for \nwarfare. One-third of our combat aircraft are grounded because of \nsequestration, hampering our ability to respond to global crises and \nmaintain strategic advantages. If sequester goes forward, that one-\nthird will grow. The Air Force will be forced to cut additionally, by \nas much as 15 percent. That would suggest that nearly 50 percent of \nAmerica's combat aircraft will be grounded in 2014 due to the \nsequester. We have to ask ourselves: How can we not have an Air Force \nready to respond to crises at a moment's notice?\n  Moving to the Navy. Our naval capabilities have also been \nsignificantly curtailed, reducing our normal levels of three carrier \ngroups and three amphibious groups ready to respond to crisis within 1 \nweek to only one of each. So, again, a two-thirds reduction in the \navailability of carrier forces or amphibious vehicle forces that can \nmeet that 1-week response time in the event of an emergency.\n  Again, we have got to have a Navy that is ready to respond when there \nare crises.\n  Then moving to the Army. This year, because of the first year of the \nsequester--and it gets worse--the Army cancelled all--all--combat \ntraining center rotations for any nondeploying unit. So if a unit is \nbeing deployed, they are\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nbeing trained, but then other units that do not have a regular assigned \ndeployment stay trained as well to meet an emergency need. If we know \nwe are going to be deploying a unit to Afghanistan to replace another \nunit that is coming back, then we will train that unit. But you do some \ntraining for the units you are not planning to deploy, just so they are \nready if the need exists. But we have cancelled all of the training for \nnondeploying units. General Odierno has said that 85 percent of \nAmerica's brigade combat teams cannot meet the current training \nrequirements that are set in our defense strategy.\n\n  We have asked what that means. When folks come before us, we ask what \ndoes it mean, you are not getting the training? Does it mean you will \nnot go if there is a compelling security need or national emergency?\n  They say: No, of course we will go. If the Commander in Chief or \nCongress were to say we have to go, we will go. But what training means \nis we will go, but we will suffer more casualties. What training does \nis give us the edge to succeed. The absence of training means--it is \nalmost immoral to think about it--that we have a training standard, but \nif you put people in harm's way who have not been able to meet that \ntraining standard, you almost guarantee that the casualties will be \nmore significant. That is not something any of us can comfortably look \nin the mirror and tolerate.\n  So it is not hard to see that what was promised about sequester is, \nin fact, true. Sequestration is not strategic. It was never designed to \nbe strategic. It was not designed to be the careful cutting of costs \nthat you might do, that you should do, that every organization should \ndo. It is not only not strategic, it is not sustainable in the \noutyears.\n  The House Armed Services Committee--Republican House, Republican \nmajority--many Republicans have admitted ``that sequestration of \ndiscretionary accounts was never intended to be policy.'' Our \ncolleagues in the House, in a bipartisan way, have called for a lifting \nof sequestration, in terms of its effects on defense.\n  Our Armed Services Committee in the Senate, the SASC, also in the \nNDAA that we are about to debate on the Senate floor, reached the same \nconclusion. We were sitting in a markup of the NDAA bill. I noticed at \nthe time as a SASC member there was nothing in the bill about \nsequestration. All of our hearings, virtually, had touched on \nsequestration. So I put an amendment on the table, kind of on the fly: \nLet's just say sequestration is bad and we should get rid of it. We \ndebated it right there as we were marking up the bill. I recall that \nthe vote on the amendment was 23 to 3.\n  Overwhelmingly in a voice vote, the Armed Services Committee, \nDemocrats and Republicans, were willing to embrace the proposition that \nsequestration was bad. Actually the language was, not only is it bad \nfor the DOD accounts, it is also bad for the other accounts as well.\n  That is why I am calling, in connection with our meeting as budget \nconferees, for a sensible bipartisan approach to limit the negative \nimpacts of sequestration.\n  General Dempsey was talking to a group of Senators yesterday on the \nreadiness subcommittee. He said: What we need to deal with in \nsequestration is money, time, and flexibility. The cuts are too steep; \nthey are too frontloaded in terms of the timing; and there is too \nlittle flexibility for our military command to be able to use the \ndollars to do the right thing to keep us safe.\n  We have to find a way to get out of the sequestration dead end and \nrestore some of the cuts and provide both the timing and flexibility to \nmake the management of them easier. If we reverse sequestration in this \nbudget conference, that will create, by economists' estimates, 900,000 \njobs at a time when our economy needs to get stronger and our \nunemployment rates to be dropped. It will add a whole percentage point \nto our gross domestic product, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  So now as the budget conference committee is meeting--our next \nmeeting is next week--I felt our opening meeting was a positive one. It \nwas mostly positive because as we went around the table, House Members \nand Senate, Democrats and Republicans, there was an absence of what I \nwould call the ``nonnegotiable'' language. I listened carefully. Being \nnew, I do not necessarily know all of the details. But I know when I \nhear lines in the sand being drawn: We will not do this; we will not do \nthat. When you hear that, you know the negotiations are going to be \nvery difficult.\n  I applaud the 29 conferees for having that opening meeting and not \nputting a lot of ``not negotiable'' language out on the table. When we \nmeet next week, I hope that attitude continues because we need \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle, in both the House and Senate, \nto work toward a positive solution in this conference that will do a \nnumber of things: Help us grow the economy; help us deal with the debt \nin a responsible way, not an irresponsible way, but lift the effects of \nsequestration so that we can be confident we will be safe as a nation.\n  I pointed out during the budget conference that while the House \nbudget under the leadership of Chairman Ryan and the Senate budget \nunder the leadership of Chairwoman Murray are different in a lot of \nways, in other ways you can step back from them and say: The \ndifferences are not so mammoth that they cannot be resolved. They are \nthe kinds of differences that legislative bodies around the country, \nState legislators often resolve. The top line difference between the \nHouse and Senate budgets for the 2014 year is about 2.5 percent of the \nFederal budget. You could argue that both of the top line numbers had a \nlittle bit of wiggle room in them in negotiation. So the actual \ndifference, I would argue, between the two budgets, top line for 2014, \nis probably about 1.5 percent.\n  Given the challenges in the world, given the challenges in our \neconomy, given the American public's desire to see us work together to \nfind a compromise, and the upside we can achieve, if we do, I cannot \nbelieve that 1.5-percent difference in the top line is an insuperable \nobstacle for us. We have hard decisions to make. We need to make them \nwith the interests of our own constituents but the entire country in \nmind, in particular, in this world where every day we hear of a new \npotential challenge that can threaten our security if we do not deal \nwith it in a smart way.\n  We need to get past the continuing resolutions and the gimmickry and \nthe shutdowns and sequestration, return to orderly budgeting, and do \nthe hard work of finding compromise.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the budget conferees are working to reach \nagreement on the fiscal 2014 budget, and I compliment Senator Murray \nfor the great work she has done. I want to join those who have \nexpressed strong support for their efforts.\n  We all know what the consequences will be if they do not reach \nagreement on a budget. We will have draconian cuts to defense \nacquisitions and readiness, to social safety net programs, to \ninfrastructure, to public schools, and to police. Every Federal program \nis going to suffer, and every American in my State and in the other 49 \nStates, will feel the impact.\n  Having been in the Senate a long time, I know that anything that gets \ndone around here happens as a result of compromise. Nobody gets \neverything he or she wants. When it comes to a budget agreement, it \nmeans you have to have additional savings, but you also need increased \nrevenues. There is no other way. You have to do both.\n  I think back to the time when we not only had balanced budgets, but \nwe also had a surplus; in the last Democratic administration, for \nexample. We did not have these kinds of specialized tax cuts to those \nin the highest bracket. Ironically, those in the highest bracket made \nmore money during that time because the whole economy was better.\n  Those who think it can be done by only cutting spending, or by only \nclosing corporate tax loopholes, but not by\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\ndoing both together, are legislators in name only. That is simply a \nrecipe for continued gridlock and another year of sequestration, which \nwould be a disaster.\n  It would allow everybody to go off and give rhetoric but not face \nreality. They could talk about what they want, but never have to vote \non anything. The fact is that if you want to do this, you have to cast \nsome tough votes.\n  The outcome of this budget conference will determine the extent to \nwhich the Congress will play a meaningful role in Federal spending for \nthe rest of this administration, and possibly well beyond.\n  I would advise my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I have been \nhere with both Republican and Democratic administrations. If the \nCongress is going to actually have a voice as an independent third \nbranch of government in how the government is run and what we do, then \nwe have to start facing up and doing real budgets and real \nappropriations bills; otherwise, just assume there is a top dollar \nlevel in there and the administration will do whatever it wants to do, \nDemocratic or Republican. That is not what I believe I was elected to \ndo. As one of 100 Senators, I should have a voice in what comes out of \nit.\n  As I said, the outcome of this budget conference will determine the \nextent to which the Congress can play a meaningful role in Federal \nspending not only for the rest of this administration but possibly well \nbeyond, but there is no better way to illustrate what is at stake than \nto use concrete examples. I want to do that by comparing the impact of \nthe fiscal year 2014 House and Senate versions of the bill that funds \nthe Department of State and foreign operations. The choices are stark, \nand it puts things in perspective.\n  The House bill provides $40 billion to fund the Department of State, \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development, and our contributions to \nthe World Bank, U.N. peacekeeping, and countless other organizations \nand programs that contribute to global security.\n  In contrast, the Senate bill would provide $50 billion, 25 percent \nmore than the House bill, for these same agencies and programs. But, \nlest anyone falsely accuse think the Senate of being big spenders, \nactually the Senate bill responds to the current budget climate--it is \n$500 million below the fiscal year 2013 continuing resolution after \nsequestration and across-the-board reductions, and includes many budget \nreductions and savings.\n  Unlike the House bill, however, we are selective in how we do it. The \nSenate bill does not make draconian and reckless cuts that would weaken \nU.S. influence and cede U.S. leadership to our competitors.\n  Given the situations in Syria, North Africa, and other areas of \nconflict--areas of conflict that could evolve and engulf the United \nStates at a moment's notice--as well as the unpredictability of natural \ndisasters, funding for international crisis response and humanitarian \nrelief is a matter of life and death for millions of the world's most \nvulnerable people who look to the wealthiest, most powerful nation on \nEarth.\n  The current demand for these programs--and certainly my mail shows \nthey are strongly supported by the American people--is unprecedented \nand growing. Yet the House bill cuts these programs $1.6 billion below \nthe Senate bill, and far below the fiscal year 2013 level.\n  One of the most troubling cuts in the House bill is for international \norganizations in which the United States plays a major role in \naddressing global threats to us and our allies--such as transnational \ncrime, disease epidemics, and climate change--that no country can solve \nalone. Some of the most feared and most deadly diseases in the world \ntoday are not on our shores, but can be on our shores from other parts \nof the world in a matter of hours.\n  Aside from a total humanitarian reason, we have a good reason to do \nsomething to help combat those diseases. The House would end our \nsupport entirely for many of these organizations, create large arrears \nof money we are obligated by treaty to pay, and erode our influence \nwith other major contributors and shareholders like the Europeans, \nChina, India, and Brazil.\n  They are saying: OK, we agreed to pay this, but, sorry, we are the \nUnited States and we don't have to keep our word. I don't think most \nAmericans want to hear that. Ask any of our international corporations, \nask any of our organizations in this country--medical facilities or \nanything else that has to work around the world--if they really want \nthe United States to give up its influence.\n  The House bill provides no funding--not one single dollar--for U.S. \nvoluntary contributions to the United Nations Children's Fund, the \nUnited Nations Development Program, the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, or the Montreal Protocol, which protects \nthe ozone layer. The Senate bill includes $355 million for this \naccount, which is about the same level as five years ago. I would like \nmore, but I don't want to go to the House level, which is nothing.\n  So while the House would end our participation in UNICEF and many \nother U.N. agencies, the Senate bill freezes spending for these \norganizations at the 2009 level.\n  The House bill provides $746 million, which is nearly 50 percent less \nthan the Senate bill, for assessed contributions--these are \ncontributions we are required to pay--to international organizations \nsuch as NATO, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health \nOrganization, Food and Agriculture Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation, and many others.\n  What we are saying is that if some disease breaks out in the world \nand comes across our borders, well, gosh, that would be terrible, but \nwe can't give any money to the World Health Organization to try to stop \nit. What if there is a question of nuclear proliferation? Sorry, we \ncan't give the money we are required to give to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. The Senate bill is $72 million below the fiscal \nyear 2009 level, and the House bill is $783 million below the fiscal \nyear 2009 level.\n\n  Does anybody actually believe that the needs of NATO or the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency or the World Health Organization are \nless today than they were five years ago? All you have to do is watch \nthe news. All you have to do is read some of the reports, some of the \nintelligence briefs every Senator can read, and you are not going to \nsay: Well, the threat is less today than it was five years ago. You are \ngoing to say, as I do, as I read these reports: The threat is a great \ndeal worse than it was five years ago. It defies logic, and it is \ndangerous. It is dangerous not to be involved in these organizations.\n  In fact, the House bill provides no funding not one dollar--for most \nof the international financial institutions, such as the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, or the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment. This would put us hundreds of millions of dollars in \narrears, forfeiting our leadership in those institutions.\n  So they can say to us: OK, debtor nation--OK, United States--you \nagreed to these, but you are not paying your bill. We can't trust the \nUnited States, so we are not going to let you have any say in this. We \nare not going to let you have the leadership you have had in these \ninstitutions.\n  In fact, the House bill provides not even one dollar for the key \nmultilateral environmental funds that support clean energy technology \nand protect forests and water resources, including the Global \nEnvironment Facility, the Clean Technology Fund, and the Strategic \nClimate Fund. It is bad enough that here in the Senate we have frozen \nthese agencies at last year's level, but at least we have some money \nfor them. The House has nothing. They do not provide a single dollar \nfor the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. The Senate bill \nprovides $135 million for this program--the same level as last year's \ncontinuing resolution--to help the poorest countries prevent chronic \nmalnutrition and famine.\n  Mr. President, we all ask: Why can't we have countries developed so \nthat they are not open to some of these terrorist organizations or \nfundamentalist organizations that step in? Well, we have a stake in \nhelping them. It doesn't require much money; a tiny fraction--1 percent \nof our budget. To just walk away from them makes no sense from our \nstrategic interest, but more than that, what does it say about\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nour moral interest as the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth? We \nhave to speak to what is the moral value of the United States.\n  Frankly, what they have done in the other body does not speak well to \nour moral core--not the moral core of the America I know in my State \nfrom both Republicans and Democrats alike. We all understand the need \nfor Federal departments and agencies to reduce costs and eliminate \nwaste and find efficiencies. We do this. The Senate bill is $500 \nmillion below the fiscal 2013 continuing resolution. But what we try to \ndo is to say that at least the United States has to keep its word. At \nleast the United States ought to show involvement in parts of the world \nwhere it counts.\n  Unfortunately, the House bill may make great sound bites, nice \nbumper-sticker politics, but it endangers the United States, endangers \nour security, and it gives the image that the United States is a \ncountry that cannot keep its word. We can't do that. It will end up \ncosting taxpayers more in the long run and cause lasting damage to the \ncountry.\n  Let's move forward, get our budget resolution, and pass our \nappropriations bills, because right now everybody gets to vote maybe. \nNobody has to vote yes or no. I have been here long enough to know that \nthe people of my State expect me to vote yes or no, not maybe.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering a motion to proceed \nto H.R. 3204.\n  Has the time been divided in any fashion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Manufacturing Jobs\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about jobs--\nabout manufacturing jobs. As we all know, manufacturing jobs are high-\nquality jobs. Manufacturing jobs come with higher pay and higher \nbenefits. Manufacturing jobs help create other local service sector \njobs, and manufacturing jobs contribute more to the local economy than \njobs in any other sector. Beyond that, manufacturers invest the most of \nany industry sector in research and development, which is critical to \nAmerica's continued growth and our security as a leading innovation \neconomy.\n  Last week 21 Senate colleagues and I joined in a new initiative \ncalled the Manufacturing Jobs for America to help create good \nmanufacturing jobs here at home today and tomorrow. It has grown out of \n25 Senators who have all contributed different policy ideas. This is \nnot one big megabill with dozens of sponsors, but just one bill. \nInstead, it is a constellation of 40 different proposals. Some of them \nhave already been introduced as bills, and half of those that have been \nintroduced are bipartisan. These bills illustrate some of our best \nideas about how we can work together across the aisle to provide badly \nneeded support for our growing manufacturing sector here in the United \nStates.\n  There are 4 different areas these 40 different proposals fall into, \nand I wanted to talk about 1 of them today. Three of them are: How do \nwe open markets abroad? How do we strengthen America's 21st century \nmanufacturing workforce? How do we create a long-term environment for \ngrowth through a manufacturing strategy? The fourth is: How do we \nensure access to capital?\n  Of the four I just mentioned, I want to speak about access to \ncapital. As any business owner knows, you cannot ensure the long-term \ngrowth and vitality of your business unless you have capital to \ninvest--whether in research and development, new workers, new products, \nor new equipment to expand into new markets. Access to capital is \nabsolutely essential to manufacturing jobs for America.\n  The three bills I am going to talk about today, which are part of \nthis constellation of 40 different proposals, would each expand access \nto capital for manufacturers in different ways.\n  Let me start with the Startup Innovation Credit Act. This is an \nexisting bipartisan bill I have introduced, along with Senators Enzi, \nRubio, Blunt, and Moran, who are all Republicans, and Senators Schumer, \nStabenow, and Kaine, all, like me, Democrats. Although we represent \ndifferent parties, come from different parts of the country, and have \ndifferent backgrounds, we have all come together to strengthen our \neconomy and in particular to support innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  One way we do that now is to support private sector innovation and \nmanufacturing through the research and development tax credit. The R \ntax credit generates new products and industries, benefiting other \nsectors. But there is a critical gap in the existing and longstanding \nR tax credit. It is not available to startups because they are not \nyet profitable. This is a tax credit you can only take if you have a \ntax liability and are profitable.\n  We worked together--Senator Enzi and I, and the other cosponsors--to \nfix this hole with a relatively simple tweak, and that is what the \nStartup Innovation Credit Act does. It allows companies to claim the \nR tax credit against their employment tax liability rather than in \nincome tax liability--a corporate income tax liability. Supporting \nsmall innovative companies in their critical early stages of research \nand development could unleash further innovations and unleash greater \ngrowth that would spur good job creation for Americans in the long run.\n  Between 1980 and 2005, all net new jobs created in the United States \nwere created by firms 5 years old or less. In total, that was about 40 \nmillion jobs over those 25 years. This credit is specifically designed \nwith those new young firms in mind--those early-stage firms that are \nthe font of the greatest source of creativity and jobs. It is limited \nto those companies that are 5 years old or less, and it is limited to \nbeing an offset against their W-2 liability so we can provide some \naccess for early-stage startups to this R credit that encourages them \nto hire more folks and grow more quickly--just a part of Manufacturing \nJobs for America.\n  The second bill I would like to talk about today is the Master \nLimited Partnership Parity Act. It levels the playing field as far as \ngetting access credit. Instead of giving smaller, early-stage startup \ncompanies the same access to capital that larger, more mature firms \nhave, this bill levels the playing field in the energy sector. It \nlevels the playing field, in particular, for clean energy firms.\n  This is bipartisan as well. I introduced it with Democratic Senator \nDebbie Stabenow as my lead cosponsor and Republican Senators Jim Moran \nand Lisa Murkowski. I am grateful for their persistent and engaged \nleadership on this bill. I am thrilled that in the last couple of days \nDemocratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican Senator Susan Collins \nsigned on as cosponsors as well.\n  The MLP Parity Act allows us to have an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy. As I presided in my first 2 years--as I served on the Energy \nCommittee--there are many Senators, Republican and Democrat, who think \nwe should not pick winners and losers in technology and we should be \npromoting an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. This bill makes that \npossible in clean energy financing and in preserving a widely used tool \nfor existing traditional energy financing. Oil and gas will play a \nsignificant role in our Nation's energy picture for the foreseeable \nfuture, but right now we don't have a level playing field between \nrenewables and between oil and gas and pipelines.\n  For nearly 30 years, traditional nonrenewable sources of energy have \nhad access to master limited partnerships. MLPs give natural gas, oil, \nand coal companies access to private capital at a lower cost. That is \nsomething that capital-intensive projects, such as pipelines, badly \nneed. I would argue that alternative energy products need that as well; \nin fact, in some ways more than ever.\n  Last night I spoke to a group of board members at the National \nAcademies of Science, and what we spoke about was how much technology \nhas\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\ndeveloped and sped up in the clean energy space, but how financial \ninnovation has not kept pace. This has held back renewable energy and \ninvestments in energy efficiency even as technology has made energy \nproduction and distribution and energy efficiency cheaper to achieve.\n  Expanding access through this broad bipartisan bill to low-cost, \nlong-term capital would be an important step to letting new energy \nsources take off and letting them compete on a level playing field with \nall sources of energy. That is exactly what the MLP Parity Act intends \nto do.\n  Last but not least, I was proud to be able to join a number of other \nSenators in cosponsoring the Small Brew Act. Senators Cardin and \nBegich, Senators Collins and Murkowski, Democrats and Republicans, have \nworked together to give small brewers a leg up by lowering the excise \ntax they face on the beer they produce.\n  Small Brewers, such as Dogfish Head in my home State of Delaware, are \nbig job creators in communities across the country. As Senator Cardin \nsaid on the floor earlier this year, ``While some people may think this \nis a bill about beer, it is really about jobs.'' And I would say jobs \nin manufacturing.\n  Small and independent brewers today employ more than 100,000 \nAmericans and pay more than $3 billion in wages and benefits. Sam \nCalagione, the owner of Dogfish Head Brewery in my home State of \nDelaware, now employs 180 workers at their facility in Milton. Of \ncourse, what they are manufacturing is not a new or innovative or \nrecently invented product. People have been brewing beer for thousands \nof years. Sam has done a remarkable job of coming up with a very broad \nrange of different brews, and, in fact, of bringing back brews that are \ncenturies or millennia old by recovering recipes for fantastic and \ntasty beers.\n\n  What I am focusing on today is about the expanse. This particular \ncompany has invested $50 million in a state-of-the-art manufacturing \nfacility. When I recently visited, I was struck at how different it is \nfrom the beer bottling plant of the past, from what some may have seen \non ``Laverne and Shirley'' or what they would imagine a traditional \nmanufacturing plant to look like.\n  Those folks who work on the manufacturing line at this particular \nfacility have to be able to use programmable logic controls. They have \nto be able to do quality control and math, and to communicate as a \nteam. They have to communicate in a way that puts them at the cutting \nedge of advanced manufacturing. This highlights some of the biggest \nchallenges in manufacturing. It takes a lot of money to invest in a \nplant and machinery in order to make them capable of competing as a \nmodern-day plant. It takes access to capital.\n  We also need to change the public's perception of what manufacturing \nis. It is a very different place to work--a manufacturing line--than it \nwas 20 or 50 years ago. They are safe, clean, and well lit. These are \ndecent, high-paying jobs. If we are going to win in the global \ncompetition for manufacturing, we need to strengthen the skills and the \nperceptions of manufacturing across our country.\n  Each of the three bills I have spoken about today will help create \ngood manufacturing jobs here in America, and I believe are ready for \nconsideration on a bipartisan basis by this Chamber. We need to take \naction together on a bipartisan basis to get our economy going again.\n  I will remind everyone: Manufacturing jobs are not just decent jobs, \nnot just good jobs, they are great jobs. They are the jobs of today and \ntomorrow. They are the jobs that sustain and build the backbone of the \nAmerican middle class.\n  We already have all the tools in this country to ensure its growth, \nbut if we work together and put in place stronger and better Federal \npolicies in partnership with the private sector, we can put jets on our \nmanufacturing sector, and it can take off and grow again.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, every so often in between the crises and rancor and \npartisan fighting, we have an opportunity to make real progress in the \nSenate. This week we are considering the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct. It is a bill that will put in place basic workplace protections \nfor lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n  It has been a big year for equality nationally and in my home State \nof Delaware. The Delaware General Assembly legalized same-sex marriage \nin May, giving every Delawarean access to the full rights and \nresponsibilities of marriage, no matter the orientation.\n  A month later, Delaware's General Assembly built on its 3-year-old \nlaw by protecting LGBT people from workplace discrimination, adding \nprotections for transgender Delawareans as well. These two laws are \nabout dignity, respect, and basic fairness for our neighbors.\n  Of course, a month later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the \nDefense of Marriage Act, giving all married couples across our country \naccess to the Federal benefits they are due. This has truly been a \nhistoric year for civil rights and for our country.\n  For all of our progress, much remains to be done. In 29 States it is \nstill legal to fire someone just because they are gay, just because \nthey are lesbian, or just because they are bisexual. That means that \nmore than 4 million Americans across those States go to work day in and \nday out with no protection against being fired summarily because of who \nthey love. In 33 States, which include 5 million people, it is legal to \nfire someone because of their gender identity.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Oregon, for his hard work and \nleading this fight here on the floor, and the Senator from Iowa for his \nlong advocacy for this bill that should have passed years and years \nago.\n  More than 40 percent of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans, and \nalmost 80 percent of transgender Americans, say they have been \nmistreated in the workplace because of who they are or because of who \nthey love. Clearly there is still work for us to do.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would provide basic protections \nagainst workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. It is a bill that is built on our Nation's historic civil \nrights laws, including the Civil Rights Act and the Americans With \nDisabilities Act. This is about basic fairness.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans--in fact, more than 80 \npercent--think it is already against the law to fire someone just \nbecause they are gay. Most Fortune 500 companies already have policies \npreventing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity in place.\n  Some of Delaware's biggest employers and companies, including DuPont, \nDow, Bank of America, TD Bank, Christiana Care, and the University of \nDelaware have led the way with their own policies to protect the rights \nof LGBT Delawareans and their employees.\n  There is real momentum behind these protections, and it is time for \nCongress to pass this law. Protecting Americans from discrimination is \npart of America's shared values, and it needs to be part of our laws as \nwell.\n  No one here thinks it is OK to fire someone simply because they are \nAfrican American or because they are a woman or because they are an \nolder American. It is not OK to fire someone because they are gay or \ntransgender either. Equality is a fundamental part of our shared \nAmerican values: Do unto others; treat people with the respect and \ndignity with which you want them to treat you. Majorities in every \nState support putting these protections in place. Majorities of \nDemocrats and of Republicans and of Independents support putting these \nprotections in place. Majorities in every Christian denomination \nsupport putting these protections in place. The majority of small \nbusiness owners surveyed support putting these protections in place.\n\n  Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental American value that we \ndon't just share, we cherish. Why not put these protections in place \nnow, today, to ensure that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender \nAmericans will be able to go to work, to earn a living, to provide for \nthemselves and their families, without the fear of being fired just \nbecause of who they are.\n  The opportunity in front of every one of us is an important one. \nLeadership on civil rights in this Chamber has traditionally been \nbipartisan, and this period of partisanship on civil rights is only \nfairly recent and need not be permanent. In fact, this bill is \ncosponsored\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nby two of our Republican colleagues, Senator Collins of Maine and \nSenator Kirk of Illinois. When he came to the floor to speak on ENDA \nearlier this week, Senator Kirk noted the importance of a Senator from \nhis home State of Illinois being in a position of leadership on this \ncivil rights issue. This really is a historic opportunity.\n  When the Senate votes on final passage on the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act tomorrow, I hope we all will take advantage of this \nhistoric opportunity.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I so much appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Delaware, first speaking to the importance of rebuilding \nour manufacturing sector, of creating living-wage jobs and how \nimportant that is to building the middle class and providing the \nfoundation for families to thrive, and then speaking to the core issue \nwe are debating today, that of ending significant discrimination \nagainst millions of American citizens. His words were well spoken, I \nsay to the Senator from Delaware, and I thank him for his advocacy that \nwill make this Nation work better for so many of our fellow citizens.\n  This issue of freedom from discrimination is a core issue of freedom. \nIt is a core issue of liberty. It goes right to the heart of the \nfounding of this country. Our Founders were often chafing under the \nheavy hand from the land they came from across the ocean, and they \nwanted to be able to forge their own world where they would be able to \nparticipate fully in society. So liberty and freedom became right at \nthe heart of our founding documents.\n  Our Declaration of Independence says in its second paragraph:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights; that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  That concept of liberty was echoed when we went to our U.S. \nConstitution. It started out saying, as Americans are well aware:\n\n       We, the People of the United States, in Order to form a \n     more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  We, the people, sought in that year to establish a more perfect \nunion, and we continue in our pursuit of a more perfect union--one with \nmore complete blessings of liberty.\n  What, indeed, is liberty? That opportunity to participate fully in \nour society. This was well captured by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. \nHe was speaking in 1965 to Howard University students at their \ncommencement, and President Johnson said:\n\n       Freedom is the right to share fully and equally in American \n     society; to vote, to hold a job, to enter a public place, to \n     go to school.\n\n  President Johnson continued:\n\n       It is the right to be treated in every part of our national \n     life as a person equal in dignity and promise to all others.\n\n  I think President Johnson captured well what freedom and liberty are \nall about, as have many of our major public citizens over time as they \nsought to examine this core premise of liberty and freedom and what it \nmeant in this Nation, what it meant to create a more perfect union in \nthis regard.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt spent a lot of time talking about human rights. She \nsaid:\n\n       Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small \n     places, close to home, so close and so small that they cannot \n     be seen on any map of the world. Yet they are the world of \n     the individual person, the neighborhood he lives in, the \n     school or college he attends, the factory, farm or office \n     where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, \n     and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal \n     dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have \n     meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.\n\n  Indeed, today we are very much talking about the factory, farm, and \noffice Eleanor Roosevelt spoke about, where, if rights do not have \nmeaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.\n  It has been long recognized that the opportunity to thrive for the \nindividual is so fundamental to this notion of liberty and freedom, and \nit is also a powerful force for the good of our Nation as a whole. This \nis well captured by Theodore Roosevelt. He said:\n\n       Practical equality of opportunity for all citizens, when we \n     achieve it, has two great results. First, every man will have \n     a fair chance to make of himself all that in him lies, to \n     reach the highest point to which his capacities, unassisted \n     by special privilege of his own, unhampered by the special \n     privilege of others, can carry him; to get for himself and \n     his family substantially what he has earned.\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt continued:\n\n       Second, equality of opportunity means that the commonwealth \n     will get from every citizen the highest service of which he \n     is capable. No man who carries the burden of the special \n     privileges of another can give to the commonwealth that \n     service to which it is fairly entitled.\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt was speaking in the masculine, but he was talking \nabout all citizens--men and women--equality of opportunity for the \nindividual and for the benefit of society.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy summarized this concept much more succinctly. He \ndid so on August 5, 2009, when the bill that is before this body was \nintroduced in that year, the 2009 version. He said:\n\n       The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as \n     justice is denied to even one among us.\n\n  So, again, the success of the individual in gaining full access to \nliberty and freedom, full opportunity to participate in society, builds \na stronger community, a stronger State, and a stronger Nation.\n  The bill we have before us today is a simple concept: That an \nindividual can pursue that place on the farm or in the factory or in \nthe office without discrimination; that the LGBT citizen has full \nopportunity to fulfill their potential in the workplace.\n  Religious groups from across America have weighed in to say how \nimportant and valuable that is. Here is a sign-on letter--a letter that \nis signed by approximately 60 religious groups across America. It is \naddressed to each of us in this Chamber.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our organizations, representing \n     a diverse group of faith traditions and religious beliefs, we \n     urge you to support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As \n     a nation, we cannot tolerate arbitrary discrimination against \n     millions of Americans just because of who they are. Lesbian, \n     gay, bisexual, and transgender people should be able to earn \n     a living, provide for their families, and contribute to our \n     society without fear that who they are or who they love could \n     cost them a job. ENDA is a measured, commonsense solution \n     that will ensure workers are judged on their merits, not on \n     their personal characteristics like sexual orientation or \n     gender identity. We call on you to pass this important \n     legislation without delay.\n\n  This letter from these roughly 60 religious organizations continues:\n\n       Many of our religious texts speak to the important and \n     sacred nature of work . . . and demand in the strongest \n     possible terms the protection of all workers as a matter of \n     justice. Our faith leaders and congregations grapple with the \n     difficulties of lost jobs every day, particularly in these \n     difficult economic times. It is indefensible that, while \n     sharing every American's concerns about the health of our \n     economy, LGBT workers must also fear for their job security \n     for reasons completely unrelated to their job performance.\n       Our faith traditions, the letter continues, hold different \n     and sometimes evolving beliefs about the nature of human \n     sexuality and marriage as well as gender identity and gender \n     expression, but we can all agree on the fundamental premise \n     that every human being is entitled to be treated with dignity \n     and respect in the workplace. In addition, any claims that \n     ENDA harms religious liberty are misplaced. ENDA broadly \n     exempts from its scope houses of worship as well as \n     religiously affiliated organizations. This exemption--which \n     covers the same religious organizations already exempted from \n     the religious discrimination provisions of Title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964--should ensure that religious \n     freedom concerns don't hinder the passage of this critical \n     legislation.\n\n  Then this letter concludes:\n\n       We urge Congress to swiftly pass the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act so that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \n     transgender Americans have an equal opportunity to earn a \n     living and provide for themselves and their families.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the sign-on \nlist associated with this letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sincerely,\n       Affirmation--Gay and Lesbian Mormons, African American \n     Ministers in Action, American Conference of Cantors, American \n     Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, The Association of \n     Welcoming & Affirming Baptists, Bend the Arc Jewish Action \n     B'nai B'rith International, Brethren Mennonite Council for \n     Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Interests Call To \n     Action, Central Conference of American Rabbis,\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\n     DignityUSA, Disciples Home Missions, The Episcopal Church, \n     Equally Blessed, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, The \n     Evangelical Network, The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, \n     Friends Committee on National Legislation, Global Faith & \n     Justice Project, Horizons Foundation.\n       The Global Justice Institute, Hadassah, The Women's Zionist \n     Organization of America, Inc., Hindu American Foundation, The \n     Interfaith Alliance, Integrity USA, Islamic Society of North \n     America, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Jewish Labor \n     Committee, Jewish Women International, Keshet, Methodist \n     Federation for Social Action, Metropolitan Community \n     Churches, More Light Presbyterians, Mormons for Equality \n     Mormons Building Bridges, Muslims for Progressive Values, \n     Nehirim, New Ways Ministry, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), \n     Progressive National Baptist Convention.\n       The Rabbinical Assembly, Reconcilng Works, Lutherans for \n     Full Participation, The Reconstructionist Rabbinical \n     Association, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Religious \n     Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Religious Institute, Sikh \n     American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF), \n     Sojourners, Soulforce, Tru'ah Union for Reform Judaism, \n     United Church of Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries, \n     United Church of Christ, Office for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual \n     and Transgender Ministries United Church of Christ, Wider \n     Church Ministries, United Methodist, General Board of Church \n     and Society, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, \n     Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual (WATER), \n     Women of Reform Judaism.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a list that Americans \nwill well be familiar with, including Methodist groups, Lutheran \ngroups, Jewish groups, and so on and so forth, from the spectrum of \nProtestant religions, Christian religions, and other religions. It is \npowerful and helpful that they have written to share their \nperspectives, and I thank them for doing so.\n  Business coalitions have also weighed in. I have here a letter from \nthe Business Coalition for Workplace Fairness. Their letter is much \nshorter. It is signed by approximately 120 companies. I will read it \nfor my colleagues now. It says:\n\n       The majority of United States businesses have already \n     started addressing workplace fairness for lesbian, gay, \n     bisexual, and transgender employees. But we need a federal \n     standard that treats all employees the same way.\n       The Business Coalition for Workplace Fairness is a group of \n     leading U.S. employers that support the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act, a federal bill that would provide the \n     same basic protections that are already afforded to workers \n     across the country.\n       Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees are not \n     protected under federal law from being fired, refused work or \n     otherwise discriminated against. ENDA would do just that.\n\n  These are companies that include American Eagle Outfitters to Morgan \nStanley, Charles Schwab to Nike, General Mills to Xerox, and Hilton \nWorldwide to Apple, and so on and so forth.\n  Speaking of Apple, it might be interesting to hear the perspectives \nof the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook. He wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street \nJournal, and here is what he had to say. This was published, by the \nway, on November 3, just a few days ago. He said:\n\n       Long before I started work as the CEO of Apple, I became \n     aware of a fundamental truth: People are much more willing to \n     give of themselves when they feel that their selves are being \n     fully recognized and embraced.\n       At Apple, we try to make sure people understand that they \n     don't have to check their identity at the door. We're \n     committed to creating a safe and welcoming workplace for all \n     employees, regardless of their race, gender, nationality or \n     sexual orientation.\n       As we see it, embracing people's individuality is a matter \n     of basic human dignity and civil rights.\n\n  Tim Cook continues:\n\n       It also turns out to be great for the creativity that \n     drives our business. We've found that when people feel valued \n     for who they are, they have the comfort and confidence to do \n     the best work of their lives.\n       Apple's antidiscrimination policy goes beyond the legal \n     protections U.S. workers currently enjoy under federal law, \n     most notably because we prohibit discrimination against \n     Apple's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees.\n       A bill now before the U.S. Senate--\n  Of course, this bill we are currently debating--\n\n     would update those employment laws, at long last, to protect \n     workers against discrimination based on sexual orientation \n     and gender identity.\n       We urge Senators to support the Employment \n     Nondiscrimination Act, and we challenge the House of \n     Representatives to bring it to the floor for a vote.\n       Protections that promote equality and diversity should not \n     be conditional on someone's sexual orientation. For too long, \n     too many people have had to hide that part of their identity \n     in the workplace.\n       Those who have suffered discrimination have paid the \n     greatest price for this lack of legal protection. But \n     ultimately we all pay a price.\n       If our coworkers cannot be themselves in the workplace, \n     they certainly cannot be their best selves. When that \n     happens, we undermine people's potential and deny ourselves \n     and our society the full benefits of those individuals' \n     talents.\n       So long as the law remains silent on the workplace rights \n     of gay and lesbian Americans, we as a nation are effectively \n     consenting to discrimination against them.\n       Congress should seize the opportunity to strike a blow \n     against such intolerance by approving the Employment \n     Nondiscrimination Act.\n\n  Again, that is a letter from Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, published in \nthe Wall Street Journal.\n  So we see this long arch in pursuit of a vision of liberty and \nfreedom, from our early settlers of North America, to the Declaration \nof Independence, to the opening words of our U.S. Constitution, to our \nleaders through a scope of time who recognized the power of liberty in \nfulfilling the potential of the individual and the potential of the \nNation, to our current religious leaders and our current business \nleaders. It is time we take another bold stride in this long journey \ntoward freedom and liberty for all Americans. In that regard, I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this legislation before us. It will \nmake a difference in millions of lives, and it will make a difference \nin the strength and character of our Nation.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I spoke at some length on this bill, the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, the other day, but as we move to end \ndebate on the bill itself, I want to once again express the critical \nnature of the bill for ensuring equality in the workplace for all \nAmericans.\n  I was just on the floor listening to Senator Merkley's very poignant \nremarks, and I want everyone to know that we would not be here at this \npoint in time with this bill before us ready for passage tomorrow were \nit not for the leadership and the persistence of Senator Merkley from \nOregon. He has been a champion of this issue since he served in the \nOregon Legislature, and when he first came here he became a champion of \nthis bill. He truly picked up the mantle of Senator Ted Kennedy in \npicking this bill out from sort of the ashes of 1996, the last time--\nthe only time--we ever had a vote.\n  I say through the Chair to my friend from Oregon, we thank you for \nyour doggedness on this issue and for working across the aisle, on both \nsides of the aisle, to bring it first to our committee and then getting \nit through the committee and now on the floor.\n  Again, I want the record to show that it was Senator Merkley who \nreally spearheaded this effort, along with Senator Mark Kirk on the \nRepublican side. The two of them fought very hard to get us to this \npoint and to make sure we were actually debating it. So we are greatly \nindebted to the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  We had an incredible vote the other night that demonstrated more \nclearly than anything I can say that the Members of this body believe \nin the message of equality and fairness that is embodied in this bill. \nThe commitment and good faith with which Members have negotiated and \noffered amendments has been a tribute to the Senate. What we are seeing \nhere is how the Senate ought to work. This is sort of the Senate at its \nbest. We can do business here and get important work done when we share \na commitment to fairness and when we act in a spirit of compromise and \ngood will.\n  I listened to the Senator from Oregon, who so eloquently pointed out \nthat too many of our citizens are being judged not by what they can \ncontribute to a business or an organization but by who they are or whom \nthey choose to love. Well, the Senate is poised to take an important \nstep toward changing that.\n  Quite frankly, I say with all candor, I think the American people \nhave gotten way ahead of us on this one. The American people--a great \nmajority--believe in the right of an individual to earn a living free \nfrom discrimination and to be judged in the workplace\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nbased on their integrity, their ability, and their qualifications. This \nbill ensures that the same basic employment protections against \ndiscrimination that already protect American workers on the basis of \nrace, religion, ethnicity, gender, and disability also apply to \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n  It is rare to have before us a bill with such broad and deep support. \nENDA is supported by some 60 faith-based organizations, including \ncongregations and organizations varying from the Presbyterian Church \nand the Episcopal Church to the Progressive National Baptist \nConvention, the Union of Reform Judaism, the Union Synagogue of \nConservative Judaism, and the Islamic Society of North America.\n  A poll showed that 76 percent of American Catholics support basic \nworkplace protections for gay and transgender workers, and in the same \npoll almost 70 percent of evangelical Christians support employment \nprotections for LGBT persons.\n  Over 100 businesses support the bill, everything from Pfizer, Levi \nStrauss, to Hershey, Capital One, Alcoa, Marriott Hotels, \nInterContinental Hotels, Texas Instruments, and on and on.\n  Seventy-four percent of Fortune 100 companies and nearly 60 percent \nof Fortune 500 companies already have sexual orientation and gender \nidentity nondiscrimination policies in place.\n\n  In the course of our committee hearings on this bill, we heard from \nexecutives of Nike and General Mills, who both testified that ``ENDA is \ngood for business.'' A Nike representative told the committee:\n\n       Teams thrive in an open and welcoming work environment, \n     where individuals are bringing their full selves to work.\n\n  Since the Senate last considered a version of this bill in 1996, 17 \nStates--and I am proud to say, including my State of Iowa--have put \nlegislation in place that includes these basic employment protections \nfor LGBT citizens. Those laws have been implemented seamlessly and have \nnot led to any significant increase in litigation. But certainly that \nis not to say what we are doing here is not necessary. The majority of \nAmericans--56.6 percent--still live in States where it is perfectly \nlegal to fire someone or refuse to hire them because of who they are--a \nlesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender American.\n  Discrimination in the workplace is real. Forty-two percent of LGBT \nworkers report having experienced some form of discrimination at work. \nSeven percent reported having lost a job as a result of their sexual \norientation. Far too many hard-working Americans continue to be judged \nnot by their ability and their qualifications but by their sexual \norientation or gender identity.\n  I talked the other day about Sam Hall, a West Virginia miner who \nfaced destruction of his property and verbal harassment from his \nworkers because of his identity as a gay person. Sam is one of those \nmillions of Americans who have no legal recourse without the law. I \nalso talked about Kylar Broadus, who faced intense harassment at work \nas he transitioned from female to male and who has never recovered \nfinancially. I talked about Allyson Robinson, who was forced to live in \na different State, apart from her family, because she could not find a \njob as an openly transgender female. This law will make a real \ndifference for these Americans and for millions more like them.\n  I remember 23 years ago I stood at this podium, at this desk, as the \nsponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as the chair then of \nthe Subcommittee on Disability Policy. Senator Kennedy was the chair at \nthat time. I talked about the necessity for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act in terms of a courthouse door.\n  I pointed out that as of that time, if you were an African American \nor a woman or let's say you were Jewish and you went down to get a job \nfor which you were fully qualified and the employer said: I'm not \nhiring Black people; I don't hire Black people; I don't like you; get \nout of here; I don't hire Jews; get out of here, you could leave there \nand go right down the street to the courthouse, and the courthouse door \nwas open to you because in 1964 we passed the Civil Rights Act that \ncovered people that way. We said: You have recourse under law for \nviolations of your inherent civil rights based on sex, national origin, \nreligion, race.\n  But, as of 1990, if you were a person with a disability and you went \ndown to the prospective employer to get a job for which you were fully \nqualified and the prospective employer said: Get out of here; I don't \nhire cripples; get out of here, and you wheeled your wheelchair down \nthe street to the courthouse, the doors were locked. You had no \nrecourse under law for that violation of your civil rights because it \nwas not a civil right. So in 1990 we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and now the courthouse door is open. If you are \ndiscriminated against because of your disability, you can go down to \nthe courthouse. You have the law on your side.\n  I stand here today, 23 years later, saying that we have covered civil \nrights laws in this country for almost everyone--except for those for \nwhom gender identity or sexual orientation is part of who they are. \nThat is true.\n  As I pointed out, we have reams of records here: people fired because \nthey were gay or lesbian--not because they could not do the job, not \nbecause they were not doing their job, they were fired just because of \nwho they were. Guess what. That gay person walked down to that \ncourthouse door. It was locked. It was locked, just as it was for \npeople with disabilities before 1990, just as it was for African \nAmericans before 1964, and for women.\n  I mean these young people working here, these young women, they do \nnot realize in the lifetime of their parents, at least their \ngrandparents anyway, you could fire someone because she was a woman or \nnot hire someone because she was a woman. Guess what. The courthouse \ndoor was locked. You had no recourse.\n  Some States passed civil rights laws. So we had some States pass \ncivil rights laws. As I said, we have 17 States in America that do have \nlaws on the books that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender identity. But how about the rest of the States? \nAs I said, over 56 percent of American workers live in States in which \nthere is no protection.\n  So in the long march of the American experiment, from the time of our \nfounding and the Bill of Rights, from our Declaration of Independence \nwhich said ``all people are created equal,'' step-by-step, step-by-\nstep, sometimes long, painfully--sometimes too long and too painfully--\nwe have expanded this covenant to bring more people into the American \nfamily to recognize that people should not be judged on the basis of \nsome externalities such as the color of their skin or their sex or \ntheir religion or national origin or disability or whether they are \nlesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\n  Everyone should have these civil rights, to be covered by civil \nrights so they will be judged on their contribution to society, by what \nthey do, not by who they are. That is why this vote is so important. \nThat is why this is a historic step again for the Senate.\n  You could look back and, yes, there were people who opposed the civil \nrights bill in 1964. We had people here that opposed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. But look back and see what they did for America. We \nare a stronger and a better country because of those laws that were \npassed, much better for everyone--for everyone, for our families, for \nthe elderly, for everyone.\n  I hope that those who may be thinking: Gee, I do not want to support \nthis; I am not a big fan of gay people or I may have some religious \nproblems on that, we have religious exceptions in here. That is not the \nissue. The issue is whether that should be an allowable reason to be \ndiscriminated against in employment. As I said, we have said before \nthat is not a legitimate reason for race, sex, national origin or \ndisability; why should it be a reason based upon your sexual \norientation or gender identity? I hope my fellow Senators will think \nabout what they would have done had they been here to vote on the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. What if they had been here just 23 years ago to \nvote on the Americans with Disabilities Act?\n  This Employment Non-Discrimination Act takes its place alongside all \nof those. That is why it is such a historically important vote. The \nbill's sponsors, Senator Jeff Merkley, Senator Mark Kirk, Senator Tammy \nBaldwin, Senator Susan Collins, have worked\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nlong and hard. They have worked closely with us in the committee over \nthe last few days to continue to build support for this bill, to work \nthrough proposals to change and improve the bill.\n  We are finishing the debate tomorrow. We will have the final vote on \nthis bill. Passing it with a resounding majority will send a clear \nmessage to the American people and to the House of Representatives that \nwe have waited long enough. Think about this. This bill failed by only \none vote in 1996--one vote. So here we are 27 years later. It is time \nto pass this. It is time now to end workplace discrimination against \nany member of our American family based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday in my remarks on the \nfloor that the Obama administration has had 3\\1/2\\ years to prepare for \nthe rollout of the President's signature health care law. It has had \n3\\1/2\\ years to get the Web site right and ready for its big debut. It \nhas had 3\\1/2\\ years to take all of the necessary safeguards to protect \nprivacy and the integrity of the Internet, particularly the Web site, \nand make sure it is not ripe for identity theft and other cyber \nattacks.\n  It has had 3\\1/2\\ years to get together a proper vetting system for \nthe so-called navigators. But despite all of that, despite all of that \ntime, it is quite apparent that ObamaCare is not yet ready for prime \ntime yet. In fact, it has been a slow-moving train wreck. The President \nis in Dallas today meeting with a number of the so-called navigators to \nthank them for their work.\n  I was able to ask Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, about the navigators this morning. She admitted there is no \nbackground check done on the navigators, even though they will collect \nsome of the most sensitive personal information one can have, including \nthings such as your Social Security number, that can be then used to \nhack into your accounts; your health information, whether it is mental \nor physical, which is among the most sensitive personal information \neach of us has.\n  She admitted that since they do not do any background check, she \ncould not guarantee that a convicted felon could not be a navigator. \nShe said that was possible. I think that is something that grabbed a \nlot of people's attention because they just naturally assumed that sort \nof thing has been taken care of in the 3\\1/2\\ years leading up to the \nrollout of ObamaCare.\n  We know the more people find out about this law--I liken it to an \nonion. With each layer of the onion you peel back, it just keeps \ngetting worse and worse and worse. The law is proving to be even more \nunworkable and even more disruptive than its biggest critics could have \neven imagined.\n  But I wanted to focus my remaining moments on the floor on two \nissues: privacy and security. The ObamaCare Web site went live on \nOctober 1. But according to CBS News, a deadline for final security \nplans was delayed three times this summer. A final top-to-bottom \nsecurity check was never finished before the launch. That is pretty \nastonishing, something as big, as widely anticipated, and as long \nplanned for as the rollout of ObamaCare and its Web site, a security \ncheck was not even completed before it was rolled out on October 1.\n\n  Just think what it means. It means the administration was encouraging \nAmericans to enter sensitive personal information onto the ObamaCare \nWeb site, even though it knew the Web site was not secure. Of course, \nwe know the Web site is not functioning properly now. White House \nofficials continue to refuse to even give Congress the number of people \nwho successfully navigated the ObamaCare Web site and signed up under \nthe exchanges.\n  You know what that must mean. That must mean the number is \nembarrassingly small. But they are also scrambling to do damage \ncontrol. The President is urging people to contact their local \nObamaCare navigators to sign up for health insurance and suggesting: \nMaybe you ought to do it by paper or by telephone.\n  We found out that the same queue or foulup that makes it impossible \nto sign up over the Internet is present with paper applications or \ntelephone applications as well. As I said, the President met with some \nof the ObamaCare navigators in Dallas, TX, today. I trust that the \noverwhelming number of these navigators are people who can be trusted \nwith some of the most sensitive personal information we Americans have.\n  But the problem is, we do not know for sure because they have not \nbeen vetted. There is not even a criminal background check required. \nRemember, the navigators are going to be collecting some of the most \nsensitive personal information you have, including your Social Security \nnumber, your protected health information such as your past, present or \nfuture physical or mental health.\n  We passed a law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, known as HIPAA, to protect this information because we recognized \nhow sensitive it can be. Of course, the navigators are also collecting \ninformation about your physical or e-mail address, tax information, \nbecause, of course, the Internal Revenue Service is going to be \ninstrumental in the implementation of ObamaCare.\n  There is no Federal requirement for background checks for individuals \nserving as navigators. This has to be a glaring oversight, something I \nwould hope even the most ardent advocates for ObamaCare would \nacknowledge is a big mistake and needs to be fixed. But in the absence \nof thorough background checks and reliable oversight mechanisms, the \nnavigator program could easily become a magnet for fraud and abuse.\n  We know what a big problem identity theft is already and how much \nhavoc it can present for people's personal financial affairs and \ninformation. We also know how vulnerable things such as Web sites can \nbe to cyber attacks, where people can collect information unbeknownst \nto the consumer. We have already heard some anecdotal reports about \nObamaCare navigators, including a woman who had an outstanding arrest \nwarrant at the time she was hired, along with former members of an \norganization known as ACORN that has had its own share of problems with \ncorruption and lawbreaking.\n  As I said a moment ago, those people will be allowed to collect some \nof the most sensitive personal information that we have as Americans. \nThinking of sensitive information, the most important provisions of \nObamaCare, including the individual mandates, the employer mandates and \nthe premium subsidies, will be administered by, you guessed it, the \nInternal Revenue Service, words that strike fear and trepidation in the \nhearts of many Americans, especially given the scandals the Internal \nRevenue Service has been embroiled in and the bipartisan investigations \nthat are ongoing into the cause and solution to these scandals.\n  I know I speak for many of my constituents back home in Texas and \nperhaps many other Americans when I say that the last thing we ought to \nbe doing is giving the IRS additional responsibilities until we have \ngotten to the bottom of the current scandals we are investigating on a \nbipartisan basis. We do not need to be giving them vast new powers to \nintrude into the lives of families and small businesses. As a matter of \nfact, I have introduced legislation that would prevent the IRS from \nperforming this act. The last thing we want to do when they are having \nproblems, when they are already having problems doing what they should \nbe doing, is to give them more to do without solving the underlying \nproblem.\n  Unfortunately, our friends across the aisle have blocked that \nlegislation that would ban the IRS from its current role in \nadministering ObamaCare. I would like to remind them that even if we \nignore the agency's harassment of conservative organizations and \nordinary American citizens engaging in their constitutional right to \nparticipate in the political process, we know the IRS has already shown \ncontempt for the law by announcing it will issue ObamaCare's premium \nsubsidies through the Federal exchanges, even though the law makes \nclear that premium subsidies are not available in the Federal exchange \nbut only through the State exchange.\n  That is only a minor technical detail to the IRS. They are going to \npaper that over even though Congress provided to the contrary.\n  At some point the President needs to concede that the costs of \nObamaCare\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nfar outweigh its benefits. We can do better. The choice is not between \nObamaCare and nothing; the choice is between ObamaCare and consumer-\noriented alternatives that will increase competition, lower health care \ncosts, and enable more people to be covered, together with reforms to \nMedicaid and perhaps even Medicare to make sure people have true access \nto health care coverage and not only a hollow promise.\n  At some point even the most ardent advocates for ObamaCare have to \nconcede that it is broken beyond repair. I have to say that time is not \non ObamaCare's side because each day brings a new revelation of more \nand more problems. Even some of our colleagues who voted in a party-\nline vote for ObamaCare and who voted in a party-line vote against any \nopportunity to reform ObamaCare are now saying--such as Senator Max \nBaucus, one of the chief architects--hey, maybe we need to delay the \npenalties. Senator Mary Landrieu has or will introduce a bill saying we \nought to enforce in law the President's promise that if you like what \nyou have, you can keep it, which we now know is not true. Indeed, HHS \nand the administration knew in 2010 that tens of millions of Americans \nwho liked what they had would not be able to keep their health care \nplan because of restrictive grandfathering provisions.\n  When the moment comes that Democrats and Republicans have come \ntogether to try to solve this problem--not by shoring up this fatally \nflawed structure known as ObamaCare which will never work--when they \nare ready to work with us across the aisle to enact alternative health \ncare reform that reduces costs, expands coverage, and improves equal \naccess to care--I look forward to that debate and that opportunity. I \nonly hope that day arrives sooner rather than later, before ObamaCare \nwreaks more havoc and causes more uncertainty and hardship on the \nAmerican consumer.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe Employment Non-Discrimination Act, also known as ENDA.\n  For my State it has been quite a year for equality. Last November we \nwere the first State in the country to defeat a constitutional \namendment banning marriage equality. Up to that point those amendments \nhad passed. Then, just a few months later, earlier this year, Minnesota \nbecame the 12th State to allow full marriage equality--the 12th State \nin the country.\n  I am proud to represent our State. It has been a true civil rights \npioneer. We can go back to the days of Hubert Humphrey, who once stood \non this floor, and to his speech to the 1948 Democratic convention \nwhere he talked about standing for the people of this country, standing \nfor people with disabilities, standing for the most vulnerable. That is \nthe history of our State.\n  Before striking down the amendment banning marriage equality, \nMinnesota was one of the very first States to ban discrimination based \non both sexual orientation and gender identity. That happened back in \n1993. I would say that 20 years later it is time for the rest of the \ncountry to catch up.\n  That is not to say the country hasn't made great strides towards \nfairness and equality. I am proud of our progress. Through the Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act we have made it \na Federal crime to assault someone because of their sexual orientation \nor gender identity. It wasn't that long ago we were debating the \nMatthew Shepard bill on this floor. The Presiding Officer had not yet \narrived here in the Senate, but I remember we had that debate several \ntimes through many years. We came close so many times and finally were \nable to pass it. That bill was about hate crimes and assault. The fact \nthat we have now reached this level where we are talking about the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act is truly a tribute to change in this \ncountry--the people of this country pushing for change.\n  Since the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, our gay and lesbian \nservicemembers who serve this Nation with honor and distinction can \nserve openly. That is something else that happened in this Chamber, \nsomething else someone predicted would never happen. Just this year, \nthe Supreme Court took a major step towards marriage equality by \nstriking down key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  But there is more to be done in our Nation's pursuit of equality. The \nrest of DOMA needs to be eliminated, and that is why I am a cosponsor \nof S. 1236, the Respect for Marriage Act. Federal benefits need to be \nguaranteed for domestic partners of Federal employees in States that \nhaven't yet adopted marriage equality, as my State of Minnesota has, \nand that is why I am a cosponsor of S. 1529, the Domestic Partnership \nBenefits and Obligations Act of 2013.\n  As we discuss policies affecting LGBT Americans, we also need better \ndata. We need to better understand the disparities people experience \nbecause of their sexual orientation and gender identity. That is why I \nam working to strengthen our data collection in these areas. And, of \ncourse, we need to pass ENDA--the topic before us today.\n  The bill before the Senate would be a major step forward for \nequality. I urge my colleagues to support the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act because protections against discrimination in the \nworkplace need to be extended to all Americans, no matter their gender \nidentity or sexual orientation.\n  Americans have many different views on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity, but I think we can all agree every person deserves to be \ntreated with dignity in the workplace. In 29 States across the country \nit is still legal to fire someone based on their sexual orientation. In \n29 States it is still legal to fire someone because they are gay, and \ncurrently there is no Federal law prohibiting this from happening. That \nis why we need ENDA and why I am a proud cosponsor of this bill.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will provide basic and \nnecessary protections against workplace discrimination--protections \njust like the ones we have had in place in Minnesota since 1993. ENDA \nwill allow all Americans to earn a living without fear that who they \nare or whom they love will cost them their job.\n  The law is not intended to give anyone any special treatment. It \nsimply extends Federal employment discrimination protections such as \nthe ones currently provided based on race or religion, and applies \nthose now to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n  The American people are coming together behind this measure. More \nthan two-thirds of people in this country, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, support a Federal law protecting LGBT individuals from \ndiscrimination in the workplace. The bill has the support of over 200 \ncivil rights, religious, labor, and women's organizations. It upholds \nand protects religious liberty by exempting houses of worship and \nreligiously affiliated organizations.\n  Companies and businesses big and small know that discrimination in \nthe workplace hurts their bottom line. That is why, as the Senate chair \nof the Joint Economic Committee, I released a fact sheet on the \neconomic consequences of workplace discrimination. It is easy to see \nwhy businesses are on the side of equality. A majority of the top 50 \nFortune 500 companies say prodiversity policies increase profitability.\n  We have certainly seen that in Minnesota, where General Mills, a \nmajor company, came out this last year as a company--and their CEO--\nagainst the constitutional amendment that would have banned marriage \nequality. The CEO of St. Jude's--St. Jude, the company--did the same. \nThe Carlson company--Radisson Hotels--did the same. You could go \nthrough a list of a number of large businesses in our States that say \nno to discrimination and yes to equality.\n  Why did they do that? I think many of them felt it was the morally \nright thing to do. But the other reason they did it is because it was \ngood for business. One poll found that 63 percent of small businesses \nsupport greater legal\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\nprotections for LGBT workers. Workplace discrimination, as we know, \ndiminishes workforce morale, lowers productivity, and increases costs \ndue to employee turnover.\n  In our State we want to attract the best workers. If you cut off a \nwhole bunch of workers and tell them this isn't really a good place to \nbe because we won't let you get married or we are going to discriminate \nagainst you, it ends up hurting that State.\n  The same is true as we look at the global economy. It is true of the \nworld. We want to be a country that welcomes people of all races to our \ncountry. We want to be a country that welcomes people of all religions. \nWe want to be a country that welcomes people of different sexual \norientations. That cannot be a barrier to entry in our country.\n  That is another reason, as we look at why this bill is so important--\nwhy it is important to business, why it is important to our economy--\nthat we need to get this bill passed. When you treat people fairly and \nyou focus on keeping and getting the best people, it is good for the \nbottom line.\n  The diverse coalition coming together in support of this bill reminds \nme of the people who came together in our State to defeat that divisive \nmarriage amendment and to enact marriage equality. By bringing together \ncivil rights organizations, religious groups, businesses, and Americans \nfrom across the Nation--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--we \nsent a clear message: Support fairness, support equality.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, just as 61 of us did on the vote on Monday evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to follow my friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota in explaining why I too support the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA.\n  As she has very well articulated, the notion that somehow or other \ndiscrimination of any kind against anybody should be allowed in our \nworkplaces is something I hope we would be able to, on a bipartisan \nbasis, come together on from all corners of the country and recognize \nthis is not an acceptable direction, this is not a place or a process \nwe should endorse.\n  As we all know, current law protects against discrimination in the \nworkplace for many classes of individuals. Many of us have been \ninvolved in working to refine these laws that protect against \ndiscrimination--discrimination that affects employment practice not on \nthe basis of the merit of one's work or qualifications, but solely on \nthe basis of factors unrelated to an individual's work experience, such \nas race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, disability, and sex \nor gender. We have made sure to put in place these protections against \ndiscrimination in the workplace for these classes, these categories of \nindividuals. But we now need to do the same for those in the LGBT \ncommunity, for whom discrimination on the basis of sex does not apply. \nENDA bridges that gap, and it is time that gap was closed. In fact, \nthat separation that has been in place is eliminated here.\n  Discrimination should never be tolerated in any workplace. It just \nshould not be tolerated in any workplace or, really, anywhere for that \nmatter. It is just pretty simple--no discrimination. I am a strong \nbeliever that individuals should be judged on the merit of their work \nand not how they look or how they are perceived to be.\n  Folks sometimes look at Alaska through a different lens. They think \nyou are out of sight, out of mind up north. We have a small population \nwith just a little over 700,000 people, but our communities across the \nState host a very significant LGBT community. In the three largest \ncities--Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau--by some estimates we are told \nwe rank in the top half of cities around the country with 50 or more \nsame-sex couples. So in the population centers in Alaska, we have what \nI would describe for a State with a small population a very significant \nand important part of our community, because the contributions that \ncome to our community because of those within the LGBT community make \nus, quite honestly, a better place--a better place to live and work and \nraise a family. And I believe that strongly.\n  We have a diverse population. A lot of people don't recognize or \nthink about our ethnic diversity up north. We actually have the most \nethnically diverse neighborhood in the United States of America in my \nhometown of Anchorage, in the neighborhood of Mountain View. In the \nelementary school where my kids spent their early years, there were \nover 50 home languages of the students in that neighborhood school. It \nis a pretty diverse community. It is a very rich community because of \nour diversity. Part of that diversity comes to us through the LGBT \ncommunity. And they are white, black, Hispanic, Native, urban, and \nrural; they are the active military and our veterans' population; they \nare young and they are old. They are very involved and very engaged in \nour workforce.\n  Several weeks ago, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce hosted their \npresident in Anchorage for their weekly chamber presentation. For our \ncommunity's chamber, it was an interesting enough speaker that the \nlocal newspaper actually did an advanced story about it. There were \nsome who were a little anxious and concerned that perhaps this would \nbring out some aspects of the community who would say: We don't want to \nsee discrimination end in our workplace; we don't want to be welcoming \nof our LGBT community. As it turned out, it was exactly the opposite. \nThe reception at the chamber meeting was one of inclusion and one of a \ndesire to truly embrace the economic opportunities that come with a \ncommunity which embraces all people, all genders, and truly all \nAmericans.\n  When we were approaching the markup of ENDA in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, there was considerable outflow of \nsupport and communications from constituents all over the State. They \nshared their stories of employment discrimination for a host of \ndifferent reasons. They told that they were discriminated against \nbecause they were too gay, they were discriminated against because they \nwere too feminine or too masculine for their place of employment, and \nin terms of the outcry from constituents in saying: Please finally \naddress this, please ensure that in our workplaces there is no \ndiscrimination; there is not only a friendly workplace, but a workplace \nwhere we are free from any form of retaliation.\n  Like any proposed legislation that affects employers and employees \nalike, I believe we have to find appropriate balance. We have to strike \nthat between protecting employees against discrimination in the \nworkplace and making sure that employers are not unduly burdened with \ncompliance costs. I think we recognize that. We have to find this \nappropriate balance among legal remedies and redress.\n  I am pleased the Senate has adopted Senator Portman's amendment \ntoday, which I have supported, which protects religious employers from \nretaliation by the government when they adhere to their religious \nconvictions and then also clarifies the importance of protecting \nreligious freedom as part of ENDA. I think that is an improvement to \nthe bill, and I am pleased we have been able to advance that.\n  I wish to recognize Senator Merkley for his leadership on this \nissue--I think from the very time he came here to the Senate, he has \napproached me in discussion about advancing the ENDA legislation, \nensuring that from the perspective of our workplaces there is full \nequality, there is no discrimination within the workplace--and Senator \nKirk, for his leadership in this initiative as well.\n  I am also pleased we are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to \nhopefully advance this bill fully and finally through the floor of the \nSenate. It is well past time that we, as elected representatives, \nensure that our laws protect against discrimination in the workplace \nfor all individuals, and we ensure those same protections for those \nwithin the LGBT community. I look forward to the vote tomorrow, and\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\nhope there is strong support for ensuring a level of fairness \nthroughout our workplaces in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor her powerful endorsement of this bill. She is a member of the HELP \nCommittee. Along with Senators Mark Kirk and Orrin Hatch, she led the \nRepublican support for this bill when it was being considered by the \nHELP Committee.\n  I believe the Senator from Alaska did an extraordinary job of \noutlining why this bill should pass and why it must pass. It is a \nmatter of fairness, and it is a matter of demonstrating that there is \nsimply no place in the workplace for discrimination.\n  It is significant that most of our large businesses and many of our \nsmaller ones have voluntarily adopted antidiscrimination policies. They \nhave done so because they want to attract and retain the best and \nbrightest employees they can find. They know that sexual orientation \nand gender identity are irrelevant to an individual's ability to do a \ngood job. What counts are qualifications, skills, hard work, and job \nperformance. The legislation--which I am very hopeful we will pass \ntomorrow--will help ensure that is the focus in workplaces throughout \nAmerica.\n  As the Senator from Alaska has pointed out, however, we were also \nvery careful to respect religious freedom and liberty in this bill. I \nagree with her assessment that the amendment offered by Senator Portman \nand his colleagues helps strengthen that part of the bill by \nprohibiting any retaliation against religious organizations or \nemployers who legitimately qualify for an exemption under ENDA. We want \nto make sure those employers receive and are able to compete for \nFederal grants and contracts just as those employers and businesses \nwhich are not exempt under this bill can compete for Federal contracts \nand grants. So I believe the Portman language does strengthen the bill.\n  I hope we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this \nbill with a strong vote. I then hope our colleagues on the House side \nwill follow suit, and that we can see this bill signed into law.\n  But my purpose in rising once again today is to thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska for her strong support, and for making a very powerful \nargument and for sharing the experiences in her State. I am sure her \nwords help reinforce the support for this highly significant \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I also thank the Senators who are \ngathered here today for their stalwart support. Senator Merkley, whom \nSenator Murkowski mentioned, from the day he got to the Senate and \nactually before when he was in Oregon, has been working on this issue; \nand also Senator Collins for working with Senator Kirk and the \nleadership and the courage she has shown on nearly every issue that has \ncome before this Chamber; and then Senator Murkowski. I love that she \ncan talk about Alaska's sense of independence and their belief that you \ntreat people well and you don't discriminate against them, and the \npicture of her in her neighborhood with all the diversity. I think a \nlot of people in other States don't expect that of Alaska but anyone \nwho has visited there sees it firsthand.\n  Senator Portman's amendment is a good amendment. The Presiding \nOfficer is the other senator from Ohio. I was going through my Twitter \nfeed while watching the election coverage last night and came across a \ntweet from Senator Portman's son Will, who is in college. The tweet \ntalked about his dad's vote on ENDA, and it said: Way to go, Dad. So I \nurge my colleagues or anyone who wants to get a tweet from their own \nkids or nieces, nephews, or grandkids--who seem to understand a little \nmore quickly than some of our Members here how important it is to treat \npeople fairly--that they too, if they vote with us, can get a tweet \nfrom some young person which says: Way to go, Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I want to take the opportunity to say a word or two \nwhile our colleagues from Alaska and Maine are here. These two \ncolleagues, representing the far northwest and far northeast of the \nUnited States, have brought so much wisdom and so much determination to \nthis topic of treating all citizens with respect, providing all \ncitizens with a full measure of liberty to be deeply engaged in every \naspect of American life. That certainly includes the workplace, and \nthat topic, discrimination in the workplace, is before us today.\n  Senator Collins was the chief Republican sponsor for the first 2 \nyears I was in the Senate. She passed on the baton to Senator Kirk but \ndid not stop championing this bill, and late last night was working and \nhas been holding meetings for the many days and weeks that have led up \nto this moment--and over the years that have led us to this moment. I \nsay thank you very much to the senior Senator from Maine for her \nengagement and advocacy of fairness for all Americans.\n  My colleague from Alaska, it was a pleasure to exchange voice mails \nas we prepared for the Monday night, knowing that she would not be able \nto be here for that vote but was sending good wishes. We were uncertain \nwhether we would have 60 votes that night or whether we would have the \nfloor open until midnight or whether we would be voting the next day in \norder to have her support be the support that put us over the top. But \nlong before that vote occurred she too was talking to her colleagues, \nnoting that freedom for American citizens means freedom to pursue your \nmission in life, your meaning in life through your work. Discrimination \nin the workplace diminishes the individual and diminishes the full \npotential of our Nation as well.\n  We are now all hoping that we will be able to have final votes on \namendments and votes to close debate and to have a final vote sometime \ntomorrow. That work is not yet done. The path before us may still have \nunexpected challenges to be overcome. But as we overcome them and \napproach that final vote, it will be in large measure because of the \nterrific work of these two colleagues.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Charles A. ``Chazz'' Salkin\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, my wife ran into one of our old colleagues \nthe other day, a guy named Ted Kaufman. He was the interim Senator who \nsucceeded Joe Biden and held down that slot for 2 years until Senator \nChris Coons was elected on his own, not that long ago. One of the \nthings I loved about Ted was, every month he would come to the floor \nand he would talk about a different Federal employee. Sometimes I heard \nour colleagues or would hear other people talk about Federal employees \nor State or local employees as nameless, faceless bureaucrats in a \nderisive way, uncomplimentary and, I expect, dispiriting.\n  The folks who serve in the Federal Government or State and local \ngovernment do so usually not because it pays a lot of money or because \nthey get huge bouquets and a lot of credit but because they want to do \nsomething constructive with their lives.\n  Ted used to do that every month when he would come to the floor. This \nis like a shout-out to him because I heard about a fellow in Delaware \nwho decided to step down after a great career of public service and I \nwant to take a few minutes, if I could, to talk about him. The person I \nhave in mind today is the fellow who is stepping down as the director \nof our Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation. His name is Charles \nA. Salkin. We call him Chazz. He was appointed the director of the \ndivision a couple of months before I became Governor. He was appointed \non June 1, 1992. He continued to serve\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nwith distinction in that capacity, leading the Division of Parks and \nRecreation for the 8 years I served as Governor, and then he went on to \nserve for two more Governors after me. He served Republican Governor \nMike Castle before me, and a Democratic administration, for a total of \nfour Governors.\n  That doesn't happen everyday in every State. When you get those kinds \nof opportunities it must mean you are pretty good. In his case he was \nvery good.\n  He is now retiring from the post after more than 35 years of service \nto the people of our State. For over three decades he has been a \ntremendous leader and real advocate for the educational, for the \nmental, for the physical benefits of State parks.\n  He is also a devoted husband to his wife of 40 years, a woman named \nSue, who is very accomplished in her own right. She recently retired as \ndeputy director of the Delaware Division of the Arts. They have a \ndaughter Emily, who I believe is now grown.\n  It is kind of interesting to see where they pull up their anchors and \nsail off into the sunrise. But, Chazz and Sue, we thank them for the \ngreat service to the people of our State and wish them and Emily well. \nTheir hard work and creativity and dedication will be missed a whole \nlot. We will remember for many years the tremendous contributions they \nhave made.\n  Since 1978, Chazz has played an active role in the expansion of \nDelaware's open space areas and in the development of programs that \nintroduce Delawareans and visitors of all ages to the historical and \nrecreational benefits of our State parks. As he steps down from the \nposition as director of the Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation, \nwe give him our sincere thanks and thank his staff too for their \ndiligent and longstanding efforts to maintain Delaware's reputation as \nhaving one of the most dynamic and innovative park systems in the \nNation.\n  Throughout his career, Chazz has been a visionary whose creativity \nand forward thinking has changed the very nature our State park system. \nFrom the institution of zip lines to kayak rentals, Chazz has done a \ntremendous job of inspiring the love of nature in just about all \nDelawareans. He has played an important role in securing Delaware's \nfootprint in the national park system with the recent naming of the \nFirst State national monument.\n  Delaware was the first State to ratify the Constitution. William Penn \ncame to America through Delaware. One of the oldest houses in all of \nNorth America is in Lewes, DE, apparently a Dutch settlement some 275 \nyears ago. We were the first State to ratify the Constitution. We have \ndone a lot of ``firsts'' for a little State.\n  We do not have a national park. We have been working on it for a \nnumber of years with Chazz, and now Chris Coons and John Carney have \ntaken up the mantle.\n  We have a First State national monument. We are thankful for that. \nThank you, Vice President Biden.\n  We have been knocking on the door for a national park. Chazz and his \npeople have been great laborers with us in that effort.\n  Chazz's research, his professional leadership, and personal \nmembership in all kinds of organizations such as the National \nAssociation of State Park Directors and the National Association of \nState Outdoor Recreation Liaison Officers, have also supported \nDelaware's natural resources and emphasized our State parks' value to \nDelaware's financial success.\n  In places such as Oregon, Senator Merkley, the Presiding Officer from \nOhio, Senator Collins, who is still on the floor--their States have \nwonderful national parks. As it turns out, the top destination, tourist \ndestination for people who come to the United States from other \ncountries is our national parks. We don't have one in Delaware. We want \none. In the meantime our State parks have sort of filled the gap. We \nhave some State parks of which we are real proud. One of the guys who \nworked very hard to make them something we can be proud of is Chazz \nSalkin.\n  He has undoubtedly left a legacy of achievement, persistence, and \npassion with the members of the Parks and Recreation team that included \nhundreds of people over the past 35 years. We in the State of Delaware \nare truly grateful for everything Chazz has done to protect our State's \nbeauty and history.\n  On behalf of Senator Chris Coons, our colleague here in the Senate, \non behalf of John Carney, our lone Congressman over in the House, we \nwholeheartedly thank Chazz for 35 years of service to the State of \nDelaware. His model leadership and dedication have improved the quality \nof life for visitors and residents who come to our State from all over \nthe world. We offer our sincere congratulations on a job well done and \nwish him and Sue and their family many happy and successful years to \ncome.\n  We struggle at the Federal Government to pay for things. We struggle \nat the State level to have the revenues to pay for the kinds of \nservices our citizens want. One of the things I especially admired in \nthe work done by Chazz Salkin is a growing reliance, over time, on \ninviting people--could be young people, could be older people, could be \nretired, maybe not, could be students, could be senior citizens, but \npeople who would like to volunteer some of their time to help in our \nnational parks. It will be interesting to be able to look at the number \nof volunteer hours that have been amassed over the years in service to \nour national parks and compare that on a per-capita-basis to the rest \nof the country. I think we stack up pretty well.\n  One of the things we have done in our State, in no small part because \nof Chazz's leadership, is to invite volunteers to come in to help out, \nto make our parks better than they ever were before and to benefit from \nthat by feeling they helped us to accomplish something really good for \nnow and for a long time in the future.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CARPER. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my friend from \nDelaware. He and I have been together for 31 years and I appreciate \nhim. I wanted to make sure Senator Collins was on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my motion to proceed to Calendar No. 236, \nH.R. 3204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past Monday I visited a senior center \nin Youngstown, OH, and met with seniors and others, talking about what \nthey hear as threats to Social Security. They hear some of the wise \npeople in this town, if you will--some of the people on television and \nthe political pundits and the economists and the newspaper editorial \nboards--saying that we need to restructure entitlements or reform \nentitlements, and that scares them because they don't get very \nspecific. They often, in those statements about reforming entitlements, \ndon't--the people saying it and the reporters asking the questions \ndon't really scratch underneath the surface and say: What does that \nreally mean? It usually means cutting Social Security benefits, but \nmore on that in a second.\n  I spoke with a woman named Gloria, a 70-year-old widow, currently \nliving in subsidized housing. She has lived on Social Security since \nher husband's death. Her benefits barely cover the costs of housing and \ngroceries, not to mention health care. She told me that without Social \nSecurity, she would not know what to do to be able to get along in her \nlife.\n  We owe it to our children and our grandchildren to deal with this \nNation's deficit. That means everything from eliminating farm \nsubsidies--the directed payments we are doing in the farm bill, and \nSenator Thune and I wrote the language to do that. It means closing the \ncarried interest loophole for Wall Street hedge fund managers. It means \neliminating tax breaks for oil companies and stopping the idiotic--for \nwant of a better term--practice of encouraging and enticing, through \nthe Tax Code, companies to actually invest overseas, so that if you \nshut down a plant in Steubenville or Toledo and move it to Wuhan or \nXi'an, China, you actually can get tax breaks to do that.\n  I am a grandfather a couple of times and about to be a third time. I \nguess as we get older, we look at the world, not surprisingly, from a \ndifferent perspective. I see, because of Social Security and Medicare, \nthat hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans get to spend more \ntime with their children and grandchildren. That is because of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Forty-five years ago, before Medicare, 48 years \nago, half of America's seniors did not have health insurance. Today, 99 \npercent have it. We know that means people live longer, healthier \nlives. It means not just that they get to see their grandchildren, \nwhich is the pleasure and the delight of almost all grandparents, it \nalso means they get to impart their wisdom and knowledge and values to \ntheir grandchildren.\n  Margaret Mead once said wisdom and knowledge are passed from \ngrandparent to grandchild, because there is this sort of natural \ntension--or there might be--between children and parents, but between \ngrandchildren and grandparents it makes for a richer society. Because \nof these two Social Security programs, Medicare and Social Security, we \nare a richer, better country.\n  Today, 63 million Americans receive Social Security benefits. In my \nState it is 2 million. Let me give a couple of statistics, because this \nis really a moral question of what we do with our retirement system. \nFor two-thirds of seniors, Social Security is more than half of their \nincome in my State and in the State of the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho is sitting here. In the State of the Senator from Connecticut it is \nnot much different. No State is much different from this. Social \nSecurity provides more than half of the income for about two-thirds of \nseniors. For more than one-third of seniors, Social Security provides \nessentially 90 percent, or all, of their income. For one-third of \nseniors, without Social Security, they would have zero or close to zero \nincome.\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\n  It lifts 15 million Americans out of poverty. In my home State of \nOhio, if Social Security did not exist, almost half of seniors would \nlive in poverty.\n  Looking forward, improving Social Security's adequacy is the best way \nto address the retirement crisis. That is why I am working with Senator \nHarkin and Senator Begich and Senator Hirono and Senator Schatz on the \nStrengthening Social Security Act.\n  My colleagues will talk about strengthening Social Security, but what \ndo they mean by that? They usually mean that strengthening Social \nSecurity means we make cuts in benefits. Those cuts in benefits can be \nraising the retirement age, it can be something called the chained CPI, \nwhich is cutting the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. It can \nmean some kinds of means testing, so people get less, if they are a \nlittle wealthier. It can mean a whole host of things, but each of them \nis a cut to Social Security.\n  So the debate here seems to be not: How do we make seniors' lives \nbetter--when a third of seniors on Social Security get almost all their \nincome from Social Security. And they are not doing that great with \nMedicare either. With some of the copays and the deductibles and all \nthat, some get some help that way. But the debate should not be all \nabout cutting Social Security--which it really is, this whole \nstrengthening. We have to strengthen Social Security, is the way they \ntalk about it. We have to reform entitlements. We have to worry about \nthe sustainability of Social Security and Medicare, and I do worry \nabout them. But the fix is not to debate cutting these programs and \ngiving these seniors less.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, defined pension benefits are less \nthan they used to be. Fewer and fewer people retiring now have defined \npension benefits. Unless they have a government job or a good union \njob, fewer and fewer and fewer have retirement benefits. Fewer people \nare able to save money because we know in the last decade savings rates \nhave gone down because incomes--while the wealthy have done better and \nbetter and better, profits have gone up and up and up, productivity in \nthe workforce has gone up and up and up--wages have decoupled with \nthat. They have not kept up. That means people are saving less.\n  So originally as to Social Security, you would have Social Security, \nyou would have a pension, and the third of the three-legged stool is \nyou had savings. Well, now the savings and the pension--whether it is a \n401(k) or a defined pension--are less than they used to be. So Social \nSecurity is more important.\n  So why are we even discussing the whole idea of cutting Social \nSecurity? That is why we need a fairer COLA to start with. The Harkin \nbill would formalize a Consumer Price Index for the Elderly that \ncalculates the Consumer Price Index, the cost-of-living adjustment, not \nthe way it does now--a 40-year-old in the workplace--it calculates it \nbased on a 70-year-old who is retired. A 40-year-old in the workplace \nhas a very different set of expenses for their standard of living than \ndoes a 70-year-old. Obviously, the 40-year-old spends less on health \ncare, on the average, than the 70-year-old, on the average, spends on \nhealth care. So we should calculate the cost-of-living adjustment that \nway.\n  That is not what so many people in this body want to do. There is \njust something about a bunch of Members of Congress, who have good \nsalaries, who have good taxpayer-financed health care, making decisions \nto cut Social Security and cut Medicare.\n  I will close with this because I know Senator Shaheen is scheduled to \nspeak and I will not take much longer.\n  But I hear these self-appointed budget hawks, most of whom will not \nbe relying--almost none of whom, colleagues here, will be relying--on \nSocial Security to make ends meet in their retirement. I take a back \nseat to nobody in what we do about budget cuts because I have been \ninvolved with a lot of colleagues on both sides of the aisle on how we \ndeal with budget deficits. But when you hear these self-appointed \nfiscal hawks, these so-called wise men--and they are mostly men--\ntalking about how we need to reform entitlements, scratch a little \ndeeper. Ask them what they mean by that. They will probably say: Well, \nwe can't sustain this. Ask them: Well, what do you mean by that? Then \nthey will probably say: Well, we need structural reform. Ask them: \nWell, what do you mean by that? Ask them the question--what do they \nreally mean? What is their idea? Their idea, almost always, is either \nraise the retirement age or cut benefits in some ways, cut the cost-of-\nliving adjustment, something like that.\n  I will close with this. As to that townhall I was attending in \nYoungstown, I was there 3 years ago at a townhall, and a woman stood up \nand said: I have two jobs, both $9 or $10 an hour jobs. I have worked \nall my life this hard. She said: Do you know what. I am 63 years old. I \njust have to find a way to stay alive until I am 65--just for another \nyear and a half--so I can have health insurance.\n  Imagine. This is a woman living right on the edge. She will not have \nmuch from Social Security. She has no savings. She just wanted to stay \nalive until she got health insurance.\n  That is why it matters so much what we do on social insurance, why it \nmatters that we protect Medicare--really protect Medicare, not protect \nit by privatizing it.

Mr. President, almost 50 years ago Congress passed the \nCivil Rights Act. This landmark legislation prohibited discrimination \non the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, and gender in employment, \nhousing, and public accommodations. Many of us in the Senate remember \nthe passage of that legislation. And many of us, unfortunately, saw \nfirsthand the painful examples of legally sanctioned discrimination \nthat existed before the Civil Rights Act.\n  I grew up in a State where I went to segregated schools. I can \nremember the separate drinking fountains and going to the movie theater \nwhere if you were an African American you had to sit in the balcony. \nThese practices were wrong, and they ended because of the Civil Rights \nAct.\n  Well, this week the Senate has the opportunity to extend our national \nquest for equal opportunity for all by passing the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. This legislation simply prohibits employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct, and I give great credit to Jeff Merkley for sponsoring this \nlegislation and for pushing for it.\n  I was proud as Governor of New Hampshire 16 years ago to sign \nlegislation making New Hampshire only the 10th State in the country to \ninclude sexual orientation in its antidiscrimination laws. That State \nlegislation went further than the bill before the Senate this week. It \nnot only covered employment, but it covered housing and public \naccommodations as well. At the time, both the New Hampshire Senate and \nHouse were controlled by Republicans. Yet the bill passed both bodies \nwith large bipartisan majorities because it was not seen then as a \npartisan issue.\n  Including sexual orientation in New Hampshire's antidiscrimination \nlaws was just one more step forward in New Hampshire's long history of \npromoting civil rights. No one in America should be hired or fired \nbecause of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  I realize, as we all do, that no law can erase prejudice. Prejudice \nwill continue to exist after the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nbecomes law. But that is not the issue. The issue is whether it is \nacceptable as a matter of law in the United States to hire or fire\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nsomeone because of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  When we declared our independence from Great Britain back in 1776, \nour Founders stated:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal. . . .\n\n  Of course, I would add women to that. But equality under the law is \npart of our national creed. We have an opportunity this week to take \nanother step forward in advancing equal opportunity for all. Let's pass \nthe Employment Non-Discrimination Act with a very strong bipartisan \nmajority. I hope we will do that. I hope we will do it this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for a moment, the day after \nelections all over the country, to pay tribute to a great Georgian.\n  Yesterday, November 5, 2013, the city of Sandy Springs elected a new \nmayor by the name of Rusty Paul. But Rusty was elected to succeed Eva \nGalambos, the first and only mayor of Sandy Springs, GA--an outstanding \ncitizen of our State and a real representative of what it is about to \nbe a good citizen of Georgia.\n  For 30 years she chaired a committee called the Committee for Sandy \nSprings, from 1975 until 2005. That committee was a committee of \ncommunity members in an unincorporated area who wanted to have their \nown city, their own government, and they wanted to privatize \ngovernment.\n  They tried for 30 years to get the State legislature--for 20 of those \nyears I was a part of that legislature--to approve a municipal charter \nfor Sandy Springs. Finally, in 2004, the legislature did. In 2005, it \nwas ratified by the voters of Sandy Springs and the voters of the city \nof Atlanta, and Sandy Springs became a city.\n  Because Eva had chaired the committee to make it a city for 30 years, \nshe was selected as its first mayor and served in that capacity for 8 \noutstanding years. A city that was a typical urban sprawl, suburban \nsprawl city, she turned into one of the prettiest places in Georgia. \nShe beautified the streets, put in streetscapes, easements for \nbeautification.\n  Today, we have a beautiful linear park on the most major road that \ngoes through Sandy Springs, on Johnson Ferry Road and Abernathy--a \nlinear park where people are able to enjoy a park and have a buffer \nfrom a highway, yet improved traffic flowing through that community.\n  That was just one of many things she did in innovative ways to make \nit a better community.\n  Eva is a great citizen. She has a wonderful husband, three great \nchildren, six great grandchildren, but her seventh grandchild is the \ncity of Sandy Springs. She birthed it. She led it. She grew it. At the \nend of this year she will leave it as its mayor, but she will always be \nthere as its leading citizen.\n  So I rise today on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to Eva \nGalambos for doing the American dream--having a dream, 30 years working \nto achieve it, and at the end of those 30 years then leading it to \nbecome what she always hoped it could be: a great city, the city of \nSandy Springs, GA.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 8 minutes, followed by Senator Baldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nfor ENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This bill is about \nbasic fairness, and it is really about the Golden Rule--treating others \nas you would like to be treated. Every single American should have the \nright to earn a living and provide for his or her family without \nfearing discrimination in the workplace because of who they are and \nwhom they love. Americans like Marty Edwards, an assistant vice \npresident of First National Bank of Granbury, Texas, whose story was \nrecently featured in The Advocate. Marty was passed over for promotions \nat work despite a very strong 11-year history at the bank. When he \nasked for an explanation from his vice president and human resources \ndepartment, he was told that the workers who had received the promotion \nwere ``a better fit for the image we are looking for.'' Marty Edwards \nwas hired by the bank right out of college. He formed his professional \nidentity there. He was moving up the ladder until he came out as a gay \nman. When Edwards asked whether his sexual orientation was the main \nreason he had been denied promotion, the bank's executive vice \npresident demanded his resignation. Edwards refused, and then he was \nfired.\n  Sadly, Marty Edwards' story is not unique. Between 15 and 43 percent \nof LGBT people have experienced discrimination in the workplace or \nharassment in the workplace as a result of their sexual orientation. \nTwenty-six percent of transgender people report having been fired from \ntheir jobs because of their gender identity, and 90 percent reported \nexperiencing harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination.\n  Our fellow citizens need ENDA. I was here when ENDA was voted on so \nmany years ago when it was a Ted Kennedy bill. We did not make it then, \nbut I think we are going to make it now because Americans know that \nENDA is the right thing to do. As a matter of fact, 80 percent of \nAmericans assume there already is a law prohibiting discrimination \nagainst this community. But more than half of Americans still live in \nStates where it is perfectly legal to fire a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or \ntransgender American just because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. So that is why we need this bill. There are many States where \nthere is no protection. This bill would make sure the protections are \nnationwide.\n  Seventy percent of the American public supports ENDA. According to \nthe Washington Post, public support ranges from a high of 81 percent in \nMassachusetts to a low of 63 percent in Mississippi. So it is clear \nthat the support cuts across party affiliation and generational gaps. \nWhether they are a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent, whether they \nare a libertarian, whether they are young or old, Americans \noverwhelming support this bill. The American people are basically \ngiving us a message: This is a no-brainer. We should not have to fight \nabout it. We should just vote for it.\n  That is why I was so dismayed to read that House Speaker Boehner said \nhe would not support ENDA. His reason was that it will increase \nlitigation. Does the Speaker really think that LGBT Americans, who have \nfamilies to support and bills to pay, would rather pursue frivolous \nlawsuits than earn their pay in a workplace free of harassment and \ndiscrimination?\n  Here is what I think is really disingenuous about that. Republicans \ndo not suggest that all the other groups covered by the Civil Rights \nAct are filing frivolous lawsuits. In other words, all the rest of \nAmericans who are protected because of their religion, because of their \ncolor, because of their creed, Speaker Boehner says they are not filing \nfrivolous lawsuits and he does not want to repeal the civil rights of \nthose people. Good. Why does he think that the LGBT community is going \nto file frivolous lawsuits?\n  I have to say that evidence shows what he is saying is false. The \nSpeaker ignores the fact that the Government Accountability Office \nissued a recent report showing that in the 22 States that banned sexual \norientation discrimination in the workplace, ``there were relatively \nfew employment discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nfiled.'' In other words, there is not a problem with frivolous lawsuits \nbeing filed by the LGBT community in the States that have protective \nlaws. That is because LGBT Americans are woven into the fabric of our \nworkplaces, our communities, and every other facet of our American \nlife. This bill is about granting them the just and fair protections \nthey deserve so that they can live their lives and contribute to our \neconomy without fear of losing their jobs because of who they are or \nwhom they love. It is the moral thing to do. It makes good business \nsense. A majority of Fortune 500 companies have sexual orientation and \ngender identity nondiscrimination policies in place. Recent polling \nshows that a majority of small businesses do too.\n  I have to say that in the States where we have these laws, people are \nhappy with it. People are so happy with it that they think the whole \ncountry has already passed a law. So how could the Speaker get up and \nannounce that he is opposed to it because there will be the filing of \nfrivolous lawsuits? It is a made-up straw man, if I might say.\n  The State of California and many of our cities enforce these policies \nas well. The economy benefits.\n  Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Those who have suffered discrimination have paid the \n     greatest price for this lack of legal protection. But \n     ultimately we all pay a price. If our coworkers cannot be \n     themselves in the workplace, they certainly cannot be their \n     best selves. When that happens, we undermine people's \n     potential and deny ourselves and our society the full \n     benefits of those individuals' talents.\n\n  I thank Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, for those progressive thoughts.\n  Employers know they will be the most competitive when they hire and \nretain the best people, and folks will apply for and strive to keep \ntheir jobs if they know a company only considers their qualifications \nfor the job and the result of their hard work--nothing more, nothing \nless.\n  I believe my colleagues will do the right thing and pass this bill. I \nwant to say to my colleague Jeff Merkley, who is not on the floor right \nnow--he has really pushed hard for this vote. I thank Senator Harry \nReid, our leader. There are many other bills that compete for \nattention. I think it was very important because what could be more \nimportant than protecting our people, protecting our sons and \ndaughters, protecting all God's children? That is what ENDA does. So I \nthink we are going to see a very good vote on this bill tomorrow. \nReally, it ought to pass by 80, 90, 100 votes because it is a very \nsimple idea: Everyone should be treated fairly. Everyone should be \ntreated equally. This Nation is at its best when we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senator from Rhode Island Mr. Whitehouse be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor again to talk \nabout the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA. This is a \nbipartisan effort to advance uniquely American values: freedom, \nfairness, and opportunity. It is about freedom--the freedom to realize \nour founding beliefs that all Americans are created equal under the \nlaw. It is about fairness, about whether lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender Americans deserve to be treated just like their families, \ntheir friends, their neighbors, and their fellow workers. It is about \nopportunity, about whether every American gets to dream the same dreams \nand chase the same ambitions and have the same shot at success.\n  On Monday this week 61 Senators, including 7 Republicans, voted to \nsupport opportunity and fairness. Today we agreed to a Republican \namendment that would strengthen the bill. Bipartisan support for the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act is growing as we head toward a vote \non passage tomorrow. I would urge all of my colleagues to join us and \nvote for this important legislation.\n  I have seen firsthand the progress we have made in recognizing that \nfairness and opportunity are not partisan issues; they are core \nAmerican values. When I served in the House of Representatives, I \nworked with Congressman Barney Frank on the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. We had many conversations with Members with varying \npolitical, personal, and religious beliefs. At times it was a difficult \ndebate. There were many disagreements. However, the tone of the debate \nhere on the Senate floor has been remarkably dignified and cordial. \nThis has been true throughout the Senate debate. In fact, I was \npleasantly surprised as a member of the HELP Committee that the \ncommittee markup of this bill took only a little over 5 minutes. I had \nbeen prepared to be in our markup for hours. This dignified tone of \ntoday's debate in committee and here on the floor reflects the progress \nour Nation has made in recognition of fairness and equality.\n  My home State of Wisconsin was the first State in the Nation to add \nsexual orientation to its antidiscrimination statute. At the time, back \nin 1982, only 41 municipalities and 8 counties in the entire United \nStates offered limited protections against discrimination based on \nsexual orientation. Wisconsin's efforts pass the Nation's first sexual \norientation antidiscrimination law was supported by a broad spectrum of \nsupporters and advocates. It was a bipartisan coalition including \nmembers of the clergy, various religious denominations, medical groups, \nprofessional groups. The measure was signed into law in Wisconsin by a \nRepublican Governor, Lee Sherman Dreyfus, who based his decision to \nsupport the measure on the success of municipal ordinances providing \nsimilar protections against discrimination.\n  Since Wisconsin passed its statute back in 1982, 20 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, representing nearly 45 percent of the population \nof the United States of America, have passed similar antidiscrimination \nmeasures. Sixteen States and the District of Columbia also protect \ntheir citizens on the basis of gender identity.\n  However, 76 million American workers have to contend with a very ugly \nreality. It is the reality that in more than two dozen States it is \nlegal to discriminate against LGBT employees. That is simply wrong. \nThis legislation seeks to right that wrong. We do not just want to live \nin a country where our rights are respected under the law; we want to \nlive in a country where we are respected for who we are, where we enjoy \nfreedom and opportunity because that is who we are as Americans.\n  The change in law that we work for this week and today can add up to \nincredible progress in our lifetime. This generation can be the one in \nwhich we fulfill the promise of freedom and equality for all, in which \nAmerica finally becomes a place where everyone's rights are respected \nat work and every family's love and commitment can be recognized and \nrespected and rewarded under the law.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize my Senate colleagues, the ones \nwith whom I have worked to advance this bill, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n  Senator Merkley, Senator Kirk, Chairman Harkin, and Senator Collins' \ntireless efforts have led us this close to the finish line with regard \nto this bill.\n  Without naming all of them, I also would like to thank my colleagues \nwho have taken the time to join in our effort to bring cloture and \nbring this debate before the body, the ones who have taken the time to \nsit down with me and my colleagues and talk through this issue so that \nwe might answer their questions and move it ahead. It means a great \ndeal. This is an important place we have reached.\n  As we prepare for the final vote tomorrow, I wish every Senator would \nstand with us and vote for fairness and opportunity. While we might not \nmeet that high mark, I do hope it is a very strong vote. Passing this \nbill with a strong majority will show America that the Senate believes \nin a future that is more equal, not less, for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. While I was awaiting my turn to speak on the floor, I \nhad the opportunity to hear both Senator Boxer and Senator Baldwin. I \ncommend both of them for very excellent and eloquent remarks and thank \nSenator Baldwin for her courage and conviction.\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n  I also know that my dear colleague in the House, Representative David \nCicilline, is watching this vote very carefully. We hope we will make \nhim, Senator Baldwin, and so many people around this country proud when \nwe take up this vote tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7869-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7869-S7870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am here today for what is now the 49th straight \nweek in which the Senate has been in session to urge that we wake up to \nthe effects of carbon pollution on the Earth's oceans and climate, that \nwe sweep away the manufactured doubt that so often surrounds this issue \nand get serious about the threat we face from climate change.\n  When I come to the floor, I often have a specialized subject. I talk \nabout the oceans and how they are affected by carbon pollution. I talk \nabout the economics around carbon pollution. I talk about the faith \ncommunity's interest in carbon pollution. Today I want to talk about \nthe role of the media in all of this.\n  In America, we count on the press to report faithfully and accurately \nour changing world and to awaken the public to apparent mounting \nthreats. Our Constitution gives the press special vital rights so that \nthey can perform this special vital role. But what happens when the \npress fails in this role? What happens when the press stops being \nindependent, when it becomes the bedfellow of special interests? The \nLatin phrase ``Quis custodiet ipsos custodes''--who will watch the \nwatchmen themselves--then becomes the question. The press is supposed \nto scrutinize all of us. Who watches them when they fail at their \nindependent role?\n  I wish to speak about a very specific example--the editorial page of \none of our Nation's leading publications, the Wall Street Journal. The \nWall Street Journal is one of America's great newspapers, and there is \nprobably none better when it comes to news coverage and reporting. It \nis a paragon in journalism until one turns to the editorial page and \nthen steps into a chasm of polluter sludge when the issue is harmful \nindustrial pollutants. When that is the issue, harmful industrial \npollutants, this editorial page will mislead its readers, will deny the \nscientific consensus, and it will ignore its excellent news pages' \nactual reporting, all to help the industry, all to help the campaign to \nmanufacture doubt and delay action.\n  As I said before, there is a denier's playbook around these issues. \nWe have seen the pattern repeat itself in the pages of the Wall Street \nJournal on acid rain, on the ozone layer, and now, most pronouncedly, \non climate change. The pattern is a simple one: No. 1, deny the \nscience; No. 2, question the motives; and No. 3, exaggerate the costs. \nCall it the polluting industry 1-2-3.\n  Let's start in the 1970s when scientists first warned that \nchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were commonly used as refrigerants \nand aerosol propellants, could break down the Earth's stratospheric \nozone layer, which would increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays \nand cause cancer. As outlined in a report by Media Matters, this is \nwhen the Wall Street Journal's editorial page embarked upon what would \nbecome a persistent and familiar pattern.\n  For more than 25 years, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page \ndoggedly printed editorials devaluing science and attacking any \nregulation of CFCs.\n  In January of 1976, an editorial proclaimed the connection between \nCFCs and ozone depletion ``is only a theory and will remain only that \nuntil further efforts are made to test its validity in the atmosphere \nitself.''\n  In May of 1979, an editorial said that scientists ``still don't know \nto what extent, if any, mankind's activities have altered the ozone \nbarrier or whether the possibly harmful effects of these activities \naren't offset by natural processes. . . . Thus, it now appears, all the \nexcitement over the threat to the ozone layer was founded on scanty \nscientific evidence.''\n  In March 1984, we read on the editorial page that concerns about \nozone depletion were based on ``premature scientific evidence.'' \nRather, it was written, ``new evidence shows that the ozone layer isn't \nvanishing after all; it may even be increasing.''\n  In March 1989, an editorial called for more research on the \n``questionable theory that CFCs cause depletion of the ozone layer'' \nand implored scientists to ``continue to study the sky until we know \nenough to make a sound decision regarding the phasing out of our best \nrefrigerants.''\n  Again, deny the science.\n  Predictably, they also attacked the motives of reformers. A February \n1992 editorial stated that ``it is simply not clear to us that real \nscience drives policy in this area.''\n  Finally, playbook 3, they have warned that action to slow ozone \ndepletion would be costly.\n  A March 1984 editorial claimed that banning CFCs would ``cost the \neconomy some $1.52 billion in forgone profits and product-change \nexpenses'' as well as 8,700 jobs.\n  An August 1990 editorial warned that banning CFCs would lead to a \n``dramatic increase in air-conditioning and refrigeration costs.'' It \nadded that ``the likely substitute for the most popular banned \nrefrigerant costs 30 times as much and will itself be banned by the \nyear 2015. The economy will have to shoulder at least $10 to $15 \nbillion a year in added refrigeration costs by the year 2000.''\n  A February 1992 editorial warned that accelerating the phase-out of \nCFCs ``almost surely will translate into big price increases on many \nconsumer products.''\n  Despite the protests of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, we \nactually listened in America to the science, and we took action. We \nprotected the ozone layer, we protected the public health, and the \neconomy prospered.\n  What about all those costs that they claimed? Looking back, we can \nsee that action to slow ozone depletion in fact saved money. According \nto the EPA's 1999 progress report on the Clean Air Act, ``every dollar \ninvested in ozone protection provides $20 of societal health benefits \nin the United States''--$1 spent, $20 saved. The Journal's response? \nSilence. They just stopped talking about it.\n  Next we will go to acid rain. In the late 1970s scientists began \nreporting that acid rain was falling on most of our Northeastern United \nStates. Guess what. Again, at the Wall Street Journal editorial page, \nout came the playbook.\n  First, they questioned the science behind the problem. A May 1980 \neditorial questioned the link between increased burning of coal and \nacid rain, concluding that existing ``data are not conclusive and more \nstudies are needed.''\n  In September 1982 the editors told us that ``scientific study, as \nopposed to political rhetoric, points more and more toward the theory \nthat nature, not industry, is the primary source of acid rain.'' Nature \nis the primary source of acid rain.\n  A September 1985 Journal editorial claimed that ``the scientific case \nfor acid rain is dying.''\n  In June 1989 the editorial page argued that we needed to wait--it is \nalways needing to wait--for science to understand, for example, to what \nextent acid rain is manmade before enacting regulations. During that \nsame period the Wall Street Journal's editorial page also smeared the \nmotive, declaring that the effort to address acid rain was driven by \npolitics, not science.\n  Consistent with No. 2 in the playbook, in July 1987 the editorial \npage wrote: ``As the acid-rain story continues to develop, it's \nbecoming increasingly apparent that politics, not nature, is the \nprimary force driving the theory's biggest boosters.''\n  Wall Street Journal editors also consistently opposed plans to \naddress acid rain because of cost concerns--No. 3 in the playbook.\n  A June 1982 editorial warned of the ``immense cost of controlling \nsulfur emissions.''\n  A January 1984 editorial claimed a regulatory program for acid rain \nwould cost ``upwards of $100 billion.''\n  These claims were made even as the evidence mounted against their \nposition, even as President Reagan's own scientific panel said that \ninaction would risk ``irreversible damage.'' Of course, the cost \nequation of the Wall Street Journal editorial page was always totally \none-sided--always the cost to clean up the pollution; never the cost of \nthe harm the pollution caused.\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n  That is the industry playbook, faithfully spouted through the \neditorial page of the Wall Street Journal--No. 1, deny the science; No. \n2, question the motives; and No. 3, exaggerate the costs.\n  But we made undeniable progress against acid rain despite the efforts \nof the editorial page. Guess what. The Journal's editorial page \nsuddenly reversed its tune. A July 2001 editorial called the cap-and-\ntrade program for sulfur dioxide ``fabulously successful,'' noting that \nthe program ``saves about $700 million annually compared with the cost \nof traditional regulation and has been reducing emissions by four \nmillion tons annually.'' On this occasion, when its effort had failed, \nthe Journal changed its tune, but until then it was still the industry \nplaybook--No. 1, deny the science; No. 2, question the motives; and No. \n3, exaggerate the costs.\n  With carbon pollution running up to 400 parts per million for the \nfirst time in human history, the Journal is using the same old polluter \nplaybook against climate change. The Journal has persistently published \neditorials against taking action to prevent manmade climate change. As \nusual, they question the science.\n  In June 1993 the editors wrote that there is ``growing evidence that \nglobal warming just isn't happening.''\n  In September 1999 the page reported that ``serious scientists'' call \nglobal warming ``one of the greatest hoaxes of all time.''\n  In June 2005 the page asserted that the link between fossil fuels and \nglobal warming had ``become even more doubtful.'' This is June 2005, \nand the Wall Street Journal editorial page is questioning whether there \nis a link between fossil fuels and global warming.\n  A December 2011 editorial declared that the global warming debate \nrequires ``more definitive evidence.''\n  As usual--back to the industry playbook--the motives of the \nscientists were smeared.\n  A December 2009 editorial claimed that leading climate scientists \nwere suspect because they ``have been on the receiving end of climate \nchange-related funding, so all of them must believe in the reality (and \ncatastrophic imminence) of global warming just as a priest must believe \nin the existence of God.''\n  As usual, we heard that tackling climate change, tackling carbon \npollution, would cost us a lot of money. In August 2009, the editorial \npage warned ``that a high CO2 tax would reduce world GDP a \nstaggering 12.9 percent in 2100--the equivalent of $40 trillion a \nyear.''\n\n  Just last month, October 2013, the editorial board of the Wall Street \nJournal warned that in the face of climate change, ``interventions make \nthe world poorer than it would otherwise be.''\n  That same October 2013 editorial actually completed the full polluter \nplaybook trifecta by also decrying the ``political actors'' seeking to \ngain economic control and by questioning the science, saying ``global \nsurface temperatures have remained essentially flat.''\n  They covered them all in just the one editorial. If only the \neditorial page writers at the Wall Street Journal would turn the page \nto the actual news their own paper reports on climate change.\n  A March 2013 article reported:\n\n       New research suggests average global temperatures were \n     higher in the past decade than over most of the previous \n     11,300 years, a finding that offers a long-term context for \n     assessing modern-day climate change.\n\n  A piece from the Wall Street Journal news in August 2013 revealed:\n\n       Average global temperatures in 2012 were roughly in line \n     with those of the past decade or so, but the year still \n     ranked among the 10 warmest on record as melting Arctic ice \n     and warming oceans continued to boost sea levels.\n\n  That takes me to a particular fact about what carbon pollution is \ndoing, and that is our oceans are taking the brunt of the harm from \ncarbon pollution, and it is time to stop looking the other way. But the \nWall Street Journal editorial page doesn't often address the effects of \ncarbon pollution on oceans, perhaps because the changes taking place in \nour oceans are not a matter where the complexity of computer modeling \nleaves room for phony doubt to be insinuated.\n  The oceans' recent changes from our carbon pollution aren't \nprojections and they aren't models, they are measurements--simple, \nunyielding measurements. We measure sea level rise with a ruler. It is \nnot complicated. We measure ocean temperature with a thermometer. We \nmeasure ocean acidification on the pH scale. They do not talk about \nthat much in the Wall Street Journal editorial pages. There is no room \nfor phony doubt. So they look elsewhere.\n  We have the right to expect independent and honest media to teach the \nAmerican public about the threats facing our oceans and our \nenvironment. What a difference good reporting can make. Exemplary and \ncompelling storytelling can and does influence our national \nconversation and inspire change. Reporters fail when they give false \nequivalency to arguments on each side of the political spectrum, even \nthough they are not really equivalent. Editors fail when they look at \nthe science, look at the measurements, look at the real threats posed \nto our world and then fail to tell us the unvarnished truth.\n  The story of climate change needs to be told. Our oceans need a \nvoice. It seems the big polluters already have one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7870-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7870-S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SEQUESTRATION IMPACT\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impact of \nsequestration on our national security and the economy.\n  As a Nation, our military strength is directly supported by our \neconomic strength, and sequestration has done substantial harm to both. \nThis senseless policy has put our military in a very bad position and \nundermines or national security strategies.\n  In fiscal year 2013, the Defense Department's budget was reduced by \napproximately $43 billion due to sequestration, or a roughly 8 percent \ncut to each defense account. These cuts have undermined our military's \nreadiness and reduced necessary maintenance. They have also undermined \nlong-term investments in modernizing our force.\n  Our military leadership has been clear about the impact of \nsequestration at numerous hearings before Congress. All of the services \nhave raised concerns about the Budget Control Act's sequestration and \nthe post-sequester budget caps. In particular, we have heard how these \ncuts undermine their ability to carry out the 2012 Defense Strategic \nGuidance or DSG.\n  The DSG outlines the strategic priorities of the Department of \nDefense. The DSG reflects the input of a wide range of military \nstakeholders. The DSG describes the security challenges we are likely \nto face as well as the resources needed to meet key mission \nrequirements.\n  The 2012 DSG sets as a central goal the transition of a U.S. defense \nenterprise from an emphasis on today's wars to preparing for future \nchallenges. The cuts due to the Budget Control Act undermine that goal. \nAs a result, the services will have to reduce personnel levels, delay \nor scrap necessary equipment modernization and acquisition, and reduce \ntraining and readiness activities.\n  In recent testimony before the House of Representatives, Army GEN Ray \nOdierno noted the Army's personnel will shrink by 18 percent in the \nnext 7 years. This includes a 26 percent reduction in Active Army \npersonnel, 12 percent reduction in Army National Guard, and a 9 percent \nreduction in the Army Reserve.\n  In discussing these reductions, General Odierno said:\n\n       In my view, these reductions will put at substantial risk \n     our ability to conduct even one sustained major combat \n     operation.\n\n  While I hope we will not have to engage in such an operation in the \nnear future, this reduction in our capacity to do so is very troubling.\n  In addition, Navy ADM Jonathan Greenert expressed serious concern \nabout cuts to operations and maintenance and investment accounts. These \ncuts threaten the Navy's readiness. He explained that the Navy would \nlikely have to cancel necessary maintenance, which reduces the useful \nlife of ships and aircraft. In addition, the Navy's shipbuilding \nprogram could be seriously affected. This means a submarine, a littoral \ncombat ship, and an\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\nafloat forward-staging base could be on the chopping block.\n  Hawaii is home to the Pacific Command. Its responsibility encompasses \nhalf the globe. This enormous area of responsibility is home to some of \nthe most dynamic and fastest growing economies in the world. The Asia-\nPacific nations are huge markets with growing middle classes of \nconsumers for American goods and services. However, it is also home to \nsome of the most serious security threats we face. It is an area where \nU.S. economic, strategic, and security interests face many challenges, \nbut also many opportunities.\n  As part of our Nation's recognition that we need to engage more in \nthis region, President Obama has committed to a rebalance of our \nstrategic focus to the Asia-Pacific. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Dempsey, described the Asia-Pacific rebalance by saying:\n\n       It's about ``Three Mores''--more interest, more engagement, \n     and from the military perspective more quality assets and \n     quality interaction.\n\n  For the Asia-Pacific rebalance to provide the long-term benefits to \nour Nation, we need to be fully committed. This requires the \ntransition, training, and support of U.S. military personnel and assets \nto the region. However, this important initiative is undermined by the \nbudget cuts our military is facing. We cannot support regional peace \nand stability with insufficient resources and personnel. Yet this is \nthe reality if we fail to address planned budget cuts.\n  These are just some examples of how our ability to effectively \nprotect U.S. interests and security are being impacted by the Budget \nControl Act. We also know that reductions in defense spending impact \nthe Nation's economy. For example, Department of Defense employees \nacross the country, including thousands in Hawaii, have faced furloughs \nthis year. This is a pay cut for many families at a time when they can \nleast afford them.\n  Some will argue that all we need to do is to give the Department of \nDefense the authority to transfer funds between accounts. I strongly \ndisagree. Congress can address these cuts to national security while \nalso strengthening our overall economy. How can we do this? By simply \neliminating sequester and funding the whole government at the level \nassumed by the Senate's budget resolution.\n  Sequestration, like the recent government shutdown, results in self-\ninflicted wounds to our economy. The shutdown was like a sudden \neconomic heart attack. But sequestration is like death by a thousand \ncuts to our national defense, our science and research enterprise, and \nprograms which our communities rely upon.\n  I have spoken a great deal about the impact of sequestration on our \nmilitary. However, the substantial cuts sustained by our education, \nresearch and development, and infrastructure are equally as damaging. \nThese are programs that support an educated and productive workforce, \nimprove the flow of commerce and support those in our communities in \nthe greatest need. Just as a hollowed-out force will struggle to meet \nmission requirements, a hollowed-out workforce will struggle to compete \nin the global economy. These two are tightly linked. That is why I urge \nmy colleagues to support eliminating sequestration for both military \nand nondefense programs.\n  The Financial Times recently reported that U.S. public investment has \ndropped to 3.6 percent of GDP. This is well below the 5 percent we have \naveraged since World War II. These cuts not only undermine our long-\nterm national security strategy but also our long-term competitiveness \nand economic growth. Without a strong economy, we cannot sustain the \ninvestments we need and a strong national defense.\n  According to Macroeconomic Advisers, spending cuts enacted since 2010 \nhave reduced GDP by 0.7 percentage points. This reduction in our \neconomy has raised unemployment by 0.8 percent, or 1.2 million jobs. \nThe Congressional Budget Office--CBO--recently reported we could give \nour economy a significant boost by eliminating sequestration. In fact, \nCBO found that if Congress had enacted legislation last summer to \ncancel the 2013 and 2014 sequester, the economy would have nearly 1 \nmillion more jobs by next year. Our economy would also grow nearly a \nfull percentage point faster.\n  To put this in perspective, without sequestration, our economy would \nbe nearly back on track to where it was before the great recession.\n  We all recognize a strong economy is the backbone of our strength as \na Nation. In order to get back to full strength, we need to get more \npeople back to work. The more people who are working, the more \nproductive our economy is. This is not rocket science. The more \nproductive our economy, the more opportunity there is for people to \nachieve the American Dream.\n  Getting people back to work also means less people have to rely on \nsafety net programs and more tax revenues coming in without raising any \ntax rates. By reducing spending and increasing revenue this way, we are \nhelping to stabilize our fiscal situation.\n  A robust economy ensures that our Nation has the capacity to meet our \ncommitments and support our vital priorities. This means we don't have \nto choose between a strong national defense and investment in \neducation, infrastructure, and innovation. We can, and must, do both.\n  The place to start is with ending sequestration and revising the \nBudget Control Act caps. This modest policy change will pay dividends \nfor our economy and, in turn, will strengthen our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7871-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7871-S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NSA OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are at a watershed moment in the history \nof intelligence oversight, like nothing I have seen since the Church \nCommittee. Some of the recent revelations have led to important \nnational conversations about the scope of our Nation's intelligence \ngathering powers here at home, and to renewed legislative efforts to \nrecalibrate those authorities and the related oversight regimes. The \nUSA FREEDOM Act that Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and I introduced \nlast week along with more than 100 members of Congress does just that.\n  It is important, however, to acknowledge that some of the leaks have \nled to needless risk to our national security and have threatened our \nrelationships with some of our most important international partners.\n  And all of this leads back to a 29-year-old contractor named Edward \nSnowden.\n  Let me make clear once more that I do not condone the way any of \nthese highly classified programs were disclosed. I am deeply concerned \nabout the potential damage to our intelligence gathering capabilities, \nforeign relationships, and national security.\n  I am also deeply concerned that one person could wreak this much \nhavoc in such a short period of time. Especially in the wake of the \nPrivate Manning leaks, I do not understand how the National Security \nAgency could have allowed this to happen.\n  This past weekend, Colbert King wrote in the Washington Post that \nthis damage was, in a sense, self-inflicted. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the King op-ed be printed in the Record. As Mr. King put it, ``I \nwant to know how Snowden got his hands on so much of the nation's most \nsensitive intelligence and was able to flee the country, all within \nthree months.''\n  I want to know too. We need to hold people accountable for allowing \nsuch a massive leak to occur and we need to change the way we do \nbusiness to ensure that we prevent this type of breach in the future. \nIn public and in private, I have continued to ask the leaders of the \nintelligence community to tell me who is being held accountable and \nwhat is being done to prevent this from happening again.\n  Without adequate answers to these questions, the American people are \nrightly concerned that their private information could be swept up into \na massive database, and then compromised. The NSA has acknowledged that \nit is collecting U.S. phone records on an unprecedented scale, and that \nit is also collecting massive amounts of Internet content against \ntargets abroad, which also includes some communications of law-abiding \nAmericans. And yet the government asks us to trust that it will keep \nthis information safe, and that we should have faith in its internal \npolicies and procedures.\n  This plea comes from the same intelligence community that the FISA\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\ncourt found to have made substantial misrepresentations about the scope \nof its collection; and the same intelligence community that allowed \nEdward Snowden to steal such vast amounts of information.\n  And it comes from the same intelligence community whose inspector \ngeneral just wrote to tell me that he is unable at this time to conduct \na communitywide review of government activities conducted under section \n215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. I ask unanimous consent that the September 23, 2013, \nletter from a bipartisan group of Senate Judiciary Committee members to \nthe inspector general of the intelligence community be printed in the \nRecord, as well as his November 5, 2013, response.\n  The intelligence community faces a trust deficit, and I am \nparticularly concerned that the NSA has strayed and overreached beyond \nits core missions. One important step toward rebuilding that trust \nwould be for the NSA to spend less of its time collecting data on \ninnocent Americans, and more on keeping our Nation's secrets safe and \nholding its own accountable.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its work on these issues \nin the next few weeks. On November 13, the Subcommittee on Privacy, \nTechnology, and the Law will hold a hearing on Senator Franken's \nSurveillance Transparency Act, which I have cosponsored. And on \nNovember 20, I have invited back to the committee Director of National \nIntelligence James Clapper, NSA Director Keith Alexander, and Deputy \nAttorney General James Cole for another hearing to review the \nintelligence community's surveillance authorities.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 2, 2013]\n\n      Latest NSA Spying Revelations Distract From the Real Issues\n\n                          (By Colbert I. King)\n\n       What's this about governments spying on their closest \n     allies?\n       We called it ``the bubble.'' It was a 12-by-15-foot \n     acoustic conference room made of clear plastic and aluminum. \n     There were at least five inches of space between the walls of \n     the bubble and the walls of the room in which it was located. \n     The bubble's plastic walls, ceiling and floor allowed visual \n     inspection for electronic listening devices, or ``bugs.''\n       As an extra security measure, a noise-generating machine \n     was installed in the outer room to prevent interception of \n     any discussions of classified information within the bubble. \n     The outer room was secured by a combination lock, the code \n     known only to my office.\n       The first U.S. ``bubble'' was installed after hidden \n     microphones were found in American diplomatic missions in \n     Moscow, Prague and elsewhere in the 1960s.\n       Our bubble, within a room on an upper floor of the U. S. \n     Embassy in Bad Godesberg, West Germany, was a countermeasure \n     against possible technical penetration by the Soviet KGB and \n     the East German Stasi. But Eastern Bloc countries weren't the \n     only concern.\n       Our bubble allowed classified discussions to occur beyond \n     the hearing of our host and ally, the-then Federal Republic \n     of Germany, and our friends down the road in the French and \n     British embassies.\n       That was nearly 50 years ago.\n       This year, in my current capacity, I was sitting in the \n     office of an ambassador in Washington when a member of his \n     staff alerted him to an important call. There was a phone on \n     the ambassador's desk. But he left the room to take the call.\n       It turns out that his prime minister was calling from \n     overseas. The ambassador went to a secure location in the \n     embassy where he could conduct a confidential conversation.\n       True, he was in the capital city of his nation's closest \n     ally. But the matter to be discussed was for the ears of his \n     countrymen only, U. S. friendship notwithstanding.\n       Today, as the United States has been doing for decades, \n     close allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere take \n     similar precautions even when their missions are in friendly \n     countries.\n       Gentlemen may know that it is bad form to read each other's \n     mail or to eavesdrop. But in diplomacy and national security, \n     the desire to know what another country is up to tends to \n     overwhelm any sense of rectitude.\n       Consequently, the European outrage over snooping among \n     friends may be slightly overdone. That is an entirely \n     separate matter from the National Security Agency's (NSA) \n     vacuum-cleanerlike collection of the communication records \n     and metadata of millions of Americans, including private \n     citizens and, apparently, foreign citizens both here and \n     overseas. The scope of that intelligence-collection program, \n     disputed by Gen. Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, \n     this week is the cause of uproar around the country and in \n     Congress. There is still much to sort out and probably \n     reform.\n       The monitoring of foreign leaders' phone calls, however, is \n     closer to the larger deed of spying on allied governments.\n       Which takes us to an indelicate question: Why is a foreign \n     leader, a repository of a nation's secrets, communicating by \n     text messages and smartphone?\n       The most junior Foreign Service officer or government civil \n     servant entrusted with sensitive information assumes that e-\n     mails and cellphones are susceptible to eavesdropping. What \n     makes a head of state behave as if he or she is immune from \n     monitoring?\n       Which brings up another tactless question: Why haven't the \n     security services of those foreign leaders developed \n     countermeasures to prevent successful spying on personal \n     communications?\n       The danger here isn't simply that the NSA may have \n     overstepped its bounds with respect to U.S. allies. The \n     intelligence services of the foes of Germany, France, Spain, \n     Brazil and the like may have the capacity to listen in on \n     high-level conversations.\n       The naivete of outraged foreign leaders and their \n     vulnerability to spying are nearly--but not totally--as \n     surprising as the scale of NSA snooping.\n       The NSA revelations, meanwhile, should not draw attention \n     away from the revelations' primary source: Edward Joseph \n     Snowden.\n       How in the world is it possible that a high school dropout \n     with a GED, a community college student who didn't graduate, \n     a failed Army recruit and security guard can catapult himself \n     into a CIA information technology job, an overseas posting \n     and subsequently a $200,000-a-year job with a company \n     contracted to do NSA work in Hawaii, where he was able to \n     gain access to the crown jewels of America's secrets?\n       Whistleblower, traitor, patriot: Debate the labels all you \n     want. The government has charged him with espionage. Take it \n     up with Attorney General Eric Holder.\n       I want to know how Snowden got his hands on so much of the \n     nation's most sensitive intelligence and was able to flee the \n     country, all within three months.\n       Damage?

I. Charles McCullough III,\n     Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Office of \n         the Director of National Intelligence, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Inspector General McCullough: Recent disclosures about \n     classified government surveillance activities have generated \n     significant public discussion about the breadth of these \n     programs, many of which are conducted pursuant to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and the need for \n     appropriate oversight and checks and balances.\n       In particular, concerns have arisen about activities \n     conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and \n     Section 702 of FISA, which was enacted as part of the FISA \n     Amendments Act of 2008. Recently declassified documents \n     appear to reveal numerous violations of law and policy in the \n     implementation of these authorities, including what the FISA \n     Court characterized as three ``substantial \n     misrepresentation[s]'' to the Court. These declassified \n     documents also demonstrate that the implementation of these \n     authorities involves several components of the Intelligence \n     Community (IC), including the National Security Agency, \n     Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Director \n     of National Intelligence, among others.\n       We urge you to conduct comprehensive reviews of these \n     authorities and provide a full accounting of how these \n     authorities are being implemented across the Intelligence \n     Community. The IC Inspector General was created in 2010 for \n     this very purpose. Comprehensive and independent reviews by \n     your office of the implementation of Sections 215 and 702 \n     will fulfill a critical oversight role. Providing a publicly \n     available summary of the findings and conclusions of these \n     reviews will help promote greater oversight, transparency, \n     and public accountability.\n       In conducting such reviews, we encourage you to draw on the \n     excellent work already done by the Inspectors General of \n     several agencies, including the Department of Justice, in \n     reviewing these authorities. But only your office can bring \n     to bear an IC-wide perspective that is critical to effective \n     oversight of these programs. The reviews previously conducted \n     have been more narrowly focused--as might be expected--on a \n     specific agency.\n       In particular, we urge you to review for calendar years \n     2010 through 2013:\n        The use and implementation of Section 215 and \n     Section 702 authorities, including the manner in which \n     information--and in particular, information about U.S. \n     persons--is collected, retained, analyzed and disseminated;\n        applicable minimization procedures and other \n     relevant procedures and guidelines, including whether they \n     are consistent across agencies and the extent to which they \n     protect the privacy rights of U.S. persons;\n        any improper or illegal use of the authorities or \n     information collected pursuant to them; and\n        an examination of the effectiveness of the \n     authorities as investigative and intelligence tools.\n       We have urged appropriate oversight of these activities \n     long before the problems\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\n     with the implementation of these FISA authorities became \n     public. We believe it is important for your office to begin \n     this review without further delay.\n       Please proceed to administratively perform reviews of the \n     implementation of Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and \n     Section 702 of FISA, and submit the reports no later than \n     December 31, 2014. Thank you in advance for your efforts to \n     ensure a full accounting of the implementation of these \n     surveillance authorities across the Intelligence Community.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Charles Schumer, Sheldon Whitehouse, \n           Christopher Coons, Richard Blumenthal, Chuck Grassley, \n           Ted Cruz, Michael S.

As you stated in your \n     letter, several IC inspectors general have oversight of the \n     IC's use of foreign electronic surveillance authorities. \n     While my office has the jurisdiction to conduct an IC-wide \n     review of all IC elements using these authorities, such a \n     review will implicate ongoing oversight efforts. Therefore, I \n     have been conferring with several IC Inspectors General Forum \n     members in order to consider how such a review might be \n     accomplished given the potential impact to IG resources and \n     ongoing projects. As my IG colleagues and I confer regarding \n     the possibility of conducting a joint review of the requested \n     topic, I will keep you and the committee staff informed.\n       Again, I thank you for your continued support of the IG \n     community. If you have any questions regarding this subject, \n     please contact me or my Legislative Counsel, Melissa Wright, \n     at 571-204-8149.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       I.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a topic not \ndebated nearly enough here on the Senate floor--making the Federal \nGovernment more accountable and transparent.\n  Today, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Coburn, \npassed important legislation that will expand Federal financial \ntransparency and accountability in many important ways.\n  I sponsored this legislation--the Digital Accountability and \nTransparency, or DATA, Act--because it will significantly reform the \nway agencies report Federal spending, and for the first time provide \ncheckbook-type spending data from across the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government spends more than $3.7 trillion each year, with \nmore than $1 trillion being distributed as awards. However, the public \ncannot clearly track where this money goes. We currently have a Web \nsite--USASpending.gov--that is supposed to show taxpayers and \npolicymakers where the money goes, but it is not accurate.\n  Most States already have an online portal so that taxpayers can track \nwhere their dollars are spent, and it is long past time for the Federal \nGovernment to move into the 21st century and adopt a similar system.\n  At a recent hearing of the Budget Committee Task Force on Government \nPerformance that I chair, it was reported that over $900 billion of \ndirect assistance data on USASpending.gov was misreported in 2011 \nalone.\n  No wonder the public has such little confidence in government--we \ncan't even tell them where their tax money goes.\n  It seems to me that the data collected by the budget shops, the \naccountants, the procurement offices, and grant makers all needs to be \ncombined, reconciled, and then presented in a relevant and transparent \nway.\n  These various systems should be able to work together based on \nfinancial standards so that policymakers and the public can track the \nfull cycle of Federal spending clearly.\n  The DATA Act will help us move in that direction by making four \nspecific improvements that I want to highlight today.\n  First, it creates transparency for all Federal funds. DATA will \nexpand USAspending.gov to include spending data for all Federal funds \nby appropriation, Federal agency, program, function, and maintain the \ncurrent reporting for Federal awards like contracts, grants, and loans. \nThis is important because there is currently no place online to find \nand compare all government spending.\n  This expansion of USASpending.gov will allow policymakers and \ntaxpayers to track Federal funds more clearly and to more easily link \nspending to budget priorities.\n  Second, the DATA Act sets government-wide financial data standards. \nCurrently there are no consistent standards for reporting financial \ndata to USAspending.gov, and it makes much of the data confusing and \nunreliable--especially if you want to compile and compare spending from \nmultiple Federal agencies.\n  DATA tasks the Department of Treasury with establishing consistent \nfinancial data standards for the Federal agencies to support the \nUSAspending.gov website.\n  Third, the DATA Act will actually reduce recipient reporting \nrequirements. I have long been concerned about the compliance costs for \nthe recipients of Federal funds. It appears that all the overlapping \nsystems are frustrating and also create additional waste--especially \nfor State and local governments.\n  For example, many universities file similar financial reports, \nmultiple times, to multiple agencies on an annual, quarterly and \nmonthly basis. If all this reporting redundancy were streamlined, we \ncould direct more money to programs and less to administrative costs.\n  This legislation requires the Office of Management and Budget to \nreview the existing Federal award recipient financial reporting to \nreduce compliance costs based on the new financial data standards.\n  Finally, the DATA Act will improve data quality. The inspectors \ngeneral at each agency will be required to provide reports on the \nquality and accuracy of the financial data provided to USASpending.gov. \nThen GAO will then create a government-wide assessment on data quality \nand accuracy based on the inspectors generals' findings.\n  Being able to follow the money is critically important to running our \ngovernment in a more efficient way and getting the best value for the \ntaxpayer. The DATA Act will help us take steps in that direction, and \nthat is why passing it is so important.\n  I want to close today by saying thanks again to my colleagues for \npassing the DATA Act out of committee. I am also pleased to be working \nwith my friend, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, as my Senate cosponsor \nof the DATA Act. We will continue working to make sure this important \nbipartisan legislation becomes law this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7873-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7873-S7874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN EDWARD KLEIN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

THE GEORGIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n10th anniversary of the 165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National \nGuard. Since 2003, the Georgia Air National Guard has played a vital \nrole in fighting the war on terror, with over 80 percent of the wing's \n900 airmen serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring \nFreedom, and Operation New Dawn.\n  I could not be prouder that these brave men and women call Georgia \ntheir home. They protected our Nation during a critical time, and in \ndoing so set the standard for service in the Georgia Air National \nGuard. As a unit, they have flown more than 11,363 hours and 7,441 \ncombat sorties. They were the first C-130 unit to deploy and operate \nout of Iraq under the famous ``Red Tail'' designation of the 332nd Air \nExpeditionary Wing, and they were also the only squadron in the U.S. \nCentral Command area of responsibility tasked at 100 percent. The wing \ncrew supported the rescue mission of SEAL Team 10 and 3rd Battalion of \nthe 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment when they lost three \nmembers of their team, and their heroic actions became the subject of \nMarcus Luttrell's book, Lone Survivor.\n  It is only fitting we commend these courageous individuals of the \n165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nGuard for their outstanding service and sacrifice. Their determination \nto protect our fellow Americans and defend our freedom should be an \nexample to us all.\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record the \n165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National Guard for 10 years of \nexemplary service on behalf of the United States.\n  During the wing's decorated career, it served in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn with the \nmajority of the unit's 900 airmen having been deployed in support of \nthese major war operations.\n  Over the past decade, the unit has flown over 11,363 hours and 7,441 \ncombat sorties, and in 2004, the wing was the first C-130 unit to \ndeploy and operate out of Iraq and fly under the distinguished ``Red \nTail'' designation 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing.\n  A unit of precision and valor, the wing crew supported the rescue \nmission of SEAL Team 10 and 3rd Battalion of the 160th Special \nOperations Aviation Regiment. During the mission, 16 U.S. \nservicemembers were tragically killed in action, including three from \nthe wing after a MH-47D Chinook was shot down during a reaction force \ntask in support of the U.S. Navy SEALS. Acting swiftly and heroically, \nthe wing was the first C-130 aircraft to respond. The courageous \nresponse from the unit was later celebrated in Marcus Luttrell's book, \nLone Survivor.\n  The 165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National Guard has set a \nstandard of military excellence, and its decade of service during the \nWar on Terror has demonstrated remarkable strength and diligence.\n  It is with great pleasure that I recognize the altruism and bravery \nshowed by the 165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National Guard and \nthank the unit for its courageousness and dedication toward protecting \nthe freedom of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILBUR FAISS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a true \nNevadan, humble public servant, and dedicated family man, Wilbur Faiss. \nBelieved to have been the Nation's oldest-living legislator, Mr. \nFaiss's passing is a great loss and his commitment to serving the \nSilver State will never be forgotten.\n  Representing Las Vegas, Mr. Faiss served 2 terms in the Senate from \n1976 to 1984. During his time in the Legislature, he authored two \nimportant laws, including one allowing pharmacists to substitute \naffordable, generic brands in place of name brand drugs, and another to \nallow seniors to access State parks and campgrounds for free. Mr. Faiss \nwas also a strong advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment in 1977 and \nhas professed that voting in support of that piece of legislation was \none of the proudest moments of his life.\n  On his 100th birthday, Mr. Faiss lent advice from his experience in \nthe Senate, stressing the importance of compromise and a positive \noutlook, whether in your professional or personal life. It is clear \nthat he practiced these sensibilities in the Senate and at home. His \nmarriage of 79 years to his late wife, Theresa, is a testament to this \nphilosophy. In 2012, he and Theresa were recognized as one of the \nlongest married couples in the U.S.\n  The citizens of the Silver State were fortunate that such a dedicated \nand passionate individual called Nevada home. Mr. Faiss serves as an \nexample for others who hold the role of public office. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his three sons, six grandchildren, five-great \ngrandchildren, and four great-great grandchildren. Today, I would ask \nmy colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a devoted Nevadan \nand honoring his accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/06/senate-section/article/S7875-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the \nSpeaker pro tempore (Mr. Upton) had signed the following enrolled \nbills:\n\n       H.R. 2094.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 288\n\n       Whereas, although the number of armed robbery at sea and \n     piracy attacks worldwide dropped substantially in recent \n     years, such acts in the Gulf of Guinea are increasing, with \n     more than 40 reported through October 2013 and many more \n     going unreported;\n       Whereas the United States imported more than 315,000,000 \n     barrels of oil through the region in 2012, and United States \n     businesses have extensive fixed assets in the region that are \n     important to United States energy security;\n       Whereas the nature of attacks in the Gulf of Guinea \n     demonstrates an ongoing pattern of cargo thefts and robbery, \n     often occurring in the territorial waters of West and Central \n     African states;\n       Whereas there are countries in West and Central Africa that \n     are susceptible to acts of armed robbery at sea and piracy \n     that lack adequate law enforcement and naval capabilities to \n     stop or deter such attacks;\n       Whereas acts of maritime crime raise the costs and risks of \n     trade and commerce in Africa and beyond because the security \n     of vessels, crews, and cargoes cannot be guaranteed;\n       Whereas shipping insurance premiums increase after such \n     attacks, and in so doing, create disincentives for local, \n     regional, and international investors and companies seeking \n     to do business in the region;\n       Whereas imports provide indispensable goods and services \n     for the people of West and Central Africa, generate port fees \n     and customs duties for their governments, and are essential \n     in spurring economic growth and development in the region;\n       Whereas the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa issued \n     by President Barack Obama in June 2012 states, ``It is in the \n     interest of the United States to improve the region's trade \n     competitiveness, encourage the diversification of exports \n     beyond natural resources, and ensure that the benefits from \n     growth are broad-based.'';\n       Whereas a vibrant trade relationship between Africa and its \n     partners, including the United States, can lead to expanded \n     economic opportunities that can spur competition, raise \n     productivity, and facilitate job creation in the economies of \n     all participating countries;\n       Whereas the African Union, in collaboration with numerous \n     official and nongovernmental stakeholders, developed the \n     ``2050 Africa's Integrated Maritime Security'' strategy (the \n     2050 AIM STRATEGY) which seeks ``to address contending, \n     emerging and future maritime challenges and opportunities in \n     Africa . . . with a clear focus on enhanced wealth creation \n     from a sustainable governance of Africa's oceans and seas'';\n       Whereas the African Union's 2050 AIM STRATEGY seeks to \n     combat ``diverse illegal activities which include . . . arms \n     and drug trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling, \n     piracy, and armed robbery at sea'', among other objectives;\n       Whereas the June 24-25, 2013, meeting of the Gulf of Guinea \n     Maritime Security Heads of State Summit held in Cameroon \n     marked the culmination of a United States Government-\n     supported Economic Communities of Central African States \n     (ECCAS) and Economic Community of West African States \n     (ECOWAS)-led initiative and process that produced an approved \n     ECOWAS-ECCAS Memorandum of Understanding for regional \n     cooperation, and adopted a Gulf of Guinea Code of Conduct to \n     address maritime crime and a Heads of State Political \n     Declaration;\n       Whereas ECOWAS and ECCAS states are working to cooperate \n     and build their joint capacities in order to increase \n     maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea and are working to \n     achieve this goal with such partners as the United Nations \n     Offices for West and Central Africa, the Gulf of Guinea \n     Commission, the International Maritime Organization, the \n     Maritime Organization for West and Central Africa, and the \n     African Union;\n       Whereas the United States Government in the Gulf of Guinea \n     has focused on encouraging multi-layered regional and \n     national ownership in developing sustainable capacity \n     building efforts, including working with partners through the \n     G8++ Friends of Gulf of Guinea Group, to coordinate United \n     States Government maritime security activities in the region;\n       Whereas the United States Government has assisted the \n     countries of West and Central Africa to enhance regional \n     maritime security through programs such as the ``African \n     Partnership Station'', operated by United States Naval Forces \n     Africa ``to build maritime safety and security by increasing \n     maritime awareness, response capabilities and \n     infrastructure'', and the ``African Maritime Law Enforcement \n     Partnership'', which ``enables African partner nations to \n     build maritime security capacity and improve management of \n     their maritime environment through real world law enforcement \n     operations, and through provision of diverse types of \n     training and equipment assistance and participation in \n     diverse regional maritime military exercises'', as well as by \n     employing analytical tools such as the Maritime Security \n     Sector Reform Guide; and\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2039, \n     ``expressing its deep concern about the threat that piracy \n     and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea pose to \n     international navigation, security and the\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\n     economic development of states in the region'', was \n     unanimously adopted on February 29, 2012: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns acts of armed robbery at sea, piracy, and \n     other maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea;\n       (2) endorses and supports the efforts made by United States \n     Government agencies to assist affected West and Central \n     African countries to build capacity to combat armed robbery \n     at sea, piracy, and other maritime threats, and encourages \n     the President to continue such assistance, as appropriate, \n     within resource constraints; and\n       (3) commends the African Union, subregional entities such \n     as the ECOWAS and ECCAS, and the various international \n     agencies that have worked to develop policy and program \n     frameworks for enhancing maritime security in West and \n     Central Africa, and encourages these entities and their \n     member states to continue to build upon these and other \n     efforts to achieve that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url":

Mr. VITTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 815, to prohibit employment discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation or gender identity; which was ordered to \nlie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION ___. PRENATAL NONDISCRIMINATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA) of 2013''.\n       (b) Findings and Constitutional Authority.--\n       (1) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Women are a vital part of American society and culture \n     and possess the same fundamental human rights and civil \n     rights as men.\n       (B) United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of \n     males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits \n     sex discrimination in various contexts, including the \n     provision of employment, education, housing, health insurance \n     coverage, and athletics.\n       (C) Sex is an immutable characteristic ascertainable at the \n     earliest stages of human development through existing medical \n     technology and procedures commonly in use, including \n     maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, \n     chorionic villus sampling or ``CVS'', and obstetric \n     ultrasound. In addition to medically assisted sex \n     determination, a growing sex determination niche industry has \n     developed and is marketing low-cost commercial products, \n     widely advertised and available, that aid in the sex \n     determination of an unborn child without the aid of medical \n     professionals. Experts have demonstrated that the sex-\n     selection industry is on the rise and predict that it will \n     continue to be a growing trend in the United States. Sex \n     determination is always a necessary step to the procurement \n     of a sex-selection abortion.\n       (D) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion undertaken \n     for purposes of eliminating an unborn child based on the sex \n     or gender of the child. Sex-selection abortion is barbaric, \n     and described by scholars and civil rights advocates as an \n     act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predicated on sex \n     discrimination. Sex-selection abortions are typically late-\n     term abortions performed in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of \n     pregnancy, after the unborn child has developed sufficiently \n     to feel pain. Substantial medical evidence proves that an \n     unborn child can experience pain at 20 weeks after \n     conception, and perhaps substantially earlier. By definition, \n     sex-selection abortions do not implicate the health of the \n     mother of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures \n     motivated by sex or gender bias.\n       (E) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions \n     performed in the United States and worldwide are \n     overwhelmingly female. The selective abortion of females is \n     female infanticide, the intentional killing of unborn \n     females, due to the preference for male offspring or ``son \n     preference''. Son preference is reinforced by the low value \n     associated, by some segments of the world community, with \n     female offspring. Those segments tend to regard female \n     offspring as financial burdens to a family over their \n     lifetime due to their perceived inability to earn or provide \n     financially for the family unit as can a male. In addition, \n     due to social and legal convention, female offspring are less \n     likely to carry on the family name. ``Son preference'' is one \n     of the most evident manifestations of sex or\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\n     gender discrimination in any society, undermining female \n     equality, and fueling the elimination of females' right to \n     exist in instances of sex-selection abortion.\n       (F) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by \n     United States law or the laws of 47 States. Sex-selection \n     abortions are performed in the United States. In a March 2008 \n     report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy \n     of Sciences, Columbia University economists Douglas Almond \n     and Lena Edlund examined the sex ratio of United States-born \n     children and found ``evidence of sex selection, most likely \n     at the prenatal stage''. The data revealed obvious ``son \n     preference'' in the form of unnatural sex-ratio imbalances \n     within certain segments of the United States population, \n     primarily those segments tracing their ethnic or cultural \n     origins to countries where sex-selection abortion is \n     prevalent. The evidence strongly suggests that some Americans \n     are exercising sex-selection abortion practices within the \n     United States consistent with discriminatory practices common \n     to their country of origin, or the country to which they \n     trace their ancestry. While sex-selection abortions are more \n     common outside the United States, the evidence reveals that \n     female feticide is also occurring in the United States.\n       (G) The American public supports a prohibition of sex-\n     selection abortion. In a March 2006 Zogby International poll, \n     86 percent of Americans agreed that sex-selection abortion \n     should be illegal, yet only 3 States proscribe sex-selection \n     abortion.\n       (H) Despite the failure of the United States to proscribe \n     sex-selection abortion, the United States Congress has \n     expressed repeatedly, through Congressional resolution, \n     strong condemnation of policies promoting sex-selection \n     abortion in the ``Communist Government of China''. Likewise, \n     at the 2007 United Nation's Annual Meeting of the Commission \n     on the Status of Women, 51st Session, the United States \n     delegation spearheaded a resolution calling on countries to \n     condemn sex-selective abortion, a policy directly \n     contradictory to the permissiveness of current United States \n     law, which places no restriction on the practice of sex-\n     selection abortion. The United Nations Commission on the \n     Status of Women has urged governments of all nations ``to \n     take necessary measures to prevent . . . prenatal sex \n     selection''.\n       (I) A 1990 report by Harvard University economist Amartya \n     Sen, estimated that more than 100 million women were \n     ``demographically missing'' from the world as early as 1990 \n     due to sexist practices, including sex-selection abortion. \n     Many experts believe sex-selection abortion is the primary \n     cause. Current estimates of women missing from the world \n     range in the hundreds of millions.\n       (J) Countries with longstanding experience with sex-\n     selection abortion--such as the Republic of India, the United \n     Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China--have enacted \n     restrictions on sex-selection, and have steadily continued to \n     strengthen prohibitions and penalties. The United States, by \n     contrast, has no law in place to restrict sex-selection \n     abortion, establishing the United States as affording less \n     protection from sex-based feticide than the Republic of India \n     or the People's Republic of China, whose recent practices of \n     sex-selection abortion were vehemently and repeatedly \n     condemned by United States congressional resolutions and by \n     the United States Ambassador to the Commission on the Status \n     of Women. Public statements from within the medical community \n     reveal that citizens of other countries come to the United \n     States for sex-selection procedures that would be criminal in \n     their country of origin. Because the United States permits \n     abortion on the basis of sex, the United States may \n     effectively function as a ``safe haven'' for those who seek \n     to have American physicians do what would otherwise be \n     criminal in their home countries--a sex-selection abortion, \n     most likely late-term.\n       (K) The American medical community opposes sex-selection. \n     The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     commonly known as ``ACOG'', stated in its 2007 Ethics \n     Committee Opinion, Number 360, that sex-selection is \n     inappropriate because it ``ultimately supports sexist \n     practices''. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine \n     (commonly known as ``ASRM'') 2004 Ethics Committee Opinion on \n     sex-selection notes that central to the controversy of sex-\n     selection is the potential for ``inherent gender \n     discrimination'', . . . the ``risk of psychological harm to \n     sex-selected offspring (i.e., by placing on them expectations \n     that are too high)'', . . . and ``reinforcement of gender \n     bias in society as a whole''. Embryo sex-selection, ASRM \n     notes, remains ``vulnerable to the judgment that no matter \n     what its basis, [the method] identifies gender as a reason to \n     value one person over another, and it supports socially \n     constructed stereotypes of what gender means''. In doing so, \n     it not only ``reinforces possibilities of unfair \n     discrimination, but may trivialize human reproduction by \n     making it depend on the selection of nonessential features of \n     offspring''. The ASRM ethics opinion continues, ``ongoing \n     problems with the status of women in the United States make \n     it necessary to take account of concerns for the impact of \n     sex-selection on goals of gender equality''. The American \n     Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \n     organization with hundreds of members--many of whom are \n     former abortionists--makes the following declaration: ``Sex \n     selection abortions are more graphic examples of the damage \n     that abortion inflicts on women. In addition to increasing \n     premature labor in subsequent pregnancies, increasing suicide \n     and major depression, and increasing the risk of breast \n     cancer in teens who abort their first pregnancy and delay \n     childbearing, sex selection abortions are often targeted at \n     fetuses simply because the fetus is female. As physicians who \n     care for both the mother and her unborn child, the American \n     Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     vigorously opposes aborting fetuses because of their \n     gender.''. The President's Council on Bioethics published a \n     Working Paper stating the council's belief that society's \n     respect for reproductive freedom does not prohibit the \n     regulation or prohibition of ``sex control'', defined as the \n     use of various medical technologies to choose the sex of \n     one's child. The publication expresses concern that ``sex \n     control might lead to . . . dehumanization and a new \n     eugenics''.\n       (L) Sex-selection abortion results in an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance. An unnatural sex-ratio imbalance is \n     undesirable, due to the inability of the numerically \n     predominant sex to find mates. Experts worldwide document \n     that a significant sex-ratio imbalance in which males \n     numerically predominate can be a cause of increased violence \n     and militancy within a society. Likewise, an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance gives rise to the commoditization of humans \n     in the form of human trafficking, and a consequent increase \n     in kidnapping and other violent crime.\n       (M) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing \n     the representation of women in the American population, and \n     therefore, the American electorate.\n       (N) Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex discrimination \n     and has no place in a civilized society.\n       (O) The history of the United States includes examples of \n     sex discrimination. The people of the United States \n     ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by \n     enacting a constitutional amendment correcting elements of \n     such discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex \n     discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have \n     suffrage guaranteed by the 19th amendment. The elimination of \n     discriminatory practices has been and is among the highest \n     priorities and greatest achievements of American history.\n       (P) Implicitly approving the discriminatory practice of \n     sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will \n     reinforce these inherently discriminatory practices, and \n     evidence a failure to protect a segment of certain unborn \n     Americans because those unborn are of a sex that is \n     disfavored. Sex-selection abortions trivialize the value of \n     the unborn on the basis of sex, reinforcing sex \n     discrimination, and coarsening society to the humanity of all \n     vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly \n     difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a \n     compelling interest in acting--indeed it must act--to \n     prohibit sex-selection abortion.\n       (2) Constitutional authority.--In accordance with the above \n     findings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' \n     power under--\n       (A) the Commerce Clause;\n       (B) section 5 of the 14th amendment, including the power to \n     enforce the prohibition on Government action denying equal \n     protection of the laws; and\n       (C) section 8 of article I to make all laws necessary and \n     proper for the carrying into execution of powers vested by \n     the Constitution in the Government of the United States.\n       (c) Discrimination Against the Unborn on the Basis of \n     Sex.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 250.
