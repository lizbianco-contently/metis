Mr. President, Nevada is a relatively small State \npopulation-wise but a large area. We are a State of about 3 million \npeople. We take pride in our home State, as we should. Even though we \nhave grown a lot in the last couple of decades, we are still a big \nfamily.\n  Today Nevadans are celebrating two of our home State's native sons \nafter the Washington Nationals clinched the National League East \nDivision crown. There is a lot of dissension here on the Senate floor \nand a lot of talk back and forth, but one thing you never hear often \nenough is that the Republican leader and I love watching baseball. We \noften share our views of the team and how, if we were there, we may do \nthings a little differently, but we are still a booster for the team.\n  The reason I mention this today is because there are two individuals \nwho helped the Nationals clinch the National League East Division who \nhave deep roots in Nevada.\n  In his first season as manager of the team, Matt Williams, from \nCarson City, NV, has led his team to the National Division series. He \nhas a stunningly powerful record athletically and is just a nice \nperson. He was a baseball and football star at Carson City High. Carson \nCity is the capital of the State of Nevada.\n  Matt Williams played baseball collegiately for the University of \nNevada at Las Vegas, where he was a star. He was so good, he played 16 \nyears in the Major Leagues. He played for the Giants, Indians, and \nDiamondbacks. He played in the World Series for each of those teams. He \nis a five-time all-star and a four-time Gold Glove Award winner. He was \na stunningly good third baseman, and he sports a World Series \nchampionship ring from the Diamondbacks.\n  Bryce Harper had his picture on the front of Sports Illustrated when \nhe was 15 years old for hitting a home run more than 500 feet. He is a \nfine young man from a wonderful family. He came to the Major Leagues \nwhen he was 18 years old--he may have been 19. I believe he is going to \nturn 22 soon.\n  During his rookie year he had a very serious injury. What was the \ninjury? He was running full speed and rammed into the wall at Dodger \nStadium, and he was hurt. It took away from his stellar year, but he \nstill did OK. He was Rookie of the Year and on the all-star team that \nfirst year. He played baseball at Las Vegas High School, and he left \nhigh school and went to a junior community college as a 17-year-old. \nBecause of his power, he went to the National Junior College World \nSeries. He is a two-time all-star. He is in his third season. In 2012 \nhe was Rookie of the Year, and he was hurt again this year because of \nhis enthusiasm for the\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\ngame and his never-ending hustle. He hit a triple and went into third \nbase and messed up his thumb. That required surgery, and as a result he \nmissed much of this season. However, he is having a good season in \nspite of that.\n  We are very proud of our baseball athletes.\n  This year one of the greatest baseball players of all time, Greg \nMaddux, was, of course, on the first ballot and was made a member of \nthe Baseball Hall of Fame. This unassuming young man has been an \nexample for how people should be athletes--not a lot of talk, other \nthan when he does talk. He has a lot of humility. He is a great \nathlete.\n  I wish Matt Williams, Bryce Harper, and the rest of the team the best \nof everything when the playoffs get underway. It should be an exciting \ndivisional series.\n  I also follow the Baltimore Orioles, and until the Nationals showed \nup, that was about all we had in the area. They have a great team. \nTheir owner is a tremendous trial lawyer. He still works every day \npracticing law. They have a tremendous team. They have had a few bad \nbreaks. Their very young third baseman was hurt. He lost a lot of this \nseason, as he did last year.\n  Anyway, it would be a great World Series to have Baltimore playing \nthe Nationals. That would be something I would really look forward to. \nAgain, it was exciting to watch them all year. Two or three games ago \nBryce Harper hit one of his towering home runs. They are still talking \nabout how far he hit it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey).

Mr. President, it is no secret that the Obama \nadministration policies have been extraordinarily harmful to job \ncreation and retention. From the perspective of my home State of \nKentucky, there is no greater example of the ill-effects of these \npolicies than the President's war on coal.\n  Given the unhealthy economy, the Senate should be regularly debating \nand voting on measures to overturn antijobs policies and pass \nbipartisan reforms to help grow our economy. But under the current \nmajority, that, sadly, is not the case. The majority leader instead has \nrefused to permit any amendments on preserving coal and coal-fired \npower all year long--none whatsoever; no votes at all--even though the \nObama administration's anticoal rules not only adversely affect States \nwith Republican Senators, such as Kentucky, but States represented by \nDemocratic Members as well.\n  The Senate's failure to address coal is reflective of the Chamber's \ndysfunction. While the House is passing bipartisan jobs bills, Senate \nDemocrats' priorities are show votes.\n  Let's review where we are and how we got here.\n  In 2008 Candidate Obama said:\n\n       If somebody wants to build a coal power plant, they can--\n     it's just that it will bankrupt them, because they are going \n     to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's \n     being emitted.\n\n  I have to say he has been true to his word. Americans have seen a \nbarrage of regulations and redtape from the President's Environmental \nProtection Agency, strangling the coal industry--one of my home State's \nmost important sources of jobs and economic development. Kentucky \nminers and thousands more from the Commonwealth whose jobs rely on \nmining are feeling the pain from the President's efforts.\n  The regulations and lack of certainty in the coal industry that this \nadministration has caused have contributed to a loss of 7,000 Kentucky \njobs in that industry since President Obama took office--7,000 lost \njobs. That tells me the overregulation this administration's EPA keeps \npiling on is contributing in a major way to the job decline in my home \nState.\n  Those of us who represent coal States have made numerous attempts to \nrein in EPA, but the majority leader and fellow Democrats here in \nWashington have blocked us at every turn.\n  Last September I introduced the Saving Coal Jobs Act. The bill would \nhave ended the abuse of the permitting process by the EPA by requiring \nthe Agency to approve or veto mining permit applications within 270 \ndays of their submission. It was simply a time limit to make a \ndecision. This legislation is necessary because the EPA's tactic of \nchoice is to sit on permits, effectively killing them. My bill also \nincluded language prohibiting any new carbon emission standards on new \nor existing powerplants as mandated by Federal agencies without the \napproval of Congress. After all, Congress, not the executive branch, is \nsupposed to write our Nation's laws.\n  Unfortunately, what happened when I introduced this legislation is \nsomething that has become all-too familiar. When I made a motion to \nproceed to the bill, it was blocked by the majority leader.\n  In April I offered my Saving Coal Jobs Act as an amendment to the \nthen-pending unemployment insurance bill before the Senate. This motion \nwas blocked by the majority leader as well.\n  In May I again offered the Saving Coal Jobs Act as an amendment to \nthe then-pending energy efficiency bill. Once again it was blocked by \nthe Senate majority leader.\n  A few days later in May I offered legislation to stop the EPA from \nmoving forward with its anti-coal jobs carbon regulations. My \namendment, introduced along with Senators Vitter and Hoeven, would have \nhalted the administration from moving forward with new regulations on \ncoal-fired powerplants until the technology required to comply with the \nregulations is commercially viable, which currently it is not. Once \nagain this commonsense measure on behalf of Kentucky coal miners and \ntheir families and jobs was blocked by the majority leader, and that \nbill was originally sponsored by a colleague on the other side of the \naisle, on the Democratic side. It fared no better under the majority \nleader than do Republican procoal bills.\n  Moreover, the majority leader is not just blocking procoal \nlegislation on the Senate floor, he is also willing to shut down the \ncommittee process for fear of procoal amendments having the votes to \npass. In June, he had the Senate Democrats prevent the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill from being marked up when they learned I had the \nvotes for my amendment reining in government regulations on coal-fired \npowerplants. So once it was clear the votes might be there in \ncommittee, they shut down the committee process.\n\n  Earlier this year, the President's EPA announced new regulations it \nwanted to enact on existing powerplants that would be a dagger to the \nheart of my State's middle class and constitute the single worst blow \nto Kentucky's economy in modern times. The proposed EPA regulations on \nexisting powerplants would kill jobs and raise utility rates across the \nState while making the transmission of electricity less reliable. The \nregulations would adversely affect Kentucky powerplants that account \nfor literally thousands of Kentucky jobs.\n  These regulations are why this June I introduced the Coal Country \nProtection Act--legislation to block the President's proposed \nregulations on carbon emissions from existing powerplants if those \nregulations eliminate jobs, cost our economy dollars, increase \nelectricity prices or jeopardize electricity reliability.\n  Those requirements are just common sense. Yet once again the majority \nleader refused to allow a vote on my legislation.\n  The importance of my Coal Country Protection Act is reflected in the \nfindings of a recent Government Accountability Office, or GAO, study. \nMy colleague Senator Murkowski from Alaska requested this study which \nfound that as a result of EPA's existing and proposed regulations, the \nnumber of coal-fired powerplants closing across the country is even \nhigher--even higher--than what was originally estimated by the GAO in \n2012.\n  These coal plant retirements are largely due to EPA redtape. Current\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nproposed regulations, from carbon regulations to proposed lower ozone \nstandards, will only make this number increase if they move forward.\n  These shutdowns mean higher electricity prices. Sadly, EPA \nbureaucrats don't understand or don't care about how the abundance of \ncoal in Kentucky permits the State to benefit from relatively low \nenergy rates which make our businesses more competitive and make it \neasier to attract jobs. As we saw during last winter's cold snap, our \ncountry needs coal and ready access to it. Coal allows us to generate \naffordable power when there is an uptick in electricity use combined \nwith spikes in natural gas prices. But as the EPA uses the \nadministrative fiat to terminate existing and future coal-fired \npowerplants, there will be less coal when we need it the most--when we \nneed a source of affordable power. Families throughout the country who \nrely on coal for electricity could find themselves in a tough spot in \nthe near future with the current administration in office.\n  Those are the facts about this administration's war on coal, but let \nme provide a more vivid picture about Kentucky coal itself.\n  Kentuckians have been mining coal for generations. Kentucky coal \nhelped power the Industrial Revolution that transformed our economy \ninto the largest and most prosperous in the world. Kentucky coal has \neven contributed to the struggle to defend our Nation in times of war. \nKentucky's coal miners have done so much for our Nation. The Senate \nshould not be turning its back on them now.\n  Jimmy Rose of Pineville, KY, is well known to many as the voice of \ncoal country. Jimmy is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps who served in \nIraq, a former coal miner, and a finalist from the television show \n``America's Got Talent.'' He is famous for his song ``Coal Keeps the \nLights On.'' I think Jimmy put it best when he said, ``Coal keeps the \nbills paid, the clothes on the backs, and shoes on the feet.''\n  I am not going to stand idly by while this administration and this \nEPA try to wipe out the lifeblood of my home State. The Senate was \ncreated to be a deliberative body, one that would debate and legislate \non the great issues of the day. Instead, the Senate, as it is currently \nrun, does all it can to avoid important subjects such as the war on \ncoal.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. The Senate can still reclaim its \nmantle as a body of vigorous debate and legislative achievement, and \nthe Kentucky coal miner can still do an honest day's hard work for good \npay, because after this administration is out of office, the coal will \nstill be in the ground. After this administration leaves office, the \ncoal will still be in the ground.\n  So I am going to fight for that Kentucky coal miner to hold on to our \nState's birthright. This war on coal is not over, not by a long shot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5653-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On another matter, I just explained why the war on \ncoal has been so damaging to the people of my State. It is clear to me \nat least that we need to work together toward sensible, all-of-the-\nabove energy policy. The good news is that the Republican-run House is \nset to present us with another perfect opportunity to work across the \naisle and do just that this very week. The House plans to pass and send \nover a bipartisan legislative package that would create jobs while \nhelping to make energy more affordable and more abundant.\n  Among other things, this energy package would finally approve the \nKeystone Pipeline. This is a project that is safe, shovel-ready, and \ncould create tens of thousands of jobs right away. It is just \nunacceptable that the administration has now spent 6 years--6 years--\ndragging its feet on the Keystone Pipeline. I commend my colleague from \nNorth Dakota Senator Hoeven for bringing attention to that fact and for \nhis strong vocal leadership on this issue. While some on the other side \nof the aisle claim to be supportive of Keystone jobs, they have failed \nto stand up to the majority leader who has blocked this effort time and \ntime and time again on behalf of the Obama administration. We need to \napprove the House legislative package and finally get this pipeline \nbuilt and these Keystone jobs created.\n  But the House's energy package would do a lot more than just that. It \nwould also modernize the permitting process, allow for more energy \nexploration, increase exports of American energy, and it would help us \nfight back against the Obama administration's war on Kentucky coal jobs \nin several different ways.\n  One bill would prevent the administration from developing more job-\nkilling coal regulations and another from Representative Whitfield \nwould push back on the coal regulations that have already been issued.\n  This package is common sense. I applaud our colleagues in the House \nfor their efforts on this issue. It presents a perfect opportunity for \nour Democratic friends, if they are willing to support it, to prove \nthey are serious about real solutions for middle-class families--that \nthey have a real agenda beyond just designed-to-fail bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5653-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5653-S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Daniel N. Fannin\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This morning I wish to share with my colleagues the \nstory of a brave Kentucky airman who loved his country so much he \ndefended it at the cost of his life.\n  U.S. Air Force SSgt Daniel N. Fannin, of Morehead, KY, was killed in \nthe crash of his reconnaissance plane near Kandahar Airfield in \nAfghanistan on April 27, 2013. It was just a few weeks after his 30th \nbirthday.\n  For his service in uniform, Staff Sergeant Fannin received several \nmedals, awards, and declarations, including the National Defense \nService Ribbon, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Air \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal with \none oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Achievement Medal with one oak leaf \ncluster, and the Bronze Star.\n  Daniel's mother Sharri Jones recalls this of her son:\n\n       Daniel flew on this Earth as an airman. His faith has \n     earned him angel wings now. He died serving others, serving \n     his country, and serving God. This mother is blessed.\n\n  Daniel grew up in Morehead and attended Rowan County Senior High \nSchool, from which he graduated in 2001. He enlisted in the Air Force \nshortly after graduation and at the time of his death was a 12-year \nveteran.\n  Daniel's mother Sharri remembers:\n\n       I frequently told Daniel he was my hero. Benjamin Disraeli \n     said, ``The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name \n     and the inheritance of a great example.''\n       These words epitomize my son. His name will be remembered, \n     and his works are indeed great examples. He was then, and \n     will forever be, my hero.\n\n  Daniel's mother Sharri continues:\n\n       I used to tell Daniel that it didn't matter what he did as \n     a career in life, but I expected him to be the best that he \n     could be, no matter if he was a ditch digger or a CEO. He did \n     me proud by doing just that. He was the best man that he \n     could possibly be.\n\n  As Daniel grew up, he had to learn how to do chores such as laundry, \ncleaning, and cooking. Sharri's mother said:\n\n       Like all kids do, he complained constantly, and sometimes \n     it was a battle getting him to do those things. I was \n     fortunate enough to get to attend his Air Force basic \n     training graduation ceremony in San Antonio. During liberty, \n     he took me aside and said: ``Mom, I want to thank you.'' I \n     said: ``What for, son?'' He said: ``For making me do all of \n     those things you made me do, like laundry. It sure made \n     things a lot easier for me here. Some of these guys didn't \n     even know how to turn a washer on!''\n\n  Daniel was an avid reader from his early childhood. ``The hardest \nform of punishment for him was not to allow him to read,'' says his \nmother Sharri. Daniel's wife Sonya Fannin certainly agreed. ``He could \nread a 400-page book in a day or less,'' she says.\n  Daniel met Sonya while stationed in Oklahoma City. Sonya says:\n\n       One of my favorite stories to tell was that on our first \n     date he went to the flower shop to pick a bouquet. He spent \n     hours in the shop, he said, before finally picking two dozen \n     white roses. When he presented them at the door, Danny didn't \n     know that those were my favorite flowers, but that was the \n     moment I knew.\n\n  Daniel loved to go camping, hiking, biking, and fishing. He loved the \noutdoors. On his and Sonya's 5-year anniversary trip to Maui, Danny's \nfavorite activity was a submarine ride 170 feet below sea level. He \nliked to say he had been to the depths of the ocean and flown to the \nhighest heights after that trip.\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n  Daniel was assigned to the Air Force's 552nd Operations Support \nSquadron at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. He was an airborne \nsensor operator and a qualified Air Force air surveillance instructor \nwho served with distinction at Tinker Air Force Base.\n  In his dozen years of service, Daniel deployed on three tours as an \nE-3 AWACS, or airborne warning and control system, aircraft \nsurveillance technician. He was also an MC-12 sensor operator. While in \nAfghanistan, Daniel was assigned to the 361st Expeditionary \nReconnaissance Squadron as a member of the 451st Air Expeditionary Wing \nat Kandahar Air Base.\n  His mother said:\n\n       After his death, multiple superior officers have told me \n     how respected he was, how well Daniel performed his duties, \n     and that he was exceptional at mentoring young airmen \n     personally as he was professionally. Daniel was a very devout \n     man. Many have said that he led them to Christ or reconnected \n     them with the Lord.\n\n  His wife Sonya agrees:\n\n       He was a Christian man of Christian values and morals. He \n     served God in all that he did.\n\n  Daniel also liked to laugh and joke with his family and friends. \nSonya says:\n\n       He went by many nicknames; ``Dan the man,'' ``Fan Dannin,'' \n     and my dad's favorite, ``Lieutenant Dan.'' My dad would \n     always ask, ``Lieutenant Dan, have you flown much lately?'' \n     Danny would stick his arms out to each side and say he had \n     been flying as much as he could.\n\n  After Daniel's death, at a park located near Tinker Area Force Base, \nwhere he had been stationed, Daniel's legacy was honored with a replica \nE-3 AWACS aircraft dedicated in his honor in a ceremony in April of \nthis year. Inscribed on the tail of the E-3 replica honoring Daniel are \nthe words ``Service Before Self,'' one of the Air Force's core values \nthose who knew Daniel knew he lived by.\n  Sonya Fannin was present for the dedication to her husband, and she \nspoke to the crowd of about 300. She said:\n\n       This memorializes Daniel's very essence, his giving spirit \n     in a way which those in the public can see. Memorializing \n     Danny here in the public park, a place in which our civilian \n     friends and family can visit and heal on their own time, is \n     truly special.\n\n  Daniel's family members and friends are foremost in our thoughts as I \nrecount this story for my Senate colleagues today. They include his \nwife Sonya Fannin, his mother Sharri Jones, his grandparents Henry and \nFern Hamm, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  I would like to close with some words from Daniel's mother Sharri \nabout her son. Here is what she said:\n\n       I know that there are many who continue to grieve deeply \n     over Daniel's passing. To them I would say, take the things \n     that Daniel shared with you, learn from them, and pass them \n     forward. Give others what he gave you. In that way, he will \n     live forever.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with such a heartfelt sentiment.\n  I would like the family of SSgt Daniel Fannin to know that Members of \nthe Senate do indeed recognize the things Daniel gave to his country-- \nnamely, his service, his life, and his sacred honor. We will be forever \ngrateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5654-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I come to the floor today my heart heavy \nwith a challenging task, which is to convey the remarkable, the \nspecial, the powerful spirit of a friend who passed 3 weeks ago in a \ntragic accident in India.\n  Matt Haley was a remarkable Delawarean. Matt Haley was a gifted and \naccomplished chef and entrepreneur. Matt Haley was someone who touched \nso many lives in my home State of Delaware.\n  In 2012 Matt won the Delaware Restaurant Association's Cornerstone \nAward, a lifetime achievement award recognizing restaurateurs who \ndedicate their lives to humanitarian efforts.\n  Matt owned eight different restaurants all across the beach region so \nwell known to folks here in Washington. Matt owned restaurants in \nRehoboth Beach, Lewes, Ocean View, Bethany Beach, Fenwick Island, and \nwas involved in dozens of other business enterprises in other States.\n  In 2014 Matt had the best year he ever had in terms of the reach and \nscope of his potential and his vision and his recognition by his \nprofession. He won the National Restaurant Association Cornerstone \nHumanitarian Award. I was thrilled to be able to join in that \ncelebration here in Washington. He won the International Association of \nCulinary Professionals Humanitarian Award. He won the James Beard \nHumanitarian Award in a remarkable celebration in New York. He won all \nthree major recognitions, major awards from the restaurant and culinary \nindustry--the triple crown, as it were.\n  Having never met him, you might think this man, having been so \nsuccessful as an entrepreneur and a businessman and so recognized and \ncelebrated in all these different ways, would have been puffed up and \nfilled with himself and with pride and with a sense of accomplishment \nand success. Matt did have a sense of accomplishment and success, but \nit came from a very different place. His spirit, his personality was \nprofoundly different than that brief resume might suggest because Matt \nwas someone who had a second and a third chance at life, so he embraced \nit with a passion and an openheartedness I have never seen anywhere \nelse.\n  Matt was 53 years old and had been sober for 24 years. Not many years \nbefore this remarkable year of success he had this year, Matt had been \nriding the bus to work as a minimum-wage dishwasher as he was \nreinventing himself. Matt spent 4 years in prison on a 13-year prison \nsentence.\n  As he memorably remarked in a talk he gave days before he left on \nthis trip to India, Matt had life-altering, terrible experiences as a \nchild. Matt had managed to grow up in an environment of circumstances \nand have experiences that would cripple any human person, any spirit, \nand had become someone who was violent and addicted, and inevitably, \nas a consequence of a lot of his actions, he ended up in jail. He was \nexactly the sort of person so many would be willing to write off. Yet \nMatt found an opportunity through the culinary arts, through the simple \nand powerful skill of cooking for others. He found a pathway back and a \nroadway up. Matt was someone who cooked not just well but was gifted at \npulling together completely unrelated items and making something \nsimple, tasty, and powerful.\n\n  Matt understood what a remarkable pathway toward success and \nindependence restaurants can be for those who start working at the very \nlowest end of the scale in our country in terms of pay scale and yet \ncan steadily grow to be successful managers or even restaurant owners.\n  Matt was someone who also had just gotten a positive diagnosis after \nstruggling with a nearly life-ending bout with cancer. Matt had nearly \ndied to this world once as a young man in prison and then had nearly \ndied to us a second time through cancer.\n  I was blessed to have gotten to know him just in the last few years \nand to have been touched by the power of his energy. Matt had a hunger \nto connect with and touch and help love others in the world who hadn't \nyet seen the possibilities of this world.\n  Matt would go anywhere, anytime to help someone in need in Delaware.\n  The stories are legend of what Matt did spontaneously and powerfully \nto reach out and touch folks in our home State and around the world who \nneeded his special gift--not just his resources but his energy and his \nkindness.\n  Matt's business partner Scott shared with me a story that he was \nliterally driving down the road and came across a van from the Delaware \nAdolescent Program, Inc., DAPI, a van for a program that helps young \nmoms complete school and be healthy and successful\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nmothers. Their van was broken down by the side of the road, and, after \nlearning more about the program and its impact and its importance and \nseeing their dilapidated and outdated van, he literally bought them a \nnew one on the spot.\n  Matt was someone who, having never traveled before until recent years \nwhen he first became successful, found himself challenged and then \nenlivened and then aflamed with a passion for traveling around the \nworld and for hearing from and connecting with young people and their \nneeds. He tells much more powerfully than I can the story of his \nbecoming connected to young women, to girls, in Nepal, victims of \ntrafficking, victims of sexual abuse, who were hungry and lonely and to \nwhom he was able to help provide food and shelter and hope.\n  He later also connected with a whole community in Central America, \nand he traveled regularly to India and Nepal and to Central America as \nwell as up and down my State. He volunteered in our prisons. He worked \nwith our food bank. He spent time and gave resources in India and Nepal \nand in Central America. Literally the last time I spoke to Matt, I had \njust had an opportunity to meet a young woman who was truly struggling \nto find opportunity in our home State. She was a recovering drug addict \nand came up to me at an event in Dover and frankly said she never \nbelieved someone in my position would care and would work and take any \nrisk to help someone like her find employment. She was interested in \npossibly working in a restaurant.\n  As we talked at greater length, I told her Matt's story. I told her \nhow this young man, full of anger and abuse and difficulty in his young \nlife, had ended up an addict and in prison and yet, through his own \ndetermination and through the kindness and partnership of others, had \nmanaged to go on to be an incredible success, an employer to hundreds, \neven thousands, and a contributor and a leader to groups such as La \nEsperanza and the food bank, and to support public school teachers and \nto support folks coming out of prison. I asked if she would be \ninterested in hearing from him.\n  In my last conversation with Matt--a man who was incredibly busy, as \nhe was finishing up several business projects and about to get on a \nplane to meet a long commitment with a group of girls in need--he said: \nAbsolutely. I would love to talk to her. Get her on the phone with me.\n  He made time the next day to meet her, encourage her, and invite her \nto come to the food bank presentation he was making.\n  To his very last breath, Matt was passionate about touching and \nchanging the lives of others. His very last initiative was to fund \nteachers and schools in southern Delaware and help provide supplies for \nthem in their classrooms, and his very last day was spent riding a \nmotorcycle on one of the highest and most dangerous roads in the world \nin the Himalaya to personally deliver supplies and engagement and \nsupport to girls in a remote village in a difficult and distant part of \nthe world.\n  Matt Haley's compassion, his spirit, and his energy touched deeply me \nand so many others. His determination to do everything he could with \nevery day he had and to make every difference he could in the world \nshould inspire and challenge all of us. He has left a significant \namount of his accumulated resources to his Global Delaware Fund, which \nwill continue his great work in these many places.\n  It is my hope and my prayer that all of us who have had our lives \ntouched by Matt and by his unique and infectious humor and spirit will \ncontinue his remarkable lifetime of work and that all of us will \nremember that in this Nation, every person has value and every person \nhas potential no matter where they are from or where they are today. \nTheir path forward can be lifted if we just continue to carry forward \nthe remarkable passion and spirit of Matt Haley.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5655-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5655-S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND MAJOR K.C. COURTLAND\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, it is a good day for Major Courtland to \nbe here because another thing I want to talk about today is the Air \nForce itself and to pay tribute to those in the Air Force. This is the \nanniversary of the 67 years of service and sacrifice for our Nation--\nclearly the greatest air power in the history of the world, the first \nplace we turn when we want to make an immediate difference in a chaotic \nsituation in the world.\n  We are talking this week, again, about how the Air Force can make a \ndifference, whether it is those based at Whiteman Air Force Base in \nMissouri or those based all over the world. The Air Force continues, in \nso many ways, to project our strength and our commitment to a more \npeaceful world by using the power that we do have in a way that ensures \nthat in some cases the playing field is more fair because we keep \npeople on the ground rather than let despotic governments get their \nweapons in the air. In some places we are able to intervene, as we did \nrecently in conjunction with the Peshmerga, to allow the recapture of \nthe dam in Iraq that is essential, and even beyond that, could have \nitself been used as a great weapon if that dam would have been allowed \nto be breached and then the flood that would have occurred because of \nthat.\n  The Air Force was created in 1947 under President Harry Truman's \nleadership. Prior to that it was called the U.S. Army Air Corps. I am \nproud to stand today at one of the desks that Senator Truman used on \nthe Senate floor--a desk later used by other Missourians, by Senator \nEagleton, by Senator Danforth, by Senator Bond--but a desk used by \nPresident Truman as he served in what he said were the best years of \nhis working life--his time as a Senator.\n  But he faced lots of hard challenges as President. One was how we \nmoved forward in a new and different world after World War II and how \nwe used our technology in different ways. One of those was to recognize \nthat the U.S. Army Air Corps had risen to a place that it really \ndeserved to be recognized for what it was--the Air Force. The first \nSecretary of the Air Force, another Missourian, was Senator Stuart \nSymington, who then would later serve in this body as a Senator.\n  Certainly, we have benefited in our office from having Kelly \nCourtland, Maj. K.C. Courtland, who has been helping us this year in my \nresponsibilities on both the Armed Services Committee and the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. This is actually her anniversary as well \nas a member of the Air Force. She now completes 24 years of Air Force \nservice on exactly the same day that the Air Force was established 67 \nyears ago. Twenty-four years ago Major Courtland enlisted in the Air \nForce. For the last year she has helped us fulfill the responsibilities \nin our office that we have and the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment--the one thing almost no one would argue we could do for \nourselves; that is the responsibility of defending the country.\n  We are hoping we see Major Courtland stationed in Missouri one of \nthese days. She is from Ludington, MI. She will be running her 85th \nmarathon this weekend--the Air Force Marathon. She values her military \ntraining. She served from enlisted to now her role as a major and has \nbeen unbelievably helpful to us at this time.\n  As we think about Major Courtland and all of the others who serve, we \nwant to be very mindful of their service, their willingness to step \nforward to defend our freedom, to be willing to defend our freedom at a \ntime when, once again, we are talking about this week those who would \nthreaten our freedom and what we will do about that and how we are \nlooking to be sure that the strategy we have and the resolve we have is \na resolve that allows us to convince our enemies that a peaceful \nworld--a world where people can pursue their own values, where they are \nable to pursue their own right of conscience, where they are able to \nlook within themselves and determine their own religious convictions \nrather than have someone tell them what those convictions are and \ndemand that everybody follow exactly the same path in the way they view \nreligion and the way they consequently would be required, because of \nthat one view, to view society and how people should live together--\nhopefully those who defend us will get the kind of support and the kind \nof thoughtful consideration and\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\ndetermination they need from the people in the Senate and the House, \nfrom people in the Defense Department and the administration, from \npeople in the White House, from the Office of the President himself on \ndown who are going to be making decisions that will put others \nin harm's way as we try to prevent greater numbers of Americans, \nfrankly, from being in harm's way.\n\n  I clearly count myself among those who believe this is a real danger \nto us--the location of this ISIS threat, the understanding from the \nSecretary of Defense that somewhere between 1 and 200 Americans are \nthere fighting alongside this genocidal group, and many times that from \nEurope fighting alongside this group--people with passports that allow \nthem to come to the United States, to not worry about coming over the \nborder and just worrying about buying a plane ticket and coming in that \nway.\n  Of course there are those who say--and I agree: If we know who they \nare, we should take their passports away. That is easy if you know who \nthey are to invalidate the passport. It is pretty hard if you do not \nknow who they are to invalidate that passport. In fact, it just cannot \nbe done. There are not only Americans coming back, but others from visa \nwaiver countries who just simply have a passport from their country and \nthey buy a plane ticket. Suddenly those who have become steeped in this \nwrong-headed view of the world--who have become conditioned to the idea \nthat a life, if it does not agree with you, does not matter--they would \nbe able to come into this country and into European countries in ways \nthat we have not seen before and still have access--as terrorist groups \nhave had before to many other countries--to poison the minds of people \nwho are looking for an answer. I can assure you that this is not the \nright answer.\n  So I wish my colleagues well as we make these important decisions. We \nare going to be looking at whatever we decide to do in the next couple \nof days and over the next 75 days or so. We will have a chance to \nrevisit that decision as we look at how force is being applied and how \nour hopes are being met. We will see if what the President thinks will \nhappen as a response to what we are doing here is actually what appears \nto be happening later this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5656-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5656-S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I have come to the floor almost every week. I think I have \ncome to the floor every week it was possible to be on the Senate floor \nover the course of the last year to discuss the changes we have seen in \nhealth care. We are now approaching the 1-year anniversary of the--\neverybody would agree--disastrous launch of ObamaCare. Most Americans \nnow agree, not only was the launch disastrous, but actually the changes \nin our health care system have not been what they would have hoped for.\n  The administration has delayed the 2015 open season, to sign up for \nhealth care, until the middle of November now. Interestingly, the \nmiddle of November is right after the election. I assume that is not a \ncoincidence that the administration does not want voters to be \nreminded, between now and election day, of what the problems are in \njust trying to sign up and what the new costs and new deductibles may \nbe.\n  But for whatever reason, of the many delays and the many \ndeterminations by the administration over and over again, no matter \nwhat the law said, the administration decided: Well, we can actually \nchange that. There is no justification for November 15 except the first \nTuesday in November. I think we all know that. No matter how many \nthings we delayed, though, the health care plan continues to get less \nand less popular. Every month, as I look at those numbers, fewer \nAmericans have confidence in the direction we are headed in health care \nthan we did before.\n  Earlier this week, CMS began sending notices to consumers enrolled in \nthe exchanges that have income-related discrepancies that do not match \nthe Federal data. Apparently, about 363,000 individuals are receiving \nthose letters. If they do not respond by September 30, the subsidy they \nthought they were having for their policy will not be there. In August \nCMS began to reach out to people who required proof of citizenship. \nApparently, it is too much trouble to have proof of citizenship to take \nto the polls with you but not too much trouble to have citizenship \nproof if you are going to participate in this program that taxpayers \npay for and that voters, ultimately, by who they send here and who they \nsend to the White House, are responsible for.\n  On Monday, it was announced that around 115,000 individuals--1,700 of \nthem were Missourians--were notified that their coverage would end by \nSeptember 30 unless they could provide that verification of \ncitizenship. That is not a very good notice to get with 2 weeks and a \ncouple of days of notification: By the way, you are about to lose your \nhealth care coverage unless you can provide documents and provide them \nright now.\n  USA Today reported that healthcare.gov still remains so ``glitchy,'' \naccording to them, ``remains so glitchy,'' that some people are being \nforced to send their information multiple times. Many cannot access \ntheir accounts, and then now there is the well-understood concern that \nthe information may not be nearly as secure as we would want it to be.\n  Serco, a company that was hired to provide services for processing \npaper applications--we found out just a few days ago, after months of \nwaiting, that the Federal Government finally responded to a St. Louis \ntelevision station--KMOV's freedom of information request which they \nsubmitted in March. It takes a long time to get one simple question \nanswered. The question was: How many paper applications are actually \nbeing processed at this processing center in Wentzville, MO? How many \napplications were processed between October of last year and March of \nthis year?\n  The number was not so big that it should have been that hard to \ncount. It was less than 5 percent of the anticipated number that the \nworkforce was put in place for and the company was paid to process--\nabout 271,000 people over that several months' period of time.\n  The director of the project testified in September that the company, \nhe said, was ``prepared to manage an estimated 6.2 million paper \napplications'' between that period of time, and instead they managed \n271,000. When you have a workforce in place to do 6.2 million \napplications and they do about one-quarter of a million, no wonder \npeople from that workplace were coming forward. Numerous \nwhistleblowers, according to KMOV, were saying: We are playing board \ngames. We have library books stacked up on the tables. We are told, \nevery once in a while, to push the button that refreshes our computers \nso that it at least appears that the computer has not just gone away in \none of many miscalculations in how this was going to work.\n  A GAO report released on Tuesday confirmed that people who had had \nconcerns about this bill because it would use Federal funding for the \nfirst time to lead to taxpayer-funded abortions--and many of my \ncolleagues in the House voted for this and voted for it only because \nPresident Obama repeatedly promised that the health care law would not \nlead to American tax dollars being used for this purpose. It is a \nlongstanding policy. It is a policy that Americans have strongly \nsupported for a long time. Unfortunately, this new report by the \ngovernment itself indicates that was one more government promise not \nkept.\n  We are on the verge of entering the second year of healthcare.gov. We \nare on the verge of entering the second year of this new Federal \ninvolvement in people's health care decisions. I think there is a \nreason that every week, every month, when Missourians are asked by the \nKaiser Foundation and others about this, this is less popular than it \nwas the month before.\n  Hopefully, when we come back next year, we will look for ways to make \nhealth care work better. Then we will begin to see people have more \nconfidence if we would do that effectively month after month, instead \nof less confidence month after month.\n  I yield back and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss the gravest and \nmost important issue we can debate in Congress. I am here to talk about \nAmerica's involvement in the Middle East and President Obama's plan to \ndefeat ISIS. Make no mistake, we must defeat and destroy ISIS. But how \nwe destroy them is what we must get right.\n  I applaud the President for presenting a plan to the American people. \nI support airstrikes against ISIS. I support providing humanitarian \naid. I support cutting off terrorist funding sources. Doing these \nthings has already helped to prevent genocide and has already begun to \nroll back ISIS's gains in Iraq.\n  I also support in engaging the world community, but most importantly \nTurkey and the Arab League nations. Unfortunately, I have not seen \nsigns from the region that tell me we have their full support. This \nshould be an Arab ground war and a U.S. air war, but I cannot and will \nnot support arming or training the Syrian opposition forces. I did not \ncome to this decision easily.\n  I spoke with military and foreign policy experts. I attended \nclassified briefings and asked questions of this administration--but, \nmost importantly, I studied our history.\n  We have been at war in that part of the world for the past 13 years. \nIf money and military might could have made a difference, it would have \nby now.\n  In Iraq alone, we spent the better part of 8 years training the Iraqi \npolice and military force of a 280,000-person army at the cost of $20 \nbillion to the American people--$20 billion. The first time they had to \nstep up and defend their country, their people, and their way of life, \nwhat did they do? They folded in the face of ISIS, abandoning their \nequipment and facilities to the enemy.\n  I ask my colleagues and the President, why do we think that training \nthe rebels would turn out any differently?\n  In West Virginia, we understand the definition of insanity. We get \nit.\n  The first principle of war is to know your enemy. And we certainly \nknow our enemy.\n  ISIS is a barbaric terrorist with no respect for humanity, and they \ndeserve to die. I have seen the videos and, like every American, I was \ndisgusted and outraged.\n  But as it is most important to know your enemy, it is equally \nimportant to know your allies--and I am not confident we know who our \nallies are.\n  To illustrate that point, I refer my colleagues to press reports that \nmoderate Syrian opposition forces sold American journalist Steven \nSotloff to ISIS, who beheaded him and put the video on the Internet. \nAre those people our allies?\n  Who are our other allies in this fight? As of today, we have only \nhints of military support from Arab countries that themselves face a \ngreater threat from ISIS than any one of us.\n  Syria's neighbors have the technical ability and the financial \nresources to support and train the Syrian opposition forces. If that is \nthe correct course of action we should take, they have the wherewithal \nto do it.\n  In the 1991 Iraq war, we had commitments from our allies around the \nworld, but most importantly from the Arab community. We had a total \nbuy-in. I know Secretary of State Kerry has been working tirelessly to \nbuild a similar coalition and to recruit support from Iraq's neighbors, \nbecause it is their neighborhood and theirs to defend. I hope it is \nsuccessful because, as our intelligence community has said repeatedly, \nISIS could soon become a direct threat to the United States of America. \nBut I strongly believe that if our military arms and trains Syrian \nrebels, we will be involving ourselves in a ground conflict that we \ncannot resolve where potentially everyone involved is our enemy.\n  To my mind, the reasons not to arm Syrian rebels today are very \nclear. No. 1, first, the weapons we give to moderate opposition may not \nremain in their hands. If my colleagues have seen the videos of ISIS \nshipping U.S. Army humvees and MRAPs out of Iraq that we gave to the \nIraqi Army, they will understand what I mean.\n  No. 2, I have seen no evidence that the Syrian rebels we plan to \ntrain and arm will remain committed to American goals or our interests. \nThe vast majority of national level Syrian rebel groups are Islamist, \nnone of whom are interested in allying with the United States. This is \nnot to their best interests--and not in their interest--and none of \nwhom we should be associating with.\n  Further, the opposition fighters we will train care more about \noverthrowing Assad's regime than they do about defeating ISIS. Assad is \nevil, make no mistake about it, but he is not a threat to America. If \nthe moderate opposition has to choose between defeating Assad and \ndefeating ISIS, why do we believe--think about this--they will choose \nour priority over their own? Why would we even think that? How do we \nknow they won't join forces with ISIS if it helps them overthrow Assad, \ntheir main objective?\n\n  No. 3, authorizing military support for Syrian rebels will \ninextricably draw us into a civil war we have no way to end--and we \nhave seen this picture unfold before. Our fight is against ISIS and the \nIslamist terrorist groups that threaten the United States. A limit of \nthat fight should be doing what we need to do to protect Americans and \nto prevent genocide. Every further step we take from that basic \nprinciple of protecting Americans and preventing genocide takes us back \ndown the road of Middle Eastern nation-building. That means we should \nsupport others with counterterrorism forces, intelligence gathering, \nair power, and diplomatic efforts--and it means stopping the flow of \nillicit oil, money, and fighters across Syria's borders. We do not need \nto arm and train Syrian rebels to protect Americans.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider America's history of \nintervention in the Middle East. It has not been a successful one. \nInterventions have failed in Lebanon, Somalia, Libya, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan is on the brink of failure.\n  What did we learn from our actions? Certainly not that going into \nMuslim countries to restore order or restore democracy is a winning \nstrategy for us.\n  I have been very clear: We have every right to and we must--we must--\ndefend ourselves and protect American citizens and interests against \nterrorists anywhere in the world. I again voice my strong support for \nthe counterterrorism efforts already ongoing to protect Americans, but \nwe have proven by blood and treasure already spent that we have not \nmade a difference with American boots on the ground in this part of the \nworld.\n  Some have used the examples of our garrisons in Germany, Japan, \nKorea, and the Balkans as examples of where the United States \nsuccessfully established the rule of law with residual military forces, \nbut such comparisons have little basis in history. Once our mission was \nachieved and occupation began, our troops did not face the threat of \nviolence from the same people we had just defended and liberated.\n  Others have said if we had kept a residual force in Iraq that ISIS \nwould never have taken hold, and I respectfully disagree. How can I \nfault a President for pulling troops out after 8 years, billions spent, \nand thousands of lives lost, with no end in sight? Again we trained in \nIraq a military of 280,000 persons at a cost of $20 billion, and when \nthey faced their first test, they folded. That was a fraction of the \ntotal cost of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I wish to give a rundown of where we stand today. In Iraq, \nconservatively, we have spent $818 billion. In Afghanistan, we have \nspent $747 billion, and that is continuing to grow. The total cost of \nour recent wars: $1.6 trillion, and that is growing. That doesn't \ninclude the cost of long-term care of wounded veterans, over 50,000.\n\n  But the cost in money is nothing compared to the cost of lives. In \nIraq, 4,400 dead, 36,000 wounded. In Afghanistan and still counting, \n2,200 dead and 21,000 wounded.\n  I know my vote comes with a price. I know that. It is my \nunderstanding that\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nthe same vote we make to train and fund the Syrian opposition forces \nwill also be one to pass a CR to fund our government. I do not believe \nwe should be forced to decide between funding our government and arming \nSyrian rebels in the same vote.\n  We should be ashamed for failing to pass appropriations bills to \nfinance government operations for the fiscal year that starts 2 weeks \nfrom now, and more ashamed that for the sake of expediency--expediency \nbecause of an election coming up--that we are using a stopgap \ncontinuing resolution as a vehicle for authorizing major military \nactivity that will have repercussions for generations to come.\n  Asking us to make this choice is a disservice to the American people. \nBut if that is a decision I am forced to make--and I will say if that \nis a decision I am forced to make--it is one I am committed to making. \nI understand my vote will likely not be the deciding vote, but even if \nit were, I would still cast the same vote. I believe these votes should \nbe separate and debated. We owe that to the American people. We have \nthis time to do it. I believe with all my heart we have more than \nenough time to do this. I am prepared, as some of my colleagues, to \nstay in session so we can give the American people the debate and \ntransparent transition they deserve.\n  We must learn from our past mistakes and we must not repeat them. I \nbelieve our country deserves this debate. Let me make it clear, I \nbelieve ISIS is a grave threat to the region and could become a direct \nthreat to the United States. We must confront and defeat them. I just \ndo not believe that arming the Syrian opposition forces is the correct \napproach, because I can foresee a Senate debate a few years from now--\nnot that far off--I can see this coming about how to defeat the next \ngroup of Islamist terrorists we helped to train and install.\n  I have not come to this decision easily, and I know it comes with \nconsequences, but I believe the people of West Virginia sent me to the \nSenate to make tough decisions and vote to do what is best for not only \nall West Virginians but for every American.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5658-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5658-S5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE EROSION OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it brings me no pleasure to make the \nremarks I feel compelled to make today. I think it is important for us \nto understand how we, the Senate of the United States, are operating.\n  The Senate--the legislative body heralded by the late Senator Robert \nC. Byrd as the second great senate in history, the first being the \nRoman Senate--is being eroded beyond recognition by the tactics \nutilized by Senate Majority Leader Reid and those who support him in \nthat process.\n  Today is Constitution Day. It was Senator Byrd who moved legislation \nto declare today Constitution Day. Under that Constitution, there are \ntwo bodies in the Congress, the House and the Senate, and the Senate \nhas always been known as the body where great debates are held, with an \nopen ability to amend and discuss, and the great issues of the day are \nlaid out. That is what we are about.\n  But the Senate has changed dramatically since I have been in the \nSenate, some 18 years, and not for the better--not for the better of \nthe American people. It might be good for politicians, but it is not \ngood for the American people and it is not good for the public \ninterest, in my view.\n  As has been happening time and again, we are once again today, at \nnigh on the eleventh hour, being asked to vote for a spending bill \nbefore we recess. We have to recess, you see. Why? So Senators can go \nhome to campaign, but we are being paid, whether we are here or back \nhome or vacationing or whatever. Why don't we stay a few days longer if \nnecessary? Oh, no. We have to get out of Washington and go back home \nand campaign.\n  This continuing resolution, covering a massive amount of spending \nthat no Member can fully comprehend at this late hour and nobody can \nmeaningfully analyze, scrutinize or investigate--once again, we are \nbeing asked to fund the entire government of the United States in one \ncatch-all bill, with no opportunity for a single amendment. There is no \nway to improve the legislation or to engage in meaningful consideration \nof our financial status.\n  Aren't we facing a crisis financially? Hasn't the Congressional \nBudget Office told us we are on an unsustainable financial path? Yes. \nAre we going to discuss that at all? No. We are going to bring up this \nbill, vote it through, and go home and campaign.\n  This denies the American people the opportunity to know what is being \npassed and to analyze and hold their elected representatives \naccountable for their actions. So the American people can't comprehend \nor study what is behind this massive bill either.\n  Once again, as a tactic, this bill is being rushed through under the \nthreat of a government shutdown. Without a funding mechanism, the \ngovernment would shut down October 1 if we don't pass an appropriations \nbill to fund it because the Government of the United States cannot \noperate and spend a dime Congress hasn't appropriated. That is a \nfundamental constitutional power.\n  Yes, there is a problem out there. How did it happen that we are \ngetting toward the end of the session and nothing has been done? I will \ntalk about that.\n  Why is this happening? Is it because we don't have time? No, it is \nnot because we don't have time. The reality--and I will say this, and I \nhave not been contradicted on it by any Member of this Senate, to my \nknowledge. It is not a lack of time. We haven't done anything this week \nor last week, and we have next week and the next week if need be. We \ncan vote 20 times a day. It doesn't take a lot of time to vote. People \ncan have their ideas to improve legislation and bring them up and argue \nfor them and get an up-or-down vote, yes or no.\n  So why is this happening? The purpose is to protect Members from \nhaving to cast votes that their constituents might disagree with, to \nprotect them from being placed on record one way or the other on \nimportant issues facing the Nation. That is the problem. It is politics \nfirst, sad to say. It just is.\n  We have not voted on a single appropriations bill in the Senate this \nyear, not one. Not 1 of the 12 appropriations bills that are required \nto fund our government each year has come before the Senate. Committees \nare being bypassed, secret deals rule the day, and millions of \nAmericans are thereby robbed of their ability to observe and \nparticipate in the legislative process. They are denied the ability to \nwrite their Senators and say: I hear you have an amendment coming up on \nthus and so. Vote for it or vote against it. That is all being \neliminated in this process.\n  It has been so long since we followed the regular order, I think it \nis necessary for me to share with the people and our colleagues what is \nsupposed to happen and what is not happening.\n  Each year Congress is supposed to pass a budget resolution which \noutlines the spending goals and limits for the upcoming year. Then, \nbased on the spending levels contained in the budget resolution, the \nindividual authorization committees are to report out authorization \nbills. For example, they are to review the Defense Department. We don't \ndo that anymore. They are to review the Defense Department. We normally \ndo a Defense authorization bill--but it hasn't been done this year--to \nauthorize certain spending and policy changes, utilizing the expertise \nof the members of the committees to shape where the spending is \nsupposed to go, laying out priorities, setting and making decisions \nabout what we can afford and what we can't afford, evaluating whether \nprograms are effective, to serve the citizens of the United States.\n  Isn't that what we are supposed to do? This is the way we eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. This is the way we stop it.\n  After the authorization committees do their work, the Appropriations \nCommittee actually is the one to fund the government. The subcommittees \nof the Appropriations Committee are tasked with producing \nappropriations bills for\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\neach area of the budget, which are to be individually brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, debated, and amended on the floor in the light of \nday before the American people. Each year the Senate is supposed to \nconsider individually 12 appropriations bills. This gives each Member \nand their constituents a chance to review and analyze every line of the \nbill and to offer suggestions for saving money, improving efficiency, \nand better serving taxpayers--which we are failing to do and we need to \ndo. We don't have a dime to waste, and we are wasting money regularly \nthroughout our government, as anybody who has studied it knows.\n  Under the tenure of Senator Reid, the budgeting process has been \ndismantled. We have only passed one budget in the last 5 years, \nalthough the Budget Act says we should pass a budget by April 15 every \nyear. Our committees stand idle, and the floor is one run not for the \nhigh purpose of legislative debate but frankly as an extension of a \nDemocratic political campaign committee.\n  So the Senate has ceased consideration of appropriations bills \naltogether, relying more and more on autopilot resolutions and catch-\nall continuing resolutions and omnibus spending packages.\n  When I first came to the Senate, almost every single Senate spending \nbill was debated. It was brought to the floor. A Senator was \nembarrassed if they didn't bring every bill to the floor. Sometimes \nthey had two or three that couldn't be completed. They would be \ncompleted at the end and passed as an omnibus bill, and people would \ncomplain. Now none of them are passed--zero. We go year by year without \ndebating a single stand-alone spending bill on the Senate floor. So a \nSenator has to ask, what are we here for?\n  One of the worst tactics the majority leader has used to suppress \nSenators' rights and block open debate is a technique called filling \nthe tree. Under that tactic he uses his majority rights to keep \nSenators from offering amendments as representatives of their States \nand the American people.\n  Senator, a bill is coming on the floor, and you can't stand and give \nan amendment? Right, you cannot. He fills the amendment tree, we can't \nfile another amendment, and he refuses to allow amendments to occur. \nHis majority, having written the bill with President Obama--they move \nthe legislation, and there is no real ability to challenge it.\n  It is not the way the Senate was supposed to be set up. The Senate \nwas always to be set up to allow individual Senators and the minority \nrights to be able to influence legislation and to highlight what is in \nit.\n  Blocking amendments prevents this body from working its will, \nprohibits legislation from being improved, and protects Senators from \nbeing held accountable by the voters on the great issues of the day. I \ndon't think there is any doubt about that. And that is the reason it is \nbeing done.\n\n  But we can do things the right way. It absolutely can be done. \nMembers ought to be able to offer amendments. It just turns into a real \ndebate, and people get to push for the agendas they believe in and \nadvocate for their position. Who knows, 10 years from today an agenda \nnot popular today will be popular then. That is the way we are supposed \nto do it. Senators being prohibited from offering amendments keeps the \nSenate from being a critical sounding board for the issues of the day.\n  Our majority leader has used this tactic, filling the tree, 90 times \nduring his tenure. To put this in perspective, the 6 previous majority \nleaders filled the tree only 49 times, all total. Mr. Reid has filled \nthe tree on 40 more occasions than all 6 previous majority leaders. \nThis stops amendments from being voted on, from being offered, and that \nis what is happening.\n  The majority leader has shut down one of the most important functions \nthat Senators exercise to defend and advance the interests of their \nconstituents.\n  It doesn't stop there. The Senate is supposed to be Washington's \ncooling saucer. That is why on many important and controversial matters \n60 votes are required to adopt a measure or to confirm a nominee, and, \nimportantly, to change the rules of the Senate requires a two-thirds \nvote to move such a question towards final passage.\n  That is, a two-thirds vote is required to change the rules of the \nSenate. Thus the two-thirds vote threshold is critical because it \nensures the rules have meaning, they have power, they apply, and in \nyears to come will not be likely changed, and protect minority rights \nin the Senate. The rules will apply when parties are in power and when \nthey are out of power. To change Senate rules requires a broad \nconsensus across the body. This protects the rights of individual \nSenators to be heard on the issues of the day. It is a key component of \nthe Senate's heritage of discussion and debate and openness.\n  Yet Mr. Reid, in an exercise of brute political force, last year \nchanged the Senate rules by a simple majority vote. He ignored the \ncounsel of the Senate Parliamentarian who ruled his tactic was contrary \nto the rules of the Senate. The Parliamentarian is our preeminent \nprotector of Senate practices, and over the years different \nParliamentarians have done a good job. In one stroke the majority \nleader changed the nature of this august body, perhaps forever.\n  So today the Democratic Senators who empower Mr. Reid and the \nSenators who give him power and support him are not even allowed to \nconsider important legislation either, effectively. Republicans or \nDemocrats cannot offer amendments. They cannot even fully debate the \nissues. Huge bills are rushed through in the waning hours of a session. \nSystematically the rights of Senators to provide equal representation \nto each State are being dismantled.\n  But it gets worse still. As we know, President Obama has promised \nthat after the midterms he would issue executive amnesty to 5 to 6 \nmillion people--immigrants who are unlawfully here, unlawfully entering \nthe United States. This Executive order, Presidential order--fiat--\namnesty--would include work permits for millions of illegal workers \nalong with photo IDs and Social Security numbers, and it would include \nmore guest workers. So businesses can bring in even more guest workers \nat a time of high unemployment and falling wages.\n  The President and the immigration lobbyists and business groups and \nactivist groups are meeting secretly in the White House trying to \nimplement through executive action the same disastrous, wrong policies \nthat were rejected by Congress through the House of Representatives. \nThe House said no to this. Once the public learned what was in the \nSenate amnesty and guest worker bill, they declared, no, no, no, and \nthe House heard it. So the President is now conspiring to go around the \nCongress.\n  What did Mr. Reid say? His duty is to represent the Congress, and we \nare a coequal branch with the executive branch and the executive branch \ndoesn't have the power to change the immigration law that is in a law, \nin effect. The United States law says you cannot work in the United \nStates--flat out, you cannot be hired if you are in the country \nillegally.\n  The President doesn't have any power to change that. The President \ncan come back to the Senate and advocate it and see if he can pass \nthat. But the Senate hasn't changed the law. You shouldn't be able to \nwork in America if you are not lawfully here. Taking a job from a \nlawful immigrant? This is fundamentally wrong.\n  What does Mr. Reid say about this? Does he defend the prerogative of \nCongress, the Senate? No, he doesn't. Instead, he has told the \nPresident to ``go real big'' and bypass Congress. Do the biggest \namnesty you can do.\n  Majority Leader Reid has blocked this Senate from considering the \nHouse-passed legislation that is sitting at the desk in this Senate \nthat would stop the President from doing this. He would use legitimate \ncongressional power to deny funding to execute any such bogus, unlawful \namnesty plan. The Constitution and the American people's interests are \nat stake here. But Mr. Reid is determined completely to ensure this \nexecutive amnesty happens anyway, and he is determined to do whatever \nhe can to see that it does happen. The principles that govern our \npolitical system, separation of powers, and public debate are not \nimportant here at this time.\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\n  But, colleagues, I would note that we have to recognize Mr. Reid does \nnot operate all on his own. He operates with the support and \nempowerment of a Democratic Caucus that allows this to occur. We saw \nthis vividly when I made a motion some weeks ago that would allow us to \ntake action to stop the executive amnesty. I moved that we strike his \nfilling the tree, remove it, clear the amendment tree, and allow new \namendments to be brought up to stop executive amnesty. That would have \nbeen to bar the executive action, and every Senate Democrat voted with \nMr. Reid--except the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin--that \nwould enable the President to go forward with his unlawful amnesty \ndecree. It is unbelievable.\n  The posture we are in is the House has passed a bill that would stop \nthe President from going forward, clearly. It has already passed the \nHouse of Representatives. It is sitting on our desk and the majority \nleader will not allow it to be brought up. Why?\n  He has the votes. Why doesn't he bring it up and vote it down? The \nreason is he wants to protect his Members. He believes in this policy. \nHe is advocating this policy. But he thinks if he brings it up for a \nvote, his Members might find out that the people back home are not \nhappy.\n  More than three-fourths of the American people believe the President \nis exceeding his authority if he goes forward with this executive \namnesty. So why can't we have a vote on it? Because of politics. \nProtect our Members. They don't need to take tough votes. Let's get out \nof Washington and go home and play politics in our home State.\n  Nobody in the Senate Democratic Congress has spoken up to support the \nHouse bill. Some pretend or hope the President won't do it. What does \nthat mean? Nothing.\n  But a vote means something. So let's vote. You are either for it or \nnot.\n  Every Member who supports Mr. Reid--and we will have another vote on \nthis--is as much a supporter of President Obama's unlawful amnesty as \nif they were sitting in a room helping him sign the order.\n  This is the time. It is either stop now or it may never be stopped. \nWe need to vote on it. People need to be held accountable. Every \nAmerican needs to know where their Senator stands on the President's \nunlawful assumption of power to violate plain law of the United States \nto carry out a political agenda he has that the American people reject. \nIt is that simple. It is about power and it is about politics and it is \nnot about what is best for America.\n  All of us owe our constituents a full, open, and deliberative process \nwhere the great issues of the day are debated with their scrutiny and \nthe people's scrutiny. We receive their input with our rights \nrespected, our responsibilities honored, and our Senate strengthened in \nthe process and respected in the process. The democratic process is \nmessy sometimes, sometimes contentious, and often difficult, but it is \nprecisely this legislative tug of war, this back-and-forth, which \nforges a national consensus. People have to stick their necks out and \nsay what they believe on important issues facing America.\n  It is a process our Founders utilized, men of the Enlightenment they \nwere, to find what truth is. Truth, they believe and I believe, is an \nobjective reality. Words have meaning. Principles are valid. Things are \ntrue and things are false. Their theory was you have a full and open, \nrobust debate and everybody says more through that process. It is the \nbest way for you to tell what the truth is, and based on what the truth \nis you can make a good judgment for what is best for America. It is the \nsame theory we use in jury trials: cross-examination of witnesses, \nbring in evidence, 12 good men and women judge the evidence in an \nattempt to find what the truth is.\n  Some of this crowd today, this post-modern group, they don't even \nbelieve in truth, if you want to know the truth. While secret deals may \nappear to keep the trains running on time, they also keep them running \ntoo often in the wrong direction. Only through a renewed, open \nlegislative process carried out in the full light of day can we clean \nup this government, forge a real national consensus, confront the \ndifficult choices we face, achieve accountability in Washington, allow \nour Senators and Congressmen to be there on the front lines and sink or \nswim on how they perform.\n  We are not guaranteed office. The American people don't work for us, \nwe work for them, and to act as we have in the past returns power \nthereby to the everyday citizen.\n  It is time for us to restore once again the great Senate of the \nUnited States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quroum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5660-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5660-S5661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, some of my colleagues will be coming to \nthe floor later today to speak about the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, and I am sorry I am not going to be able to join them, but LWCF \nis very important, especially to Montana, and so I want to make my \nvoice heard this morning.\n  LWCF turned 50 earlier this month. Passed during the Johnson \nadministration, LCWF harkens back to the time when folks reached across \nthe aisle to conserve our treasured lands--treasured lands that exist \nin all corners of our Nation.\n  LWCF has contributed to the protection of well-known places such as \nRocky Mountain National Park and the Appalachian Trail, but it has also \nsupported lesser known but equally spectacular places such as Cherokee \nNational Forest in Tennessee, Sawtooth National Recreation Area in \nIdaho, and the Flathead National Forest in my State of Montana.\n  America is filled with amazing lands that make us stand in awe of \ntheir beauty, make us want to go out and explore, make us want to hunt, \nfish, and camp. We must make sure they are preserved for our future \ngenerations to enjoy just as we have been able to enjoy it.\n\n  From hunters and anglers to ranchers and sporting goods store owners, \nLWCF is a program that simply works. It uses the funds from offshore \noil and gas receipts for a wide array of conservation programs. Some of \nthese programs increase access to public lands, others preserve natural \nresources.\n  LWCF is also good for the economy. When people want to get out and \nenjoy the outdoors, they buy fly rods, tents, and hiking boots. The \nlist goes on and on. Simply put, LWCF is an economic driver. America's \noutdoor economy generates nearly $650 billion each year and supports \nnearly 6 million direct jobs in many of this Nation's smallest \ncommunities.\n  In Montana, a State with only 1 million people, outdoor recreation \ncontributes nearly $6 billion each year to our economic output and \nsupports some 64,000 jobs in Montana. Outdoor recreation is a part of \nwho we are as Montanans, and when I drive across the State, I often see \nvehicles with stickers in the back window that say, ``Get Lost,'' but \nwhat those stickers are really saying is: I am headed to a trailhead \nand I am going to get lost in some of the wild places in Big Sky \nCountry. This way of life is passed down from generation to generation \nand the LWCF helps us keep our outdoor heritage alive.\n  We have come to expect a vibrant outdoor economy and amazing places \nto explore, but we need to remember this didn't happen by accident. It \nisn't by chance that we get to enjoy water and breathtaking landscapes.\n  As one of my many heroes Teddy Roosevelt said: ``We are prone to \nspeak of the resources of this country as inexhaustible, this is not \nso.''\n  We invest in our majestic national park system, preserve lands from \nAlaska to Florida, and we have millions of people dedicated to \nconservation nationwide. LWCF is a critical part of our conservation \neffort, and if it is not authorized, it will run out at the end of the \nnext fiscal year. As of right now, LWCF will stop strengthening our \neconomy as of October 1, 2015. We must fund and reauthorize LWCF so our \ntreasured places can be preserved for another 50 years and well beyond.\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\n  There is still time to make sure this critical initiative continues \nand receives the full funding it needs. Full funding for LWCF is \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  I wish to commend Senators Richard Burr and Lindsey Graham for their \nwork on LWCF, and I look forward to working with them on full funding \nfor this issue.\n  I will also push my legislation that requires 1.5 percent of LWCF \nfunds to go to increased public access to our public lands. Making \npublic lands public is a smart bill, and I will continue to fight for \nit.\n  There is a strong coalition behind LWCF, and I believe we can get \nthis done by working together. Along with leaders in both the House and \nthe Senate, we will show the American people we are still capable of \nworking across the aisle to preserve our treasured lands and support \nour local economies.\n  Montanans have favorite places to camp and fish and hike. It may be \nthe Bitterroot, it may be the Crazies or it may be the Bob Marshall \nWilderness, but we all love the outdoors. We all want to make sure our \nsons and daughters can enjoy the same beautiful outdoor places that we \ndo today. This is our legacy.\n  LWCF is a critical part of making sure all Americans can continue \ntheir outdoor traditions. It must be around for another 50 years and \nbeyond.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 503\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, last month we marked the 24th anniversary \nof the beginning of the gulf war. In August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait. \nShortly after this development the United States launched Operation \nDesert Shield, which led to Operation Desert Storm to drive Iraqi \nforces out of Kuwait.\n  Arkansas made a huge sacrifice during Operations Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm. The Arkansas Army National Guard had 13 units called to \nserve during these operations, and 10 units of the Arkansas Air \nNational Guard were called up. More than 3,400 Arkansas Guard soldiers \nwere called up altogether--the second highest percentage of any State. \nOf those Arkansans called to serve, nine of the Army Guard units served \nin combat, including the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade--the only \nNational Guard artillery brigade called to Active Duty during the gulf \nwar.\n  I thank all of the men and women--more than 600,000 Americans from \nacross the United States--who served and sacrificed in Operations \nDesert Storm and Desert Shield.\n  These servicemembers deserve a place of honor and recognition in our \nNation's Capital. My friend and colleague Senator Donnelly and I have \nbeen working toward that goal. I am proud of my colleagues in the House \nwho unanimously passed H.R. 503, the National Desert Storm and Desert \nShield War Memorial Act in May. I ask that we bring this bill up for \nfinal passage here in the Senate.\n  In a time where we are facing budget constraints, this bill is budget \nneutral. Private funds for construction of the memorial will be raised \nby the National Desert Storm War Memorial Association. This bill simply \nauthorizes the establishment of a monument on Federal lands here in our \nNation's Capital, which is what Congress needs to act on to honor all \nof those men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. Passing \nthis bill will be a great step in honoring our gulf war veterans. I am \ngrateful to have the support of the full Senate and look forward to a \nswift ultimate passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 403, H.R. 503. I further ask that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, with a great deal of respect and deference \nto my good friend and an extraordinary Senator from Arkansas, I \nactually do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1033 and H.R. 503\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. What I would like to do, because I fully support what an \nextraordinary and very important piece of legislation this is, honoring \nthose who served and fought and fell in Desert Storm--what I object to \nis the decoupling of the two bills, both of which honor our veterans.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 398, H.R. 1033, the American Battlefield \nProtection Program Amendments Act, and Calendar No. 403, H.R. 503, the \nDesert Storm Memorial en bloc, that the committee-reported amendment to \nH.R. 1033 be agreed to, that the bills, as amended, if amended, be read \na third time and passed en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nexplain to the people watching what is happening here. We have a bill \nthat everybody agrees to that is not going to get passed because \neverybody does not agree to another bill that is linked to it. We have \noffered multiple compromises on the battlefield protection act. We just \nhave a $17.8 trillion deficit.\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nWe are going to have a $599 billion debt this year. Yet this program \nthey want to authorize that will keep this program that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas would like to honor our Desert Storm from happening--they \nrefuse to take yes for an answer.\n  There are 26 critical sites that need to be protected that we know \nof. We said: Do that. We have said: Do not authorize more than we can \nafford. We will not do that. We have made compromises so that we can do \nwhat the intent of the battlefield protection act is and accomplish the \nleverage against the bill honoring our Desert Storm veterans. But that \nis not good enough. So what we have asked for is to quit allowing \nStates and localities to game the system with any kind of pay-fors and \ndo not have the Federal Government pay for the State's share or the \nlocal community's share plus the Federal Government's share. We have \nsaid some good government stuff.\n  You can pass this bill today if, in fact, they will take some \nadjustments to the bill. So what I would offer is rather than object, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey modify his \nrequest so that my substitute amendment to H.R. 1033, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to.\n  If you agree to these simple, straight-forward, good government, \nfinancially secure items, you do not get the full basket, but you get \nthe things that are critical to this country in terms of protecting \nbattlefield sites and we will honor our Desert Storm veterans.\n  I ask that we have that modification be agreed to which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. BOOKER. There is no more eloquent a person when it comes to good \ngovernment than Senator Coburn, but I do not modify my request. I \nobject. I ask unanimous consent that the previous request I made be \nagreed to.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the sad thing is the people who were \ninvolved in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield are in the middle \nof this. We have this other bill that there are some concerns about. \nThat is fine. That is what this place is all about. But the idea of \nholding the Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield bill hostage in \nthis situation is not good. We live in an era of gridlock, and we have \nproblems getting things done.\n  This bill passed the House unanimously and would pass the Senate \nunanimously. So I would hope that we can again get together and get \nthings worked out. The reality is and the problem is that there is no \nreason to couple these two together. If the other bill has problems, it \nneeds to be worked out. That is what it is all about. Let's have that \ndiscussion.\n  But the Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield bill has nothing to \ndo with that. So I would hope that in the near future we can move \nforward and honor these 600,000 people who participated, so that one \nday their children can come and visit Washington and be able to look at \nthe monument about which the committee will decide as to what is \nappropriate so that we can honor these individuals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--Calendar\n                                 No. 12\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 24 years ago, on July 26, 1990, President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, in a glorious sun-filled day on the White \nHouse lawn, attended by more people than had ever attended a bill \nsigning in the history of our country--President Bush signed into law \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, a bill broadly supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans here in the Senate and in the House.\n  It was a momentous occasion. You see, most people thought of civil \nrights as pertaining to people of color, religion, national origin, \nsex--that type of thing. But up until July 26, 1990, people with \ndisabilities had no civil rights. I remember when President Bush signed \nthat law, he uttered these words. He said: ``Let the shameful walls of \ndiscrimination come tumbling down.'' It was a wonderful day.\n  Looking back over those 24 years, can anyone deny that our country \nhas made great progress in expanding our concepts of the rights of \npeople with disabilities: the right to be educated and well educated; \nthe right of people with disabilities to have independent living, to \nlive on their own, not to be institutionalized; the right of people \nwith disabilities to associate freely with others; the right of people \nwith disabilities, children with disabilities, to go to school with \nother kids who are not disabled; the right of people with disabilities \nto travel freely with barriers broken down, ramps not stairs, buses \nthat are fully accessible now, trains, everything accessible, every \nbuilding designed in America. Think about that. Every building designed \nand built in America today is fully accessible.\n  We have gone a great way in making older buildings--even some of our \nnational monuments--totally accessible to people with disabilities. \nPeople with disabilities are finding more and more employment. They are \nworking--not at some minimum-wage job--but working alongside others, \nshowing that they too can contribute to our society and be fully \nfunctioning members of our society.\n  That is what the Americans with Disabilities Act did for our country. \nIn 1991 the United Nations decided that what we had done in America \ncould be an example for the world. So a commission was established to \ndraw up a convention, a treaty on the rights of persons with \ndisabilities. I might point out, it was negotiated under the George W. \nBush administration. It took several years, but it was hammered out \nwith the concurrence--get this--with the concurrence and the approval \nof the George W. Bush administration.\n  That U.N. treaty has been sent out to nations to be ratified. Over \n150 nations have now ratified it. Think about that. Of 196 members of \nthe United Nations, 150 have already ratified it. One country is \nsingularly absent--the United States--from whence it all started. If \nyou look at the treaty--if you just read it--it just echoes the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act language in what it does.\n  So I will have more to say about this later. But I just want to give \nthat background. We brought it up 2 years ago for a vote. Now, under \nour Constitution, a treaty requires a two-thirds vote--two-thirds of \nthose present and voting. It was brought up 2 years ago in December of \n2012. We did not get a two-thirds vote. It failed. Well, that Congress \nended and a new Congress started, so the President had to resubmit it. \nIt had to go back to the committee, now under the leadership of Senator \nMenendez.\n  As requested, the committee has reported out the bill again with new \nreservations, understandings, and declarations. Now it is incumbent \nupon the Senate to debate and vote again on this treaty.\n  I am hopeful we would have the votes this time--after due \nconsideration over the past couple of years, that we would have the \nvotes necessary.\n  The unanimous consent request I am about to proffer is the mirror \nimage of the same one 2 years ago. I want everyone to understand that \nthis unanimous consent request was not denied 2 years ago. We went \nahead, debated, and we had a vote.\n  That is what this unanimous consent request would do, provide us \nwith, again, 2 hours of debate, evenly divided in the usual form, and \nthen an up-or-down vote. We have the time to do it.\n  I mean, what are we doing around here, one quorum call after another? \nPeople want to leave here tomorrow night. Two hours of debate, a vote, \nthat is nothing to pass this momentous piece of legislation.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--Treaty \n                               No. 112-7\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 12, the \ndisabilities treaty document No. 112-7 (disability); that the treaty be \nconsidered as having advanced through the various parliamentary stages \nup to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; \nthat any committee declarations be agreed to as applicable; that there \nbe no amendments in order to the treaty or the resolution of \nratification; that\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nthere be 2 hours for debate, equally divided in the usual form; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time the Senate proceed to vote on the \nresolution; that any statements be printed in the Record; that if the \nresolution of ratification is adopted, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; that if the resolution is \nnot adopted, the treaty be returned to the calendar, and that there be \nno motions or points of order in order other than a motion to \nreconsider; and that the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Reserving the right to object, I wish to note that this is a \ntreaty that has attracted a fair amount of controversy. It is a treaty \nthat was voted on in 2012 and failed to receive the requisite two-\nthirds majority vote in order to be ratified in this body.\n  This treaty received additional consideration this year in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee on July 22 and received a 12-to-6 vote. \nThere are a number of our colleagues, both on and off the committee, \nwho have concerns with this treaty, who would like the opportunity to \npropose amendments, along with our consideration of this document. \nUnder the proposed unanimous consent request, we would not be allowed \nto propose any amendments, and we would be given 2 hours--only 2 \nhours--to debate it.\n  Given the significance of treaties, and the fact that they carry the \neffect of the law of the land once ratified, I think this body deserves \nmore, certainly, than the opportunity to debate it for only 2 hours. To \nbe precluded here from the ability to present any amendments would not \nbe an appropriate thing for to us do.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is another sad, irresponsible day in \nthe Senate. I say to my friend from Utah, he was here 2 years ago when \nwe proposed the same exact unanimous consent request, and the Senator \ndid not object.\n  It also did not allow for any amendments. That is usual when we have \ntreaties and it comes through the committee. So why is the Senator from \nUtah objecting today to even doing what we did 2 years ago? Maybe he \nhas the votes to defeat it. I don't know. We won't know until we vote \non it. But 2 years ago, the Senator from Utah did not object to the \nvery same unanimous consent request.\n  He says there has been a lot of controversy about it. Well, that is \nnot so. The only controversy has been raised by the tea party and some \nwhom I call the black helicopter crowd, people who just don't like the \nUnited Nations. I don't care if they like the United Nations; that is \nup to them. But it seems to me we ought to at least bring it up again, \ndebate it, and see if anyone has changed their minds. We have new \npeople in the Senate who were not here 2 years ago--new Senators who \nhave not had the opportunity to express themselves on this treaty.\n  I disagree with my friend from Utah. There is no controversy over \nthis, basically. Controversy? This is a treaty supported by former \nPresident George H.W. Bush. Former President George W. Bush, former \nPresident Carter, and former President Clinton all support it. All the \nveterans groups support it. The American Legion, VFW, Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, and Vietnam war veterans all strongly \nsupport ratification of this treaty.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has supported it strongly--and I don't \njust mean leaning back. Tom Donohue, the head of the Chamber of \nCommerce, has written, has called people about how important it is to \nthe business community that we ratify it.\n  Former Governor John Engler, who is now the head of the Business \nRoundtable, brought this up to the Business Roundtable and they \nunanimously supported our ratification of this treaty.\n  I spoke to the Business Roundtable group last evening, and they all--\nthe ones I talked to individually--couldn't understand why we would \nblock this treaty because it is good for business, and they understand \nit.\n  It is supported by the Information Technology Industry Council--that \nis AT I just spoke with the CEO of AT last evening who strongly \nsupports it; Sprint, Adobe, Microsoft--all the high-tech people--\nbecause they understand we need strong, accessible standards for their \nproducts and their software across the globe.\n  All disability groups, every single disability group in America \nsupports the treaty. Faith-based groups across the spectrum support it.\n  Senator Bob Dole has worked his heart out on getting votes to ratify \nthis treaty. He has been on the phone, he has made appearances, and we \nhave Republicans on it. Senator McCain has been a strong supporter for \nthis treaty from the very beginning. Senator Mark Kirk is a supporter. \nMr. Kirk is a veteran himself.\n  We had a press conference with all the veterans groups here not too \nlong ago and I thought Mr. Kirk said something very poignant. He said: \nA lot of disabled American veterans fought in places around the world \nto secure our freedom. They should have the right to travel freely in \nother parts of the world, even though they have a disability.\n  Think about that.\n  Senator Barrasso is a strong supporter, and Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Collins, Senator Ayotte have all worked hard on this subject. \nBut for a couple of people who have raised an objection, we can't bring \nup the treaty.\n  The Senator from Utah just objected to bringing it up for, what, 2 \nhours of debate and an up-or-down vote. I say: Hey, look around the \nChamber. There is nobody here. There won't be anybody here all \nafternoon. We could have a little debate on this, 2 hours; they could \nmake their case, we could make our case and have a vote for 15 \nminutes--and yet the Senator from Utah will not let it be brought up, \neven though he let it be brought up 2 years ago. He said: Well, we \ncan't offer amendments. That was the same 2 years ago, but they didn't \nobject to bringing it up.\n  When we see all of the support this has--and I might address an issue \nthat has come up, and it seems to have its genesis in the tea party. \nThey have raised objections on the basis that somehow, by ratifying \nthis treaty, we give up our sovereignty as a nation, that it erodes our \nsovereignty. That is based upon the fact that there is a commission \nunder this treaty. There is a U.N. commission set up, a 16-member \ncommission of experts, to draft standards and advise countries on what \nthey need to do to meet their obligations.\n  Again, if we are a signatory to the treaty, I have no doubt we would \nget a seat on that commission, and the high-tech industry council and \nthe business groups know that. That is where we have our input to \nmaking sure that accessibility standards, software standards, and other \nthings are adaptable for us, our business community, our software, and \nour hardware.\n  The tea party, some of these people, have objected to this \ncommission, saying that the commission can issue findings and such that \ntake away our sovereignty.\n  We have operated, at least for the past 20 years, under two other \ntreaties that have the same kind of commission of experts, and it \nhasn't eroded our sovereignty. Do you know why? Because it is advisory. \nThat commission has no authority to assess penalties or anything else \non the United States or any other country. All they can say is: Well, \nyou should do this, you should do that--but it is only advisory. How \ndoes that erode our sovereignty?\n  Yet the very same people who make the argument that somehow this \nerodes our sovereignty will rush to the front to vote on a trade \nagreement--a trade agreement such as NAFTA or other trade agreements we \nhave, which do erode our sovereignty, because it turns over to the \nWorld Trade Organization the ability to fine America, to tell us what \nwe have to do in order to make trade right. They have the ability to \ntell America what to do. Yet my friends who are objecting to this \nprobably support those trade agreements.\n  Yet when it comes to people with disabilities, why is it they are so \nadamant that we cannot join 150 other nations of the world to advance \nthe rights of people with disabilities globally? Why is it just people \nwith disabilities they focused on?\n  They didn't focus on torture, they didn't focus on the worst forms of \nchild labor, they haven't focused on any of\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nour trade agreements. Why people with disabilities? It makes us wonder, \nis this another blatant form of discrimination against people with \ndisabilities?\n  Maybe some in that tea party would like to undo the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I don't know. But we can't say honestly that, yes, \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act is good, it has done a lot of good \nfor our country, for our business community, for people with \ndisabilities, everyone, and say but we don't want to be involved in \nhelping other countries advance the cause of people with disabilities \nso people with disabilities in other countries have the same kind of \nrights, accessibilities, and standards we enjoy in this country for \npeople with disabilities.\n\n  Some people may say we are the best in the world on disability law \nand policy--and that is true, we are--so why don't we shine our light \naround the world?\n  President Reagan always referred to America as the ``shining city on \nthe hill.'' If we are a shining city on the hill and no one can get \nthere and we are not willing to help other countries, what does it mean \nto be a shining city on the hill? Is that some kind of an idea that \nonly we can have? We are a shining city on the hill when it comes to \ndisability rights, and we ought to be involved in spreading it \nglobally. This is our opportunity to do so.\n  Some people say: We can work with other countries. If they want our \nadvice, we can go to other countries to help them with disability \npolicy. Think about that for a second. We don't have the personnel or \nthe wherewithal to go to 150 separate different countries to help them \nin terms of changing policy. It takes a kind of collective action where \nwe can join with other countries that have done pretty darned well. \nThere are a lot of other countries that have done very well in \ndisability policy. To join with them, we are much better and much \nstronger that way than us just going to another country.\n  I was in China earlier this summer meeting with people about this \ntreaty, which China has adopted. They have signed on. We talked about \nthe United States working with China, not only in China but with other \ncountries, to help advance the rights of people with disabilities.\n  China is doing some interesting things. They are starting to move \nahead.\n  One person said to me: What is so important about America being a \npart of the treaty is that when we speak to one another, we speak in a \ncommon language of the Convention on the Rights of People with \nDisabilities. It seems to me that if the United States is not a part of \nit, they speak to us in a different manner. It is: The United States, \nhere is what we do; here is what you ought to do. That doesn't get us \nvery far in diplomacy.\n  But if we work with the Chinese and other countries to say: Here is \nwhat we ought to do, here is what other countries have done, here are \nthe standards we ought to abide by, there is much more force and effect \nthan if we try to go it alone.\n  I assume there are military analogies to this. Think about the \npresent situation. Should we go it alone simply because we are the most \npowerful, we have the biggest military, the best weapons, and \neverything else? Should we just go it alone because we are the best \nmilitarily in the world? I don't think the American people would want \nthat.\n  We have to join with other countries and sometimes ask other \ncountries to take the lead and we will provide that strong backbone. \nThat is how I see the disabilities treaty. We have to join with other \ncountries.\n  How can we give up the moral leadership we have had on this issue, \nboth here and abroad, the moral leadership we have had on advancing the \nrights of people with disabilities?\n  How can we abdicate that because a handful of people are afraid of \ngiving up our sovereignty--which is a bogus argument because that \ncommittee is advisory only. It makes recommendations, but it has no \nenforcement authority whatsoever.\n  By not ratifying this treaty, we are left behind. Think about that. \nWe, the United States, are left behind in a field in which we have \ncarved out leadership, and we are just going to give it up: No, we \ndon't want to lead the world.\n  Why wouldn't we want to lead the world in disability policies? To not \njoin 150 other countries, to not provide the leadership, to not provide \nthe expertise we have developed over 24 years or more relinquishes our \nresponsibility to people with disabilities, both in America and around \nthe world. Why on Earth would we want to do that?\n  In Ghana, a great young advocate named Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a man \nborn with no left leg but determined as a child to play soccer, turned \nhis obsession for this sport into an obsession advocating for the \nrights of people with disabilities in Ghana.\n  Earlier this year in Malawi, 21 African nations met on this issue of \nchanging their policies, advancing the rights of people with \ndisabilities. I was asked to go and meet with them. I couldn't because \nwe were in session in the Senate. But that is why they are reaching out \nto us. They want us to be involved with them to help move this issue \nforward.\n  In Nepal parents of children with autism banded together to start \ntheir own school to educate their children. They want their kids with \ndisabilities to be fully included in society and have opportunities for \nwork and for life. They want us to be joined together with them. It is \nconspicuous.\n  I was privileged to join Senator Cardin earlier this summer in Baku, \nAzerbaijan, for a meeting of the committee for security and economic \ndevelopment in Europe. I offered an amendment putting all the nations \nof Europe that are in that OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development--OECD countries--that we supported ratification of this \ntreaty. It was adopted unanimously. They want the United States to be a \npartner in this effort.\n\n  Talk to a disabled veteran who would like to travel overseas maybe \nwith his or her spouse and their children.\n  I recently talked to a mother whose family immigrated from Italy. She \nwanted to go over for a big family reunion, but she has a child with a \ndisability, and where they were going they had no accessibility. She \ncould have gone and left her son at home, but she couldn't do that. So \nshe missed that big family reunion because of the lack of accessibility \nin Italy.\n  It is a sad day that one individual on the Senate floor would object \nto bringing this up when it has such broad support.\n  I will say one last thing about the issue of sovereignty. I have \nheard a couple Senators on the Republican side talk about the fact that \nwith this Commission, we give up our sovereignty, which I have said is \na bogus argument.\n  Of my friends on the other side, the few who have objected to this on \nthe grounds that we would lose our sovereignty, let me ask this \nquestion.\n  Former President George H.W. Bush supports this treaty \nwholeheartedly. Does he not understand about sovereignty or does he not \ncare about sovereignty?\n  Former President George W. Bush, under whose administration this \ntreaty was hammered out, supports it. Does former President George W. \nBush not understand this or does he just not care about our \nsovereignty?\n  Bob Dole knows this treaty backward and forward--a World War II hero, \nPresidential candidate, Republican leader of the Senate, disabled \nAmerican veteran.\n  Are those few people over there who say this would erode our \nsovereignty saying they know more than Senator Dole or are they saying \nSenator Dole doesn't care about our sovereignty--which is it--or those \nfew who raise the issue of sovereignty, that the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce doesn't care about our sovereignty? I don't think we would \nlike to say that to Tom Donohue or to John Engler at the Business \nRoundtable. Of course they care about our sovereignty. Tell that to the \nAmerican Legion. Tell the American Legion they don't care about our \nsovereignty or they don't understand this or they are too stupid to \nunderstand it. Is that what they are saying or are they saying they are \nthe arbiters--those few, they are the arbiters of what is and is not \nour sovereignty. They rise above all former Presidents. They rise above \nRepublican leaders. They rise above John McCain, a war hero. Believe \nme, I think John McCain understands about our sovereignty. He knows \nthis treaty. He supports it wholeheartedly. Are\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nthose few who raise this issue of sovereignty saying John McCain \ndoesn't get it or he doesn't care about our sovereignty? Which is it? \nThe fact is, John McCain does care about our sovereignty, he does get \nit, and he knows this doesn't erode our sovereignty one single iota.\n  But I wish to make that point because those few keep raising this \nissue of sovereignty as though they are the guardians, they alone know \nwhat distinguishes our sovereignty and what erodes it--not former \nPresidents, former Republican leaders. In fact, every former Republican \nleader of this Senate still alive supports this treaty.\n  My, how far we have gotten off track since the adoption of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act that was strongly bipartisan and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act amendments we put through in 2008, \nstrongly supported by both sides. I dare say, we have strong Republican \nsupport for this treaty but for a few on the Republican side who just \nwant to adhere to that tea party nostrum that somehow this erodes our \nsovereignty and we can't join.\n  I will close where I started. The unanimous consent I offered today \nthat was objected to by the Senator from Utah is the same as what we \nhad 2 years ago and no one objected to it. The Senator from Utah was \nhere 2 years ago, and he didn't object then to the same unanimous \nconsent request. He did not object. So it goes back on the calendar. It \ngoes back on the Executive Calendar and it will be there.\n\n  I guess I would say the action by a few on the Republican side \nblocking ratification of the convention on the rights of people with \ndisabilities will not be the end. I may be retiring from the Senate, \nbut I am not retiring from this fight. I will never retire in the fight \nfor justice, fairness, and equality for people with disabilities both \nhere and around the world. I will never retire from the fight to refute \nthose absolutely unfounded and bogus objections to this crucial treaty.\n  I will continue to work with former Senator Bob Dole, with former \nPresidents, with veterans, with business leaders, with Republicans on \nthe other side who support this treaty, with the national disabilities \ncommunity, with our disabilities community. I will continue to work to \nadvance this and to get it over the hurdle.\n  The false claims--the false claims--of those who object to this \ntreaty will be overcome. We will succeed in ratifying this treaty. We \nwill restore America's stature as the world leader on disability rights \nand we will continue to fight for justice and a fair shake for people \nwith disabilities not just here in America but around the world.\n  It is a sad day, another sad and irresponsible day in the history of \nthe United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Suicide Prevention Month\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I rise today in recognition of Suicide Prevention Month \nto once again bring attention to an issue that weighs heavy on many of \nour hearts and minds.\n  Last month the world paused to mourn the loss of a man who brought \nlaughter and joy to countless lives, a man whose internal suffering \ndidn't stop him from improving the lives of so many he touched, \nincluding our heroic men and women serving overseas. Robin Williams \nsaid the best audience he ever had was with the troops he entertained \non USO tours. His death showed us that we may not always know who among \nus is living the life of unbearable pain and suffering. Even the \nstrongest among us sometimes needs a helping hand, including the brave \nmen and women in uniform who protect our country each and every day.\n  Today I wish to once again shine the light on the scourge of military \nsuicide. Earlier this month the Department of Defense released a report \nwhich detailed the number of suicides among servicemembers during the \nfirst quarter of 2014. The Department of Defense reported that a total \nof 120 servicemembers committed suicide from January through March, \nincluding 74 active component servicemembers, 24 Reserve members, and \n22 National Guard members. In 2013, 475 servicemembers took their own \nlives. In 2012, we lost 522 to suicide. We have seen 2 straight years \nof more deaths as a result of suicide than of combat in Afghanistan.\n  These men and women are giving their all to support our way of life \nand they risk making the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms. At \na minimum we should honor this service and sacrifice by doing all we \ncan to support them.\n  We all understand this is not a simple issue. There is no one \nsolution to the problem, no cure-all that ends it tomorrow. I do \nbelieve, though, there are commonsense steps we can take now to make \nmeaningful progress.\n  In May I introduced the bipartisan Jacob Sexton Military Suicide \nPrevention Act of 2014. This legislation is named after Jacob Sexton, \nan Indiana National Guardsman from Farmland, IN, who took his own life \nwhile home on a 15-day leave from Afghanistan. Building upon \nlegislation I introduced last year, the Sexton act ensures that mental \nhealth is evaluated regularly and is a central element of a \nservicemember's overall readiness in four key ways.\n  First, it requires annual mental health assessments for all \nservicemembers, including active duty, the Guard, and the Reserves. \nRight now the military provides the most effective mental health care \nonly for those who are preparing for or returning from deployment, \ndespite research that shows the majority of military suicides occur \namong servicemembers who have never been deployed.\n  Second, it establishes a working group between the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Health and Human Services to find \ninnovative ways to improve access to mental health care for members of \nthe Guard and Reserve. Where servicemembers often rely on civilian \nhealth insurance and providers, as the Guard and Reserve do, we want to \nteam up to be able to provide care right in their own communities. \nSuicide among Guard members hit a record high in 2013, and we are \ncommitted to bringing that number down to zero.\n  Third, the bill requires an interagency report to evaluate existing \nmilitary mental health practices and to provide recommendations for \nimprovement, including peer-to-peer programs I have proposed in the \npast.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that seeking help remains a sign of \nstrength. It protects the privacy of the servicemember coming forward, \nbecause no one should be punished for seeking help. No one should be \nkept from their next promotion for seeking help.\n\n  I introduced the bipartisan Sexton act with my Republican colleague \nRoger Wicker of Mississippi. Since then it has received the endorsement \nof numerous national organizations, including the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the American Foundation for Suicide \nPrevention, and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. This bill \nis a step in the right direction in the fight against military suicide.\n  I was encouraged when the Senate Armed Services Committee passed this \nlegislation as part of the fiscal year 2015 National Defense \nAuthorization Act this past May. This is important progress, but we \nneed to get this legislation signed into law. As the Senate prepares to \nrecess, I call on the Senate to take up the NDAA as soon as we return \nto Washington. There is no reason why this bipartisan legislation \nshould not be passed, and passed quickly, just as we have for the last \n52 years.\n  Our country, as we all know, is faced with many serious issues, some \nof which we don't have good answers to yet; but the Sexton act is a \ngood start to address the pressing issue of military suicide. This \nlegislation helps save lives--helps save soldiers' lives. So let's pass \nthe NDAA and with it the Jacob Sexton Act to show our service men and \nwomen that we are all in on supporting them the same way they support \nus.\n  This legislation is just the beginning. Combating suicide both in our \nmilitary and elsewhere is an issue that continues to demand Congress's \nattention. We must continually evaluate what we\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\nare doing, take a second and third look at the resources we are \noffering, and ask ourselves every day: Can we do better? Is there more \nwe can do before it is too late? The answer more often than not is yes.\n  That is why we must be vigilant in the effort to let people know they \nare not alone. There is somewhere they can go, someone to talk to, and \nsomeone to help carry the load. We need to continue the conversation \nabout what we can do to help our brothers and sisters, our sons and \ndaughters, our husbands and wives, who may feel like they are \nstruggling with seemingly insurmountable challenges all by themselves. \nThese challenges can be overcome.\n  Suicide Prevention Month is a reminder of that fact. There are many \nresources available to those who struggle with suicidal thoughts. For \nour servicemembers, trained mental health specialists are available 24 \nhours a day through the military and Veterans Crisis Line. All you have \nto do is call 1-800-273-8255, and press 1. You will get immediate, \nconfidential assistance 24 hours a day. For additional help, \nmilitarymentalhealth.org offers a free, 100-percent anonymous mental \nhealth assessment. This is a valuable tool for servicemembers unsure of \nwhere they stand.\n  I hope all of our servicemembers struggling with mental health \nconcerns and with challenges know that we are here for them and that we \nare working nonstop to ensure they receive the care and support they \ndeserve. Let's continue to spread that message throughout the rest of \nSuicide Prevention Month, and every month thereafter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Portman pertaining to the introduction of S. 2839 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Angels in Adoption\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, it is my pleasure today to come to the \nfloor of the Senate to honor some very special constituents from all of \nour States who are here for 3 days, and they are very special because \nthey actually have wings. We call them angels, and I think the \nPresiding Officer has met her angels who are here this week. They are \nMembers who have been honored or constituents of ours who have been \nhonored by Members of the Senate and Members of the House for the \nextraordinary work these individual citizens and sometimes entities and \norganizations have done on behalf of orphans here in the United States \nand around the world. There are happily over 124 angels here with us, \n124 Members of Congress--70 Members of the House and 54 Members of the \nSenate--who took the time to identify someone in their district or \nState who has really stepped up for orphans through either the domestic \nadoption and foster care system or our international adoption world.\n  I am proud of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. I am one of \nthe founders of the organization. About 16 years ago a group of about \n20 of us came together to begin really focused work on educating \nourselves first and then our colleagues across the aisle and in both \nHouses of Congress on the barriers that were keeping children from \nfamilies, the barriers that were causing children to be left and \nabandoned, never to be reunited with their birth families or ever \nplaced with new families who could adopt them. We struggled to learn \nand educate ourselves about why families break up and disintegrate and \nwhat is the proper approach after that happens to try to pull that \nfamily back together and if not, how we can place children in homes \nwhere they can be raised and nurtured and cared for.\n  You heard me say this many times: Governments do some things very \nwell--some things not so well--but raising children is not one of them. \nParents, responsible adults, raise children. It is the way we are \nwired. It is the way we are created. It is the only real way that ever \nworks well. I believe our job at the Federal, State, and local level, \nboth here in the United States and around the world, is for the \ngovernment to get out of the way and let this happen or start leading \nand helping with the kinds of policies that help children reunite with \nbirth families and if that is not possible, to move quickly--because \ntime is of the essence in a child's development--to make sure that \nchild and sibling groups are placed in a loving, supportive family and \nnot in an institution--not necessarily with people who are paid to be \nparents, not necessarily in group homes, but in real families. \nSometimes governments, nonprofits, and charitable individuals want to \nhelp with stipends to support that effort. We perfectly understand \nthat. It is perfectly legal. But we really love children to be in homes \nwhere they feel they are being loved out of a gift of love, and that is \nour goal.\n  There is so much gridlock and arguing going on. This is one issue \nabout which there is no gridlock and no argument. Republicans and \nDemocrats have come together. Jim Inhofe and I are proud to serve as \nthe leaders in the Senate with many Members who have been very active. \nThe Presiding Officer has been extremely active. I wish to say thank \nyou to the Senator from Wisconsin for her leadership on several pieces \nof important legislation. I would like to give a special shout-out to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, who has been remarkable in \nher leadership; Senator Gillibrand, who has been extremely helpful; \nSenator Shaheen; Senator Blunt; Senator Boozman; and I could go on. \nThere have been 20 or 25 real champions this year in the Senate on \nissues that affect orphans and children in foster care. Senator \nGrassley, who leads the foster care caucus, has also been a very \nreliable advocate on behalf of these children.\n  To frame the challenge, there are about 500,000 children in the \nUnited States who are in foster care. About 100,000 have been deemed to \nbe adoptable. Parental rights have been terminated due to gross \nneglect, abuse, et cetera. The courts have stepped in and said these \nchildren need a new home, new parents. That is a big number, 500,000, \nbut it represents about one-half of 1 percent of all the children in \nAmerica. From that standpoint, you can say America is doing pretty well \nwith keeping all of our children in families, keeping them loved and \nsupported. When families fail, the community, the government, and \nchurches and places of worship need to step in and help and be \nsupportive.\n  But we still have many problems. Some children are waiting too long. \nSome children are born in this country without birth certificates--I \njust met one in my office today, if you can imagine that--so their \nlegal status has been compromised. There are millions of orphans around \nthe world who don't have any advocacy and don't have the kinds of \nsystems we have in the United States to help with their identification, \ntheir rescue, their placement, et cetera, so that is the work we do.\n  The Congressional Coalition on Adoption educates Members of Congress. \nWe hold seminars for ourselves, educational opportunities. We hold an \nannual gala, and this year the Angels In Adoption gala is happening \ntonight in Washington. Angels are visiting Senate offices, telling \ntheir stories of adoption to our Members. Tonight we will be at the \nRonald Reagan International Trade Center celebrating with almost 1000 \npeople the work our angels are doing.\n  I wish to congratulate our three very special national award winners: \nadoptive parents Bill Klein and Dr. Jennifer Arnold, the stars of the \nTLC reality show ``The Little Couple.'' They are very famous in America \nand well-known around the world. People have watched them overcome the \ngreat challenges they face. They are very tiny but have great hearts \nand great minds, and by being on television, they have an extraordinary \nreach. We are all very familiar with their show. They are married and \nhave proceeded to build a family through adoption. They adopted a \nlittle, little child from India and another little child from China and \nare building their family. They have just\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nbeen remarkable models for all adoptive parents, of which I am one. \nThey share the joys and challenges of being adoptive parents of \nchildren with very special physical needs.\n\n  It has just been remarkable. We will be so touched by their story \ntonight. They just left my office and they will share their story with \nus tonight. I just wanted to thank them for their leadership.\n  Shonda Rhimes is not with us in Washington. She will be receiving an \naward. She is the executive producer of the hit shows ``Scandal,'' \n``Private Practice,'' and ``Grey's Anatomy.'' She has been a tremendous \nadvocate for adoption. She has written about some issues regarding \nadoption into her shows and has helped to educate the United States of \nAmerica and the world about the needs of orphans and the great \nprivilege of being adoptive parents.\n  Finally, our third national award winner is our Paul Singer awardee. \nPaul Singer is deceased, but he was a great leader in our corporate \nworld and our organization gives an award every year to a corporate \nexecutive. This year our winner is Debra Steigerwaldt Waller, CEO of \nJockey International. She founded an organization that really helps \nprovide support with postadoption services because many of our adoptive \nfamilies have adopted children with special needs and some have adopted \nteenagers or older children. There are all sorts of challenges that \ncome with those adoptions, just as there are with infant adoptions, and \nthose families need someplace to turn. She stepped up as a corporate \nleader and adoptee herself, and we are thankful for her leadership.\n  I wish to mention two other angels.\n  I see my colleague is on the floor ready to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I was proud to nominate Pastor Chad \nHardbarger and his wife Marsha. They served as foster parents in \nLouisiana for over 9 years. Amazingly, the couple has cared for 14 \nchildren from the foster care system and have adopted 6 of those \nchildren out of foster care. They have a 19-year-old, a 14-year-old, an \n11-year-old, a 9-year-old, an 8-year-old, and a 7-year-old. They are in \nthe process of adopting a special infant named Amber. All of them are \nhere in Washington and have had a great tour of the city today.\n  Monique, Chris, Bryce, Jordan, Bailey, Gavyn, and Amber are a \nwonderful family that was brought together and into the loving home of \nPastor Chad and his wife Marcia. They are now working with their local \nchurch in Shreveport--in the northwest Louisiana area--to help advocate \nand get other churches and other families involved in fostering and \nadopting.\n  I was so pleased to present the award to the senior pastor of \nEmmanuel Baptist Church. He has established his own ministry, Fashioned \nfor a Home, and he does so many great things to help our children.\n  These children don't have any fancy lobbyists or PR firms fighting \nfor them. The pastors at home, their wives, and advocates are the ones \nwho are doing a beautiful job. Congratulations to Chad Harbinger and \nhis wife Marsha. I was so moved when I met Senator Wicker's angel at \nthe pinning ceremony, and he was such an interesting angel that I \nwanted to put his story in the Congressional Record.\n  Senator Wicker nominated Mendell L. Thompson, who has been president \nof America's Christian Credit Union in Glendora, CA, serving more than \n48,000 members and has more than $500 million in managed assets.\n  He serves as trustee and director of several different organizations. \nHe received his award from Senator Wicker for designing a loan package \nat the credit union that would provide low-interest loans to families \nthat were adopting, because sometimes the expenses can be overwhelming, \nparticularly if you are adopting internationally but even if you adopt \nout of foster care. The foster care costs are minimal, but there are \nother costs when you adopt a child. Sometimes they have to add a room \nto the house or get a special vehicle if they have adopted a special-\nneeds child. He has made over 1,000 loans to families that have adopted \nchildren.\n  I wanted to give a shout-out to Senator Wicker's angel, Mr. Mendell \nL. Thompson, and his board of directors at America's Christian Credit \nUnion in California and thank them for believing that every child \ndeserves a forever family and for taking an active role in crafting an \naffordable solution for America's adoptive parents. He has a passion at \nheart for the miracle of adoption and continues to promote this in \nCalifornia and around the country.\n  I thank the members for their participation. It is going to be one of \nour biggest events.\n  Before I take my seat, Madam President, I wish to speak on one more \ntopic.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Reverend Samuel R. Blakes\n\n  Madam President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Rev. Samuel Raymond Blakes, pastor of New Home Family \nWorship Center in New Orleans, LA on his 19th pastoral anniversary. I \nwas honored to participate in the recent anniversary celebration and \nworship alongside members of the congregation and friends.\n  Reverend Blakes is a graduate of St. Augustine High School. He \nattended Southern University at New Orleans and earned both a bachelors \nand master's degree in theology from Christian Bible College in \nLouisiana.\n  Rev. Blakes has devoted himself to New Home Family Worship Center \nwhere he has served as pastor since 1995. Through his leadership, the \ncongregation of New Home has expanded to a membership of over 10,000 \nworshipers. Reverend Blakes remains committed to making a positive \nimpact on the lives of all people through his weekly televised \nspiritual broadcasts, live radio show and ongoing community outreach.\n  Rev. Samuel R. Blakes is the youngest son of the late Prophet Robert \nC. Blakes, Sr. and Minister Lois R. Blakes, both residents of New \nOrleans for decades. Prophet Blakes was an outstanding community \nleader, spreading his ministry across Louisiana and into Texas.\n  I commend Reverend Blakes and his congregation for remaining \nvigilant, faithful and steadfast in his service to his community. I \njoin his wife Stacey, daughter Sariah and the entire New Home Family \nWorship Center congregation in celebrating his 19th pastoral \nanniversary. I pray that Rev. Samuel R. Blakes will continue to be \nblessed with many more years as a spiritual leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3522\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Recently the House of Representatives passed, on a \nbipartisan basis, H.R. 3522, the Employee Health Care Protection Act by \nCongressman Bill Cassidy. This bipartisan act that passed the House \nwould keep the President's core promise throughout the ObamaCare debate \nwhen he told every American: If you like the health care coverage you \nhave, you can keep it--period, end of story. I am bringing this up in \nthe Senate because it is vital that the President, and everyone who \nmade that pledge, keep that promise, and the bill that was enacted into \nlaw would do that.\n  Again, the bill is limited, focused, and straightforward. It lets \nsmall businesses and workers keep their health care coverage if they \nlike it. It provides more affordable health care options for American \nworkers who don't want or can't afford the other ObamaCare mandated \nplans.\n  Again, the President and every Democrat who voted for ObamaCare \npromised that explicitly again and again and again. When that didn't \nhappen--when millions of Americans were kicked off the plan they had \nand liked and wanted to keep--Americans rightly felt misled. In fact, \nthat led to the President's promise and commitment ``if you like your \nplan, you can keep it'' being labeled by nonpartisan sources in 2013 as \nthe ``lie of the year.'' This bill would fix that and make it good. It \nwould not repeal ObamaCare. It would fix that part of ObamaCare. It \nwould make that promise good.\n  The keep your plan bill would let insurers continue to sell those \nplans that people want to keep that are less expensive and cover basic \nbut crucial needs. At least 2 million people would likely sign up for \nthese plans.\n  Last fall nearly 5 million Americans all across the country had their \nhealth\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nplans canceled even though they wanted to keep them--even though the \nPresident told them they could keep them. In Louisiana, 93,000 received \ncancellation notices after getting that clear pledge and promise from \nthe President and other supporters of ObamaCare.\n  Sadly, that hurt isn't over because the employer mandate for \nbusinesses that employ 100 or more workers is still coming. When that \nmandate kicks in in just a few months, we are going to see the same \nthing happen all over again with millions upon millions of Americans in \nLouisiana and in every single State getting pushed off the plan they \nhad, they liked, and they wanted to keep. Small businesses are losing \nthe plans they had, they liked, and they wanted to keep.\n  The bill passed the House, as I said, on a bipartisan basis, 247 to \n167, and over 2 dozen Democrats voted to support this bill by \nCongressman Bill Cassidy. Even Democrats on the House side see the \nimportance of the legislation.\n  I ask all of us to recognize this is a crucial element of ObamaCare \nthat needs to be fixed. It absolutely needs to be fixed. Thirty-nine \nDemocrats in the House had previously voted for a similar bill to let \nAmericans keep their plan in the individual market. Senate Democrats \nscrambled with the administration last year to find some way to let \nindividuals who faced cancellations on the individual market keep their \nplan, but those cancellations are happening to a lot of folks. It has \nnot been fixed for all those folks by a long shot, and more of those \nsorts of cancellations are on the way when the employer mandate finally \nhits.\n  I urge all of us to come together to pass this bill in the Senate as \nit has been passed on a bipartisan basis in the House.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3522, which was received from the \nHouse. I further ask consent that the bill be read a third time and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Reserving the right to object, just bear with me. As the \nSenator knows, the President set forth a policy to let States, such as \nLouisiana, take advantage of this opportunity--through the work of the \ninsurance commissioner--to allow those individuals to stay on their \nplans.\n  This bill would allow new plans to be offered that do not comply with \nthe ACA--plans that would include the kind of discriminatory treatments \nthat the ACA seeks to cure, such as higher costs for women than men and \ntreatments that are discriminatory against individuals with preexisting \nconditions. For that reason, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I think this is very unfortunate. My distinguished \ncolleague alluded to what I know. Let me tell you what I know. I know \n93,000 Louisianians were forced off a plan they had, they liked, and \nthey wanted to keep. I know the President of the United States promised \nthem exactly the opposite. I know my Louisiana colleague in the Senate \npromised them exactly the opposite, and I know thousands of more \ncancellations are on their way when the employer mandate is enforced. \nThat is what I know.\n  I hold hundreds of townhall meetings in Louisiana, and that is what I \nknow from talking to Louisianians, and that is why I know this is the \ncentral problem of ObamaCare and it needs to be fixed.\n  The bill passed the House on a bipartisan basis. I find it very \nunfortunate that we can't bring it up in the Senate on the same basis \nand pass it expeditiously.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nCelebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Wilderness Act and the Land and \n                        Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this month America celebrates the 50th \nanniversary of both the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I am going to spend a few minutes today--and I \nbelieve I am going to be joined at various times by a number of \ncolleagues--to talk about the important role these two storied pieces \nof legislation have played in creating a legacy of protection and \naccess to America's treasures.\n  First, people may not remember, perhaps given the way some in \nCongress talk about wilderness these days, but the Wilderness Act had \nan extraordinary bipartisan push behind it. It passed 73 to 12 in the \nSenate and 373 to 1 in the other body. Then congressional champions \nincluded leading Democrats and Republicans of that time. To celebrate \nthe success of this landmark piece of legislation today--and it is the \nmiddle of Wilderness Week--I introduced a Senate Resolution, along with \nour colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Sessions, \ncommemorating the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Wilderness \nAct.\n  Just like the original bill, our bipartisan resolution has numerous \ncosponsors and the support of our colleagues from both sides of the \naisle. Part of the beauty of the Wilderness Act lies in the balance \nthat was forged between immediately designating some places as \nwilderness in 1964 as part of the enactment, while providing a pathway \nfor future designation.\n  It is that balance that has helped to make the Wilderness Act one of \nour country's most democratic pieces of legislation in our rich \nhistory. By requiring future legislation, it compelled citizen \nactivists to go out at the grass roots level to involve their friends \nand neighbors to seek permanent protection for the special places that \nwere important to them.\n  While passing wilderness designations through Congress has been far \nfrom easy, the reward has been extraordinary.\n  Since the act was signed, Congress has designated more than 110 \nmillion acres of Federal lands as wilderness and each acre a gift to \nour future from our past selves.\n  Next to me a few of those acres are in a photo of Mirror Lake and \nMount Hood, part of the Mount Hood Wilderness within the Mount Hood \nNational Forest in my home State of Oregon.\n  Mount Hood is an Oregon icon. Ava and William Wyden, our twins, 6 \nyears old--pictures available on my iPhone after this discussion--ski \nthere. They have already recognized, at a very young age, that Mount \nHood is an icon.\n  Wilderness, there and across America, has been called the gold \nstandard of conservation, keeping areas under the strongest level of \nprotection the law provides and ensuring that they remain wild for \nfuture generations to appreciate and enjoy. By identifying what places \ndeserve wilderness protection in an open, inclusive fashion, the \ncountry ensures full public debate, opportunities to bring people \ntogether to build a consensus, sensitivity to rural traditions and \nlocal economic needs, with an end product being wilderness areas that \nall Americans can be proud of.\n  Creating wilderness is not only important for preservationists, it is \nalso crucial for conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts everywhere, and \nfor all those who make a recreation economy hum--the outfitters, the \nguides, the lodges, and the mom-and-pop diners. The fact is that the \nrecreation economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in rural \nAmerica and generates billions of dollars of economic activity across \nour country.\n  That is also where the Land and Water Conservation Fund comes in \nbecause it helps to secure and maintain public access to the country's \npublic lands and wilderness areas for recreation and enjoyment.\n  Also celebrating its 50th anniversary this month is the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. This exceptionally important program is \nresponsible for protecting areas in all 50 States and our territories. \nThis includes such special places, iconic places, as the Grand Canyon \nNational Park, many of our storied\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nCivil War battlefields, and numerous national wildlife refuges.\n  In my home State of Oregon the fund has helped protect many of our \nmost precious outdoor treasures, such as the Columbia River Gorge \nNational Scenic Area, Crater Lake National Park, the Pacific Crest \nTrail, and the Oregon Dunes. Equally important, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund feeds States critical funds that help create and \nmaintain the local parks, the trails, and the recreational facilities.\n  Every year the Treasury collects billions of dollars of revenue, from \noffshore oil drilling and other sources of energy production. Out of \nthat total, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is authorized to \nreceive up to $900 million a year.\n  It is in my view a balanced approach, it is a simple approach, and it \nis a constructive approach to managing public lands with some of the \nmoney the country makes from extracting resources, taking that money \nand turning it around, and reinvesting it in the country's unique, open \nspaces.\n  There are tremendous economic benefits to the investment the fund \nmakes. Nationwide, 98 percent of our counties contain land protected by \nthe fund, and in these places America's outdoor recreation economy \ngenerates $646 billion in consumer spending and supports more than 6 \nmillion jobs.\n  Few States enjoy the outdoors more than Oregonians. It is almost as \nif the outdoors is a part of our gene pool.\n  We see ourselves as outdoors people, and outdoor recreation accounts \nfor nearly $13 billion in consumer spending in our State, and it \nsupports 141,000 Oregon jobs.\n  As I mentioned before, in addition to its Federal role, the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund helps the States. It provides matching grants \nso that State and local governments can use those funds to build new \nparks that are going to help struggling cities or towns develop. Or, \nthey can maintain natural spaces that are critical to the quality of \nlife in those local communities.\n  But the bottom line is, those investments--Federal, State, and local \ninvestments--lead to job creation. We know that recreation \nopportunities drive tourism, especially in our counties where there is \na significant amount of protected lands.\n  Those who are recreating go to the local restaurants, go to the local \nshops, and they stay in the hotels. Often they look for outfitters and \nguides.\n  Economists note that job growth in rural western counties, where \nthere is a significant amount of federally protected land, is four \ntimes faster than in areas where we do not have that measure of Federal \nprotection.\n  These are just some of the many reasons why failing to give the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund the resources it needs, in my view, would \nbe nothing short of legislative malpractice.\n  Unfortunately, despite the fact that 80 percent of Americans approve \nof the program's mission, it has been consistently underutilized, \nunderappreciated and, yes, underfunded. As a result, jobs, growth, and \nprotection--needed protection for these treasures--are left behind.\n\n  I plan to introduce two bills that would help to secure the future of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. The first bill would provide a 1-\nyear extension of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the second \nbill--that I hope to be able to introduce very shortly--would make it \npermanent because I believe that dedicated, stable funding will ensure \nour public lands continue to be preserved and accessible to support \nthose recreationists of the future, the conservationists of the future, \nand the local economic leaders of the future who will prosper as a \nresult of those investments.\n  In closing I will simply note that we celebrate the 50th anniversary \nof the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund as \nmillions of families across the country return from summer vacations to \nthe parks and wilderness areas that these great laws have helped to \npreserve and enrich.\n  Children everywhere are sharing stories in their schools about how \nthey went fishing, hiking, and camping in their Nation's backyards.\n  If realized to their greatest potential, the Wilderness Act and the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund are sure-fire ways to help guarantee \nthat the next generation of Americans will continue to have access to \nbeautiful recreation areas, captivating historic sites, and pristine \nwilderness. Strong, robust funding for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund will help grow economies and create jobs in every State \nnationwide.\n  Finally, let me note that until recently I had the honor of chairing \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As chair, I had the \nopportunity to work particularly with two colleagues who are on the \nfloor now, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, and the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Heinrich. It makes me feel \nvery good that they are here because, as Westerners, they see day in \nand day out what we are talking about with respect to the importance of \nthis program and this extraordinary contribution it has made to the \ncountry.\n  These two great Western leaders, with respect to natural resources, \nunderstand it is not only about the past. It is not just about the \nwonderful half century that I have taken the time to note. These are \ntwo leaders--Senator Udall of Colorado and Senator Heinrich of New \nMexico--who I think are going to be part of the leadership, the \nleadership that works to protect these two great programs for years to \ncome.\n  I am very grateful to have the opportunity to be on the floor with \nthem.\n  I had a chance particularly to see some of the treasures in Colorado \nrecently. I can see why Senator Udall feels so strongly.\n  New Mexico is one of the few States I have not visited, so I hope I \nwill be able to wrangle an invitation to join Senator Heinrich.\n  But I want to leave the floor knowing that as we make this commitment \nto do all we can to make the protection part of our extraordinary \noutdoor spaces part of the legacy we leave for our children and \ngrandchildren, the case for these two programs--and advocating for \nthem--is in very good hands with Senator Udall and Senator Heinrich.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the \nSenator from Oregon. He has been a true leader in the Senate for many \nyears and I know the Senator from New Mexico joins me in thanking him \nfor his leadership and for his partnership.\n  I rise--as Senator Wyden has to celebrate the public lands of his \nState of Oregon--to celebrate the public lands of Colorado. I make the \npoint right out of the gate that our public lands support thousands of \njobs across Colorado and they strengthen our special way of life.\n  This month marks the 50th anniversary of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and the Wilderness Act. Both of these incredibly \nsuccessful laws have been instrumental in protecting our public lands \nfor future generations, growing our outdoor recreation economy, and \nensuring access to public lands in Colorado and all across the country.\n  In sum, what I am saying is these landmark laws have touched every \ncorner of Colorado over the past 50 years.\n  I am very pleased in that spirit to join Senator Wyden and Senator \nSessions in submitting a resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of \nthe Wilderness Act.\n  From the snowcapped peaks of the Eagles Nest Wilderness and the \ndesert arches of the Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness, to James Peak--\nwhich I worked hard to establish--the Wilderness Act has protected more \nthan 3.6 million acres in Colorado alone. These places have inspired \ngenerations of Coloradans and remind us that we don't inherit the Earth \nfrom our parents, we borrow it from our children.\n  Let me turn to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In 1964, some 50 \nyears ago, President Lyndon Johnson worked with the Congress to \nestablish LWCF--the acronym for the Land and Water Conservation Fund--\nto fulfill a basic promise to the American people.\n  That promise is, as we develop our oil and gas resources, we will \nalso conserve other special places throughout our country for the next \ngenerations.\n  As we mark 50 years of the program, we can tangibly see, feel, and \nbreathe its success in the 3 million acres LWCF has helped us to \npreserve as part of 40,000 local park and recreation development \nprojects across all 50 States, as\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nwell as over 4 million acres of public lands managed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In Colorado we have seen firsthand how LWCF dollars have helped \nprotect access to the public lands that help define us as a State.\n  From my position as chairman of the national parks subcommittee, I \nhave seen how these funds have been particularly useful to our parks.\n  After all, there is no better example than the creation of Great Sand \nDunes National Park in Colorado. This magnificent place was protected \nby LWCF appropriations that were obtained with very strong local \nsupport. Great Sand Dunes National Park protects one of our Nation's \ngreat landmarks and is also a critical source of tourist dollars for \nthe surrounding rural communities, and this economic boost is something \nwe have seen all across our State and our Nation.\n  It is noteworthy that for every dollar coming out of the LWCF fund, \nwe see four times that much created in economic value--$1 equals $4 in \neconomic value--and this investment through the LWCF program is part of \nthe reason we have seen strong growth in America's outdoor recreation \nindustry. When I say the outdoor recreation industry, that is \nactivities such as hunting, fishing, camping, skiing, biking--you name \nit--and those activities have generated over $13 billion. That supports \nover 124,000 jobs in Colorado alone.\n  In another vein, LWCF resources have helped States such as ours \nbecome more resilient when it comes to national disasters. Last weekend \nI was in Lyons, CO, one of the towns hardest hit by Colorado's historic \n2013 floods. This photograph is one of numerous examples of what we \nfaced for about 3 days last fall a year ago.\n  Trout Unlimited has shared a story of how LWCF funds were used to \nhelp recover from a similar flood in the neighboring Big Thompson \nCanyon 30 years ago. Back in 1976 local officials had the foresight to \nmake an LWCF purchase of 80 flooded properties and to replace the \ndamaged homes with new parkland which then provided fishing access to \nthe community and critical floodplain protection. That $1 million \ninvestment in 1976 helped families who had lost their homes then and \navoided an estimated $16 million in property damages in 2013 that would \nhave happened without those preservation efforts.\n  The Big Thompson Canyon flooded in a similar fashion last year as it \ndid in 1976, but because of the LWCF moneys and the fact that 80 \nflooded properties were purchased, there weren't buildings and there \nwasn't human activity in those areas, and we saw the result. It was a \nway to rebuild smarter and better in 1976, and we are going to do that \ngoing forward from 2013's flood.\n  As a part of that, I was really excited and pleased to hear that the \ntown of Lyons recently received $350,000 of LWCF funding to repair and \nrebuild the spectacular St. Vrain River corridor trail. Before that \ntrail was destroyed last fall in the flood, it had been used as a \nregional connector for anglers, cyclists, kayakers, mountain bikers, \nand many others. This project will now help restore a vital economic \nasset for the community, and it will ensure access to the river and the \nriver corridor for many generations to come. That is a success story, \npure and simple.\n  LWCF has helped in many other less obvious ways. As we fight to get \nour kids--and ourselves--to spend less time in front of the television, \noutdoor recreation is still the best way to stay physically fit and \nactive and emotionally healthy.\n  This past July I rafted the Browns Canyon Wilderness Study Area of \nthe Arkansas River. You can see here what a spectacular and unique \nplace Browns Canyon is--an area I have proposed to preserve permanently \nas the Browns Canyon National Monument and Wilderness. Along on that \nrafting trip we had a group of veterans, and several of them are \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, as we know it. \nThey told me how they use their time outdoors as a part of their \nhealing--again, a success story.\n  How do we keep LWCF strong? Even though LWCF has been successful by \nany measure, while enjoying strong bipartisan support, the program has \nonly been fully funded two times since its enacting law in 1964 \npromised $900 million in annual funding. That is right--only two times \nout of the last 50 years. LWCF is a victim of the uncertainty of the \nannual appropriations cycle, which leaves a huge unmet need in Colorado \nand across our country. That is why I have been fighting--joined by \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--for full, permanent \nfunding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am very pleased to \nbe working with Senator Wyden, Senator Heinrich, and others on a fix \nthat would fulfill the LWCF promise. This is a promise to our kids, our \ngrandkids, and all generations down the line, and we have an obligation \nto keep it.\n  The good news is that this potential fix would also reauthorize and \nfund two other programs that are critical to our rural communities: the \nPayment in Lieu of Taxes Program, which is also known as PILT, and \nSecure Rural Schools. I will talk briefly about both of those programs.\n  For decades the PILT Program has provided critical funding to nearly \n1,900 rural counties to make up for diminished tax revenues stemming \nfrom Federal land ownership within those county boundaries. PILT helps \nensure rural communities have access to basic services such as law \nenforcement, education, and health services.\n  Let me share an example. Ouray County in southwestern Colorado is \nstill recovering from the recent economic downturn and the \ncorresponding 36 percent drop in property tax collection. The county \nhas already cut staff time significantly by reducing county operations \nto only 4 days a week. Without PILT, that would drop to just 3 days a \nweek. PILT also ensures that the county can hire a sheriff and that \nstudents can get to school.\n  Unfortunately, permanent funding for this program expired, and PILT \nnow experiences the uncertainty of short-term fixes, creating \nsignificant planning challenges for Colorado and rural Americans. I was \nproud to lead the effort last year to extend PILT funding through the \nfarm bill, which delivered $34.5 million to Colorado communities. But \nhere in the Congress we have to do more. We have to confront this \nannual uncertainty over the future of the PILT Program. That is why I \nhave championed a separate bill to permanently fund PILT. This is also \na bipartisan effort, and it is why I have worked with Senator Wyden to \ninclude such certainty in this comprehensive bill today.\n\n  I mentioned the Secure Rural Schools Program, and the same could be \nsaid of it. Rural Colorado communities rely on the Secure Rural Schools \nProgram to hire teachers and strengthen our education system. In 2013 \nalone Colorado communities--where one teacher can make or break a \nschool--received $9.5 million through this vital program. So this \nimportant bill for our Secure Rural Schools Program would ensure that \nthe Federal Government keeps its commitment to our rural counties to \nhelp offset the costs of public education, roads, and other essential \nservices.\n  We have a dynamic trio of very important programs: LWCF, PILT, and \nSecure Rural Schools. They help support Colorado's rural communities \nand our special way of life.\n  I will conclude with this theme. We are a nation of risk-takers and \nexplorers, always searching for the next challenge to overcome or the \nnext mountain to climb. Our public lands are a reminder of that \nheritage, and finding the right balance for how to use our public lands \nis the next challenge to overcome. As we tackle problems such as \ngrowing our economy, disaster response, and taking care of our wounded \nwarriors, let's not forget the important role of our public lands and \nthe opportunities they provide for outdoor recreation, our economy, and \nour health. This year, let's reflect on what President Kennedy called \n``intelligent use of natural resources.'' Let's celebrate 50 years of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund with bipartisan action for full \nand permanent funding for LWCF, PILT, and Secure Rural Schools.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, let me start out by righting a wrong. I \nhadn't realized Chairman Wyden, our chairman from Oregon, had not had a \nchance to visit the great State of New Mexico. I will fix that right \nnow and\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nmake sure he is not only invited, but we might seek to show him some of \nthe incredible places the two programs we are talking about today have \nhelped preserve, protect, and make as assets to our local economy in \nthe State of New Mexico.\n  As we heard from our colleague Senator Udall and our colleague \nChairman Wyden of Oregon as well, this month we celebrate two \nincredible milestones in our country's conservation history. We \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act and the 50th \nanniversary of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Both of these \nprograms have been etched into the history of my home State by New \nMexico conservationists with names such as Aldo Leopold, Senator \nClinton P. Anderson, and Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall.\n  When Senator Anderson steered the passage of the Wilderness Act here \non the floor of the Senate, he said on August 20, 1964:\n\n       In no area has this Congress more decisively served the \n     future well-being of the Nation than in passing legislation \n     to conserve natural resources and to provide the means by \n     which our people could enjoy them. . . . While we stretch out \n     the highways to carry ever-expanding traffic, while we build \n     whole new communities to house a growing population, and \n     while we consume more acreage for a burgeoning industry, we \n     have set aside part of our land as it was when human eye \n     first saw it--unscarred by man, primeval, a memorial to the \n     Creator who molded it.\n\n  Senator Anderson was also unquestionably one of the principal \narchitects of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the 88th \nCongress, where so much of this work was done, was coined as the \n``Conservation Congress.''\n  LWCF is the primary tool our Nation uses to fund the protection of \nour natural and cultural heritage, and I have worked diligently with my \ncolleagues--including Senator Udall, his cousin Senator Udall of New \nMexico, Senator Wyden of Oregon, and others--to secure full and \npermanent funding for this program.\n  But even 40 years before the enactment of the Wilderness Act or LWCF, \nconservationist Aldo Leopold had the vision and influence to help \nprotect 500,000 acres of mountains, rivers, and mesas in New Mexico--\nwhich eventually became the Gila Wilderness--in order to ensure a \nroadless and backcountry experience free of what Aldo Leopold called \n``Ford dust'' for those hearty enough to saddle up or hike into the \nheart of this wild country. With the passage of the Wilderness Act, it \nbecame the National Forest System's very first designated wilderness \narea. New Mexico is also where the idea of tribally administered \nwilderness became a reality when Blue Lake was returned to Taos Pueblo.\n  Former Senator Jeff Bingaman's leadership was absolutely invaluable \nin conserving important public lands in New Mexico, such as the Rio \nGrande del Norte and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks regions, both of \nwhich were designated national monuments within the last 2 years.\n  But the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is not just about the past, as we have heard from my \ncolleagues. The future of public lands conservation will depend on the \ncontinued collaborative efforts of our elected officials, our business \nowners, tribal leaders, sportsmen, conservation organizations, outdoor \nretailers, and others to work together to protect America's most \ntreasured natural landscapes.\n  Our efforts should continue our proud bipartisan history. After all, \nit was Representative John Saylor, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who \nwas the lead sponsor and champion in the House of Representatives for \nthe Wilderness Act. And it was former Republican Senator Pete Domenici \nof my home State who championed legislation to designate the Sandia \nWilderness, a place I look upon every time I go home to Albuquerque, \nand who said at the time that the area ``forms a beautiful natural \nbackdrop for the city which all the residents can enjoy.''\n\n  In New Mexico, hunters and anglers, campers and acequia parciantes, \nchili farmers and urban dwellers, all have a deep connection to the \noutdoors and benefit from the recreation, wildlife, and the water that \nwilderness provides. Many of my own most formative moments, decisions, \nmemories, and turning points have occurred in these public wildlands.\n  I remember a trip with my wife Julie to the Irish Wilderness in \nMissouri, a trip that we made as we were leaving our college days \nbehind in the Midwest and heading back west to New Mexico to start our \nnew life together. In 2001, shortly after 9/11, I backpacked through 53 \nmiles of the Gilo Wilderness and decided on that trip to run for a seat \non the Albuquerque City Council.\n  I have many cherished memories from the trips my wife and I have made \nover the years along the spines of the American Rockies, the Sangre de \nCristos, the Tetons, in places with names like the Pecos Wilderness, \nthe South San Juan, Jedediah Smith, and canyons with names like Dark \nCanyon, Desolation Canyon, Gray, Grand Gulch, the Goosenecks, the San \nJuan, and of course the Chama River Canyon near my home.\n  Wilderness is in my blood, and I make no apologies for believing that \nsome places are so very special that we will never improve upon them. \nThese are the places worth fighting for.\n  I am committed to carry on my State's rich conservation history. \nSenator Tom Udall and I have introduced legislation to designate \nspecial places such as the Columbine-Hondo in Taos County, the San \nAntonio River and Ute Mountain in the new Rio Grande del Norte National \nMonument as new wilderness areas. It is clear that conservation and \ngrowing our economy are inextricably linked. Protected wild places \ncontribute to the New Mexico economy in a robust and sustainable \noutdoor recreation community which generates $6.1 billion in consumer \nspending every year in the State, gives us 68,000 New Mexico jobs, and \n$1.7 billion in wages and salaries, according to the Outdoor Industry \nAssociation.\n  The new Rio Grande del Norte National Monument in northern New Mexico \nhas already yielded economic benefits since its designation. After less \nthan 1 year since it was designated a national monument, the local \ncommunity saw a 40-percent increase in visitors.\n  As we look back on the last 50 years since the Wilderness Act and the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund both became law, let us also look to \nthe future. My children love wild places as much as I do. My son Carter \nwill be backpack hunting for elk with me later this fall. My son \nMichael will join me on BLM land to chase mule deer. They have hiked \nthe Columbine Hondo Wilderness Study Area and fished in Cruces Basin \nWilderness.\n  It is up to all of us to ensure that their children have the same \nopportunities we had and that we have shared with their generation.\n  I close with a quote from Aldo Leopold's book, ``A Sand County \nAlmanac'':\n\n       When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may \n     begin to use it with love and respect.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and to commemorate its 50th anniversary \nthis month.\n  Fifty years ago, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the House and \nSenate passed and President Johnson signed into law the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act. And for 50 years now, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has helped protect and preserve our Nation's outdoor \nheritage all around my home State of Washington and across the country \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  The LWCF contains a set of unique tools that empower local \ncommunities to increase public access to open space, conserve forests, \nand protect wilderness areas. These funds help secure permanent, public \naccess to lands and waterways for hikers, bikers, campers, hunters, \nanglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Senator Henry Jackson, from my \nhome State of Washington, was one of the drafters of the original \nlegislation. During debate of the bill on this very floor, he reminded \nhis colleagues of the importance of open space to Americans, that these \npublic lands are ``the places they go to hunt, fish, camp, picnic, \nswim, for boating or driving for pleasure, or perhaps simply for \nrelaxation or solitude.'' And that description still rings true today.\n  There are many examples of the LWCF at work in my home State of \nWashington. LWCF support flowing through its State and local assistance\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\ngrants, Forest Legacy Program, Federal Land Management Agency projects, \nand Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have helped \nprotect over 120,000 acres of land and create or enhance hundreds of \nrecreational facilities. These funds have gone to a wide variety of \nprojects, from Federal wilderness to private working farms and forests, \nfrom scenic rivers to urban water parks. From the Straits of Juan de \nFuca to the crest of the Cascades, from the Columbia River Gorge to the \nLittle Spokane River, the LWCF has made my State a better place for \nfuture generations.\n  But a common thread through all these projects has been the way LWCF \nfunding has brought together local public officials, conservationists, \nfarmers, business leaders, forest owners, and engaged citizens to \ncreate and enhance public access to open space and natural areas and \nhelp keep sprawl in check, all while allowing for sustained economic \ngrowth and development. Funding from the LWCF were key in allowing for \nmany of the individual acquisitions needed to achieve this, and I am \nproud to have supported many of these projects which have helped make \nthese communities' visions a reality.\n  It is important to remember that it isn't just rural areas in \nWashington that have been enhanced with resources from the fund. Dozens \nof projects in the hearts of our cities have given children access to \nmuch needed parks, sports fields, and swimming facilities. Families can \nnow enjoy time together picnicking, biking, and even hiking in forests \nand other habitats, right outside their doorsteps. And we all benefit \nfrom the cleaner air and cleaner water that results from these high \nquality protected lands. Land and water conservation is good for our \nhealth, good for our families, and good for our souls.\n  But we also know it is good for our economy. In 2012, Americans spent \nover $640 billion on outdoor recreation, and in Washington alone \noutdoor pursuits supported 227,000 direct jobs.\n  Our Nation has been blessed with an abundance of natural resources. \nThat is why it makes perfect sense that when we develop some of those \nenergy resources to fuel our economy, we set aside a portion of the \nroyalties generated from that development to protect those other \nnatural resources. But these conservation dollars are more than just \noutlays, they are also good investments. Studies have estimated that \neach dollar invested in land conservation returns between $4 and $10 in \neconomic benefits to the economy, and we will see this return on \ninvestment for generation after generation.\n  Even with all the good that we see as a result of the LWCF, there is \nso much more that we could be doing. That is because in spite of all \nthe benefits that we receive from LWCF spending, Congress has diverted \nthe bulk of these conservation dollars to unrelated programs. We ought \nto fix that. Next year, the funding authority for the LWCF will expire. \nWe need to permanently reauthorize this program, and create an \nindependent, dedicated stream of funding for it. Doing so will benefit \nall Americans, both now and for generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 7 minutes, followed by Senator Cornyn for up to 10 \nminutes, and Senator Blumenthal for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             ISIL Strategy\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the \nPresident's strategies on combating the threat of ISIL, or ISIS. I \napplaud the President's recognition that ISIL is a barbaric terrorist \ngroup that beheaded Americans. It murders, kidnaps, and tortures \ncivilian populations. It sells women into slavery. It has the stated \npurpose of attacking America and its allies. It poses a threat, and the \nPresident is right that it calls for appropriate action by the \ninternational community.\n  I support and congratulate the President on the selective military \nstrikes that have been done at the request of the Iraqi Government \nagainst ISIL's advances, which have held them back, and being able to \nregain territory that was held by ISIL, protecting civilian \npopulations. I strongly support the President's commitment that there \nwill be no combat ground troops interjected into this combat, and I \nthink the President has done a good job in engaging the international \ncommunity to work with us so that this is truly an international \neffort.\n  Let me comment for a moment, if I might, about military action and \nthat it needs to be restricted. I oppose authorizing military use of \nforce that is open-ended, that could result in the use of ground troops \nor where we could be asked to carry through or have our military do \nwhat the countries where these terrorist groups are located should be \ndoing with their own military. In Iraq, it should be the Iraqi security \nforces that take on the ground responsibilities.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, when we went into Iraq--and it was done \nwithout my support. I voted against the authorization to go into Iraq. \nWe were told that was going to be a short campaign, that the might of \nthe military of the United States would make that a very quick \noperation. As we see years later, it took a long time and we are still \nin Iraq. It must be done with the help of the international community, \nparticularly the countries that are in the region.\n  I think we have a strong responsibility as Members of the Senate and \nMembers of Congress to revisit the 2001 authorization that was passed \nby Congress shortly after the attack on our country on September 11, \nand the 2002 authorization that was used for Americans going into Iraq. \nI don't think either one of those resolutions is relevant for \nadditional military action today in either Syria or Iraq.\n  Let me read into the Record the appropriate language that was \nincluded in the 2001 authorization:\n\n       The President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations or \n     persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided \n     the terrorist attack that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or \n     harbored such organizations or persons . . .\n\n  It is a real stretch to say that authority applies to actions against \nISIL today. Therefore, I think it is incumbent. I think we have a \nconstitutional responsibility to act, and I think we must act and make \nit very clear that there will be no ground combat troops authorized in \nany action taken by Congress.\n  In regard to Iraq, the Iraq resolution was passed at a time when the \ninformation supplied to Congress was not accurate. It is certainly not \nrelevant to the fact that now there is an independent Iraqi Government. \nThat authorization also needs to be revisited.\n  Let me remind you, if this administration can use the authority of \n2001 and 2002 for using aircraft and military operations by air, what \nis to say that the next administration--because we know this is going \nto take a long time--couldn't use that authorization for introducing \nground troops in these countries?\n  So I think it is important that we revisit these authorizations, \neliminate the previous authorizations, and make it relevant to the \ncurrent need. It has to be limited to strategic air missions requested \nby the Iraqi Government, targeted at protecting civilian populations.\n  In regard to Syria, I have serious doubt about authorizing military \noperations. I think we need to have clarification from the \nadministration as to the clear objectives they are seeking to \naccomplish in Syria. We have to be very careful about the authorization \nof the use of our military in a country where we are not invited.\n  Now let me talk 1 minute about timing. The President has article II \npowers. I don't deny that. So if something were to happen, he has the \nright to defend our country and use our military to defend our country. \nHe can do that for a period of 60 days. Sixty days from now we will \nsoon be returning for a lameduck session of Congress, so I don't think \nthere is any immediate rush for us to try to get an authorization bill \ndone. But I think we should be working on an authorization bill so we \ncan take it up when Congress reconvenes, and if something happens in \nthe interim, we are certainly available and we can come back in and be \nready to act.\n  America is always stronger when Congress and the administration work \ntogether on these issues, and I would\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\nhope we could come together with the appropriate authorization, making \nclear we will not allow authorization for combat ground troops and that \nwe are very restricted on the use of our air power.\n  Let me lastly comment about the continuing resolution we will be \nvoting on tomorrow, as I understand it, that gives title 10 power for \nthe arming and equipping of the Syrian opposition. Clearly in that \nauthorization there is no authorization for use of U.S. military force. \nIt is consistent with the action taken by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on which I serve and the resolution I supported that talked \nabout arming and training the vetted Syrian opposition. We did that \nover a year ago. It was for a different mission; it was for dealing \nwith Assad. This in a way is comparable to dealing with ISIL but also \ndeals with the capacities against Assad. It is limited, to expire on \nDecember 11, and I think it is consistent with our mission to deal with \nour policies in Syria.\n  As I said earlier, I voted against the Iraq authorization in 2002. I \nsee that we have to be very careful that we do not allow authorization \nto exist that could be used for a long and costly involvement of the \nUnited States.\n  It is also clear to me that we cannot win the campaign against ISIL \nby military action alone. We have to have diplomatic support. We have \nto deal with cutting off the financial aid. We have to deal with \ncutting off the political support in Iraq. In Iraq we have a \nrepresentative government. The seeds have been planted. That is what we \nneed to do. That cuts off the support ISIL will need for long-term \nsurvival. The international community needs to stay resolved and the \nUnited States needs to stay in leadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                            Senate Procedure\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has been more than a decade since I \nfirst came to this Chamber of the United States Senate. It has become \nunrecognizable--what has traditionally been a forum for thoughtful \ndebate, amendments, and discussion based frequently on different \nperspectives that we come to based on our experience or the parts of \nthe country we represent. Unfortunately this Chamber has devolved into \none where not much gets done, and when there are votes, they are \nfrequently show votes with the election clearly in mind.\n  Look no farther than our September agenda. Amid high unemployment, \nstagnant wages, widespread frustration over the consequences of \nObamaCare, and genuine humanitarian and security crises abroad and here \nat home, our colleagues who control the agenda in the Chamber decided \nthe most urgent order of business was to amend the Bill of Rights to \nthe U.S. Constitution and gut the First Amendment.\n  As I said at the time, when I went home during the August recess to \ntalk to my constituents, not one of them said: I want you to go back to \nCongress and I want you to gut the First Amendment guarantee to freedom \nof speech. This clearly is not at the top of the American people's \nagenda.\n  Despite all the challenges facing our country, the majority leader, \nwho controls the agenda on the Senate floor, continues to prioritize \nelection year votes--show votes--over serious legislation.\n  Back in March, when our Democratic friends decided to promote their \nso-called ``fair shot'' agenda, the New York Times noted that the \nexercise was completely political in nature. The New York Times--hardly \nhostile to our Democratic friends and their policy agenda--put it:\n\n       Democrats can see that making new laws is really not the \n     point. Rather they are trying to force Republicans to vote \n     against them.\n\n  Meanwhile, the majority leader has prevented millions and millions of \nAmericans from having a real voice in this Chamber. Since he became the \nmajority leader, he has blocked legislation more than twice as often as \nthe majority leaders Bill Frist, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, Bob Dole, \nGeorge Mitchell, and I should add Robert Byrd, combined. But he hasn't \njust blocked Republican amendments, not just those in the minority; he \nhas blocked amendments from the majority party--his own party.\n  Since July of last year we have had rollcall votes on only 14 \nRepublican amendments and only 8 Democratic amendments. I have to tell \nyou that if my party was in the majority and we ended up getting less \nvotes than the party in the minority, I would be pretty hot about it, \nand I would have some explaining to do to my constituents. Indeed, the \nmajority leader has allowed so few amendments that one of his fellow \nSenate Democrats, the junior Senator from Connecticut, recently told \nPolitico: I got more substance on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives in the minority than I have as a Member of the Senate \nmajority.\n  Our colleagues in the House have sent over scores and scores of bills \nrelating to job creation, taxes, health care, immigration, and other \nissues only to have Senator Reid declare them dead on arrival. No \nwonder Congress has a 14-percent approval rating. When people see the \ndysfunction here--primarily in the Senate, since the House is passing \nlegislation and then it dies here because the majority leader refuses \nto take it up--it is understandable why they are frustrated, just as we \nare frustrated.\n  I know it is not just those of us in the minority. Many Democratic \ncolleagues privately expressed their own frustrations about the Senate \nbecoming so dysfunctional. If the majority leader was serious about \nsolving the problems that confront our country, they would not need to \nlook far beyond positive progrowth ideas to address our Nation's most \npressing challenges. They would see that Senate Republicans have joined \nour House colleagues in offering a bevy of thoughtful proposals.\n  First and foremost we have long stressed the need to pass a progrowth \nfiscally responsible budget. The Senate--under Democratic control--has \nnot passed a budget since 2009. That is malpractice. We should leave \nthe next generation with more economic opportunity, not more debt. \nSomebody is going to have to pay that money back. Maybe the young folks \nwho are sitting in the front row--the young pages and their children \nwill have to pay the money back. Americans and small businesses across \nthe country budget responsibly every month and so should their \ngovernment.\n  In addition, we pushed sensible progrowth energy policies that enjoy \nbipartisan support, such as approving the Keystone XL Pipeline and \nboosting the U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas. We need energy \npolicies that enhance our energy security, reduce prices, encourage \ninvestment, and create jobs at home. We also need a regulatory system \nthat fosters economic growth and prosperity, not one that furthers \nWashington's overreach. Republicans believe we must continue aggressive \noversight of the Obama administration's out-of-control regulatory \nagenda, which is hitting hard-working Americans and their wages while \nempowering Federal bureaucrats.\n  Senate Republicans also believe the President's health care law was \nabsolutely the wrong way to expand affordable, accessible, quality \nhealth care to more Americans. We believe families and patients should \nbe free to purchase whatever kind of insurance they prefer without \nhaving to worry about the government meddling.\n  We believe future reform should guarantee that health care decisions \nwill be made by patients and their doctors, not by Washington. We \nbelieve those reforms should make quality health insurance and quality \ncare more accessible for more people. Here is the greatest irony of \nObamaCare--instead of making health care more affordable, it made it \nmore expensive, thus limiting access to care.\n  On tax reform, we believe our overriding goal should be to lower tax \nrates for all taxpayers, broaden the base, and simplify the entire \nsystem in order to restore America's global competitiveness. We also \nfavor ending ``too big to fail,'' thereby, ending the implicit \ngovernment backstop and subsidy currently enjoyed by America's largest \nbanks. There are a number of ways to achieve that goal, but we all \nagree Dodd-Frank did not solve that problem.\n  Immigration continues to be among the most pressing issues we face, \nespecially given this year's record surge of unaccompanied children \ncoming from Central America and pouring across our southwest border. We \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\nthat one of America's top priorities is to make sure our laws are being \nenforced and our border is secure. We share that priority and we will \nkeep advocating the necessary reforms, along with other reforms, to fix \nour broken immigration system.\n  We believe there are a lot of good ideas, and they are not the \npurview of either political party. In fact, we have been sent by our \nconstituents to work in a bipartisan way to try and solve some of \nAmerica's most pressing challenges, and we view our intellectual \ndiversity as a sign of strength, but we remain united on the core \nprinciples and ideas that define our party.\n  We have had an experiment in big government over the last 6 years \nand, you know what, it hasn't worked very well. Unemployment rates \nremain high, the labor participation rate is at a 30-year low, and \npeople have simply given up. The economy should be bounding back rather \nthan knocking along the bottom. We remain committed to tackling our \nNation's biggest challenges of promoting greater prosperity for all \nAmericans, and we do that by growing the economy and creating jobs and \nletting people work hard, as they always have in America, and pursuing \ntheir dreams.\n  Proposals such as the ones I mentioned, many of which enjoy \nbipartisan support--they certainly have in the House of \nRepresentatives--will never see the light of day here as long as the \nmajority leader continues to operate this Chamber like an incumbent \nprotection program.\n  The American people sent us to take tough votes and solve problems. \nIndeed, I don't know anyone who would want to be a Senator if we are \nnot allowed to vote and solve problems. The American people certainly \ndeserve a Senate that operates that way.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Domestic Violence\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, recently the Nation has been shocked \nand horrified by a video showing Ray Rice, a professional football \nplayer, knocking out his then fiancee who is now his wife, Janay Rice, \nand dragging her like a sack of potatoes out of an elevator as it \nalmost closed on her. The Nation was shocked by the callous \nindifference and disregard for the issue of domestic violence not only \nby Ray Rice but by the NFL itself, which has fumbled and failed in its \nreaction from the very beginning.\n  Indeed, I wrote to the NFL asking for stronger measures after it \nsuspended Ray Rice for a mere two games. Since then it has received the \nnow infamous and notorious video, and he has been suspended \nindefinitely.\n  Ray Rice is only 1 of 85 players since the year 2000 who has been \ncharged or cited for domestic violence, and many more were arrested for \nsexual assault, drunk driving, and other crimes.\n  This poster shows how the league could field an entire lineup of \nplayers who have been arrested for domestic violence and who remain \nactive in the NFL. There are others who are not shown here. Ray Rice is \non the field, though he may be suspended indefinitely.\n  These incidents, and literally thousands of others, are the ugly, \nbrutal, bloody face of domestic violence in this Nation. Not only is it \nbigger and broader and more painful and serious than Ray and Janay \nRice, it affects our entire society. Its victims are throughout the \ncountry, and what they need most desperately are more services to \nbolster their courage and strength to come forward and break the cycle.\n  I know domestic violence is an issue in Connecticut because I worked \nto fight child abuse and neglect and related kinds of domestic violence \nwhen I served as attorney general. Not only have I worked in courts but \nalso in schools to speak to young men and women.\n  I have worked with shelters such as Interval House, the largest \nshelter in Connecticut, which helped to form an organization called Men \nMake a Difference, Men Against Domestic Violence, which is composed of \nmen as role models. Coaches, former athletes, successful \nbusinesspeople, law enforcement types, and broadcasters provide role \nmodels and take a stand and speak out against this scourge.\n  I know the brutal and terrible toll taken by domestic violence in \nConnecticut and in this country. The economic consequences run into the \nbillions and the searing pain, savage emotional harm, and physical \nwounds are incalculable. The tentacles of domestic violence reach into \nevery aspect of American life--homes, workplaces, hospitals, and \nathletic fields.\n  In Connecticut, the demand for victim support services has steadily \nincreased over the years, and in Connecticut and around the country the \nneed for services has spiked as a result of the Ray Rice video because \nmore women and men have gained the courage and strength to come forward \nas a result of the national conversation that video has spurred.\n  As I have continued my work in Congress as a Member of the Senate, I \nhave been deeply troubled, in fact, outraged on occasion, that we \nauthorized barely a pittance of what is necessary to deal with that \nproblem and support those services that are so vital to providing \ncounseling, support, and advocacy.\n  Just in the past couple of days, I have learned that 30 percent of \ncalls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline go unanswered. Congress \nbears a majority of the responsibility for this lack of resources.\n  There are heroes in this fight against domestic violence. Some of the \nadvocates, service providers, and people such as Karen Jarmoc, CEO of \nthe Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and Kim Gandy, \npresident and CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and \nmost important, the survivors and victims who have come forward and are \ntelling their stories and speaking truth to the power and brutality \nthey faced and confronted and conquered.\n  In fact, one of the challenges on this issue has always been the \nsecrecy that surrounds it. The video of Ray Rice assaulting and \nknocking out his wife is the exception that proves the rule. It is the \nexception because most instances of domestic violence occur behind \nclosed doors in secrecy and often at night and they go unrecorded \nbecause in most instances of domestic violence, women are disbelieved, \nembarrassed, shamed, and stigmatized when they come forward.\n  The Ray Rice video is the exception that proves the rule. It is the \nexception of this brutality being shown, but it is the rule that the \nresponse is almost always slow and inadequate. Even after Ray Rice was \nindicted for third-degree assault, Janay virtually apologized for her \nrole in a stage-managed press conference orchestrated by the team--the \nRavens--for whom Ray Rice played.\n  Only after the second video was circulated did the league even \napproach real action. The prosecutor in this instance said he would not \ntreat Ray Rice more leniently or harshly simply because of his \ncelebrity, which is understandable.\n  The routine in most courts in America is failure to treat domestic \nviolence as seriously and severely as the crime it is and provide the \npunishment it deserves. The Ray Rice case was routine and it was done \nroutinely, but that doesn't make it right. So the courts bear a measure \nof responsibility, along with the Congress.\n  The NFL is not alone here, but the NFL has a special position of \ntrust. It is one of the most massively influential organizations in \nAmerica. It employs players who have a massive impact on the attitudes \nand feelings of young men and women--in fact, Americans of all ages.\n\n  The NFL has a position of public trust because of its prominence and \npower, but it also has a position of public trust because of the \nspecial benefits it is accorded under the law. And it is like the NBA, \nthe MLB, and the NHL, which all receive tremendous assistance in \nputting their brands and their messages before the American people. So \nit is our responsibility to call on these leagues to ensure that their \nmessages which they can spread so widely because of the benefits they \nare accorded under our law--to ensure and require them to keep faith \nwith their public trust and public obligation.\n\n  The public assistance these leagues receive take a number of very \nexceptional forms: tax benefits, public subsidies, and local \nassistance. But chief among them is the antitrust exemption enjoyed by \nthe four major sports leagues. Although large corporations and similar \norganizations that have the potential to dominate a particular \nmarketplace are generally prevented\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nfrom coordinating their activities under our antitrust laws, Congress \npermits this kind of coordination by professional sports teams, \nparticularly in the area of pooling their broadcast rights and \ntelevision contracts--the very means that enable them to spread their \nmessage and create that public image.\n  Teams in smaller media markets are able to remain competitive with \ntheir larger counterparts because of those benefits and the fact that \nthe governing national leagues can evenly distribute resources--again, \nthrough coordination, agreements, combinations that would violate the \nlaw for any other corporation.\n  This exemption was the product of significant debate and analysis in \nCongress and around the country when it was granted. It was first \nestablished in 1961, and the Judiciary Committee noted even then that \nit was not intended to be absolute and that it was not to be used for \nunfair competition and that there was a public trust and obligation.\n  In 1976 the House of Representatives convened what it called a \n``Select Committee on Professional Sports'' which prepared detailed \nreports on ``the large number of off-the-field problems that affected \nall four of the professional sports,'' including ``both violence that \ninvolves participants in the sports as well as violence involving \nspectators of the sports.'' We know the problems in these leagues \ninclude not only domestic violence but also the failure to address \ninjuries such as concussions, drug abuse, and other problems that have \nbeen reported.\n  If anything, in the more than 50 years since the exemption was first \ngranted, the prominence of the four professional sporting leagues in \nthe American media landscape has only increased. The leagues have a \ntremendous effect, again, reaching into every aspect of American life, \non programming, pricing, advertising, and more.\n  A lot has changed over the past 50 years, not least of which is our \nunderstanding of the harms of domestic violence and the importance of \nworkplace policies that protect women, minorities, and other members of \nsociety. Yet the NFL's response to the Ray Rice incident came right out \nof the 1960s--right out of an episode of ``Mad Men.''\n  Our laws and our practices and our culture must change. Most leagues, \nmost athletes, most managers, and most teams play by the rules on and \noff the field. But, unfortunately, these deep-seated problems are not \nnew. This special status can no longer be a blank check. It can no \nlonger be granted permanently. It must be reviewable and the teams and \nthe league held accountable. The era of the blank check for sports \nteams must end. The special benefits must be dependent on the leagues' \nfulfilling their positions of trust and special responsibility.\n  I will be proposing legislation to sunset the leagues' special \nantitrust treatment, ending the blanket antitrust exemption and making \nit renewable every 5 years. The exemption should depend on the leagues' \nacting consistently with their public trust and complying with ethical \nand legal standards that both protect and oversee players and that keep \nthe teams accountable to their fans. Their fans deserve better.\n  To ensure that Congress has accurate information, my legislation will \nestablish a commission, like many that have existed in the past, to \nmonitor the leagues' record of corporate citizenship. The commission \nwould include representatives with special knowledge of issues that \nwere proven to be a problem for the leagues, such as the heads of the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and the Surgeon General, and the commission \nwould be responsible for submitting a report to Congress in advance of \nthe vote to reauthorize and renew the antitrust exemption.\n  Other groups would have an opportunity to be heard and to submit \ntheir views, and there would be hearings, meetings, and other exchanges \nthat would give all an opportunity to be heard on this vital topic. I \nhope the Congress will have hearings as soon as possible on this issue.\n  I believe the professional sports leagues, and in particular the NFL, \nhave an obligation to adopt policies that train players on domestic \nviolence--more than lip service, more than check-the-box orientation \nsettings--and, most important, to punish acts of abuse and promote \nawareness of this terrible crime. They have an obligation to act in \naccordance with due process and establish rules that treat more \nstringently and strictly this crime of domestic violence, in accordance \nwith standards that give the players the right and opportunity to be \nheard.\n  But maybe more importantly than all else, these leagues should be \naccountable to help the survivors and victims, to provide funds out of \nthe tens of billions in their profits to support these services that \nare more necessary than ever. They should support the survivors--most \nof them women--who come forward and have the incredible courage, \nbravery, and strength to break with a situation of domestic violence. \nIt is at that point of maximum danger and turmoil in their lives that \nthey most need to reach someone and have someone reach them to provide \nthe counseling and advocacy they need and deserve at that moment of \nturmoil and pain.\n  Congress, the courts, all of us, have a responsibility to do more and \nto do better and to demand of professional sports leagues that they do \nmore and do better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5676-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5676-S5684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, at some point today or tomorrow the Senate \nwill hastily consider, and likely pass, a massive, hodgepodge spending \nbill to fund every last Department and program within our Federal \nGovernment--even those programs and those Departments we know don't \nwork, even those programs and those Departments where we know there is \na lot of abuse and misuse of sacred Federal funds. The alternative, if \nwe can call it even an alternative at all--and the only alternative--is \nto deny funding for every last Department and every last program within \nthe Federal Government--even those programs and those Departments we \nknow are absolutely essential.\n  All or nothing--those are our only options, the only options we are \ngiven. We have no other choice made available to us. This is government \non autopilot or, alternatively, government without an engine.\n  The problem is that by funding the Federal Government with a massive \npatchwork spending bill, we force the American people to choose between \ntwo equally bad, two equally unacceptable options: Pay for everything \nin government or pay for nothing at all; either fund the entire Federal \nGovernment tomorrow at exactly the same level we are funding it today \nor fund nothing within the Federal Government, not even to pay our \nsoldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines, our judges, or not even \nto provide care for our veterans or support for the most vulnerable \namong us.\n  This kind of all-or-nothing proposition is dysfunctional, it is \nantidemocratic, and it prevents Congress from doing its job, which, I \nremind my colleagues, is to represent the American people and to be \nfaithful stewards of their money--of the taxpayers' money--with which \nthey have entrusted their Congress.\n  During the month of August, I held a long series of townhall meetings \nacross my State, the great State of Utah. Whether I was in Cache County \nin the northern end of the State or in Washington County in the \nopposite direction or somewhere in between, the people of Utah, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, were clear about what they wanted. \nThey were clear about the fact that they were demanding action. They \nwanted action in Washington. Their concerns weren't always the same. \nSome worried most about the public lands. Others were anxious about the \neconomy. Many, of course, were troubled by the growing crisis along our \nsouthern border.\n  They were all looking for answers. They were all looking for \nsolutions from someone. Everywhere I went they asked me: What are you \ngoing to do? What are you going to do to get our economy back on track? \nWhat are you going to do to deal with many of the problems within our \nFederal Government that seem to go unaddressed for\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nfar too long? I would tell them: As a matter of law and by operation of \nour Constitution, Members of Congress have certain tools to address all \nof these concerns, but none of these powers is greater than the power \nof the purse. This is the power to allocate money, to fund the \ngovernment, to fund its operations. It is what enables Congress, and \nonly Congress, to reform dysfunctional government.\n  Encompassed within the power to give money is the power, necessarily, \nto withhold money. In this case the power of the purse is the most \npotent and the most effective instrument Congress can use to hold the \nexecutive branch accountable.\n  So when the administration fails to follow the law, as our current \nadministration has done so freely and so frequently, Congress can \ndemand answers and accountability by using the power of the purse as \nleverage.\n  As several of these townhall conversations continued, in the course \nof those townhall conversations, I began to notice that at this point \nin my answer, many people began to look hopeful--hoping that perhaps \nsomething could actually get done in Washington; hoping that perhaps \nsome of the problems within our Federal Government could be corrected, \ncould be reined in, could be turned around and set on a better course--\nbut then I would have to break the bad news, and here is the bad news.\n  I would have to tell them all those things their representatives \nshould be able to do and have an obligation to do--such as fixing \nbroken government programs and ensuring the solvency of Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and impeding lawless actions by the \nexecutive branch--but simply cannot get done because the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate insists that our Federal Government operate on \nautopilot.\n  This is the problem with the continuing resolution. When Congress has \nonly one opportunity to exercise its power of the purse by voting for \nor against an all-or-nothing spending package and an all-inclusive, \nall-or-nothing spending bill, Congress has essentially no opportunity \nto exercise its power of the purse--at least not in a meaningful way, \nat least not in a way that enables Congress to demand accountability \nfrom Government.\n  In the continuing resolution we will consider tomorrow, there are \nseveral provisions that deserve their own consideration and debate, \nsuch as reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, extending the Internet \nTax Freedom Act, and authorizing military action in Syria. None of \nthese measures--and certainly not something that could put American \nlives at risk--should be hurried through on an all-or-nothing vote.\n  This is why the continuing resolution matters for everyone in this \ncountry. It is the principal reason our government is so dysfunctional \nand so unaccountable. A government on autopilot leaves Congress \neffectively paralyzed--powerless to implement meaningful government \nreforms and powerless to hold the President and the President's \nadministration accountable for their actions.\n  This is not how government is supposed to operate. This is not how \nthis government is ever supposed to be allowed to operate. It doesn't \nhave to be this way. There is a better way. Indeed, as you can see on \nthis chart, until just a few years ago, the better way was the only \nway. The House has done this and it is still doing it today.\n  Let me explain what this demonstrates right here. Freestanding \nappropriations bills that were passed by the Congress for fiscal year \n2006--we had 11 separate individualized freestanding appropriations \nbills. To put that in context, that is more freestanding independent \nappropriations bills than Congress has enacted in all of the fiscal \nyears ever since then--just in one year. That, of course, used to be \nthe norm. It no longer is. In fact, lately, we are not doing any of \nthese things.\n  It is important to point out that the House of Representatives still \nroutinely passes freestanding appropriations measures. For fiscal year \n2015, the upcoming fiscal year, the House of Representatives has passed \nseven such bills. The Senate has passed zero. Not only has the Senate \npassed none of its own free-standing appropriations bills, it has \nrefused even to vote on any of the seven appropriations bills passed by \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The fact is that before the Democratic leadership took control of the \nSenate, Congress would spend most of its time during the spring and \nsummer of each year discussing, debating, amending, and eventually \nfiguring out how much taxpayer money to spend and on what. Congress \nwould consider separate spending bills, one by one, individually. Each \nof these bills would allocate a certain amount of money to fund the \nDepartments, the agencies, and the programs within a certain area of \ngovernment, organized by government functions such as defense, \ntransportation, homeland security or health care.\n  Each spending bill originated in one of the corresponding \nsubcommittees in the House and in the Senate. This is what we call the \nappropriations process. It makes sense that it would take up most of \nour time because as Members of Congress we have a solemn obligation to \nrepresent the people and to be faithful stewards of taxpayer money--of \nthe money that many Americans spend many months of their lives each \nyear just to earn so that they can send it to Washington, DC.\n  The American taxpayer deserves better. The American taxpayer should \nbe able to expect more out of Congress. Instead, they have come to \nexpect so much less.\n  That is how Congress used to operate, according to its own rules, \naccording to historic precedent, and--more to the point--according to \nbasic principles of common sense. Alas, times have changed. What \nCongress used to deliberate on for months, we now rush through in a \nsingle afternoon without opportunity for amendment, without opportunity \nfor a full debate.\n  What used to be the subject of open and robust debate is now \ntrivialized and treated as a mere formality, as a mere technical \nrequirement to be dispensed with and discarded as quickly as it \narrives.\n\n  The American people deserve better. Indeed, as I discovered while \nvisiting with the people from one corner of Utah to the other, the \nAmerican people demand that we do better. I think we can do better. In \nfact, I know we can. We have in the past. We will in the future, but we \nhave to get the regular order appropriations process back on track.\n  We need to dispense, once and for all, with this mindset that says we \nare going to fund the government with one bill. You are going to have \none opportunity to vote on any and all matters relating to the funding \nof the Federal Government. It is a binary choice. We fund everything at \ncurrent levels or we fund nothing. We keep it running just the way it \nis with no opportunity for meaningful reform or we don't fund anything \nat all and we accept all of the heartache and all of the difficulty \nthat goes along with this. This is wrong. It violates our laws and \nviolates our procedures and it violates common sense.\n  We as a Congress have asked the American people over and over to \nexpect less. I am here to tell each of my colleagues that it is time \nfor the American people not to expect less. It is time for the American \npeople to expect more. They are expecting more. They are expecting \nfreedom. They are expecting for us to honor them by debating and \ndiscussing and voting on how we are going to spend their money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           The American Dream\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I was born during the baby boom in Butte, \nMT. It was a boom time for our economy. Millions of kids such as me \ngrew up expecting the boom years to go on forever. Things weren't \nalways easy, especially in a tough blue-collar town like Butte. But it \nwas still easier in those days to believe that the American dream was \nwithin your grasp. Put in your time and you can earn a good living. \nWork hard and you can play hard.\n  Unfortunately, I am less confident in the American dream for today's \nyoung people unless politicians can put their partisanship aside and \nput the interests of this country ahead of their own. I am hopeful that \nthis Congress can once again behave like statesmen from half a century \nago, when the boom times of the 1960s also produced restraint. I grew \nup in the morning shadow of the continental divide. Butte was\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nsurrounded by some of the best fly fishing in North America and huge \nareas of land known as primitive areas.\n  Some of those blue-ribbon streams were separated by the smallest of \ndivides from the most polluted waters in America. Some of those \nprimitive areas shared borders with the most valuable hard rock mines \nand timber cuts in the country. Those same resources continue to \nsupport thousands of jobs in Montana. But the boom times of the 1960s \nproved how wasteful and damaging unlimited production can be.\n  Today I applaud the lessons of restraint. This month is the 50th \nanniversary of the passage of the Wilderness Act. Senators on this same \nfloor in 1964 turned the primitive areas and administrative wilderness \nareas of Montana and 12 other States into permanent protected areas.\n  That same year they also passed the visionary Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Several of the original wilderness areas are in \nMontana, including one of the largest, the Bob Marshall Wilderness. In \nMontana we just call it the Bob. Imagine a Congress with the foresight \nto create a whole category of restraint. Anyone that says the American \ndream is gone for good has never visited the Bob.\n  Last month I had the opportunity to hike with a local group of \nMontanans up 2,000 feet to Headquarters Pass on the Rocky Mountain \nFront. On the trail, we met a herd of mountain goats. When we got to \nthe pass, we stood under the windy shoulder of Rocky Mountain peaks and \nlooked into the Bob.\n  Today I am the proud sponsor of an important made-in-Montana bill \nthat would keep this land the way it is and add to the legacy of 1964. \nThe Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act, first introduced three years \nago, would protect almost 300,000 acres of public land. Today I urge my \ncolleagues to move a public lands package forward this year in order to \nreward the collective efforts of so many Americans who work so hard on \nbills like the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act.\n\n  The American dream today has a new challenge because of the \nWilderness Act. A small portion of our public lands has been set aside \nand made available forever for all Americans to enjoy in Montana. We \ncall this our outdoor heritage. Despite news stories about the \nperennial and terrible idea of giving away this heritage, support for \npublic lands in Montana remains deep and wide. The reason goes to the \nheart of what it means to be American. The American dream isn't just \nabout having a job. It is about where we live and how we live.\n  In Montana, our public lands to support trout or elk or whatever \nadventure Montanans seek are part of that dream, whether they are a \nboilermaker, a teacher or an outfitter.\n  It doesn't hurt that tourism has become a huge part of our economy in \nMontana. Today outdoor recreation supports 64,000 jobs in our State and \nalmost $6 billion in revenue each and every year. Like many Montanans, \nI am frustrated with how long it takes to conduct a timber sale or \ncomplete an environmental analysis on potential projects.\n  We need to get our forests healthy and working again, creating good \njobs and making our forests more resilient to wildfires. Even simple \nprojects get tied up in redtape and our rural communities and the land \nitself suffer for it. But this frustration should not blind us to our \nincredible heritage of untrampled public land owned by you and me and \nevery American.\n  Rather than government shutdowns and public land selloffs, I urge \nthis Congress to find the same wisdom to look ahead 50 years from \ntoday. We need to support local collaboration and fully fund the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund. Bills such as the Rocky Mountain Front \nHeritage Act, the North Fork Watershed Protection Act, the East Rosebud \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the Forest Jobs and Recreation Act \ndeserve every Senator's support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. CORKER. It is my understanding the leader is on his way down. I \nhave a unanimous consent request that I would like to offer. I know \nthat he wants to say a word. I will preliminary make some comments. \nWhen he gets here, out of respect for his time, I will ask that \nunanimous consent request.\n  Let me move on by saying that the President gave a speech a week ago. \nWe have a hearing today in the Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary \nKerry and others will assess our strategy in Iraq and Syria related to \nISIL.\n  I just want to say these obviously are very important decisions. One \nof the pieces of this strategy is that instead of the President coming \nand asking for an authorization for the use of military force--which, \nin my opinion, is the sound judgment, to come and ask us for that \nsupport so the American people are behind this effort, by virtue of the \nHouse and Senate taking that up. They are not going to do that. Instead \nthey are asking for the authority to do a very, very small piece of \nthat, which is to train and equip some members of the moderate, vetted \nSyrian opposition and to do so in the country of Saudi Arabia.\n  So they are asking for an authorization to do that overtly. It is \nsomething about which many people have questions. It is something that \nfor many years, for some time, I have supported and actually been \ndisappointed that the administration has left hanging the people of \nSyria whom we encourage now to take on Assad.\n  So that is a very important vote, a vote that all of us should take \nas a freestanding vote. But instead what is getting ready to happen is \ncoming over from the House is a continuing resolution bill that funds \nthe government. So instead of voting on the continuing resolution, \nwhich is a totally separate matter, and voting on arming the vetted \nmoderate opposition the way the President has requested, as a separate \nvote so, No. 1, we have the opportunity individually to weigh in on \nthose two measures separately, as the House is doing right now--\ninstead, what is going to happen, as I understand from the majority \nleader, is we are going to take up that vote in a combined way. I think \nthat is a poor way to run the Senate. It is a poor way for the people \nof the United States to understand where we are on important issues.\n  Just to give an example, I do not support the funding levels in the \nCR. I voted against the Murray-Ryan budget. I couldn't believe that in \nsuch a short amount of time we were willing to do away with the budget \ncaps we thought so important to the fiscal well-being of this Nation. \nSo I do not support the funding levels for the continuing resolution \nand had planned to vote against it.\n  Now there is a piece in it that is an important foreign policy piece \nthat I think needs further debate, where we are authorizing the arming \nand training of the moderate opposition through December 11 as a part \nof this bill. That, to me, is an inappropriate way for us to do \nbusiness. I think every Member of this body ought to have the \nopportunity to vote on each of those.\n  So the request I am going to make when the leader gets here is not to \nchange any of the wordage--I realize time is of the essence. We have \ntwo bodies that sometimes do not act in concert in appropriate ways. \nBut my unanimous consent request is to ask that properly these be \nseparated, the language be identically the same.\n  So what I have done is I have at the desk a bill that lays out the \nauthorization for arming and training the vetted moderate opposition in \nSaudi Arabia and other places. I have that exact language that is \ncoming over from the House so that the Presiding Officer, myself, and \nothers can weigh in on that issue. Once that issue is dealt with--\nagain, it would take 15 or 20 or 30 minutes for that to occur--we could \nthen move over to the continuing resolution, which, again, has a \ndifferent set of supporters, generally speaking.\n  So I do wish this body would debate the issues of great importance to \nour Nation. I know that in this hearing with Secretary Kerry, on both \nsides of the aisle there are numerous questions about how this strategy \nis going to work in Syria and how, with no ground force on the ground \nand us planning to train people in a very short amount of time, a very \nsmall amount of people--we are not going to give them very \nsophisticated equipment--how that ground game, that ground effort is \ngoing to be effective. I wish this body would take that up and debate \nit. To me, it is an important issue. It is an\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nissue that I have supported for some time. At the same time, the \nefficacy of it has changed.\n  One of the things that is fascinating to me--General Dempsey \nyesterday: All of a sudden, we are going to train them.\n  By the way, they have been organized because they want Assad out. \nThey have been fighting against Assad in Syria. But we are going to \ntrain them to fight ISIS or ISIL, which has not been the rallying \nentity for the Free Syrian Army to organize.\n  So, look, I plan to support publicly, as I am right now, this first \nphase of arming and training them because I have been pushing for it \nfor so long. I worry about its efficacy. It seems as if the goals of it \nnow are very different. But I am OK authorizing that until December 11 \nand we can hear more about it. But I do not support the funding levels \nin the CR. This is not an appropriate way for us to do business.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent--I hope the majority leader is \ngoing to be here in a minute. I would like to get back to the hearing \non Syria that we are having in foreign relations. I understand he may \nwell be on the way.\n  With that--as a matter of fact, I may pause for a minute. Let me just \nmake a point I made earlier with Secretary Kerry at the hearing. I do \nnot want to debate whether the President has the legal authority to \nconduct a war, a multiyear war, a war that many people say may take up \nto a decade in another country against another enemy. I do not want to \ndebate whether he legally can do that. I know he is tying himself to \nthe 2001 authorization, which I assure you no one was contemplating. \nBut I do not want to debate that. I know there are all kinds of article \nII people--all kinds of people who believe the President can do almost \nanything he wishes relative to military engagement.\n\n  I just want to talk about how lacking in judgment it is for three \npeople--the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State--\nto attempt to do this over a multiyear period, in a different country, \nwith a different enemy, and not come to us. That lacks in judgment. \nThat lacks in judgment because bad things are going to happen. Mistakes \nare going to be made. Five hundred thirty-five Monday-morning \nquarterbacks make no sense. Holding the country together is what is \nimportant. So selling that plan, selling the details, having us have \nthe opportunity to tease out and understand how this is going to work \nis an important part of the process that they are skipping.\n  I see the majority leader is here. I know he is busy. I thank him for \ncoming to the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the two \nleaders prior to the consideration of H.J. Res. 124, the CR, that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of my bill--the exact same language \nas coming over from the House--which is at the desk--that is the same \nlanguage as included in the CR regarding Syria; that there be up to 4 \nhours of debate followed by a vote on passage of my bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my friend \nfrom Tennessee is a fine Senator. He has the interests of the State of \nTennessee every step of the way and, of course, our country. So my \nstatement here has nothing to do with the kind of man he is and the \nkind of Senator he is.\n  I have just left my office, where I watched the second of three votes \nin the House. The House has voted on the continuing resolution. It \npassed by an overwhelming margin over there. The purpose of that is to \nstop another government shutdown. The continuing resolution includes \nlanguage on training and equipping the Syrian opposition. That bill \nwill come over here in a matter of an hour or two. The House has chosen \nhow it wishes to address these two matters; that is, the CR and arming \nand training the Syrian rebels.\n  As my colleagues know, in order to make a law, you need the Senate to \npass something and the House to pass something or vice versa. Then, of \ncourse, it is signed by the President. They have to be identical. If we \nwish to prevent a government shutdown, we have to pass this continuing \nresolution the House will send us. I have had conversations with the \nSpeaker, and he has been very strong in stating what they are going to \ndo over there.\n  Senate committees are in the process--one of the committees the \nSenator from Tennessee is the ranking member of--in the process of \nholding hearings on whether an authorization to use force is necessary \nand if so, how it should be crafted. So I look forward to Foreign \nRelations deciding what legislative action to take on this matter. But \nin the meantime, we should pass the House-passed continuing resolution \nwhich includes the language on training and equipping the Syrian \nopposition and present the people here an up-or-down vote on what we \nget from the House of Representatives.\n  We cannot have another government shutdown. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to thank the leader for coming down \nand thank him for agreeing to a time when we both can be here.\n  I do want to say that we could deal with it exactly in the way that I \nlaid out and keep the government from shutting down because we would be \npassing exactly the same language.\n  But I understand. I talked privately with the majority leader about \nthis. I understand people do not want to do that over in this body. \nThey do not want to separate the two. I know that the majority leader--\nthat is his right, to object to dealing with these issues in the same \nlanguage that I laid out. I do appreciate him coming down. I disagree \nvery strongly with this approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe under the regular order that I \nwill be recognized for up to 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              ISIL Threat\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with all the things that are going on \nright now, I am particularly interested in the hearing we had yesterday \non ISIS. It was a big deal. I applaud General Dempsey for his honesty \nin talking about how serious this war is that we are embarking on right \nnow. The fact is that we have a mess, and ISIS has tripled in the last \n3 months, up to now well over 30,000 troops, with tanks, heavy \nartillery.\n  This is not--I know the President has tried to make people believe \nthis is just another rag-tag terrorist operation like Al Qaeda or the \nTaliban. It is not. This is war. This is a real serious thing that we \nare in the middle of.\n  I do applaud General Dempsey and also Secretary Hagel for their \nhonesty in the committee hearing. It was difficult for them when the \nPresident talks about no troops on the ground, no troops on the ground. \nWe know we already have troops on the ground.\n  I think the American people have had a wake-up call. I believe they \nunderstand how serious it is. In fact, there were two polls out last \nweek. One of them was a poll that 70 percent of the American people \nknow how serious this is and that ISIS could affect and would affect \nand is affecting our homeland. That was a big thing, that 70 percent of \nthe people in America understand that. Just yesterday the Wall Street \nJournal poll came out, along with ABC, and they said the same thing: 70 \npercent of the people know this is something that affects our homeland.\n  When they talk about troops on the ground--I remember asking the \nquestion during the hearing yesterday. I said to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey: If the President said no troops \non the ground, what if your airstrikes--if something happens to one of \nthose planes and we have the problem that one of the pilots is bailing \nout. Are you saying that we do not have troops on the ground to ensure \nhis or her safety?\n  He said: Absolutely we will.\n  So the point is that has been a question that people have to \nunderstand, that this is war. We have to win it. We can't take another \nchance.\n\n\n                     The Economy And Overregulation\n\n  But that is not why I am here. I think because of the distraction of \nISIS and all of these other things, a lot of people have forgotten the \nserious problems that are hampering our economy; that is, what this \nPresident has done through the overregulation that takes\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nplace. Since he first took office and failed to achieve his signature \ncap-and-trade legislation, he has been working tirelessly to try to do \nwhat he couldn't do through legislation with regulation. The \nregulations received most of the attention because they are the most \nexpensive.\n  I first started in 2003, and I remember so much in the Senate. In \n2003, at that time Republicans had a majority. I was the chair of the \ncommittee that had the jurisdiction. They started off in 2003 with the \nfirst cap-and-trade legislation, and we defeated it. We defeated it \never since that time. One reason we defeated it was I was able to find \nout--and I didn't know this in the beginning--that people said: Global \nwarming is real, there are all these bad things, and we are all going \nto die.\n  Yet from the costs we determined--and this came not just from me but \nfrom others who were interested, but universities such as MIT came out \nwith a study, the Wharton School of Economics came out with one, and \nCharles River Associates. They all had the cost of this cap-and-trade \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  Every time I hear a large figure, I look at the population in my \nState of Oklahoma and see what that cost means to a family. In my State \nof Oklahoma, $300 billion to $400 billion a year would be a permanent \ntax increase for the average family in Oklahoma--that files a Federal \nincome tax--of $3,000 a year.\n  When we get to these numbers, we look and we realize this is going to \nbe very expensive and no one wants anything to do with greenhouse \nregulations when the cost is so high.\n  I will show later on that it wouldn't accomplish anything, anyway. \nThat is probably why the recent polls, such as the Gallup poll on \nglobal warming, have it on the bottom of the national priority list. \nTheir last poll is a poll of 15 things to be most concerned about, and \nglobal warming and climate change registered No. 14 out of 15.\n  The people have understood--it is as if they understand now what is \ngoing on with ISIS. They know what the truth is.\n  The Pew Research Center showed that 53 percent of Americans either \ndon't believe that global warming and climate change are occurring or \nthey say if it is, it is natural causes.\n  This has been going on. This is what has bothered me. I can \nremember--and I am going from memory now--but I used to use the \nexample, back when we first started looking at this subject, as to how \nthis is a cyclone that has been going on for recorded history.\n  In 1895, we were in a cooling period, basically. They were referring \nto it as the little ice age at that time--I could be wrong. But, \nanyway, that endured until 1918. Then in 1918, it turned into a warming \ntime and that went all the way up through 1945.\n  This is what is significant. In 1945, we started another cooling \nperiod. It happened that 1945 was the year that was recorded as the \nyear when it had the highest amount of CO2 emissions, and \nthat precipitated not a warming period but a cooling period. Of course, \nthat went on up to about 1975 when we went to the other side, where we \nhave actually entered into a cooling area. Everybody knows that.\n  God is still up there. We have always had these seasons. People would \nlike to think somehow it is man who is doing it. They don't want any \nprogress. They don't want people to be able to generate electricity and \nenergy to take care of our needs.\n  While my friends on the other side of the aisle act as though public \ndebate has been settled on the issue, obviously it is just the opposite \nof that. It probably explains why it has been difficult for Tom Steyer \nto raise the full $100 million he promised to help Democrats win \nelections this fall.\n  We remember in February that he announced he would put up $50 million \nof his own money--and then he did--and that he would raise another $50 \nmillion. It would be $100 million that he would put in campaigns for \nincumbents who would agree to try to resurrect the global warming \nissue--because it has died in the eyes of the American people--and try \nto stop the pipeline.\n  He did this, and the trouble is he is not able to raise the other $50 \nmillion. The last count was it is only $1.7 million he has been able to \nraise from outside donors. Nonetheless, of course, he has his own $50 \nmillion. Regardless, we know he is spending the money he has, even \nthough he hasn't raised other money.\n  We can see on this chart a quote where he said--that is a picture of \nTom Steyer. He is not a bad guy and all of that, he is just far left, \nand he has a lot of money. He said:\n\n       It is true that we expect to be heavily involved in the \n     midterm elections. . . . we are looking at a bunch of . . . \n     races. . . . My guess is that we'll end up being involved in \n     eight or more races.\n\n  So Tom Steyer's goal is, as I said, to try to resurrect the global \nwarming issue and try to stop the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I think it is an appropriate time to talk about the hypocrisy on the \nleft over political spending. We spent all of last week debating a \nconstitutional amendment to limit political speech that is currently \nprotected under the First Amendment. Democrats are talking about the \nKoch brothers, and people are not aware that this type of activity was \nfrom a man named Tom Steyer, by his own admission.\n  Someone asked me the other day--I think we were on the floor. I was \nthe only Republican to come down. It was kind of fun. They were having \ntheir all-night session. I made the statement: If there is anyone with \ninsomnia at home who is not asleep yet, this is a good way to do it. I \nmade the comment that this is something we know is going on.\n  I stated that with all these races that are out there, they are \ntrying to do something in order to elect people to try to go back to \nwhat they failed to be able to get. I think it is an appropriate time \nto get through that hypocrisy.\n  Recent news reports have surfaced and described the Democracy \nAlliance. That is an organization that aims to organize the policy \nobjectives and funding streams of the leftwing liberal establishment.\n  According to an internal memo that was leaked to the press a few \nweeks ago, the Democracy Alliance for the past 9 years ``has aligned \ndonors, leaders in the progressive movement, [that is liberal] and \npolitical infrastructure in order to achieve victories at the ballot \nbox and in policy fights including those for comprehensive health care \nreform, Supreme Court confirmations . . . ''\n  This influence is estimated to be between $600 million and $700 \nmillion.\n  The Washington Post recently had this chart. It is kind of hard to \nread, but in the Post it was obvious because each one of those dots is \na liberal political organization. They all joined together and that is \ncalled the Democracy Alliance.\n  Again, this was 161 plus 21--182 organizations are part of this \nalliance. It details all of their agendas and how they are being \ncoordinated by the political Democratic agenda by the Democracy \nAlliance. We will recognize most of the names on the list. It includes \nthe Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, America \nVotes, and even Organizing for Action which, incidentally, is President \nObama's political campaign arm.\n  In April, this group convened a secret meeting in Chicago to huddle \nwith its deep-pocketed donors to craft a strategy in messaging for this \ncoming year's elections. It was shrouded in secrecy, and the memo \nprepared for attendees--all the people on this list who were coming in \nto meet in Chicago--warned them of interacting with political \nreporters. In fact, it included a pages-long list of reporters who are \nexpected to try to crash the conference, along with the photos, so \nfolks could be on the watch for these people.\n  The names of the people attending and involved were not going to be \ndisclosed to the public, nor would any details be released about the \ndiscussions that were taking place.\n  Tom Steyer and the Democracy Alliance are acting like a cult, even as \nthe Democratic left pushes for the institution of a new constitutional \namendment. We now know that initiative was nothing more than a \npolitical sham.\n  At the end of the day, the liberal left wants an aggressive, \nsecretive, political machine operating on its behalf, and it looks as \nthough they have what they need in the Democracy Alliance.\n  The key selling point for the Democracy Alliance pitch to its \ncontributors is the inseparable link to the deep connections with the \nObama White House administration. The Democracy Alliance firmly \nbelieves it is in the driver's\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nseat when it comes to setting policy for liberals in Washington, and it \nwants its donors to know it.\n  There is nothing wrong with this. We have had differences of opinion \nand philosophy, and that is why we have political parties. This is more \nextreme than anything I have seen and more organized.\n  One of the key goals of the Democracy Alliance is to promote ``an \nenvironment that keeps our kids safe.'' This explains why the \nadministration continues to push an extremist agenda of environmental \nmandates that will crush our economy.\n  This is where Tom Steyer has really succeeded in being part of the \nDemocracy Alliance. He has managed to convince Democrats in the Senate \nto hold more than one all-night vigil on global warming, and these have \ncome as the United States has been enduring one of its coldest years \nyet.\n  Just this month so far, NOAA, of the Commerce Department, has \nreported 246 record cold temperatures. Wyoming already has right now 20 \ninches of snow in some places, and it is unseasonably cold in \nWashington, DC.\n  One of these colder areas, my city of Tulsa, OK, on Saturday set a \nrecord cool high temperature. It only reached 65 degrees. It has never \nhappened before, so it is not cooperating very well with trying to \nconvince people the world is coming to an end because of global \nwarming.\n  It also explains why the President is continuing to aggressively try \nto implement greenhouse regulations after failing to accomplish this \ngoal legislatively. These regulations will effectively prevent any \ncoal-fired powerplant from being constructed and force our Nation into \nrelying substantially on expensive renewable resources.\n  Regulations such as these would take us in the direction of Europe, \nwhich in many instances has experienced electricity prices three times \nas high as they are in the United States. They have been ahead of us in \ntrying to stop fossil fuels and in trying to stop nuclear energy. The \nrates their people are paying are now three times higher than ours.\n  If anyone doubts these rules will have a negative impact on our \neconomy, just look at Australia. Australia imposed a carbon tax on \ntheir economy a few years ago and it caused horrendous damage. It \ncaused $9 billion in lost economic activity per year and destroyed tens \nof thousands of jobs. This is in Australia. This just happened. It was \nso bad that the government in Australia recently voted to repeal the \ncarbon tax. Remember all the talk about the fact: Oh, Australians are \nleading the way and they are going to have a carbon tax, we should be \nfollowing them. Now they have repealed that by an overwhelming vote and \ntheir economy is now better for it. In fact, it was announced last week \nthat Australia experienced record job growth last month of 121,000 \njobs. They said this is because they have repealed this carbon tax they \nhad passed. They credit this success to the repeal of the carbon tax in \naddition to these greenhouse regulations.\n  I think it is important for us to recall the many other regulations \nthis Obama administration has already imposed on the American people \nand discuss all of the new regulations that have not yet come out, but \nthey are working on it. Some of these regulations they are holding off \nuntil after the elections so the people would not know the cost of the \nregulations and how many jobs are going to be lost.\n  The first we need to remember is Utility MACT. By the way, MACT means \nmaximum achievable controlled technology. In other words, what \ntechnology has told us we could do to try to control these releases.\n  Utility MACT was the first one they successfully passed. In this \ncase, the EPA established a standard that was impossible for utilities \nto actually meet.\n  This regulation is inappropriate under the Clean Air Act, and it is \nhaving a $100 billion annual impact on the economy and destroying 1.65 \nmillion jobs. They have already done it. They were able to pass it \nalong party lines.\n  The EPA has already finalized similar regulations for industrial \nboilers and cement kilns. Together, those regulations are having an \nimpact of more than $63 billion on the economy and they have destroyed \n800,000 jobs and may result in the shutdown of 18 cement plants around \nthe country. No one has refuted these figures.\n  In another section of the law, the EPA put a rule together, knowing \nit would increase the cost of gas. The rule is known as the Tier 3 \nrule, and it regulates the amount of sulfur that can be in gasoline \nwhen it leaves the refinery.\n  Tier 2 standards were put in place back in the early 2000s. That \nresulted in a 90-percent decline in the sulfur content of gasoline by \n2010. That is already behind us, and it had a positive, measurable \nimpact on the environment.\n  The need for a Tier 3 standard is not articulated very well. In fact, \nEPA did not have any unique scientific data to support the key benefits \nof this rule, and the EPA ignored the fact that it would actually \nincrease greenhouse gas emissions. So they are going to increase \ngreenhouse gas emissions with the rule they are still putting forth and \nbe counterproductive. Talking about the Tier 3 rule, EPA stated that \n``this rule will increase the cost of gasoline.''\n  Furthermore, the EPA recently finalized a rule called the 316(b) \nwater rule. This rule regulates the cooling water systems used by \npowerplants and other major industrial facilities to prevent their \noperations from overheating. So they use water. The EPA and the Fish \nand Wildlife Service were worried about the impact these facilities \nwere having on fish, and so they put out a rule to help. In the \nrulemaking, EPA again states that ``the final rule will increase \nelectricity costs.''\n  Worse is the fact that EPA could not even fudge its numbers enough to \npresent a positive cost-benefit ratio. In its final rule, the stated \ncosts are $300 million, which is about 10 times the estimated benefits \nof the rule, which are only $28.6 million. This violates the \nPresident's own Executive Order 13563, which states that agencies must \n``propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that \nits benefits justify its costs.''\n  That is another problem we have with this administration. They will \nadd rules, they will add laws, and they violate these laws--just like \nwhen he turned loose the five terrorists from Gitmo. We had passed, in \nfact, knowing he was going to try to get rid of people in Gitmo--and he \ntook the five who were the very worst--we had passed a law saying he \ncan't do that until he gives the Senate Armed Services Committee 30 \ndays' notice and gives us a chance to respond and stop him from doing \nit. He totally ignored it, just as he ignored these regulations.\n  Worse yet, this rule has no human health benefits. Its only \nbeneficiaries are fish. So EPA is putting out a rule that will increase \nelectricity costs, including for those who live on fixed incomes, all \nfor the sake of saving a few fish.\n  Another rule EPA has done since President Obama began his \nadministration is the regional haze rule. These regulations were \nestablished to improve the visibility of national parks, and States \nwere instructed to develop their own plans--known as State \nimplementation plans--in order to comply. My State of Oklahoma did \nthis, but EPA overturned it because of a technicality associated with \nits economic analysis. When EPA did this, it instituted a Federal \nimplementation plan, and in this case it cost over $1 billion to \nexecute or nearly 10 times the amount of the State-based plan that had \nbeen developed cooperatively with our utility companies. This is the \nkind of uncooperative relationship we have come to expect when working \nwith the EPA.\n  Beyond the greenhouse gas regulations, the one receiving the most \nattention is the waters of the United States rule. Nearly every group \nfrom Oklahoma is talking about this rule because it would extend the \npowers of the Federal Government over millions of new acres of land.\n  Just last week I was in Guymon, OK; El Reno, OK; and Boise City, OK. \nBoise City is the farthest west, largest city out in the panhandle. It \nis kind of sandwiched between Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, and Texas. \nThey are all in western Oklahoma. This is an arid part of the country. \nThey are in their third year of their drought right now, but the new \nrule would declare much of this area as a Federal waterway subject to \nthe onerous Federal regulations. This would impact every industry--\nfarming, ranching, oil and gas,\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nconstruction, transportation--everything.\n  Tom Buchanan happens to be the president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau. \nI asked him a question in a kind of townhall setting that we had not \ntoo long ago.\n  I said: What is the biggest problem we have in agriculture in \nOklahoma?\n  He said: The biggest problem has nothing to do with the farm bill. \nThe biggest problem we are facing right now is the overregulation by \nthe EPA and what they are doing with endangered species, what they are \ndoing with the containment of fuel on farms, what they are doing with \nthe water rules they have. That is the biggest problem.\n  I was with Terry Detrick, president of the American Farmers and \nRanchers, and he agrees that the biggest problem farmers in America are \nhaving right now is the overregulation of the EPA.\n  The EPA has said it will work with industries to make sure it works \nfor them, but we know from experience this won't be possible. It is not \ngoing to happen. Their goal is to take over, to control and leave no \nroom for negotiation.\n  Another devastating regulation being developed by the EPA is the \nozone NAAQS standard. NAAQS means national ambient air quality \nstandard. It was last set at the end of the Bush administration at 75 \nparts per billion. The EPA has been working since President Obama took \nover the White House to lower this standard.\n  In 2011 the President cancelled EPA's plans to lower the ozone \nstandard because it was going to hurt his reelection chances. But now \nthat he has secured that reelection, he is ready to start it up again.\n  The EPA staff and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee--\nCASAC--recently recommended that the Administrator propose to lower the \nNAAQS level to between 60 and 70 parts per billion.\n\n  This chart shows how much of the Nation would be out of attainment if \nEPA lowers the standard to 60 parts per billion. In Oklahoma, all 77 \ncounties would be out of attainment. What does that mean? I was mayor \nof the city of Tulsa once when it was out of attainment. We were not \nable to increase populations in many of our businesses.\n  It essentially means the EPA will have to issue a regulatory permit \nfor any business expansion plans that could increase emission levels. \nIt would make business expansion enormously expensive and would \ndramatically increase the power of the EPA. All told, this rule would \nput nearly 94 percent of the counties' populations of the United States \nof America out of attainment zones and would cede our economic \nsuperiority to the likes of China and India.\n  Zooming in to more industry-focused regulations, the EPA has been the \nmain culprit in the President's war on fossil fuels. Hydraulic \nfracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up dramatic new oil and \nnatural gas resources in this country that no one thought we would ever \nbe able to profitably extract.\n  By the way, hydraulic fracturing was actually developed in my State \nof Oklahoma, in Duncan, OK, in 1949. So this is something that is going \non. In spite of this, they are trying to use hydraulic fracturing to \nstop the successful increases we have been able to have in the wells.\n  Lisa Jackson was the first EPA Administrator under Barack Obama. I \nremember asking her the question: If we were to do something with \nhydraulic fracturing, has there ever been a documented case in the \nUnited States that hydraulic fracturing is damaging to groundwater?\n  She said: No, it is not. There has never been--her actual exact \nwords--any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected \nwater.\n  So if we eliminate this, it is not going to save anything because it \nis not going to create any problems. And this doesn't come from me; it \ncomes from the Administrator of the EPA, appointed by President Obama. \nRegardless, the EPA is moving full force to regulate hydraulic \nfracturing. At one point during the administration, there were a total \nof 13 different agencies working to do this. The Bureau of Land \nManagement is one of them. It is my understanding that their \nregulations are being finalized, and it could cost producers as much as \n$100,000 per well. Keep in mind that every time they talk about what it \nis going to cost industry or business, that is passed on to the public.\n  The EPA is also working to regulate methane emissions from across the \noil and natural gas industry. Whether it is the upstream producers \nduring the drilling and completion process, the midstream pipeline \noperators, or the downstream retail distributors, EPA is convinced that \nthe industry is willingly allowing their valuable product to seep into \nthe atmosphere without any concern or awareness of where it is.\n  EPA's methane strategy is part of the President's overall climate \nchange action plan, and the Agency recently published white papers \noutlining its understanding of methane leaks in the industry, and they \nwere not very impressive.\n  I recently wrote EPA and the White House to express my concern with \nthese papers. I was shocked that the papers seemed to lack any \ncomprehensive understanding of the industry's operational practices. I \nwas also disappointed that EPA didn't consider many of the regulatory \nhurdles in place which actually prevent producers from installing the \ntechnology and infrastructure that would reduce methane emissions. I am \nhopeful that EPA will take my recommendations seriously before moving \nforward.\n  So we have two problems. Right now we could be totally independent of \nany other country. All we have to do is do what every other country in \nthe world does; that is, exploit our own resources. This President has \nmade it impossible for us to get into public lands and to get this \ndone.\n  Then, of course, we have the problem of overregulation. In all, the \nadministration's regulatory agenda is intended to shut down the engine \nof America's economy. They have already shut down coal. Now they are \nworking on oil and natural gas.\n  What they have done so far is just a preview. But the liberal \nenvironmentalists--Tom Steyer, Bill McKibben, Democracy Alliance--must \nall be frustrated by what is going on right now. Temperatures are not \ngoing up, they are going down. Nobody seems to care. No one has any \ndesire to implement the policies they want. Polling is all showing they \nhave lost this battle. That is exactly why they are willing to spend \nbetween $600 million and $700 million on this year's elections--to \nconvince the American people to elect Members who will support the \nPresident's regulations, which will shut down the economy.\n  One more thing, going back to global warming. Earlier I said that \nback in 2002 when we discussed the costs of it, being between $300 \nbillion and $400 billion, as the largest tax increase in history, a \npermanent tax increase, I asked the question to Lisa Jackson--again, \nshe was the Administrator of the EPA, appointed by Barack Obama--I \nsaid: If we were to pass these cap-and-trade regulations or bills or do \nit by regulation, would this have the result of lowering CO2 \nemissions?\n  She said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is \nin China, it is in India, it is in Mexico, it is in other places.\n  In fact, one could use the argument that it would actually have the \neffect of increasing emissions because as we chase away our base, the \nmanufacturing base will go to countries like China and India, where \nthey don't have any restrictions on emissions at all.\n  I think it is important to remind the people that even though that \nera is almost gone and people realize that is something that was very \npopular at one time, now the polls show that people have caught on. But \nkeep in mind that what the President could not do through legislation \nhe is now doing through regulations, and regulations, as we pointed \nout, are the greatest problem our economy is facing today, and this is \nsomething we are going to have to change.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n\n\n               Reauthorization Of The Export-Import Bank\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and the legislation that we \nare soon going to be seeing on a continuing resolution that was just \nvoted on by the House of\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nRepresentatives. While I am happy that there is a CR--a continuing \nresolution--that keeps our government open, I am very distressed with \nthe fact that the House is sending us a simple 9-month extension of the \nExport-Import Bank to expire June 30 of next year.\n  The reason why that is so frustrating to me and many of my colleagues \nover here is because this is a jobs issue. It is about our economy, and \nwe have heard today at various venues throughout the Capitol how people \nare actually losing jobs right now because of the uncertainty of the \nExport-Import Bank. So I know that some of my colleagues in the House \nof Representatives--Republicans--are proud they have helped to \nreauthorize the bank for 9 months. Make no mistake about it; this will \ncost us jobs in the United States of America during that time period.\n  We had a press conference today. I was proud to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Kirk, Senator Graham, Senator Manchin, and various \nleaders in the energy industry--the Nuclear Energy Institute; \nCombustion Associates, Inc.; Itron, which is a company in the \nNorthwest; Westinghouse; and FirmGreen--to talk about how many energy \njobs are dependent upon the Export-Import Bank. You can see from this \nchart: 46,000 U.S. energy jobs and $7.7 billion in energy exports.\n  Just last year these transactions helped these energy jobs in the \nUnited States of America by putting investments in projects overseas. \nThat is why we want to see a long-term reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank. While this uncertainty exists in the continuing \nresolution, all you are going to do is to exclude U.S. companies from \nclosing deals. That is because a credit agency is critical to U.S. \ncompanies actually being at the table.\n  We heard from one firm today, FirmGreen, that they were actually \nexcluded from participating and getting a deal simply because of the \nuncertainty of the Ex-Im Bank: A credit agency guaranteeing financing \nthe deal was not at the table and we lost out to an Asian competitor. \nSo during these 9 months of uncertainty, that is exactly what is going \nto happen to more U.S. companies. They are going to lose out on these \nenergy jobs that we are looking for overseas.\n  I am talking about things that are part of our energy strategy--\neverything from Sub-Saharan Africa, wind turbines in Central America, \nand powerplants in Africa to various investments in the nuclear \nfacilities. A short-term 9-month extension doesn't provide a large \nenough window for companies to build a pipeline, to construct a wind \nturbine or to develop a nuclear facility. So it will hurt us by slowing \ndown on these energy projects just at a time when we are trying to fund \nthe training of troops to combat ISIS. We are going to be creating \nuncertainty in places such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iraq on water \nprojects, construction projects, and road projects that might not get \ndone because U.S. companies won't be able to get the financing of a \ncredit agency. So this is a national security issue, and we are already \nhearing from exporters about this.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a list of 30 \ndifferent newspapers with editorials supporting the reauthorization of \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Newspapers Endorsing Ex-Im Reauthorization\n\n       1.

It \ntypifies what companies are saying, that ``to really increase \nmanufacturing jobs, you need to increase exports.''\n  That is why we feel so strongly about this. The Roanoke Times also \nsaid:\n\n       It's a global economy. Policymakers need to put U.S. \n     manufacturers on an even playing field with foreign \n     competitors in emerging markets, not take them out of the \n     game.\n\n  That is exactly what happens when we give a short-term \nreauthorization for 9 months. No deal of this size and magnitude with \nenergy companies gets done in a 9-month period of time. It takes the \nbank basically 3 months just for the processing. The discussion of \nbeing at the table, closing the deal, and competing with your \ncompetitors takes much longer, and no one is going to be interested in \nclosing a deal when they don't know whether the bank is going to \ncontinue to exist.\n  That is why other newspapers such as the Times-Picayune has said that \none of their companies--basically a CEO of Reliable Industries of New \nOrleans--said: ``The Export-Import Bank is a major reason his firm has \nbuilt an export business with 600 customers in 60 countries.''\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the other \nside of the Capitol who don't understand business: The notion that you \ndon't get is that the export opportunities for our economy are the \nbiggest chances to grow GDP in America, and you are foreclosing on that \nfor the next 9 months because you are creating uncertainty and \nunpredictability.\n  Well, you know what I say to that? You are basically shipping jobs \noverseas. That is exactly what you are doing. You are participating in \nshipping jobs overseas because you don't want to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out \nthat the United States right now in manufacturing has a supply chain of \nsmall businesses all throughout the United States that help in the farm \neconomy in building farm equipment, help in the aerospace industry \nbuilding airplanes and airplane-related products, and in the energy \neconomy, as we focused on today at our press conference. All of these \nsuppliers, when they cannot get financing for their products, are going \nto look to overseas suppliers who can get support from the credit \nagencies in their country, whether that is China, whether that is in \nFrance or whether its in Germany or other countries. So people who \ndon't support giving predictability on the Export-Import Bank are \nsupporting shipping jobs overseas.\n  Our economy is struggling too much and our national security \ninterests are at stake to be shipping jobs overseas and not having the \ninvestments in these countries such as Iraq and Egypt and other places \nwhere we want to build security. I believe in the long-term interest of \nfighting our challenges with extremism around the globe with economic \npower. I know people are going to talk about military power and people \nare going to talk about soft power. I believe in economic power. Having \nan Export-Import Bank that is doing business like building roads and \nbuilding water and building energy facilities actually helps to \nstabilize these areas of the world.\n  I am glad to see that General Petraeus also agrees. General Petraeus \nbasically said that the Ex-Im Bank ``is integral to our country's \nsecurity interests.'' Integral--he has watched this on the ground and \nhe knows and understands what the Export-Import Bank is, and he is \nasking us to give it more certainty and predictability than what a 9-\nmonth extension does, because, as I said, business deals cannot get \ndone in that short a period of time. Here is a person who understands \nthese issues both from a military perspective and an economic \nperspective. I wish more of my colleagues would understand that they \nare basically just shipping jobs overseas.\n  Newspapers around the country are continuing to try to help echo this \nissue. The Charlotte Business Journal said: ``Executives say the Ex-Im \nBank is a key to a competitive U.S. nuclear industry.'' They have been \ntrying to focus on this issue.\n  The Boston Globe said: ``Billions will be lost unless Congress \nreauthorizes\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nthe Export-Import Bank.'' It also went on to call exactly what this \ngame is that is happening right here and now in Washington, DC. The \nBoston Globe in their editorial in support of a longer reauthorization \nsaid: ``Conservative hardliners rallying to shut down the agency are \nrisking a serious, self-inflicted economic wound.''\n  That is because we don't have to be at this point. If you want to \ntalk about reforms for the Ex-Im Bank, we have a lot of opportunity to \ndo that, but hardliners don't want to reauthorize the bank.\n  Having been in business, I am somebody who believes in trend lines. I \nwould ask my colleagues who are going home and thinking they are going \nto campaign about jobs to ask themselves what kind of message are they \nsending to the global community about the Export-Import Bank when just \na few years ago an agency that should have a 5-year reauthorization was \nonly reauthorized for 2 years--just 2 years. Now you are going to go \ninto the international community and say, wait a minute, we only \nbelieve in this bank for 9 months. So the trend line is it used to be 5 \nyears. For basically about 80 years it used to be 5 years, but because \nthe conservative tea party people are having their way--not the \nmajority of the people in the House but the tea party conservatives are \nhaving their way--this has gone from a 5-year reauthorization to a 2-\nyear reauthorization to now a 9-month reauthorization. Who knows what \nthey will propose next. We know they don't support the bank. We know \nthey want to get rid of it.\n  I think the Charlotte Business Journal, again, characterized this \nissue very well because they know this industry: ``The United States \nwill lose its lead in nuclear technology if it is not involved in the \nconstruction boom overseas.''\n  You are not going to be very involved in the construction boom over \nthe next 9 months because you are not going to be able to get people to \nclose long-term deals when they think the other side of the aisle just \nwants to kill the Export-Import Bank.\n  I think the Columbian in my State said it best. They said: ``While \ncomplaining about the Ex-Im Bank might make for sound bites that pander \nto conservatives, in the end it amounts to legislative negligence.''\n  They are talking in general about those who want to kill the Export-\nImport Bank, but the very day that the House proposed a 9-month \nextension, the Republican study group also proposed killing the Export-\nImport Bank. So make no mistake about it, there are those who are \npandering to very conservative views who basically just want to end the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Thank God we have other businesses in this country. The Louisville \nCourier-Journal said: ``When a small company is attempting to navigate \nthe international marketplace, it can be difficult to manage the risks \nrelated to financing and growth and securing payment.''\n  That is a local company in Louisville, KY, that knows what it takes \nto compete in an international marketplace. That industry leader also \nsaid that the Ex-Im Bank has helped them manage the risk and as a \nresult their export business has grown strong in recent years. That is \nwhat is at stake for these small businesses and supply chains to \ngetting this business done.\n  I think for us right now the challenge is to try to get people to \nunderstand that a 9-month extension is not going to solve this problem. \nIt is going to exacerbate the lack of confidence in our ability to get \nthis bank reauthorized for a long period of time.\n  The Wichita Eagle editorial also added a this great comment: \n``Failure of Congress to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank would be a \nphilosophical victory for some--but a badly timed blow to Kansas \ncompanies trying to compete in the global marketplace.'' They went on \nto say to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  So, while I know the House is sending us 9 months, and I know that \nsome people are trying to take comfort that they have dodged this issue \ninstead of taking a really hard vote on it or improving the bank, all \nthey have done is left the marketplace with a great deal of \nuncertainty.\n  It will cost us jobs; it will shift jobs overseas, and Congress--here \nin the Senate we need to act to get a long-term reauthorization for the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  The Wichita paper had it right. Reauthorize this bank--not a short-\nterm Band-Aid, but give the certainty that businesses need to compete \nin the global economy and help our economy at home by growing jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the last hour or so I had the good \nfortune to hear the junior Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, \ndescribe what is happening with the Ex-Im Bank, and it is not good for \nthe country.\n  The Ex-Im Bank is so very important to the Presiding Officer's State. \nThe State of Connecticut benefits tremendously from the Ex-Im Bank, as \ndo the small manufacturing businesses in the State of Nevada.\n  As Senator Cantwell said, it is a shame we are shipping more jobs \noverseas, and by not extending the Ex-Im Bank long term, that is what \nwe are doing. She is such an advocate for this program which is so \nimportant to our country. I underline and underscore everything she \nsaid this afternoon. I am so disappointed we are not able to have a \nlong-term extension of the Ex-Im Bank. It is very important, and it is \ntoo bad we are not going to do that.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.J. Res. 124\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.J.

Next year, the Nation will celebrate the 95th anniversary \nof the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women, at long \nlast, the right to vote. The result of more than four decades of \nadvocacy from such giants of the women's equality movement as Susan B. \nAnthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the amendment was merely a first \nstep in advancing women's rights.\n  Since the ratification of the 19th Amendment, there has been \nconsiderable progress in the march for gender equality. The President's \nCommission on the Status of Women, established by President Kennedy and \ndirected by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, in part led to formation of \nthe National Organization for Women. NOW's core issues include two on \nwhich this Congress has been rightly focused: ending violence against \nwomen, and promoting economic justice.\n  The country last week celebrated the 20th anniversary of the \nenactment of\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nthe Violence Against Women Act. This landmark law shined a light on the \nscourge of domestic violence and improved the criminal justice system's \nresponse to these cases. Last year, Congress again came together to \nreauthorize and strengthen VAWA to address the evolving needs of \ndomestic and sexual violence victims, and to ensure that those \nprotections are available to all victims, regardless of sexual \norientation, ethnicity, race or gender. The VAWA reauthorization law, \nwhich I was proud to author, was just one example of how we must \ncontinue to build on the historic work of past years in advancing equal \nrights and opportunities for American women.\n  And earlier this week, the Senate yet again tried to move forward \nwith legislation to address pay equality. Building on more than 50 \nyears of progress, starting with the Civil Rights Act, which barred \nemployment discrimination based on race and gender, and on the heels of \nthe 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act would \ntake a significant step toward ensuring a balanced and equal \nenvironment for women in the workplace. Unfortunately, for the fourth \ntime, partisan objections have prevented the Senate from advancing this \nlegislation to hold employers accountable and to protect employees from \nretaliation for discussing their salaries with colleagues. Vermont has \nadopted its own Equal Pay Act, making it illegal for employers to offer \nanything less than equal pay for equal work. Still, in Vermont, where \n22,000 households are headed by women, the yearly gender pay gap is \nnearly $6,000. More needs to be done, and we can do better.\n  This year, Vermont will mark two important anniversaries. Thirty \nyears ago, Vermont voters sent the first woman in our history to the \nState House to serve as Governor. Madeleine Kunin, a trailblazer in \nVermont, served for 6 years as Governor, before becoming a Deputy \nSecretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. As a child, she \nfled the threat of the Holocaust, leaving Switzerland with her family \nfor the hope and promise of America. She returned to the country that \nshe had been forced to flee when President Clinton appointed her to \nserve as the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland. She continues to lead and \ninspire as an author, educator, mentor to women in politics, and \ntireless advocate for women's rights.\n  Later this year, the Vermont Women's Fund will celebrate 20 years of \nsupporting women, both in the workplace and at home. The Fund helps \nwomen overcome economic hardships to live secure and successful lives. \nThe Fund guides young women to opportunities in nontraditional career \npaths and propels future leaders to reach their goals. As we well know, \nwhen women are given an equal opportunity, their achievements are \nelevated. When women are given equal opportunities, they thrive and \noften rise to the top. When women are given a fair shot, their \ncontributions at home, in the workplace and in our communities make us \nall better. The Vermont Women's Fund, with its diverse and \nrepresentative council, works to establish and preserve that progress \nfor Vermonters.\n  In the nearly 95 years since the Nation came together to belatedly \nextend the right to vote to women, we have made considerable strides in \nadvancing gender equality. More than two dozen women lead Fortune 500 \ncompanies, an achievement once viewed as unattainable to young women \nentering the workforce. Women have risen to some of the highest ranks \nin our government. Women now comprise a majority of students enrolled \nin college. In Vermont, we are proud of our history in advancing \nwomen's rights. Leaders like Madeleine Kunin, and programs like the \nVermont Women's Fund, are shining examples of why Vermont is a leader \nin this social progress for women and our entire society. And we are \nproud to be a national leader in the advancement of women. Congress, \nand the country, can learn and benefit from Vermont's trailblazing \nexample.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5685-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5685-S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE CHRISTIAN APPALACHIAN PROJECT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nChristian Appalachian Project, CAP, an organization that is celebrating \n50 years of dedicated service to the people of Appalachia.\n  CAP was started by the Reverend Ralph Beiting in Eastern Kentucky. \nReverend Beiting was a Catholic priest assigned to an area of Kentucky \nthat had no Catholic church, and the organization grew out of his \nability to help those in need without the organizational structure of \nan established church. In 1964, he started a summer camp for boys on \nHerrington Lake in Garrard County, thus launching the Christian \nAppalachian Project's now 50-year legacy.\n  Since that summer of 1964, CAP has grown into the Nation's 16th-\nlargest human services charity. Among the services CAP provides are \nhome repair and reconstruction, disaster relief, clothing drives, food \nrelief, and--a sure sign that some things never change--summer camps.\n  CAP employs 160 people and has around 50 long-term volunteers. This \nis in addition to the host of volunteers that are drawn to community \nservice projects like Grateful Bread, Grateful Threadz, and WorkFest.\n  CAP has touched the lives of thousands in Appalachia and is a model \nfor how organizations can serve their communities. I therefore I ask my \nSenate colleagues to join me in honoring the Christian Appalachian \nProject.\n  Kentucky Living published an article in their September 2014 issue \nprofiling the Christian Appalachian Project. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Kentucky Living, Sept. 2014]\n\n    Bringing Help and Hope: Hundreds of Volunteers Working With the \n  Christian Appalachian Project--Now Celebrating 50 Years of Service--\nBring Residents of Appalachia Dignity, Self-Worth, and Renovated Homes.\n\n                        (By Debra Gibson Isaacs)\n\n       It wasn't supposed to snow. After all, it was spring break \n     for the college students who had wound their way into rural \n     eastern Kentucky from across the nation. But the snow was \n     just one of many surprises this week, and like the others, it \n     was easily, joyfully accepted.\n       The students were in Kentucky for WorkFest, one of an array \n     of programs serving the most basic needs of the region's most \n     vulnerable residents--children and families, the elderly, and \n     individuals with disabilities--conducted by the Christian \n     Appalachian Project, or CAP as the nonprofit organization is \n     affectionately known. CAP provides home repair and \n     reconstruction, food, disaster relief, crisis intervention, \n     child development, summer camps, family advocacy, domestic \n     violence shelters, in-home respite, clothing, and programs \n     for the elderly.\n       With help from hundreds of volunteers, CAP has renovated \n     362 homes in Floyd, Jackson, Rockcastle, Clay, Owsley, \n     McCreary, Martin, Lawrence, and other counties during \n     WorkFest since the annual event began in 1992. On this day in \n     March, CAP volunteers were in Rockcastle County working on \n     four homes.\n       One was the home of Vincent, a member of Jackson Energy \n     Cooperative. Vincent had returned to Kentucky from 11 years \n     working for the military to find his home in need of far more \n     work than he could accomplish alone and with little money.\n       ``I am like the Beverly Hillbillies,'' 48-year-old Vincent \n     joked, his green eyes smiling above his mustache, a bandana \n     on his head and two earrings piercing his left ear. ``I \n     packed up everything I owned in my truck and came home. This \n     is home. I always come back home.''\n       But home had a bathroom floor that had rotted out. The \n     living room floor was also gone. The roof leaked. Windows had \n     to be replaced. Plumbing needed repair. The front porch was \n     close to falling down. The modest home was barely habitable. \n     Still, no one seemed to see the problems; they were focused \n     on the solutions.\n       Seeing the solution rather than the problem is standard \n     fare for CAP, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary all \n     year from now until August 2015. Started by the Rev. Ralph \n     Beiting, a Catholic priest assigned to a slice of eastern \n     Kentucky without a single Catholic church at the time, CAP \n     grew from Beiting's ingenuity in helping those around him. At \n     first Beiting would travel to northern Kentucky, where \n     friends and church families would donate all kinds of goods \n     and clothes, and he would distribute them to those in need. \n     His outsized personality soon led him into the hearts of the \n     people, and that led him to try to meet the many needs he \n     found.\n       The first official CAP project came in 1964--a summer camp \n     for boys on Herrington Lake in Garrard County. Beiting went \n     on to develop the concept for finding ways to help people \n     help themselves. He named his ministry the Christian \n     Appalachian Project and declared it would be ``a group that \n     would roll up our sleeves and get the job done.''\n       That same work ethic and dedication continues today, 50 \n     years later, as the Christian\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\n     Appalachian Project goes about improving the lives of those \n     in Appalachia.\n       ``Cut it like this,'' instructs Jay G. Dresser, a CAP \n     volunteer for 15 years, as he takes a power saw from one of \n     the students to demonstrate how to notch a 2x4. A few feet \n     away, students are in the bathroom ripping up rotted flooring \n     while another group works in the bedroom. It is dark and \n     nippy inside the modest home, but no one seems to notice as a \n     happy cacophony of saws, hammers, and laughter fills the \n     house.\n       ``That's better,'' Dresser encourages. ``Push this. Now \n     pull the plate all the way out. Now stand it up and let me \n     reset the blade.''\n       A few miles away, a similar scene unfolds at the home of \n     Betty, also a Jackson Energy Cooperative member, and the \n     daughter and her fiance, cousin, and four grandchildren who \n     live with her in a mobile home that has been added to over \n     the years. New windows are already in place and two \n     volunteers are at work on the roof.\n       ``The kids now have a warm bedroom,'' says Betty. A fire in \n     the kitchen earlier had done extensive damage to another part \n     of the house, but she did not have the ability to repair it. \n     ``I just did the best I could,'' she says. ``My sister-in-law \n     fell through the porch and the refrigerator almost landed on \n     her.''\n       ``My son passed with leukemia when he was 32,'' Betty says, \n     her long brown hair now streaked with gray. ``He always told \n     me if he won the lottery he would bulldoze down this house \n     and build me a new home. I wish he was here to see this. They \n     have done miracles.''\n       Everyday miracles are what CAP has come to be known for as \n     it has grown into the 16th-largest human services charity in \n     the country with 160 employees and as many as 50 long-term \n     volunteers.\n       CAP's Housing Program, which coordinates WorkFest and \n     YouthFest, a spring-break alternative program for high school \n     students, provides home repair and reconstruction services \n     year-round. Permanent crews, including an experienced, \n     industry-trained crew leader and several long-term \n     volunteers, perform all types of home repairs.\n       Families requesting help fill out an application, which is \n     reviewed by a caseworker who then schedules a home visit to \n     assess the applicant's needs. The families go through a \n     budgeting process and in monthly installments pay back one-\n     half of the material costs (up to a maximum of 5 percent of \n     their income). They also donate sweat equity. All the labor \n     is donated for the homes that CAP builds or repairs.\n       Across Appalachia, similar projects are under way. A CAP-\n     operated food pantry called Grateful Bread warded off hunger \n     for 800 families last year, and Grateful Threadz, a store \n     accepting donations of gently used clothing, helped thousands \n     of individuals and families. Prescription assistance helped \n     709, family advocacy served 4,980, elderly services 267, and \n     domestic violence shelters 2,640. It is the same with \n     numerous other programs. In all, the organization reached \n     more than 50,000 people last year. Each represents a need \n     met, a better life.\n       ``We exist to serve God,'' says CAP President Guy Adams. \n     ``That is a high calling. How we do that is helping people in \n     need in Appalachia.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5686-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. STEM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I want to talk about an incredible \nchampion of America's railroads. James A. Stem, Jr., has been a \ntireless advocate for the men and women who keep our Nation's railroads \noperating for nearly 50 years. He has done just about every job in the \nindustry and will soon be retiring as the national legislative director \nof the Transportation Division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, \nTransportation Workers, formerly the United Transportation Union, UTU.\n  James began his career in 1966 as a trainman for the Seaboard Air \nLine Railroad in his native Raleigh, NC. He joined the Brotherhood of \nRailroad Trainmen and worked in numerous capacities including as a \ntrainman, switchman, hostler helper, hostler, fireman, and locomotive \nengineer. He even holds seniority as a locomotive engineer on a CSX \nline.\n  In the 1970s, James became much more involved in rail labor in North \nCarolina for the United Transportation Union. He was a delegate to five \nUTU International conventions and was eventually elected as the North \nCarolina State legislative director in 1984. He would go on to become \nthe UTU alternate national legislative director in 1998, serving \nalongside a legend, James Brunkenhoefer--also known as ``Brokenrail.'' \nJames was elevated to national legislative director in 2009. In 2011, \nUnited Transportation Union and Sheet Metal Workers International \nAssociation merged to become the International Association of Sheet \nMetal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers. James continued his work \nwith an even larger membership, now more than 216,000 strong.\n  James has frequently testified before Congress, always advocating for \nthe betterment of working men and women in the railroad industry. He \nwas part of the original 1997 Positive Train Control Working Group \nsponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration.\n  James has been a great defender of Amtrak and commuter rail and a \nstrong proponent of high speed rail. When cuts threatened the \neffectiveness of passenger rail, James fought to block them on Capitol \nHill. When railroad workers needed improved health and safety benefits, \nJames was there. He has tirelessly advocated for the working men and \nwomen on the railroads, making sure they have good paying jobs, proper \nhealth care, and a solid retirement.\n  James' influence can be felt at almost every level of government, \nwithin the industry, and inside rail labor. Two of his former UTU \ncolleagues currently serve as Federal Railroad Administrator and \nChairman of the Surface Transportation Board. Both will tell you that \nwithout James's leadership and friendship, they would not be where they \nare today.\n  It is with great pride that I congratulate James A. Stem, Jr. for his \nlong career in the railroad industry and for the incalculable \ncontributions he made there. I wish James and his wife Bonnie well in \ntheir retirement and hope they are able to enjoy extended family time \nwith their children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5686-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5686-S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         H.R. 3043 AND S. 1507\n\n  Mr. MORAN. I wish to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Wyden, and with Senator Heitkamp, to clarify \nseveral questions that have arisen since H.R. 3043 and S. 1507 were \nintroduced.\n  I say to the chairman, the term general welfare is found in the \nPreamble to the Constitution, and the power and duty of governments to \npromote the general welfare is at the core of our service to the \npeople. Indian Tribes, through treaties, agreements, and statutes, \nreserved their original, inherent right to self-government, and Tribal \ngovernments are in the best position to determine the general welfare \ninterests of the Indian people. H.R. 3043 and S. 1507 are intended to \nrespect the right of Indian Tribes to provide for the general welfare \nof Tribal members.\n  I ask the chairman, is it your understanding that in interpreting the \nmeaning of the requirement under the bill that Indian Tribal government \nprograms be ``for the promotion of the general welfare,'' it is \nintended that the IRS will apply this requirement in a manner no less \nfavorable than the safe harbor approach provided for in Revenue \nProcedure 2014-35, and in no event will the IRS require an \nindividualized determination of financial need where a Tribal program \nmeets all other requirements of new section 139E as added by the bill?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. I want to express my full support \nfor the administrative guidance issued by the IRS in Rev. Proc. 2014-\n35. I would also point out to the Senator that the bill requires under \nits ``Statutory Construction'' provision of section 2(c), that any \nambiguities in new Code section 139E shall be resolved by the IRS in \nfavor of Indian Tribal governments and deference shall be given to \nIndian Tribal governments for programs administered and authorized by \nthe Tribe to benefit the general welfare of the Tribal community.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. As the chairman knows, there have been concerns \nexpressed in Indian Country that the IRS may take the occasion of \npassage of H.R. 3043 or S. 1507 to retrench, narrow or possibly \nwithdraw the administrative guidance provided in Rev. Proc. 2014-35 \nafter enactment of the bill. As the sponsor of this legislation, I \nwould like to say that would be contrary to the intent of Congress.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I fully share the Senator's concern and want to assure her \nas well as Tribal interests that the Congressional intent, as well as \nmine as chairman of the Finance Committee, is to expand rather than \nrestrict the safe harbor provisions in Rev. Proc. 2014-35. The purpose \nof this legislation is to further empower Tribal self-determination. \nTribes, and not the IRS, are in the best position to determine the \nneeds of their members and provide for the general welfare of their \nTribal citizens and communities.\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              TRIBAL GENERAL WELFARE EXCLUSION ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to strongly support the Senate's passage of an important tax \nbill, H.R. 3043, the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014. This \nbill will improve the application of the Federal income tax in Indian \nCountry and in doing so will reflect appropriate respect for the \nsovereignty of tribal governments.\n  By way of background, the Federal Tax Code treats most payments that \nindividuals receive, and the value of some services they receive, as \ntaxable income. There is an exclusion, though, for payments and \nservices received under programs conducted by State and local \ngovernments. It's called the general welfare exclusion, and it covers \nthings like housing assistance, emergency medical care, and education \nassistance. These are traditionally treated as nontaxable.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has had difficulty applying the general \nwelfare exclusion when it comes to benefits provided by tribal \ngovernments to tribal members. In order to determine which benefits \nwere excluded from taxation, the IRS began conducting aggressive \naudits, leaving the tax treatment of many tribe-provided benefits in \ndoubt. As Delores Pigsley, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of \nSiletz Indians Tribal Council, put it in a letter to me, ``for several \nyears, the IRS has sought to tax tribal government programs and \nservices.'' This, in turn, has undermined tribal sovereignty and \nhindered economic and social development.\n  I am pleased to report that there has been some significant progress. \nIn July, the IRS issued regulations clarifying the application of the \nexclusion, and the regulations were a good step in the right direction, \nclearing up some questions and reflecting an improved dialogue between \nthe IRS and tribes. However, a regulation is not a congressional \nstatute; we need to lock these improvements into statutory law, as well \nas expand on them such as by establishing a Tribal Advisory Committee \nto help the Treasury Department and the IRS understand about how best \nto address tax issues affecting Indian Country.\n  The bill we are considering today would accomplish these goals. It \ncodifies and expands IRS regulations, draws clear lines, and gives \ngreater respect to tribal institutions and programs.\n  I would like to acknowledge the principal sponsors of the Senate \nversion of the bill, Senators Moran and Heitkamp, for their leadership. \nI also would like to thank Senators Stabenow, Thune, and other members \nof the Finance Committee, who have urged the committee to move forward \non this issue.\n  Tribal governments have a long history of providing critical benefits \nto tribal members, and these programs are fundamental to the \nsovereignty and cultural integrity of tribes. Tribes, and not the IRS, \nare in the best position to determine the needs of their members and \nprovide for the general welfare of their tribal citizens and \ncommunities. I know this bill has the support of tribes in my home \nState of Oregon and will benefit tribes and tribal members across the \nNation. I urge all Senators to support the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5687-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5687-S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AMENDING THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, the pension community approached me with \ntheir concerns that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was \ninterpreting section 4062(e) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct of 1974 too broadly. That provision was intended to protect pension \nplan participants in the event of a cessation of operations at a \nfacility. However, the pension community was able to provide \nsubstantial evidence that the corporation's enforcement efforts were \nout of line with congressional intent to such an extent that section \n4062(e) had become a major impediment to businesses' efforts to \nrestructure. After a thorough review of the situation and consultation \nwith employers, employees, retirees, and the Obama administration, it \nbecame abundantly clear that enforcement efforts under section 4062(e) \nwere failing to protect either pensions or the corporation.\n  Consequently, I worked with the ranking member, Senator Alexander, on \na new approach that we introduced as S. 2511. That legislation, which \npassed out of committee on a unanimous vote, will restore the original \nintent of section 4062(e) by clarifying the types of cessations of \noperations that trigger downsizing liability. The legislation will give \nplan sponsors certainty with respect to their obligations, and it will \nalso ensures that participants are protected when workforce reductions \nsignal that the ongoing viability of a plan sponsor is in question.\n  Overall, S. 2511 represents a significant compromise between the \nneeds of employers, employees, and retirees, and I think it will give \neveryone a lot more clarity with regard to their obligations under \nsection 4062(e). However, there are a few points about the bill that I \nwould like to clarify.\n  First, there may be questions as to how the terms ``facility'' and \n``location'' should be interpreted. They are not explicitly defined in \nS. 2511 because we intend for them to be interpreted according to their \nnatural usage. For example, if an employer maintains several buildings \nthat are physically adjacent to each other, that would be a single \nfacility at a single location. However, if the employer maintains a \nbuilding in one part of a city and another building in another part of \nthe city, those buildings would be separate facilities at separate \nlocations.\n  Second, S. 2511 is intended to allow employers to make conditional \nelections. The legislation allows employers that have a substantial \ncessation under section 4062(e) to elect a new, alternative means of \nsatisfying their liability. The election must be made not later than 30 \ndays after the earlier of the date that the employer notifies the \ncorporation of a substantial cessation of operations or the date that \nthe corporation makes a final administrative determination both that a \nsubstantial cessation of operations has occurred and of the amount of \nthe alternative liability. Of course, there may be instances in which \nit is uncertain as to whether such a cessation has occurred or the \namount of the alternative liability, if any, even after a final \nadministrative determination has been made by the corporation. In those \ncases, the employer would certainly not be required to make a binding \nelection to pay amounts that may later be determined not to be due. \nThus, in all cases, an election by the employer would become \ninapplicable to the extent that a court subsequently rules or the \ncorporation later agrees that a cessation has not occurred or that the \nalternative liability amount is lower than the amount determined by the \ncorporation.\n  To the extent that an election becomes inapplicable, any \ncontributions previously made by the employer to satisfy such \ninapplicable liability amount should be treated as additional funding \ncontributions that are not subject to the provisions of the bill. \nConsequently, such additional funding contributions could be treated as \nincreasing the employer's prefunding balance. In addition, we fully \nintend for the corporation and the courts to have the power to stay, in \nwhole or in part, an employer's obligation to make alternative \nliability payments until the court has determined whether there has \nbeen a substantial cessation and/or the alternative liability amount.\n  In other cases, a substantial cessation may have occurred, but there \nis no liability of any kind due to the corporation's enforcement \npolicy. We expect that some employers may want to make an election of \nthe alternative liability amount in case the employer's financial \ncondition changes and the corporation asserts a liability under section \n4062(e). In such cases, the annual amount due under the alternative \nliability method would be zero until the corporation makes a final \nadministrative determination that the corporation's enforcement policy \nno longer applies to such employer. To ensure that a substantial \ncessation in one year cannot cause liabilities 10 or 20 years later, \nfor example, the 7-year payment period for the alternative liability \namount would include years in which the amount due is zero.\n  In order to ensure that any reporting requirement that may later be \ndetermined to apply is satisfied, an employer may notify the \ncorporation of\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\nan event that the employer does not believe constitutes a substantial \ncessation of operations. If the employer informs the corporation in \nwriting, the notification will not trigger the 30-day period for making \nan election, and the 30-day period will begin when the employer agrees \nthat the event constitutes a substantial cessation of operations or \nwhen the corporation makes a final administrative determination to that \neffect and similarly determines the amount of the alternative \nliability.\n  Third, S. 2511 is intended to prevent employers from being subject to \nretroactive liability and to other unreasonable payment deadlines. The \nlegislation generally requires the first contribution under the \nalternative liability method to be paid not later than the earlier of \n(1) the due date for the minimum required contribution for the year in \nwhich the substantial cessation occurred and (2) in the case of the \nfirst contribution, the date that is 1 year after the later of (a) the \ndate that the employer notifies the corporation of the substantial \ncessation or (b) the date that the corporation makes a final \nadministrative determination that a substantial cessation has occurred \nand of the amount of the alternative liability, with subsequent \ncontributions due on the same date in the following years. The intent \nis to ensure that in all cases the employer has at least 1 year's \nadvance notice of the need to make the first contribution.\n  Thus, clause (2) controls where otherwise an employer could have less \nthan a year's advance notice of the liability. That is especially \nimportant where there is uncertainty as to whether a substantial \ncessation has occurred or regarding the alternative liability amount \nbecause the corporation's final determination might not even be made \nuntil after the due date for contributions for the year of the \nsubstantial cessation. Similarly, the substantial cessation could occur \nin a year when the employer is not subject to section 4062(e) liability \npursuant to the corporation's enforcement policy, but in a later year, \nthe employer becomes subject to section 4062(e) liability with respect \nto that earlier cessation. To prevent retroactive liability and other \nproblems, clause (2) is controlling regarding the timing of the first \ncontribution in all cases where the employer would otherwise have less \nthan a year's advance notice of the liability. Where clause (2) is \ncontrolling, the seven annual payments would start with the first one \nrequired by clause (2).\n  In some cases, an employer may have notified the corporation of a \nsubstantial cessation and elected the alternative liability method in a \nspecific amount. We intend for the same timing rules to apply in \ndetermining the due date of the first payment of such amount. However, \nthe corporation may later challenge the amount of the alternative \nliability and seek a higher amount. In such cases, the higher amount \nwould become due pursuant to the timing rules so that there may be \nseparate 7-year periods, one for the originally elected amount and one \nfor the higher amount determined by the corporation.\n  Fourth, if an employer fails to pay the amount due for any year by \nthe due date, the employer will be liable for the balance of all \namounts due for subsequent years under the alternative liability \nmethod, though the corporation may waive or settle such accelerated \nliability in its discretion. Of course, any such acceleration should be \nstayed during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding \nto determine whether there has been a substantial cessation and/or the \namount of the alternative liability amount. In addition, if the \ncorporation or a court finds that the employer had a reasonable basis \nto contest any material portion of the corporation's determination, \nthen the acceleration provision shall not apply, but the employer would \nowe past due payments plus interest.\n  S. 2511 is a commonsense solution to the concerns of the pension \ncommunity, and I appreciate the work of Senator Alexander, the members \nof the HELP Committee and the Obama administration in getting this \nimportant legislation across the finish line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5688-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BURNS AND BARAN NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, yesterday I cast votes against the \nnominations of Stephen Burns and Jeffrey Baran to be Commissioners on \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I hope I am wrong in my conclusion. \nThe NRC is an incredibly important body at this time in the history of \ncivilian nuclear generation. While low natural gas prices puts economic \nstrain on our fleet of nuclear generators, the NRC has to carefully \nevaluate the costs and benefits that its regulations provide. In the \npast the NRC has had talented scientists and nuclear experts compose \nthe Commission. But for these two vacancies the President has nominated \nlawyers with legal and policy experience. Neither Stephen Burns nor \nJeffrey Baran has the technical experience, I believe, that will enable \nthem to effectively serve on the NRC.\n  Moreover, Stephen Burns--during his service with the NRC as General \nCounsel--authored several important legal memoranda that enabled then-\nNRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko to improperly undermine the licensing of \nYucca Mountain resulting in severe criticism by a Federal court. He \nalso provided a legal opinion that improperly advised Chairman Jaczko \nthat he, alone, could use emergency powers to conduct the business of \nthe Commission in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. This was not \na close question, in my opinion. Mr. Burns should not have issued such \nan opinion. While Mr. Burns is familiar with the Commission's \nprocedures, he has no technical nuclear power experience and I am not \nconvinced that he will resist interpreting the law with a political \nbent. For Mr. Baran--a House Committee staffer who has worked for many \nyears for an opponent of Yucca Mountain--there is not evidence that he \ncan impartially consider highly political Commission decisions.\n  This critically important Commission must be led by persons who are \nable to be competent and independent persons of strength. Reluctantly, \nI have concluded that I must oppose the nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5688-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5688-S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING DON EDWARDS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the \n100th birthday and extraordinary contributions of former Congressman \nDon Edwards.\n  Don was born on January 6, 1915, in San Jose, CA, where he attended \npublic schools and graduated from the San Jose High Academy. He then \nattended Stanford University, where he was a star on the golf team, \nwinning a State medal for match play along with several amateur titles. \nAfter graduating in 1936, Don earned his LL.B. at Stanford Law School.\n  In 1940, Don was hired as a special agent by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. When World War II broke out, he was activated from the \nNavy Reserve and served for 4 years as a naval intelligence officer and \ngunnery officer in the South Pacific, attaining the rank of lieutenant.\n  In the 1950s, Don founded the Valley Title Company and built it into \none of the Nation's leading title insurance companies. In 1962, he was \nelected to Congress.\n  During his 32 years in the House of Representatives, Don Edwards \nbecame known as ``the Congressman from the Constitution,'' the leading \ncongressional defender of civil liberties and chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights. I was lucky enough to \nserve with Don for 10 years and see firsthand his steadfast dedication \nto his home State of California and the civil rights and civil \nliberties of all Americans.\n  In the 1960s, he helped guide landmark civil rights and voting rights \nlegislation through Congress. In the 1970s, he led the efforts to pass \nthe Equal Rights Amendment. A master consensus-builder, he helped forge \nlarge bipartisan majorities to pass the Voting Rights Act extension of \n1982, Fair Housing Amendments of 1988, Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990, and Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  One of Don's proudest achievements was the creation of the Nation's \nfirst urban national wildlife refuge on the southern end of San \nFrancisco Bay. Established in 1974, it was renamed the ``Don Edwards \nSan Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge'' in 1995.\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\n  In 1981, Don married his longtime partner, Edith ``Edie'' Wilkie, \ndirector of Congress's Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus, and even \nafter they retired, she remained active in arms control and \ninternational peace for the rest of her life.\n  Today Don lives in beautiful Carmel among a tight circle of friends \nand family, including his sons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. \nThey will join him in January to celebrate his 100th birthday. As he \nreaches this milestone, I send him my best wishes, deep affection, and \nabiding gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LETITIA A. LONG\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to \nLetitia--Tish--A. Long, who will retire on October 3, 2014, as Director \nof the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA.\n  It gives me great pleasure to speak publicly about Director Long, who \nhas not only had an exemplary and distinguished career spanning 36 \nyears in the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense, but \nwho is someone I have gotten to know on a personal level.\n  As the Director of the NGA, Ms. Long was the first woman to head a \nmajor U.S. intelligence agency, and she will therefore always have a \nplace in history as one of the Nation's most important figures in \nmilitary and national intelligence. She is also a leading figure among \nwomen engineers.\n  I am grateful that in retirement, Tish will continue to advocate and \nfind ways to encourage young women to go into the fields of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  After studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate at Virginia \nTech, and then earning a master's degree in mechanical engineering at \nCatholic University, Tish began her government service as a civilian \nelectrical engineer at the Office of Naval Intelligence, where she was \noften the only woman in a room full of male engineers.\n  In 1994, she was promoted to the ranks of the Senior Executive \nService, where she eventually served in a dual role at the Naval \nIntelligence Staff as director for Requirements, Plans, Policy and \nPrograms; and director of Resource Management.\n  Looking back at her career, it should come as no surprise that Ms. \nLong reached great heights within the Intelligence Community. In 1995, \nshe participated in the planning for the creation of the National \nImagery and Mapping Agency, the predecessor agency of NGA, which she \nwould later lead as Director. From 1998 to 2000, Tish served on the \nstaff of the Director of Central Intelligence as the executive director \nfor Intelligence Community Affairs on the community management staff, \nthe predecessor organization to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  Director Long's previous positions included service as Director of \nthe Military Intelligence Staff at DIA and Deputy Director of Naval \nIntelligence. Tish was instrumental in the creation of the Office of \nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, where she served as \nthe first Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence for \nPolicy, Requirements and Resources. In 2006, she returned to the DIA as \nits Deputy Director.\n  Then, in August of 2010, Ms. Long became the fifth Director of the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. As its director, Tish expertly \nmanaged the multibillion-dollar NGA budget and a workforce of nearly \n10,000 government employees during a challenging period that included \ntwo wars, budget sequestration, and a government shutdown.\n  Under Director Long's skillful leadership, NGA provided extensive \nsupport to our Nation's highest priority security concerns, from \ncounterterrorism missions across the globe--including critical support \nto the raid that killed Usama bin Laden--to monitoring and providing \nadvanced warning on crises in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n  I have appreciated Director Long's candor with the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and her willingness to address the committee's \nconcerns. Ms. Long's leadership on intelligence integration, advanced \nanalytic tradecraft, and technology initiatives significantly improved \nintelligence production for the Defense Department, the Intelligence \nCommunity, and our allied partners. These efforts also provided greater \ninsight into national security issues for policymakers in both the \nexecutive branch and Congress.\n  Let me close by saying that those of us who are fortunate enough to \nknow Tish personally can attest to her dedication to the mission, \npersonal integrity, and unwavering loyalty to our Nation.\n  As she leaves government service, Tish will have more time to spend \nwith her husband John Skibinski, stepdaughters Jordan, Lindsay, and \nKatherine, and granddaughter Hanna.\n  It is with great pride and honor that I personally recognize Director \nTish Long as an innovator, leader, and friend.\n  We wish Tish all the best in the future. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5689-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OBSERVING POW/MIA DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National POW/MIA \nRecognition Day. As we acknowledge the important role of American \nservicemembers and veterans, we must keep at the forefront of our \nthoughts and prayers the safe return of those who have gone missing in \naction or are prisoners of war. National POW/MIA Recognition Day, which \nis observed the third Friday of September, provides a time to honor \nprisoners of war, POW, and those who became missing in action, MIA.\n  As the brave men and women who serve our Nation commit themselves to \nprotecting America and our freedoms, our Nation must be resolute in \nbringing them home should they go missing or be taken prisoner when \nserving our Nation in a time of war. Standing by our servicemembers \nincludes utilizing every reasonable means of bringing them home.\n  POW/MIA families and veterans have remained committed to keeping the \npursuit of facts at the forefront in the years since the Vietnam war. \nThis effort and the perseverance of the POW/MIA families have been \ninstrumental in accounting for missing military and civilian personnel \nfrom not only the Vietnam war but also World War II, the Korean war and \nthe Cold War. Finding resolution for the families must remain a central \nfocus as America has since engaged in subsequent wars to halt \nterrorism.\n  On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor those Americans who \nhave thankfully returned home, the families and loved ones who stood by \nawaiting their return, and we remain committed to finding answers for \nthe families who continue to await the return of their missing and \nunaccounted-for loved ones. Each day, as we see the reminder of those \nAmericans and their families through the POW/MIA flags that are posted \nat many places across our Nation, including the Halls of Congress, \nmilitary sites, war memorials, national cemeteries, and U.S. postal \nservice offices, let us not lose sight of this enduring commitment to \naccounting for those missing.\n  I look forward to the day when we can welcome all our servicemembers \nhome. Thank you to the many servicemembers and their families for all \nthey have done and continue to do for our country and to all those who \nwork to ensure their return home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5689-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE EBOLA CRISIS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee hearing yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Ebola in West Africa: A Global Challenge and Public Health Threat\n\n       We must take the dangerous, deadly threat of Ebola as \n     seriously as we take ISIS. Let me say that again: We must \n     take the dangerous, deadly threat of the Ebola epidemic as \n     seriously as we take ISIS. I think I have a reputation as a \n     senator who's not given to overstatement; I don't believe \n     that's an overstatement.\n       The spread of this disease deserves a more urgent response \n     from our country and other countries around the world than \n     it's now getting. This is one of the most explosive, deadly \n     epidemics in modern time but we know what to do to reduce the \n     spread. It will require a huge and immediate response.\n       There is no known cure; there's no vaccine. Half of those \n     who get sick die. Each sick person, according to the Centers \n     for Disease\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\n     Control and Prevention, could infect up to 20 others, \n     including caregivers, friends and family. Samantha Power, the \n     U.N. Ambassador, said to me earlier this week in a briefing \n     she's trying to get other countries to view this with the \n     same urgency that we do.\n       This is an instance, she said, when we should be running \n     toward the burning flames with our fireproof suits on. Ebola \n     is killing people in West Africa at alarming rates and \n     picking up speed. It's hard to say exactly what the number of \n     cases is. There is an official number, a little less than \n     5,000 of Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, \n     but the worry is that one-half of those cases were reported \n     in the last three weeks. You don't have to know very much \n     about mathematics to know that if--whatever the number--if it \n     doubles every three weeks that very soon we have an out-of-\n     control epidemic. And we can see easily what would happen if \n     a single infected traveler reaches another country and begins \n     to infect others in that country.\n       I said earlier, and we'll learn more today, about what we \n     know how to do. We'll hear from a doctor who has contracted \n     Ebola and who has recovered from it and who is here to talk \n     about it. It's not like the flu. It can only be spread by \n     bodily fluids, often contracted by caring for someone who's \n     sick or through burial practices.\n       But with global travel, we're only one airplane ride away \n     from a person exposed to Ebola getting on a plane to the \n     United States and then becoming sick once they arrive. And \n     then the mathematics of that infection could begin to develop \n     in this country.\n       There's human tragedy in Africa, but it affects the rest of \n     the world and it affects the United States. Our state is \n     known as the Volunteer State. And Dr. Brantly is an Ebola \n     patient. He was working for Samaritan's Purse. He's not a \n     Tennessean, but his parents are graduates of Lipscomb \n     University, which is in Nashville. He, like many Americans, \n     go on mission trips around the world to help people who need \n     help.\n       I will support the administration's request for the $30 \n     million Senator Harkin talked about, and the $58 million for \n     the biomedical advanced research and development. That's for \n     vaccines and cures and treatments. That should pass this \n     week.\n       There's a request to address $500 million of reprogramming \n     in the Defense Department. Some have asked, why should our \n     military be involved? Because they have to be involved if we \n     want to deal with the problem. There's no way for the doctors \n     and the nurses and the health care workers to deal with it.\n       So I'm pleased that on both sides of the aisle, we have \n     leaders who are beginning to recognize the severity of this \n     epidemic. Dr. Frieden and U.N. Ambassador Power are taking \n     the lead. We look forward to learning all we can about the \n     severity of the epidemic and what we must do to control it.\n       But I'll end where I started. We must take the deadly, \n     dangerous threat of the Ebola epidemic as seriously as we \n     take ISIS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RESIGNATION AS COMMISSIONER TO THE EISENHOWER MEMORIAL COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, next Tuesday, September 23, is \nan important day in my hometown of Maryville, TN. It is the 90th \nbirthday of Dean Stone.\n  It would be hard to imagine Blount County without Dean Stone. For \nmost of his 90 years, he has been our historian-in-chief, our \nstoryteller-in-chief, and our editor-in-chief. His photographs of the \nGreat Smoky Mountains and his eight books about our county's history \nline the libraries of most of Blount Countians. In fact, taken \naltogether they constitute a library of their own.\n  Dean is a longtime journalist and native of Maryville, TN, where he \nserved as editor of the Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times and still serves as \nopinion editor today. In each Sunday's edition, he writes his ``Bits of \nStone'' about the history and happenings around Blount County. Dean \nearned his degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma in 1949 \nafter serving in World War II, where he originated the idea of raising \nthe American flag over Yugoslavia. After college, he decided to return \nto Maryville and began his career with the Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times \nas a Sunday editor.\n  Dean became managing editor of the newspaper--known now as the Daily \nTimes--later that year and has been employed with the newspaper for the \nlast 66 years. His journalistic skills and energy have helped to make \nthe Daily Times one of the best smaller daily newspapers in our \ncountry. Under his direction, the Daily Times has received more than 30 \nfirst-place awards from Tennessee journalism associations. In 2013, \nDean was inducted into the Tennessee Journalism Hall of Fame.\n  Dean is known for his contributions to tourism in Maryville and \nBlount County, including founding the Times Townsend Traveler in the \nearly 1950s, a tourism journal that was one of the first publications \nof its type in the Nation. He has received numerous awards in \nrecognition of his service to tourism in the area, including \nrecognition as the ``one person in Blount County and Townsend who has \ncontributed the most to tourism during the 20th century'' at the \nTennessee Governor's Conference on Tourism. He also served as president \nof the Blount County Chamber of Commerce, on numerous education and \nschool boards, Leadership Blount, the Maryville-Alcoa Jaycees, the \nAlcoa Kiwanis, and the United Way of Blount County.\n  Dean is a longtime supporter of our national parks and for many years \nhas served on and chaired the Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nCommission. He was instrumental in founding Beautiful Blount, which \nstill seeks to preserve the beauty in the foothills of the Smoky \nMountains. He also started Stonecraft in 1954, a postcard company he \nfounded to share the beauty of the Smokies.\n  Gregg Jones, current president of Blount County Publishers, said:\n\n       For the past several decades it has been Dean Stone's joy \n     to reveal in word and picture every dimension of his beloved \n     Blount County. As he has done so over the years, it has \n     become apparent that Dean, himself, is one of Blount County's \n     greatest treasures. I am honored to claim Dean as my \n     colleague and friend, and wish him the very best on this \n     special day and every day to come.\n\n  Another colleague of Dean's, Carl Esposito, current publisher of the \nDaily Times, said, ``Dean Stone is not only the elder statesman of the \nDaily Times, but a virtual repository of Blount County history and \nknowledge. It is a pleasure and privilege to work alongside him.''\n  Many Blount Countians have their own stories about Dean's impact on \ntheir lives, and I have mine. Other than lawn mowing and paper routes, \nDean gave me my first real job. When I was a student at Maryville High \nSchool during the 1950s, Dean began a feature in the Daily Times \nreporting the news in Blount County high schools. He named me the \nschool page editor for Maryville High. As I remember, the pay was one \npenny for each inch of copy that I wrote. I remember turning in so many \ninches of copy that after the first edition, Dean limited the number of \nwords each school editor could write.\n  Ever since, Dean Stone and his family have been close friends of the \nAlexander family. There is no one from whom I have learned more about \nmy home county than Dean Stone.\n  So Dean, from one of your many students, admirers, former employees \nand fellow Blount Countians, Happy 90th Birthday, and thank you for all \nyou have done to celebrate the beautiful place we call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5690-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5690-S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SWORDS TO PLOWSHARES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 40th anniversary of Swords to Plowshares, one of the \npreeminent organizations providing quality, compassionate care and \nservices to veterans in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  In 1974, six veterans concerned about the challenges facing soldiers \nreturning home from Vietnam established a program to help ease their \ntransition to civilian life by providing education, job training, and \nemployment assistance. Swords to Plowshares quickly earned a reputation \nas a trusted resource for veterans, and over the years it has grown to \nmeet the needs of each new generation of veterans.\n  As veterans came home from Vietnam, Swords to Plowshares created \nextensive health, social services, legal services, and housing programs \nto support them. Following the gulf war, Swords began offering programs \nto address mental health and substance\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nabuse among veterans. As veterans returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nSwords worked with vets and their families to identify gaps in VA \nservices and established the Institute for Veteran Policy to make \nrecommendations to the military and VA to better address the needs of \nour newest veterans.\n  Today, with the help of more than 100 dedicated staff, Swords \nprovides employment and job training, legal services, and housing \nassistance to more than 2,000 veterans in the San Francisco Bay area \neach year.\n  I want to extend my special thanks to Michael Blecker, a U.S. Army \nveteran who joined Swords in 1976 and has served as its executive \ndirector since 1980. I am lucky to have known Michael for more than two \ndecades, and there is no one who has been more dedicated to ensuring \nthat veterans are treated with the dignity they deserve.\n  Our service men and women and their families who have made tremendous \nsacrifices in service to America deserve not only our deepest gratitude \nbut also our commitment to help them lead healthy and productive lives. \nAs Swords to Plowshares celebrates its 40th anniversary, I offer my \nprofound thanks for all it does to fulfill our sacred obligation to our \nNation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5691-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO REVEREND CECIL WILLIAMS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in celebrating the 85th birthday and extraordinary contributions of \nmy dear friend, the Reverend Cecil Williams.\n  For more than half a century, Reverend Williams has served as the \nfounder and minister of Liberation at Glide Memorial United Methodist \nChurch in San Francisco, CA. As a minister, community leader, author, \nlecturer, and champion of the poor and marginalized, Reverend Williams \nis widely recognized and revered as a national leader in the struggle \nfor civil rights, human rights, and social change.\n  Cecil Williams was born in San Angelo, TX, and from a very young age, \nthis caring and sensitive boy was fondly known as ``the Rev'' by his \nclose-knit family. Cecil grew up in the segregated South, but his \nstrong, loving mother always told her son, ``You are going to be \nsomebody.''\n  After graduating from Huston-Tillotson University and the Perkins \nSchool of Theology at Southern Methodist University, Cecil Williams \nbecame the pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church at a time \nwhen its congregation was dwindling. Reverend Williams embarked on his \nlife's work: to make this church the center of a vibrant community that \nwould reach out to all, particularly the poor, oppressed, and \nmarginalized.\n  Reverend Williams welcomed worshippers of all backgrounds, races, and \nsexual orientations. In 1964, he helped establish the Council on \nReligion and Homosexuality an organization dedicated to educating \nreligious communities about gay and lesbian issues and stood up to \npolice who attempted to shut down a dance benefit to raise funds for \nthe new organization. Reverend Williams was also one of the first \nclergymen to take a stand for same-sex couples by presiding over their \nweddings four decades before today's struggle to legalize gay marriage.\n  Under his leadership, Glide Memorial thrived and became a cornerstone \nof the community. He hosted poets, jazz musicians, and political \nactivists at the church and launched a free meals program that serves \n750,000 meals a year, feeding more than 3,500 hungry people daily. \nToday more than 17,000 people participate in Glide programs, \nvolunteering in its community clinic, childcare, and afterschool \nprograms, housing services, and Daily Free Meals program.\n  Reverend Williams is married to Janice Mirikitani, Founding President \nof the Glide Foundation, and together they direct Glide's many \ninnovative social and cultural programs.\n  In his life and work, Rev. Cecil Williams has embodied Glide \nMemorial's revolutionary mission: ``to create a radically inclusive, \njust and loving community mobilized to alleviate suffering and break \nthe cycles of poverty and marginalization.''\n  I am proud to join his family, friends, and many admirers in \ncelebrating the 85th birthday and extraordinary contributions of Rev. \nCecil Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5691-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN HOGANSON\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I wish to honor John Hoganson who \nretired at the end of July after 33 years of dedicated service to the \nState of North Dakota with the North Dakota Geologic Survey.\n  John traces his love for discovery and earth science back to his \nchildhood in eastern North Dakota. As a child, John could be found with \nhis father's claw hammer breaking open rocks in an attempt to discover \nthe mysteries that lay inside. As a young adult, his passion and \ncuriosity helped him graduate from North Dakota State University and \neventually to earn a doctorate in geology with an emphasis in \npaleontology from the University of North Dakota.\n  He began his career in public service as a geologist with the \nGeologic Survey. The position later transitioned when he was tasked \nwith formulating a fossil resource management plan for the State. John \nwould later go on to serve as our State's first paleontologist, a \nposition he held for 25 years.\n  John was instrumental in securing passage of two landmark pieces of \nlegislation in the North Dakota State legislature that helped to \nprotect our State's fossil resources and created a state fossil \ncollection. Under John's leadership, North Dakota's fossil collection \nhas grown from a small collection of bones to one that now numbers in \nthe hundreds of thousands. One of the top finds includes a 67-million-\nyear-old Edmontosaurus, a duck-billed dinosaur, with intact fossilized \nskin, who has been affectionately named Dakota. Dakota is one of only a \nhandful of dinosaurs in existence to have preserved skin. Dakota has \nbeen regarded by experts as one of the more important discoveries in \nrecent times because he may be the best-preserved Edmontosaurus found \nto date. He also created a public dig program which has brought in \nvolunteers from across the country and around the world to assist with \ndigs.\n  In addition to his work for the State, John has also been a valuable \nteacher and mentor, spending countless hours engaging students of all \nages and the general public around the State in hands-on educational \nexperiences. Without John's passion and commitment, many North Dakotans \nwould have never been aware of our State's rich paleontological \nhistory. He has been pivotal in the creation of curriculum for the \nNorth Dakota Studies project, and the 24 fossil exhibits in museums and \nvisitors centers across the State.\n  In evidence to his lifelong commitment to discovery, John will be \ncontinuing his work with fossils by completing some research projects \nand writing papers for scientific journals. I want to thank John for \nhis years of dedication and service as an advocate for paleontology and \nas a teacher to the people of North Dakota. I wish him the best in his \nnew endeavors and a happy and full retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5691-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5691-S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING DAVID SOUSA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate David Sousa \non his being elected the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, Nevada \nDepartment Commander for 2015. I am proud to honor a Nevadan who has \ndedicated his life to serving our country and is committed to ensuring \nthat our Nation's heroes receive the care that they deserve.\n  Commander Sousa has had a long and decorated military career in the \nUnited States Army for over 25 years. During his service, he has served \nmissions in Kenya and Somolia and went on to serve in ``Operation Iraqi \nFreedom'' in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, as a member of the 72nd Military Police \nCompany. He also went on to serve in ``Operation Enduring Freedom'' in \nKandahar, Afghanistan, as a member of the 422nd Expeditionary Signal \nBattalion. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Commander Sousa for \nhis courageous contributions to the United States of America and to \nfreedom-loving nations around the world. His service to his country and \nhis bravery and dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men \nand women who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I recognize\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nthe important role the Veterans of Foreign Wars plays for combat \nveterans and military servicemembers from the active, Guard, and \nReserve forces. This distinguished national group of veterans has been \na constant influence, furthering the voice of all of our Nation's \nheroes. On July 22, 2014, at the 115th National Convention, David Sousa \nwas elected Nevada Department Commander. Commander Sousa has served and \nheld many roles within the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization for \nthe past 10 years and has previously been named the VFW Outstanding \nVeteran for 2006. His work for the VFW is exemplary, and I expect great \nthings from him as he assumes his role as Nevada's Department \nCommander.\n  Commander Sousa's focus of his work for this year is suicide \nprevention and awareness for veterans, as well as working towards a \nsafer community for veterans. I commend Commander Sousa on this \nimportant goal and look forward to working with him to achieve this. As \na member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals \nwho serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for when they \nreturn home. I am concerned about the needs of Nevada's veterans, \nespecially those suffering one of the most common injuries from the \nIraq and Afghanistan wars--post-traumatic stress. I believe Congress \nhas a responsibility to enact policies that will help veterans overcome \nthese difficulties and ensure that the Department of Defense and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs have the resources necessary to meet the \ngrowing needs of Nevada and our Nation's veteran communities. I remain \ncommitted to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers \nin Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I am both humbled and honored by Commander Sousa's service and am \nproud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Commander Sousa for all of his accomplishments and \nwish him well in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5692-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNIZING WASHOE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT'S AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the Washoe County School District's Air National Guard for \nreceiving the Secretary of Defense Freedom Award.\n  Former Secretary of Defense, William Perry, developed the Secretary \nof Defense Freedom Award under the Employer Support of the Guard and \nReserve office in 1996. Each year, up to 15 awards are presented to \nemployers in three categories: large business, small business, and the \npublic sector. The award honors employers who have shown exceptional \nsupport to their Guard and Reserve employees and have gone above and \nbeyond what is federally mandated to ensure that their military \nemployees are well taken care of. This esteemed award is the highest in \na series of Department of Defense employer awards, and I congratulate \nWashoe County School District's Air National Guard on being selected as \none of only 190 employers to receive this award.\n  Washoe County School District's Air National Guard's extraordinary \nlevel of support they provide to their servicemembers is admirable, and \nI am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Washoe County School \nDistrict's Air National Guard here today. During deployment, the school \ndistrict takes the time to send emails and care packages to our brave \nmen and women. Its support services also extend to the members' \nfamilies. Washoe County teachers volunteer their own time to help \nchildren and spouses who are in need of assistance by babysitting, \nhousecleaning, and running errands. The school district has also been \ncommended for the support it showed after a fellow Guardsman and \nteacher, Michael Landsberry, was killed defending students during a \nshooting at Sparks Middle School last year.\n  Each and every day, our troops are serving the United States to \nprotect the freedoms we enjoy today. They dedicate their lives to serve \nthis great Nation and constantly make grave sacrifices to ensure the \nsafety of our country. Our servicemembers and their families deserve \nour gratitude and thanks, and as a member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I am committed to keeping our Nation's promise to \ncare for them. There is no way to adequately thank the men and women \nthat lay down their lives for our freedoms, but Washoe County School \nDistrict's Air National Guard has shown an unwavering dedication and \ncommitment to ensuring that our servicemembers and their families are \ngetting the support that they deserve.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in congratulating \nWashoe County School District's Air National Guard and know that they \nserve as an example for the rest of the Silver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5692-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING VETERAN'S VILLAGE\n\n Mr. HELLER.

A \nnumber of veterans are unable to find a job or afford to buy or rent a \nhome. As the demographics of our Armed Forces have changed throughout \nthe years, so too have the needs of homeless veterans. As a member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, this is an issue I have been \npersonally involved with and have introduced legislation to address. \nOrganizations like the Veteran's Village serve to help those in need in \nan environment of respect and dignity within the Las Vegas community. \nThis organization is a shining example of the kind of initiatives that \nwill help get our veterans back on their feet.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women that lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms, but the Founders and volunteers at the \nVeteran's Village are working to assist our Nation's veterans by giving \nthem shelter while they try to rebuild their lives. The organization \nwas founded by Dr. Arnold Stalk, who envisioned turning the old Econo \nLodge into a facility to house our homeless veterans. With the help of \npublic and private collaborative partnerships, Veteran's Village has \ncreated a home environment for our Nation's heroes who need a helping \nhand. This organization's continued dedication to serving veterans \nthrough providing skills training, nutrition, employment training and \nreferrals, continuing education and degree programs, medical services, \nmental health counseling and much more is commendable, and I am proud \nto honor this organization here today.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals, but to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans' service organizations like the \nVeteran's Village are committed to ensuring that the needs of our \nveterans are being met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Veteran's Village, an organization whose mission is both noble and \ncharitable. I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge the Veteran's \nVillage and its work to end homelessness for veterans throughout the \nUnited States, and I wish it the best of luck in all of its future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5692-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5692-S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAURIUM MANOR INN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nacknowledge the 25th anniversary of the Laurium Manor Inn in Houghton \nCounty, MI, which was celebrated on September 14, 2014. I extend my \nheartiest congratulations to Dave and Julie Sprenger, who purchased a \nvacant historic mansion 25 years ago with the intention of opening a \nbed and breakfast. The Sprenger's vision resulted in a small business \nsuccess building on the rich history of\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\nMichigan's Copper Country to attract today's travelers.\n  Nestled in the heart of the Keweenaw Peninsula's copper country in \nthe Upper Peninsula of Michigan and built for Thomas H. Hoatson, Jr., \nowner of the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, this mansion started \noff as a 13,000-square-foot home for the Hoatson family. It remains the \nlargest mansion in the western portion of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. \nThe extravagance of the structure was by far its best known feature. \nFrom the embossed elephant leather on the walls, to the grand staircase \nwhich spans three floors, to the hand-painted wall mural, stained glass \nwindows, and giant Corinthian columns, the Hoatson mansion was the \nepitome of opulence. Mr. Hoatson, Jr., a Houghton County native of \nScottish decent, made his fortune in the copper mining and banking \nindustries. He spent $50,000 building the mansion at a time when miners \nwere making 25 cents an hour.\n  Undaunted by the prospect of restoring this enormous and ornate \nstructure, Dave and Julie Sprenger bought the mansion in September of \n1989, opened it as a bed and breakfast, listed it as the Laurium Manor \nInn on the National Register of Historic Places, and established it as \na heritage site within the Keweenaw National Historical Park. This has \nbeen no easy task. In addition to the constant renovations and repairs, \nthe remote location of the village of Laurium, the harsh winters of the \nUpper Peninsula, and the changeable nature of tourism have all \nchallenged the Sprenger's small business. However, throughout all of \nthis, the Sprengers have persevered and continue to provide quality \nservice to the local community and visitors from around the world.\n  As a senior member of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee, I recognize the important role small businesses play in \ncreating jobs and growing the economy, and this bed and breakfast is no \nexception. I am delighted to congratulate Dave and Julie Sprenger on \nthe 25th anniversary of their flourishing small business, which \ncontributes to the local economy and enriches historical experiences \nfor tourists and residents alike. I wish them many more decades of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5693-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEEP SUBMERGENCE VEHICLE ALVIN\n\n Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Woods \nHole Oceanographic Institution, WHOI, on the 50th anniversary of the \ncommissioning of the deep-sea, human-occupied submersible Alvin.\n  Alvin was commissioned on June 5, 1964, at the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institution, in Woods Hole, MA. It is owned by the U.S. \nNavy and operated by WHOI. In one of its first missions, it responded \nto a national emergency in 1966, locating and helping to recover a \nhydrogen bomb that had accidentally dropped into the Mediterranean Sea.\n  In 1974, Alvin brought scientists for the first time to the mid-ocean \nridge during Project FAMOUS, the French-American Mid-Ocean Undersea \nStudy, and revealed a seafloor that scientists had not imagined. \nProject FAMOUS proved that submersibles could effectively explore the \ndeep seafloor and marked the beginning a new era of exploration.\n  Alvin discovered and explored previously unknown and unexpected \ncommunities of deep-sea organisms that thrive in the absence of \nsunlight, sustained not by photosynthesis but by chemosynthesis. This \ndiscovery was one of the most profound of the 20th century, because it \ncompletely transformed our conceptions of where and how life can exist \non this planet; reconfigured our search today for life on other \nplanetary bodies; and opened entirely new lines of microbiological and \nbiogeochemical research, including those that have led to commercial \nand pharmaceutical applications.\n  Over the following decades, Alvin discovered several previously \nunknown seafloor environments harboring a diversity of chemosynthetic \ncommunities, including high-temperature black-smoker chimneys that spew \nlike undersea geysers in the Pacific, 1979; cold-seep habitats \nsustained by hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbon-rich \nfluids seeping from the seafloor Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, \n1982, and in the Gulf of Mexico, 1983; and ``Lost City'' environments, \nwhere seawater reacts with mantle rock, peridotite, to produce methane \nand hydrogen in the Atlantic, 2000.\n  Alvin has also explored another type of seafloor habitat--seamounts, \nor ancient undersea volcanoes--with their diverse communities of deep-\nsea corals, fish, and other organisms, in the Gulf of Alaska, the \nPacific, and the Atlantic. Scientists aboard Alvin have discovered many \nhundreds of previously unknown marine species.\n  Alvin has contributed to other events of historical significance, \nexploring and bringing back images of the wreck of the Titanic in 1986 \nand responding to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, by investigating \nimpacts to deep-sea habitats in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n  Alvin inspired scientists and engineers to develop new generations of \ndeep-submergence technology; including remotely operated vehicles, \nROVs, tethered by fiber-optic cables and free-swimming autonomous \nunderwater vehicles, AUVs. These vehicles are now routinely used for \nnaval activities and national security, oil exploration, maritime, and \nother industries, environmental and fisheries monitoring, and disaster \nresponse, and are now being developed for use under ice in polar \nregions and to explore other planetary bodies.\n  Alvin resumed operations in 2014 after a major upgrade, funded by the \nNational Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, and WHOI, which \ndramatically enhanced its capabilities. An anticipated second phase of \nthis Alvin upgrade will increase the submersible's diving capacity from \n4,500 to 6,500 meters, 14,000 to 21,000 feet, allowing it to reach 98 \npercent of the seafloor.\n  Alvin has been a workhorse for U.S. scientists, safely taking nearly \n2,600 individual researchers on more than 4,700 dives to the ocean \ndepths and is the only deep-sea human-occupied vehicle in the National \nDeep Submergence Facility for the U.S. oceanographic community. Alvin \nhas thrilled and inspired generations of schoolchildren around the \nworld with its adventures and discoveries and become an icon for \nexploration and a symbol of American ingenuity.\n  The accomplishments and discoveries achieved by this single \nsubmersible and the scientists, engineers and ship's crew who built, \nuse, and operate it during its first 50 years demonstrate the \nimportance of continued support for the development of deep-submergence \ntechnology and exploration of the largest portion of Earth's surface \nand its last frontier the ocean.\n  Alvin is a national scientific treasure and we are proud that it \ncalls Massachusetts and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5693-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5693-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING SEEKINS PRECISION\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, America depends on the ingenuity of \nsmall business owners to propel the country forward in innovation. \nSeekins Precision demonstrates this originality by continuously \nimproving their products for a unique industry. I rise today to honor \nSeekins Precision of Lewiston, ID, a small business whose commitment to \nmanufacturing products for those who enjoy exercising their second-\namendment rights honors both Idaho and the Nation.\n  Founded in 2004, Seekins Precision builds innovative products for \nprecision shooters. As the result of an unsuccessful deer hunt, founder \nGlen Seekins identified a need for hunting equipment able to endure the \nnatural elements of the Idaho mountains products that were durable, yet \nlightweight. The combination of Mr. Seekins' background in mechanical \ndesign and his entrepreneurial spirit sparked the design for Seekins \nPrecision's flagship scope rings. After training himself on a computer \nnumerical control machine to build scope rings, Mr. Seekins and his \nwife, Katie, set up shop in their garage. In November 2005, their scope \nrings became so popular in the local shooting community that the \nbusiness developed into a full-time operation.\n  Over the past 10 years, Seekins Precision has achieved an outstanding \nreputation for quality, as well as that of a unique Idaho gem. Since \nits inception, Seekins Precision has expanded from only making scope \nrings with just a handful of employees, to developing over ten major \nupper-end rifle lines and creating more than 25 new jobs in\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nthe local Idaho community. Today, the business has expanded to \nmanufacture a full line of automatic rifle products, including rifles, \ncomplete uppers, and other parts and accessories. All of Seekins \nPrecision's products are proudly invented, sourced, and made in the USA \nin their new 25,000 square foot facility, a $4 million investment back \ninto the community.\n  At the beginning of this year, Seekins Precision participated in the \nShooting Hunting Outdoor Trade, SHOT, Show and Conference in Las Vegas, \nNV, the largest annual trade show for recreational technology \nprofessionals, and the world's premier exposition of combined firearms. \nParticipation in the SHOT Show exposed Seekins Precision to buyers from \nall 50 States and more than 100 countries, expanding the business' \nexposure to international markets. Located in the Port of Lewiston \nsince 2010, Idaho's only seaport and the farthest inland port east of \nthe west coast, Seekins Precision relocated to a 25,000 square foot \nfacility in order to accommodate further product demand this past May. \nThe small business received support from Idaho's own Governor, Butch \nOtter, who attended the grand-opening ribbon-cutting ceremony. Seekins \nPrecision's astonishing success emulates that of the American Dream, \nreaching beyond the local community and loyal customers.\n  I congratulate everyone at Seekins Precision on their success, \ncontinued growth and exemplary reputation for quality. Seekins \nPrecision represents the best aspects of American craftsmanship and is \na credit to both Idaho and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5694-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GEAR UP HAWAII\n\n Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, September 22nd marks the beginning \nof National Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate \nPrograms, GEAR UP, Week and I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe invaluable work of GEAR UP in Hawaii.\n  For more than a decade, GEAR UP has provided low-income students all \nover the country with the support and resources they need to go to \ncollege. GEAR UP helps these students, many of which are the first in \ntheir family to go to college, to overcome the challenges they face in \ntheir communities.\n  GEAR UP Hawaii serves over 16,000 students each year from low-income \nand underserved communities throughout the State in grades 7 through 12 \nand in their first year in college. The program provides a number of \nservices to these students including: supporting academic preparation \nin high school; providing opportunities for early college options; \nincreasing college access and financial aid information to students and \nfamilies; and supporting students in their first year in college. GEAR \nUP Hawaii has gained national recognition for its success in closing \nthe achievement gap and helping low-income students prepare for \ncollege.\n  Through its collaborative partnerships between Hawaii's State \nDepartment of Education, K-12 schools, the University of Hawaii, \nbusinesses, and community organizations, GEAR UP Hawaii inspires \nstudents to see post-secondary education as something they can achieve. \nIt also gives students the tools they need to succeed in college and \ntheir careers.\n  The program's results demonstrate that GEAR UP Hawaii is making \nsignificant strides towards increasing the number of low-income \nstudents who are prepared for and enroll in college. The first class of \nStep Up Scholars, a GEAR UP Hawaii program, graduated from high school \nin June 2013 and earned the college-ready Board of Education \nRecognition Diploma, BOERD, at nearly twice the rate of the statewide \naverage and three times the rate of non-Step Up Scholars. In addition, \nacross GEAR UP Hawaii schools this past year, there was a 14 percent \nincrease in the number of students participating in dual enrollment \nprograms who graduated high school with six or more college credits. \nThanks to these programs, Hawaii's students graduate from high school \nbetter prepared for college and for their futures.\n  A college education is a path to opportunity for our students. GEAR \nUP Hawaii plays a vital role in fulfilling our responsibility to ensure \nthat every student has access to that path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5694-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WENDY LEWIS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I comment today on an issue of \ntremendous concern to a number of Pennsylvania families who in recent \nyears adopted children from Nepal.\n  In August of 2010, the State Department suspended the authorization \nfor American families to adopt children from that nation with the \nexception of those families, some from Pennsylvania, who were already \nin the process of adopting Nepali orphans. The State Department and \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told these ``pipeline'' \nfamilies that their cases would be processed to completion, but that \nthey should anticipate significant delays and possibly negative \noutcomes, since their cases were suspected of being heavily tainted by \nfraud, corruption, and illegal or unethical practices. In response to \nU.S. government requests for additional evidence substantiating the \nlegality and morality of these adoptions, these families had to \nundertake extensive investigations on their own to provide such \nevidence.\n  Since these families were already completely bonded with their \nadoptive children, each of them eagerly undertook its investigation, at \ngreat financial and emotional expense. Meanwhile, most of the children \nwere forced to languish for an additional 6 months in orphanages. While \ndue diligence is appropriate for all adoptions, I am deeply troubled \nthat in this case not a single instance of fraud or corruption was ever \nfound. In fact, the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services ultimately allowed all these American pipeline \nfamilies bring their children home to the United States. Despite this \nultimately successful outcome, the State Department continues to \nsuspend adoption of desperate Nepali children by American families. I \nask that the Department reevaluate its policy with the recent \nexperience of the pipeline families as a major consideration.\n  With an eye towards the future of the children who were adopted by \nthe pipeline families, I am concerned that the public record on these \nadoptions from Nepal is still replete with references to fraud and \ntrafficking. We need to set the record straight and to make it clear \nthat each of the Nepali pipeline adoption cases in progress at the time \nof the suspension was ultimately approved and was devoid of any \nfindings of malfeasance. Every child deserves a family and no child \ndeserves to be needlessly haunted by clouds of doubt about his or her \norigin. These American families deserve to have a positive public \nrecord created showing that their adoptions were completely legal and \nethical. I wish to personally begin that record today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5694-4", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5694-5", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5694-S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5695-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001--PM 53\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States: \n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to create a program \nto provide funding for organizations that support startup businesses in \nformation and early growth stages by providing entrepreneurs with \nresources and services to produce viable businesses, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Startup \nOpportunity Accelerator Act or SOAR Act, which provides funding for \naccelerator programs and organizations that support small business \nstartups.\n  The importance of small businesses to the economy and job creation is \nwell documented. In fact, data has shown the innovative, smallest \ncompanies represent a significant majority of all new businesses, \nreaffirming the importance of young, small firms to driving small \nbusiness and economic growth.\n  To be sure, we see the impact of these high growth startups daily in \nthe technology we rely on for communication and access to information. \nMany of the startups developing these innovative technologies have \nthrived in regions, such as Silicon Valley and Silicon Alley, where \nthere are high concentrations of other entrepreneurs and startups. \nSpecifically, these regions have benefited from the presence of growth \naccelerators and other organizations that connect startups with the \nresources necessary for growth. These resources can provide critical \nopportunities for entrepreneurs to access the\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nventure capital, mentorship, and industry networks vital to success.\n  That is why I am introducing the SOAR Act. The SOAR Act would \nauthorize the Small Business Administration's SBA, Growth Accelerator \nFund, which offers funding to growth accelerators and other \norganizations supporting startups through a competitive prize program. \nThe SOAR Act would broaden the reach of these organizations to new \ncommunities by specifically encouraging applicants that fill both \ngeographic and demographic gaps in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n  After launching in the spring of 2014, the SBA saw tremendous \ninterest in the Fund and received more than 800 applications from \norganizations across the country. The SBA was able to grant awards to \n50 organizations, including a New Jersey-based innovation center that \nplans to develop a new growth accelerator focused on the food industry.\n  The SOAR Act will authorize the Growth Accelerator Fund for 5 years \nand provide a needed funding boost to help meet high demand from small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs in the program.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation that provides increased \nresources to help startups succeed. This relatively small, targeted \ninvestment would deliver big returns for communities across the \ncountry, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Portman, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. \n        Ayotte, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2839. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \naddress the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin \nuse; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nRhode Island to talk a little bit about a very important piece of \nlegislation we are introducing. It is called the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act of 2014. I think it is fair to say that \nSenator Whitehouse from Rhode Island and I do not agree on everything \nin this body that comes up--all the policy issues. But on this one we \nagree that it is necessary to develop and implement a comprehensive \nstrategy to deal with this heroin epidemic that is sweeping across our \ncountry.\n  He has been an unwavering ally in trying to find common ground on \nthis legislation. I appreciate him. Again, I think this is an area \nwhere we can find common ground on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of the Capitol to move legislation forward that can help to deal \nwith this growing issue in our States.\n  I do not think we can afford to wait. Every day, unfortunately, the \nnumber of people who die from heroin overdoses grows. Every day more \nmothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters are lost \nto this horrible scourge. By the time this year is out, I am told that \nmore than 19,000 Ohioans will have overdosed on heroin or other \nopiates. The deaths from heroin overdoses this year will be the No. 1 \ncause of death in the State of Ohio, exceeding traffic accidents.\n  Elected officials around the country, medical professionals, and \ngrass roots volunteers are dealing with this issue. They are fighting \nback. They are doing everything in their power to try to save lives and \nto try to stem this epidemic. But they need help. The challenge we all \nface is serious. To address it we need a comprehensive effort, \nmarshaling the resources of communities, grass roots organizations, \nlocal, State, and, yes, the Federal Government. That is where we come \nin here, in the Congress.\n  I think only together can we make progress here and prevent new \nvictims from falling into the grips of addiction. Only together can we \nhelp those who are already struggling with heroin to rebuild their \nlives. I think this bipartisan legislation we have introduced today is \nthe important first step in that. It lays out a broad spectrum response \nto the epidemic of heroin and opiate addiction.\n  It starts with prevention and education. Why? Because we know that \napproach can work. Obviously, it is the most effective way to deal with \nthis, to keep you from getting into the addiction in the first place. \nNearly 20 years ago I joined with leaders around southwest Ohio to form \nwhat is called the Coalition for a Drug Free Greater Cincinnati. I was \nhere in the Congress on the House side. A constituent came to me and \nsaid her son had just died from an overdose of smoking marijuana and \nhuffing gasoline. I was ready for her. I had all the statistics as to \nwhat we were doing at the Federal level in terms of eradicating crops \nin places like Colombia, interdicting drugs, prosecuting people, trying \nto stop the flow of drugs into this country.\n  She kind of looked at me and said: How is that going to help me and \nmy community? How would that have helped my kid? How does that help me \ndeal with our church, where people are in denial and will not even talk \nabout it, or our school, where the principal said: It is not a problem \nhere.\n  So we came up with this notion of these community coalitions. There \nwere a few around the country, and they seemed to be working. Ours in \ngreater Cincinnati has worked well. It is still working well. By \nworking together with grass roots organizations across the spectrum--\nteachers and parents, law enforcement, religious leaders, the media, \nbusiness--we pulled together a group. That coalition led to this \ngreater effort that we started in the House, and there is legislation \nthat I authored called the Drug-Free Communities Act, which has now \nprovided funding, by the way, and therefore helped to create thousands \nof other community coalitions. It has provided funding to over 2,000 \ncommunity coalitions around the country. There are now about 5,000, I \nthink, around the country. Those have worked. But they are not adequate \nto deal with this heroin epidemic.\n  But we start there. We start with this notion that there is a way, \nthrough a grass roots program, for more focus on prevention and \neducation to be able to help stem this growing problem; that is, \nstopping addiction before it even starts. That, of course, again, is \nthe most effective way. It saves money, saves lives. We also, though, \nhave to do more to incentivize new innovative treatment programs for \nthose who have become addicted to try to break the cycle and break the \naddiction.\n  We do that in this legislation by encouraging diversion programs like \ndrug courts that provide treatment alternatives to incarceration. We do \nit by funding evidence-based heroin treatment pilot programs. There are \nsome exciting new medications out there that we think are worth a try, \nincluding some new medications that actually block the urge, the \ncraving. We are funding evidence-based treatment programs, but at the \nsame time encouraging the use of emergency medications to stop \noverdoses.\n  This is something we have seen in all of our States. It expands the \navailability of Naloxone, which is an overdose inhibitor that the law \nenforcement agencies and other first responders have access to in order \nto be able to keep people not from overdosing--which is happening--but \nfrom dying from that overdose.\n  We know that there have been many lives saved, even over the last \ncouple of years through the use of that medication. We offer more \nresources to promptly identify and treat incarcerated individuals \nsuffering from addiction disorders by collaborating with criminal \njustice stakeholders and, again, providing evidence-based treatment. \nThis revolving door in the criminal justice system of people who are \ndrug users getting into prison, getting out again--and within 2 or 3 \nyears over two-thirds of them are back in the system--we are all paying \nfor that. The communities are paying for it with increased crime. The \nfamilies are paying for it. The taxpayers are also paying for it--\n$25,000, $30,000 a year for incarcerating individuals, who, if you can \nget them into a drug treatment program, in part through these drug \ncourts, in part through other programs that are proven to work, they \ncan then not just get over their addiction and not be committing crimes \nbut become productive citizens and taxpayers themselves.\n  We have seen this lap around the country. We have to be encouraging \nthat and supporting that at the Federal level. I saw a model of this \nkind of approach when I visited the CompDrug treatment center recently \nin Columbus, OH. I met with several nurses and\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\ncounselors who are there on the front lines in the battle against \naddiction. They used medication-assisted treatment, but they also use a \nlot of counseling to help men and women get on this path to recovery. \nSo it is not just the medication, but it has to be a more comprehensive \nplan. They do this in both a public health capacity but also in \nconnection with a prisoner reentry program.\n  So, again, it is people coming out of the criminal justice system who \nhave a history of addiction and to get them into this program so they \ncan get not just the treatment they need to get over their addiction \nbut the job training they also need to be able to get back into the \nworkforce to become productive citizens.\n  We do not stop here in this legislation. If there is one thing I have \nlearned over the last couple of decades working in this area, it is \nthat the best solutions on this are not going to come from Washington. \nThey are going to be developed at the grass roots, on the ground.\n  What we can do is support those efforts on the ground and provide \nStates with more flexibility to be able to use these resources that are \nalready coming from Washington, so our legislation does that as well.\n  Our bill offers States that are proactive at enacting proven policies \nthe ability to benefit from support under State incentive grants. These \ngrants will reward States such as Ohio that are improving access to \ndrug-abuse services for specific at-risk individuals and that are \nworking to reach 100-percent compliance with programs such as the \nprescription drug monitoring program that tracks prescription drugs.\n  Some States such as Ohio--where we have a big prescription drug \nproblem--there is also southern Ohio with adjoining States West \nVirginia and Kentucky that have this issue and without a sufficient \nmonitoring program. Some people are getting prescription drugs filled \nin Ohio and then going across the river to Kentucky and getting them \nfilled. There is no way to monitor that without an effective program. \nWe want to encourage all States to adopt this kind of a program so we \nknow who is getting prescription drugs, who needs them and who is \nabusing the process.\n  We also talk about this issue in the abstract. I have done that today \ntalking about numbers--19,000 overdoses. But what does that mean? It is \na shockingly high number. We sometimes forget that every one of those \noverdoses represents a person, a family member, someone who has hopes \nand dreams, someone who at some point made a mistake, and now that \nmistake threatens those dreams and often devastates their family, as I \nhave seen and I am sure you have seen. Sometimes it can even result in \nthat person's death. As we talk about overdoses this year, it will be \nthe No. 1 cause of death in my State of Ohio.\n  I want to share a couple stories briefly before I close, people I \nhave met in Ohio, people in communities in my State who are struggling \nwith the weight of addiction.\n  I recently met a guy about my age. His name is Paul. Paul came to a \nroundtable discussion and has been engaged in this issue because his \nson died of a heroin overdose. He was 19 years old. He died of an \noverdose 2 days after getting out of rehab. Sadly, that is not an \nuncommon story. People go into rehab to turn their lives around and \nmany are successful, but many aren't. For some of them when they get \nout, the temptation is too great and unfortunately their body no longer \nhas the tolerance for the drug it once did and sometimes they overdose. \nHis son was one of those.\n  This man has been in a lot of pain, I could tell. He is still in a \nlot of pain. But where he has channeled his grief and his pain is \nhelping others to overcome addiction and to bring this discussion out \nof the dark, to talk about it.\n  It is not a comfortable topic for a lot of people to talk about, but \nhe has been willing to do it, to talk about his family situation and \ntalk about the fact that every family around the kitchen table ought to \nbe talking about this subject. We ought to be talking about it in the \nclassrooms. We ought to be sure that people understand the incredible \nrisk and danger our young people face today.\n  Earlier this year I met a young woman named Sarah. Sarah has been \nstruggling to overcome her own addiction. She has been successful, and \nI applaud her. She told me: Addiction starts in treatment, Rob, but it \nalso happens in the community. You have to have a surrounding that \nsupports you and encourages you.\n  She is fighting her own battle, but she is also doing something \ninteresting at Ohio State University. She has started a student-led \nrecovery program, kind of a support network among students.\n  Again, often this is in the shadows. She has been the one to step \nforward and say: Hey, I have an issue. I am a recovering addict, and I \nwant other recovering addicts to come and join me and feel support so \nthey don't do what Paul's son did.\n  Then there is Bill. Bill is in recovery from a heroin addiction that \nhe told me used to cost him $2,000 a week at its height. It cost him \nhis freedom too. He ended up in prison. When he got out of prison, he \nwas able to take advantage of some of these programs we talked about \ntoday, some of these prisoner re-entry programs and treatment options. \nBill turned his life around. Interestingly, he now works at the very \ncorrections facility where he once served.\n  As he joked with me, he said: I used to be behind bars. Now I hold \nthe keys to the cells and I am spreading a message.\n  I imagine he is a very credible spokesperson for that message. He is \nworking with inmates to help build relationships and re-entry programs, \nnot just in the prison behind the walls, but also in his community in \nCanton, OH.\n  He encourages employers to give people a second chance, to give them \na shot. His quote to me was: Don't give them the keys to the safe on \nthe first day, but give them a shot. It worked for me. It can work for \nothers.\n  This battle against addiction will not be an easy one, we know that, \nbut we also know it is well worth the fight. We have to take the fight.\n  When we see the number of overdoses drop, and we see statistics \nshowing that fewer kids are using drugs and more people are breaking \nfree of the addiction that once held them, we will know it paid off. It \nis not only about dollars and cents. Yes, we can save taxpayer money, \nwe can be sure that more people are productively employed, and that our \nsociety is more efficient and communities are safer, but ultimately \nthis is about our young people and what kind of future they are going \nto have.\n  It is about our children and our grandchildren. Will they have a \nbetter shot at their dream, a better shot at getting through school, \ngetting an education, a better shot at getting a decent job and being \nable to hold it, and a better shot at being able to take care of their \nown families and having the dignity and self-respect that comes with \nthat? That is ultimately what this legislation is about.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for joining with me to craft this \nlegislation. I also thank Senator Leahy, who I understand has recently \nagreed to become an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  I encourage other Members to take a look at it. It is a good way for \nus to come together as Republicans and Democrats to focus on an issue \nthat is affecting every single State represented in this body.\n  Sometimes people are in denial about this subject, but the reality is \nit affects all of us as Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE:\n  S.J. Res. 44. A joint resolution to authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am introducing a resolution to provide \nPresident Obama with authority in the multinational mission to defeat \nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, which is meant to \nreinforce the President's strategy, as well as set key limitations that \nI hope will be included in final authorizing language for broader \nCongressional consideration.\n  President Obama laid out a strong case for the need to defeat ISIL, \nand asked for Congressional support for this effort. Now is the time \nfor Congress to act to support the President and reestablish balance \nbetween the Executive and Legislature on whether or not to engage in \nsignificant military action.\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\n  I was heartened when Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Menendez \nanswered the President's call by saying the committee would soon craft \nauthorizing language for the U.S. military mission. It is my hope that \nthe proposal I am introducing today will help move the process forward \non what a specific and narrow authorization for limited military action \nagainst ISIL should look like.\n  This authorization is specific to ISIL and supports President Obama's \nkey pillars: a multinational effort to degrade and destroy ISIL, the \nuse of necessary and appropriate force in a campaign of air strikes \nagainst ISIL in Iraq and Syria and the provision of military equipment \nto appropriately vetted forces in Iraq and Syria, including the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, Kurdish fighters, and other legitimate, appropriately \nvetted, non-terrorist opposition groups in Syria. It also includes four \nkey limitations: no U.S. ground troops; repeal of the 2002 Iraq \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force; sunset after 1 year; and \nnarrow definition of associated forces. I have also included reporting \nrequirements that require the President to update Congress on progress \nof the mission.\n  I believe this authorization is needed for two reasons. First, we \nneed to comply with constitutional war powers provisions--Congress \ndeclares war and the President, as Commander-in-Chief, executes the \nmission. Second, and perhaps more importantly, Congressional buy-in \nrepresents a core value of our Nation--that the political leadership is \nwilling to do the hard work to reach consensus in support of our \nservicemembers. If Congress is not willing to do the hard work to \ndebate and vote on an authorization, we should not be asking our \nservicemembers to go into harm's way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5703-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 551--RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 2014 AS ``NATIONAL CAMPUS \n    SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n                 NATIONAL CAMPUS SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. HELLER (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 557\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 19, 2014, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5705-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 558--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 22 THROUGH 28, \n     2014, AS ``NATIONAL ADULT EDUCATION AND FAMILY LITERACY WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, \nMr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \nCollins, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

INF TREATY INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has determined that the Russian \n     Federation is in violation of its obligations under the \n     Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their \n     Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at \n     Washington December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, \n     1988 (commonly referred to as the ``INF Treaty'') not to \n     possess, produce, or flight-test ground-launched missiles \n     with range capabilities of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or to \n     possess or produce launchers of such missiles.\n       (2) The United States Government has raised INF compliance \n     concerns with the Russian Federation on repeated occasions in \n     an effort to resolve United States concerns. The United \n     States Government continues to attempt to address these very \n     serious matters with the Government of the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (3) On April 2, 2014, General Philip Breedlove, Commander \n     of the United States European Command and Supreme Allied \n     Commander Europe, stated, ``A weapon capability that violates \n     the INF Treaty, that is introduced into the greater European \n     land mass is absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt \n     with . . .

I also \ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty would replace the outdated extradition treaty between the\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\nUnited States and Chile, signed at Santiago on April 17, 1900 (the \n``1900 Treaty''). The Treaty follows generally the form and content of \nother extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It \nwould replace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern \n``dual criminality'' approach, which would enable extradition for such \noffenses as money laundering and other newer offenses not appearing on \nthe list from the 1900 Treaty. The Treaty also contains a modernized \n``political offense'' clause and provides that extradition shall not be \nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought. Finally, the \nTreaty incorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline \nand speed the extradition process.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to its ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 17, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/17/senate-section/article/S5721-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2014\n\n  Mr. REID.
