I hope we can complete these \nvotes, because there are people working very hard on this, not the \nleast of which has been the President pro tempore, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, who has worked on this matter for a number of \nyears.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that we are on the Violence \nAgainst Women Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope all Senators will join in adopting \nthe trafficking victims protection amendment that is before us today. \nThis is crucial to reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct. We can make real progress in helping victims of human trafficking \nby adopting the amendment today and then proceeding to pass both the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act and the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act without delay.\n\n  One hundred and fifty years after President Lincoln issued the \nEmancipation Proclamation and long since ratification of the 13th \namendment to our Constitution, slavery is illegal. What we are fighting \nnow is human trafficking, which can amount to modern day slavery. This \nstill occurs throughout the world--including in the United States of \nAmerica. The Polaris Project estimates that there are more than 27 \nmillion victims of human trafficking worldwide today. To put that in \nperspective, that is more people than the population of Texas.\n  The amendment before the Senate today is drawn from our Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act, a bipartisan bill that was \nwritten with the input of victims and service providers to make \ncritical improvements to existing law. I have worked hard to try to \naddress concerns expressed by Republican Senators and to ensure \nbipartisan support for this legislation, which Congress has \nreauthorized three times before. The result is that last year this \nlegislation had 57 cosponsors, including 15 Republicans.\n  It is a parallel effort to our reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. I was preparing to move it separately but other \nSenators offered trafficking-related amendments to the VAWA bill. That \nis what led to this amendment being offered at this time. This is now \nour opportunity to pass the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act and take a giant stride forward to help trafficking \nvictims.\n  Our effort is to stop human trafficking at its roots by supporting \nboth domestic and international efforts to fight against trafficking \nand to punish its perpetrators. We provide critical resources to help \nsupport victims as they rebuild their lives.\n  This amendment includes new measures to ensure better partnership and \ncoordination among Federal agencies, between law enforcement and victim \nservice providers, and with foreign countries to better address every \nfacet of this complicated problem.\n  It also strengthens criminal anti trafficking statutes to ensure that \nlaw enforcement agencies have the tools they need to effectively combat \nall forms of trafficking. It includes measures to encourage victims to \ncooperate with law enforcement, which leads to more prosecutions, and \nto identify victims and alert law enforcement.\n  We have included accountability measures to ensure that Federal funds \nare used for their intended purposes, and we have streamlined programs \nto focus scarce resources on the approaches that have been the most \nsuccessful.\n  Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported the measure and it \nwas cleared for passage by every Democratic Senator. We worked closely \nwith Chairman Kerry, now Secretary of State Kerry, and the members of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee. We have updated it with modifications \ncleared with the State Department and the new Foreign Affairs chairman, \nSenator Menendez, to the first title. I want to acknowledge Senator \nRubio's efforts last year trying to help us clear this bill for Senate \npassage. Regrettably, this important legislation, like so many others, \nwas held up last year by the objection of one anonymous Republican \nSenator. This is now our opportunity to pass it. Let us join together \ntoday to take this important step to help trafficking victims and \nprevent human trafficking.\n  The United States remains a beacon of hope for so many who face human \nrights abuses. We know that young women and girls, often just 11, 12, \nor 13 years old, are being bought and sold. We know that workers are \nbeing held and forced into labor against their will.\n  I urge all Senators to join in passing the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act. People in this country and millions \naround the world are counting on us.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the time be equally divided, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Fiscal Challenges\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past few weeks I have come to \nthe floor to urge the President and Senate Democrats to act on the huge \nfiscal challenges facing our Nation, starting with the Obama sequester. \nUnless Senate Democrats allow a reasonable spending cut alternative to \npass this Chamber before March 1, the President's plan will go into \neffect. The House passed legislation to avert the Obama sequester \nmonths ago, but Senate Democrats have yet to pass an alternative bill \nthat could actually go to conference. In fact, it took until this week \nfor them to even say they would do an alternative, and the alternative \nthey have come up with is clearly--clearly--designed to fail. Look, \nthey knew this was coming more than a year ago. Yet they still haven't \nput forward a serious proposal of replacement spending cuts. What a \ncolossal waste of time.\n  At the beginning of the year Democrats promised that things would be \ndifferent. They promised to get their work done ahead of time instead \nof 5 minutes before the deadline, that legislation would get committee \nconsideration and that we were going to go through the regular order.\n  Instead, we find ourselves in sad and familiar territory. It goes \nsomething like this: Republicans identify a challenge and propose a \nsolution well in advance. Democrats sit on their hands until the last \nminute, and then they offer some gimmicky bill designed to fail. Then \ncomes the final act: President Obama rides in to blame everyone else. \nObviously, tomorrow's State of the Union Address will provide a perfect \nforum for that, so we will see if history repeats itself. But, frankly, \nthis whole routine is getting quite old. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe the \nPresident and his Democratic friends are willing to break the cycle \nthis time. If so, my party has said from the beginning that we would \nmuch prefer to replace the Obama sequester with smarter spending cuts \nand reforms.\n  Even though Republicans already passed legislation to solve the \nproblem a long time ago, if the President wants a different solution he \ncan call his own, that is fine. We are happy to give him the credit. \nBut however we get it done, the time has come to finally take on \nWashington's spending problem in a bipartisan way, and that means the \nPresident will actually have to move beyond the gimmicks and the taxes \nand propose real spending reductions because I assure you that my \nconstituents in Kentucky will not accept a tax hike in place of \nspending cuts already agreed to by both parties.\n  Remember, we agreed to reduce this amount of spending in October 2011 \nwithout raising taxes. We have already made this agreement. The \nquestion is, What are we going to do about it? I think Democrats' \ncontinued avoidance of their responsibility to deal with the huge \nthreats to our economy and our future lies ahead.\n  As I said, I strongly suspect that instead of bipartisan action, the \nWhite House will subject us to yet another campaign blitz. Frankly, I \ncould write the scripts myself. We will all be told that the \nPresident's hands are tied by the very sequester he himself proposed, \nsigned, and now refuses to get rid of. We will be told he has no choice \nbut to furlough civilians throughout the Defense Department, to cut off \ntraining for forces next to deploy, and to order a battle carrier to \nstay at home, which would diminish our presence in the\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nPersian Gulf, when the reality is that he has responsibilities as \nCommander in Chief.\n  Let's be clear about something: If the President does choose to \nstrike fear into the hearts of folks whom he should be reassuring, then \nthat decision will be his alone. And that is why the next time the \nPresident delivers some over-the-top speech, flanked by some pollster-\napproved voter group, I hope someone on the stage taps him on the \nshoulder and asks, Mr. President, if you are truly worried about this \nissue, why aren't you working with the Congress we elected to prevent \nit?\n  It is a good question, and it is one only he can answer. We will \nwelcome him to Capitol Hill tomorrow, and I hope he will provide an \nanswer. Will the President lay out a serious plan to avert the Obama \nsequester or will he simply use this as another excuse to fire up the \ncampaign machine? If it is the latter, he will have to live with the \nconsequences of his choice.\n  Another issue we have been reading a lot about lately relates to the \nconsequences of ObamaCare. I could stand here and tell you that \nRepublicans warned about most of these things until we were hoarse, \nthat we saw it all coming and said so--the higher costs, the higher \npremiums, the tax hikes, the lost jobs, and the potential for millions \nto lose their plans. The President dismissed all of that, and he got \nhis legislative win. The question is, What is he going to do to help \nfolks now that our predictions are all coming true? Will he be open and \nhonest with the American people about the consequences of ObamaCare? \nWill he use tomorrow's speech as an opportunity to prepare them or will \nhe simply ignore it and hope people simply don't notice?\n  These are just a couple of the issues Americans are worried about \nright now. I hope the President addresses both of them tomorrow. There \nis pretty broad agreement that the President spent most of his first \nterm avoiding the issues Americans cared about most. What I am \nsuggesting is that he not do the same thing this time around.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend some time outlining some \namendments I have to the Violence Against Women Act, but I also ask \nunanimous consent to use oversized charts, and even with the size I \nhave, on the one chart, you can barely see it, in terms of the grant \nprograms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would also like to comment on the Trafficking \nPrevention Reauthorization Act of 2012, which is the Leahy amendment. \nWhen we first started working on this issue, it was 2001 and $31.8 \nmillion, with one or two Federal agencies involved. With this bill, we \nare going to create eight different agencies with responsibility for \nthis. That is absolutely crazy, and it duplicates exactly what we have \ndone in every other area of the Federal Government, which I will show \nhere in a moment. It shows what we have done in the Justice Department \nin terms of grants.\n  Now, we spend $3.9 billion a year out of the Justice Department on \n259 different grant programs, many of which--as a matter of fact, the \nmajority of which overlap one another. We have found--and this is not \nmy data, this is GAO data--that we have multiple entities making a \nclaim for a grant in one area, and then they go over and make a claim \nfor the same thing in another area. Guess what. The Justice Department \ndoesn't know that. They have no idea what is going on with their grant \nprograms. They do not do any followup, they do not put in any metrics, \nand so therefore the $3.9 billion or the $40 billion we have spent on \nthese programs in the last 10 years has been highly ineffective.\n  These grants are well intended. I don't doubt that. The amendment of \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, on the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act is very well intended. I am not disputing that. But we \nfind that the vast majority of money in that amendment goes overseas \nfor trafficking prevention and protection, not here in our country \nwhere it is coming across Interstate 35 and Interstate 40 through my \nState, coming from the west coast to east and from south to north.\n  When we find that the vast majority of money will be spent outside \nthe country, especially in light of our present budgetary situation, we \nought to reconsider this amendment. We ought to refine it down to one \nor two agencies, not eight. We ought to put line responsibility and \ntransparency in it, and we ought to put in metrics to make sure the \nmoney we are spending is actually going to be measured so we will know \nwhether we have been effective in spending the American taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  So I am opposed to the Leahy amendment because although well \nintended, it is a very wasteful throwing of the mud up against the \nboard and hoping to hit something. It is not organized, it is not well \nthought out, and it is certainly not efficient in terms of the way the \nmoney will be expended.\n  Let me spend a moment on these three charts. I am going to have two \nmore when GAO issues its release on April 1 of all the duplication in \nthe Federal Government, but I want you to notice something here: the \nDepartment of Justice grants, 253 different programs not just run by \nthe Department of Justice but 9 other agencies besides them, spending \n$3.9 billion a year. Now, one might say: Well, that is OK.\n  But let's look at the organization because we have this chart, which \nthe Department of Justice doesn't have. So here they are, layer upon \nlayer of administrative costs for all these programs--very well \nintended, all of them, but highly inefficient.\n  Now, what are we doing with this bill? We are going to add more to \nit. We are not going to add a lot of metrics to see if what we are \ndoing actually works.\n  The other thing we are doing with this bill is we have an \nauthorization that is far greater than the amount of money we are ever \ngoing to spend on it. Now, why would we do that? Is it political? Could \nit possibly be political, that we are going to authorize way above what \nwe know is ever going to be spent? Yes, it is. We know we are not going \nto spend what is authorized in this bill.\n  Authorizations ought to be what we intend to be spent, not how we \nintend to soothe someone with what we say we are going to spend, yet \nknowing full well we will never spend the money. It is a very shameful \nsleight of hand because these are important issues. As a practicing \nphysician, having delivered over 4,000 babies, I have seen violence \nagainst women in lots of ways. I have done a lot of counseling, spent a \nlot of time there. And any dollar we take from the American taxpayer, \nwe ought to make sure it actually does something very positive.\n  I have several amendments to this bill. I didn't get all the \namendments I wanted. One was denied, and I will explain to the American \npublic what it was. It was to eliminate $200 million in expenditures \nfor campaign conventions for the Democrats and Republicans. It passed \nhere with 94 votes, but they wouldn't allow it to be voted on here. It \npassed the House. So here is a way to take $200 million and let the \nparties run their own conventions rather than the American taxpayers \npaying for the parties. But that wasn't allowed.\n  So we haven't moved forward yet in the Senate, where people can \nactually offer what they think will be good-government amendments that \nwill save this government money and do what the vast majority of the \nAmerican people want us to do.\n  Just look at this chart. And I want to add one other thing. There is \nonly one agency of the Federal Government that, at the end of the year, \nif it doesn't spend its money, doesn't get to keep it. Guess what \ndepartment that is. It is the Department of Justice.\n  We have set them aside. So even though we don't have good controls on \nthe grants, we don't have oversight. We haven't eliminated the \nduplication which the GAO says is tremendous in terms of its goals. We \nhad an opportunity to do that on this bill. We didn't do it. At the end \nof the year, whatever they don't spend they get to spend where they \nwant to spend outside of the appropriations process of Congress. It is \ntime we change that. It is time we know where every dollar is going.\n  Now, I admit this is a dizzying poster, but it equates well the lack \nof certainty, intelligence, and planning of Congress. Congress created \nthat.\n  Think about that: 250-plus different grant programs, most of them \noverlapping and doing the same thing, with\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\nmultiple grantees hitting multiple grants. Since we don't oversight \nthem, and the agency doesn't oversight them, and they don't know \nwhether the money has been spent on what it was supposed to be spent, \nwe have no idea if we are accomplishing something good other than \nappropriating money to go to grants that go to the cities.\n  The other problem I have with this bill is that there is a federalism \nconcern. One of the reasons we have been running trillion-dollar \ndeficits, one of the reasons we are close to $17 trillion in debt, one \nof the reasons we have $86 trillion in unfunded liability--and if we \nused generally accepted accounting principles and measured our debt \nlike every other country, we would be at about 120 percent of our GDP, \nand we would be in excess of $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. And \none of the reasons is because we step all over the enumerated powers of \nthe Constitution.\n  If we were to take this act and look at it, 98 percent of it is for \nState violations of laws. Nobody will dispute that. Where in the \nConstitution does it give us the right to go down to the State level \nand direct and mandate how States are going to respond to their own \ntort and civil laws? Whether it is the Presiding Officer's Commonwealth \nof Virginia or the State of Oklahoma, what gives us that right?\n  I am for fixing these problems, but there is a bigger problem about \nto swallow our country, and we continue to blindly follow our hearts \nrather than putting a measure of common sense with our desire to do \nwell. So I have a couple of amendments.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 15\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 15.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the things the VAWA legislation \nfails to do is to address the duplication and overlap within the very \ngrant programs and nongrant programs of VAWA operated by the Department \nof Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. It doesn't \naddress those.\n  At the beginning of every Congress, I send to each and every Senator \ninformation outlining the criteria that I would use--seven others \njoined me last year--in terms of determining legislation. Last Congress \nwe sent this out, and what I will tell you is that this legislation \nsignificantly violates one of the principles that we have to do for us \nto get out of the hole; that is, to eliminate duplication and \nconsolidate what is in front of us.\n  So this legislation does do some small consolidation. I will readily \nand freely admit it hasn't come close to eliminating all the \nduplication. There are several VAWA grant programs that are so broad \nthat they duplicate one another, providing multiple opportunities, as I \nsaid before, to double-dip into Federal programs. They also duplicate \nsignificant programs with Health and Human Services. So you can get a \ngrant at Health and Human Services and you can get a grant at the \nJustice Department. So the whole proposal of this amendment is to force \nthe Department of Justice to make recommendations on what is \nduplicated, what is effective, and capture those savings to more \nquickly address the deficits we have in terms of DNA collection and \nidentification.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence that could \nsignificantly change both the cost and the time period in which we \naddress both violent crime and nonviolent crime. According to the GAO, \nwe wasted billions of dollars over the last 10 years in these grant \nprograms. So what this amendment says is we are going to put it to the \nJustice Department--they know where they are--to come forward, save \nthis money, and let's direct this money to clean up the CODIS system, \nthe DNA backlog, and bring it forward and infuse that money into both \ntechnology and catch-up so we are timely.\n  Why is this important? It is important for a lot of reasons. Sitting \nin those hundreds of thousands of cases is the very clue to solving \nhundreds of thousands of cases and others that we don't even know may \nbe connected.\n  The second reason it is important is there are people sitting in \nprison today who are innocent, and that data collection and DNA input \ncould clear them of a wrongful conviction.\n  So what this is asking the Justice Department to do is to identify \nevery program. By the way--and most people don't know--there is only \none Federal agency that actually knows every program they have. That is \nthe Department of Education. Go call anybody at the Justice Department \nand nobody over there can tell you. We know, because we have studied \nit, but they don't know. They can't even publish all their programs. \nThey don't put it out.\n  Consolidate unnecessary duplication and apply the savings toward \nresolving rape cases and DNA data cases and with the remainder that is \nleft over to go to reducing the debt. It is simple. Nobody in America \nexcept the Federal Government would run programs like this. Nobody \nwould blindly create more programs rather than make the ones they have \nwork now, except that is what we are doing.\n  So this is simple, straightforward math. I don't expect it to pass. \nWe have only had one amendment pass in the Senate in the last 2 years \ntrying to eliminate duplication, and therein lies the problem. We are \nafraid to do what is best because we would rather protect a \nconstituency of one of these small grant programs than fix them all and \nstill solve the general intent of why we put the money out there in the \nfirst place. We are conflicted.\n  So when GAO, at the end of March this year finishes the review of the \nFederal Government--which we had to mandate by an amendment that I put \ninto law--we are going to see in excess of $200 billion a year in \nduplicative costs that shouldn't be there.\n  I want you to think for a minute. If you look at every one of these \ngrant programs, every one has an administrator. Every one has a staff. \nEvery one has grant approval people. Most of them have grant \ninvestigators--most don't. Some have fund managers--most don't. So each \none of these has a bureaucracy. And when the vast majority is \nduplicating one another, we are saying we are well intended, but we are \nspending money on the process, not on the problem. The intent of this \namendment is to strike that balance between truly getting to the \nsolution to a problem and at the same time solving another problem, \nwhich is the CODIS and the rape backlog.\n  In the bill--and I am thankful that the Cornyn amendment is there. \nThe grant system previous to the Cornyn amendment said the vast \nmajority of the money had to be spent on why you can't get the DNA data \nup rather than working on the backlog. What this will do is force us to \nget caught up. This creates $600 million of savings over a period of \ntime that will then be applied to solving this problem once and for \nall. But there is great savings to come from that because what it means \nis we are not going to double-pay for things that we intended to solve.\n  I get dizzy looking at these charts. I have one for every branch of \nthe Federal Government now. We actually know what is going on. \nActually, we know what is not going on because we know what Congress \nintended, and we also know what isn't happening with the dollars that \nare coming from that.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside and call up amendment No. 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 13.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reaffirm the inalienable rights of every American citizen \n          guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States)\n\n       Beginning on page 177, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 187, line 3.\n       Beginning on page 191, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through page 192, line 22, and insert the following:\n     Except as provided in section 4, the amendments made by this \n     title shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Beginning on page 193, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through page 194, line 3, and insert the following:\n     Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act limits, \n     alters, expands, or diminishes the civil or criminal \n     jurisdiction of the State of Alaska, any subdivision of the \n     State of Alaska, or any Indian tribe in the State of Alaska.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is an amendment that is critical to my home State of \nOklahoma and every State that has Native American tribes.\n  Oklahoma now has the largest number of Native Americans of any State. \nI believe we are at 36 recognized Federal tribes in Oklahoma. Inside \nthis bill is a direct violation of the Bill of Rights of American \ncitizens who are not tribal members because what we have allowed is for \ntribal courts to try U.S. citizens in their courts--for very good \nreasons--in terms of sexual assault, assault, abuse, and other items. \nThe reason we are doing that is because either U.S. attorneys or the \nU.S. Justice Department has not effectively carried out their charge to \nrepresent\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\nthe Native American people in terms of prosecuting people who might \nhave performed those acts.\n  What we have done with this solution is to trample on the Bill of \nRights of every American who is not a Native American. I have no \ndoubt--I am 100 percent certain--that this portion of the bill is going \nto be thrown out by the first Federal judge that hears it.\n  You cannot take away the rights of U.S. citizens under the Bill of \nRights at any time, any place, any way domestically. What this bill \ndoes is totally eliminate the Bill of Rights for U.S. citizens in \ntribal courts. Most would not understand that most tribal courts don't \nrecognize our Bill of Rights. Some do but the vast majority do not.\n  So are you guaranteed rights as a U.S. citizen? Are those rights \nenshrined in the Constitution and the statutes of this government and \nthis Republic? Can we, as a Senate, forget about that and pass a law \nthat says all of a sudden we are going to violate those rights because \nwe are going to put people under the jurisdiction of a sovereign nation \nthat does not recognize those rights?\n  This is simply an amendment to strike that section of the bill. I \ndon't expect it to pass--which, again, tells us part of the disease \nthat is in Washington: We pay lipservice to the Constitution rather \nthan to believe its truths and rely on its guarantees of individual \nliberty and justice.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I believe it is \namendment No. 16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 16.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the requirements for speedy notice to victims and to \n                     require a report to Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this amendment is a perfecting amendment \nfrom the last Violence Against Women Act, which I coauthored with \nSenator Biden--then-Senator Biden--and Senator Specter.\n  When a woman is raped, right now in our country she gets raped two, \nthree, four times through our justice system. Let me explain that to \nyou. We have deadly diseases that are sexually transmitted--HIV, \nsometimes chlamydia. Now we have untreatable strains of gonorrhea. So a \nwoman is raped and, under most State laws, she doesn't have any right, \nonce an indictment has been placed against a defendant, to have them \ntested. By not having them tested what we do is we make the woman go \nthrough testing again and again and again, especially in light of HIV. \nSo they are the ones who have to be tested because they cannot know \nthat the accused perpetrator of their rape is not carrying HIV, is not \ncarrying gonorrhea, is not carrying syphilis, is not carrying \nchlamydia, because they cannot be tested. What we do is we put them \nthrough that trauma once a month for months because the perpetrator, or \nat least the accused perpetrator, has the right not to be tested in \nthis country.\n  We put a provision in the last bill that says you will lose 5 percent \nof your grant money if you do not institute these changes at a State \nlevel so that the woman who has been raped has at least an equal \nfooting to know whether her health, other than her psychological, \nemotional, physical health, because of what occurred during the act, \nwill continue to be deteriorating. Guess what. The vast majority of the \nStates said we will do what we want and we will not take that \nadditional 5 percent.\n  All this amendment does is it puts some real teeth in it. If you are \ngoing to say that somebody who has been indicted for rape has more of a \nright to not be tested than the woman who was raped, and she has to \ncontinually be tested to know whether she might have an outcome that is \nadverse for her long-term health, what this amendment says is it is \ngoing to be 20 percent.\n  I do not expect this amendment to pass either, because if we are \nreally against violence against women, what we will do is start putting \nsome of the consequences of that on the men who actually caused the \nviolence. Being tested for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis is \nnot a hard test. It is what a prudent man would do.\n  Some people say don't worry about it, just treat them. They obviously \nare not aware of the side effects of all these medicines that we would \nuse to blast this, the treatment for all these diseases. Not knowing \nand then sometimes covering up, what most people do not realize is that \ntwo or three of these diseases actually will affect the long-term \nfertility of the woman. But we have decided, at least the States have \nthat are taking this grant money, that the rights of the indicted \nperpetrator are greater than those of the victim who has been raped.\n  It should not be. I have cared for those women. I have walked with \nthem emotionally for years afterwards, wondering if the HIV infection \nwas going to show up, never knowing for sure.\n  Here is the other thing that happens. We get all these plea deals of \nrapists and here is the plea that they cop: If you give me X lower \nsentence, I will submit to testing. So all of a sudden the person who \nperpetrated this ghastly, cowardly crime negotiates a much lighter \nsentence so that the woman can have some peace of mind and not have a \nquestion mark for the next 4 or 5 years. We need to fix that, and 5 \npercent obviously did not do it. Twenty percent will.\n  I got up very early this morning to get here today to be able to \noffer these amendments. I hope my colleagues are able to get in. I know \nthe airplanes are backed up coming into Washington. But thinking about \nthe real purpose, to stop violence against women--if you want to stop \nit, you have to make it effective. You have to spend every dollar as \nthough it is the last dollar, and you have to measure every dollar. You \nhave to quit having the waste in the Justice Department and the grants \nthat are associated with them. You have to have every grantee know that \nif they get a grant from the Federal Government under one of these \nprograms, they are going to be checked, they are going to be measured \nagainst performance, and if they do not perform they are going to send \nthe money back.\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\n  We can do a lot better than we are doing with this bill. These are \nimproving amendments. My hope is, my prayer is, that some of them will \npass because they really will have a positive impact on both women and \nour freedom.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Levin are located in today's \nRecord under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, article II, section 3 of the U.S. \nConstitution says that the President of the United States ``shall from \ntime to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and \nrecommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge \nnecessary and expedient.''\n  Every President, dating all the way back from George Washington to \nour current President, has provided this to Congress on a yearly basis. \nSo the State of the Union Address, which will be presented tomorrow by \nthe President, is the continuation of a great tradition in our American \ngovernment. But the State of the Union is more than just about the \ncurrent state of our Union. It is about the future. It is about \npresenting to the American people a vision of what our country should \nlook like and how we can get there. So before the President makes his \ncase and sets out his priorities for the Nation, let's recognize where \nwe are today.\n  What is the state of our great Nation today?\n  Today, America is nearly $16.5 trillion in debt--an increase of $6 \ntrillion since the President took office in 2009.\n  Today, we are borrowing $40,000 per second. Just in the time I took \nto say that, we borrowed about $40,000. And every 10 seconds that goes \nby is another $400,000 that is being borrowed and, therefore, has to be \nrepaid with interest.\n  Today, more than 12 million American people are looking for work, and \nthat does not include the countless number of people who have given up \nlooking.\n  And today, critical benefits and programs that our seniors and \nretirees need are on track to become unavailable.\n  Hovering around 8 percent unemployment for 49 months is a crisis that \ncannot be ignored. Sadly, it has, and it has become the new norm. We \ncannot allow that to happen.\n  Spending $1 trillion beyond our means each year is outrageous and \nunsustainable. And failing to address our massive national debt by \ncareening from crisis to crisis in this body called Congress over now \nthe last more than 2 years is a terrible way to run a country, to run a \nbusiness, to run a family, to run anything.\n  So tomorrow night the President will tell the American people how he \nplans to lead, how he plans to turn this ship around and guide us to \nsafer seas. We will not have the blame game and finger pointing. That \ndoes nothing to help us find solutions.\n  While jobs and economic recovery received barely a passing mention in \nthe President's second inaugural address, I hope the President tomorrow \nevening will focus on the specific ways he will work with Congress to \nfix our Nation's fiscal house so we can strengthen our economy and help \nget Americans back to work.\n  There are four major topics I hope to hear from the President when he \nspeaks to the American people tomorrow evening.\n  First, leadership. Time and time again, the President has refused to \nengage on meaningful action that would help us reduce the debt and spur \neconomic growth. He continues to blame Congress for inaction but yet \ndoes not offer his own plans. Tomorrow night, the President needs to \nshow the American people he is ready and fully willing to engage in the \neffort to lead us out of this malaise of economic uncertainty.\n  Second, recognition that spending is a problem. I hope the President \nwill be honest with the American people about the extent of our \nspending problem and offer specific solutions. It is impossible to say \nwith any credibility whatsoever that this gigantic bureaucracy cannot \nfind waste, mismanagement, misuse of funds, duplication, egregious \nexcess spending, and each agency of this government not commit to doing \nwhat is essential by trimming out the unessential.\n  This is a bureaucracy beyond description, and there is waste and \nplenty of money, as Senator Coburn and many others, including myself, \nhave been down here talking about--clearly, spending on things the \nAmerican people do not fully support, and if they knew the full extent \nof what the duplication was, they would demand changes. There is a real \npot of funds to reach into in that regard, in order to deal with our \ncrisis, in order to reduce and make our government more effective and \nmore efficient.\n  The President keeps promising the American people that he will reduce \nthe debt through a balanced approach. However, whenever he is asked for \na plan, all we hear back is a call for more taxes. The President got \nwhat he wanted in the fiscal cliff--well over $600 billion of new \ntaxes. And those will be added to taxes that will hit Americans as a \nresult of the health care law. Included in ObamaCare is $1 trillion of \nnew taxes--that has not been mentioned here, nor does the President \nmention it--$500 billion of which will directly affect the middle \nclass.\n  So now it is time to look at the so-called other side of that \nbalance. We need President Obama to offer a plan for serious spending \nreform. People whom I represent in Indiana and the American people will \nnot support another tax increase. Spending, Mr. President--out-of-\ncontrol wasteful spending by the Federal Government--is what must come \nnext.\n  Third, reforming Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. I was \npleased to hear the Senator from Michigan state that for 2 years he has \nbeen saying and committing to work to reform these programs. None of us \nhere wants to see benefits that the American people, under Medicare and \nMedicaid and Social Security, are entitled to--none of us wants to take \nthose away. We want to try to save those programs. But we all \nunderstand those programs are careening toward insolvency, and without \nreforms those who rely on those benefits will not receive those full \nbenefits; and those who have to pay into them to keep those programs \nsolvent will see dramatic increases in their taxes.\n\n  Reform for mandatory spending, particularly for Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security, is something nobody wants to talk about. It is \nsupposed to be the third rail of politics--touch it and you are gone. \nBut this is the reality we face that we must address and have the will \nto take care of. And we need to address it now.\n  So I am hoping tomorrow evening the President will say he wants to \nlead a responsible bipartisan effort in terms of preserving these \nprograms for not only those who are currently beneficiaries but for \nthose future generations who will need funding to support their needs \nas they retire and grow older.\n  Fourth, progrowth policies. I hope the President will present \nspecific ways to grow this economy and create jobs. We just heard some \ndiscussions here by the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from \nMichigan about closing loopholes and Tax Code reform. Once again, here \nis something on a bipartisan basis many of us have been talking about.\n  A Democrat from Oregon, Ron Wyden, and a conservative Republican from \nIndiana, Dan Coats, have joined together in putting forward a \nprogrowth, competitive, comprehensive tax reform program. We agree \nclosing egregious loopholes is very much a key to begin to present a \nmore simple, a more fair, a more balanced Tax Code for our corporations \nand for the American taxpayer. What our plan does is not, though, \ntaking the money gained from closing those loopholes and simply giving \nit to the government and saying spend more. We take it and use it to \nmake that Tax Code more fair, to reduce rates so we can be more \ncompetitive, so we can spur economic growth and put people back to \nwork.\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n  American corporations pay the highest tax rate of any of the 36 \ncountries in the world that are our direct competitors in terms of \nselling overseas. We have just moved into the last, the worst spot \nhere, as one country reduced their tax rates significantly below what \nour corporate entities pay. So we want to lower those to make our \ncompanies more competitive, and that simply means that Americans have \nmore jobs because we are exporting more goods to the rest of the world. \nBy removing unnecessary regulatory burdens, we can also make it fair \nand more competitive, and we can usher in a new period of economic \ngrowth and bring new opportunity to many unemployed Americans.\n  I am looking for those four points. There may be more, but I think \nthose are the four major issues that need to be addressed. I trust the \nPresident will come to this same conclusion. This is not an easy time \nfor our country. We face many difficult challenges that demand bold \nsolutions and demand real leadership. But, as I have said many times \nbefore on this Senate floor, these challenges, although great, are not \ninsurmountable.\n  Republicans stand ready to work with our Democratic colleagues to \naddress these critical and pressing issues. But, in reality, we cannot \nachieve the necessary solutions if the President continues to lead from \nbehind and if he continues to say all that is needed is more tax \nrevenue.\n  Now is the time to act on a long-term plan to address our dangerous \ndebt and record high unemployment. Now is the time to rise above petty \npolitics. Now is the time for gamesmanship to be taken off the floor. \nNow is the time to just get it done.\n  We owe it to every American still looking for work. We owe it to \nevery college student hoping to use his or her skills in the workplace. \nWe owe it to every child born today who will be saddled with $50,000 of \nnational debt. And we owe it to previous generations who have \nsacrificed so much to provide us with the opportunities our generation \nhas enjoyed.\n  I hope the President will show us tomorrow that he is ready to lead. \nAfter all, he is the leader elected by the American people.\n  We cannot solve our problems and enact a path to growth and \nprosperity without his engagement. This is the hope and change the \nAmerican people are looking for tomorrow evening.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this Chamber has the rare opportunity to \npass legislation that would improve public safety, help secure justice \nfor rape victims, and help get dangerous criminals off the street. We \ncould very easily pass this legislation with an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority, just as we have on two prior occasions. Unfortunately, some \nof my colleagues have decided to turn the Violence Against Women Act \nreauthorization into a partisan football, and I will explain that in a \nminute. As a result, not only are they dividing us when we ought to be \nunited in the cause against violence against women, they are ultimately \njeopardizing support for women's shelters, counseling programs, and \nlegal services. They are also making it harder to do something I have \ncommitted to do for the last couple of years, and that is to reduce the \nrape kit backlog, which is a national scandal of the highest order.\n  Ever since it became law in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has \nbenefited from strong bipartisan support. As I have said, it has twice \nbeen reauthorized by a unanimous Senate vote. I never thought the day \nwould come when this issue would become politicized, but I am afraid it \nhas.\n  I believe it is very important, and all of us who care deeply about \nthis issue and this legislation must understand that this should remain \na bipartisan cause. Just ask Carol Bart, Lavinia Masters, Lennah Frost, \nor Mica Mosbacher, all of whom have courageously shared with me and all \nof us their personal stories in the hopes of helping other victims \nagainst sexual assault. It has been my tremendous honor to get to know \nthese women, and I admire their courage and willingness to share what \nis a profoundly personal trauma in their effort to help other would-be \nvictims. I am proud to say each of them has endorsed and supported the \nSAFER Act, which is the rape kit backlog element in the underlying bill \nwe are considering. The SAFER Act would make it much easier for State \nand local law enforcement officials to reduce the rape kit backlog, \nwhich may be as large as 400,000 untested rape kits. These rape kits \nare composed of DNA evidence collected at a crime scene, which then can \nbe compared against an FBI database to get a hit or identification of a \nsample from an unknown assailant against a known criminal whose name is \non the FBI database. When you get a hit, that provides conclusive proof \nof identity of the assailant where they may not otherwise be known or \ncaptured.\n  This reform is not controversial. In a much less polarized \nenvironment, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act would be a \nslam dunk. In today's polarized Washington, it seems that no issue is \nimmune from political gamesmanship.\n  The problem with the underlying bill is simple: It denies \nconstitutional rights to certain American citizens. I am stunned that \nsome of my colleagues are okay with this. I am stunned that some self-\nproclaimed civil liberties organizations apparently have no objection \nto a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution. They believe somehow \nthat Congress could legislate away constitutional rights. It cannot. \nThe Constitution is the fundamental law of the land and no act of \nCongress can violate the Constitution and stand. Constitutional rights \nshould not and are not negotiable. They are not bargaining chips in a \nWashington parlor game. They are permanent, and they are sacrosanct. \nHere is the good news. There is an obvious compromise that would \nresolve this dispute and guarantee bipartisan support for reauthorizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act.\n  Senator Leahy's bill, the underlying bill, would let certain U.S. \ncitizens be prosecuted for domestic violence in Native American tribal \ncourts without their full constitutional rights and without an ability \nto pursue an appeal in the Federal court system. Once again, we all \nunderstand this. Congress cannot legislate away constitutional rights. \nThis bill, if passed in its current form, would purport to do that.\n  The solution is easy. I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator \nCrapo, who was the original cosponsor of the underlying bill, and \nSenator Alexander, that would let Native American tribal courts \nprosecute non-Indians for domestic violence, provided that all non-\nIndians were given their full constitutional protection, as provided by \nthe Bill of Rights, and would be allowed appeals from a verdict in the \nFederal court system.\n  In other words, if you compare our amendment with the language in \nSenator Leahy's underlying bill, we would both give Native American \nofficials the exact same authority to prosecute people who commit \ndomestic violence on Indian reservations. The difference between our \nproposal and the underlying bill is ours would not violate the \nConstitution. It would not deny American citizens the protection of the \nBill of Rights, but the underlying bill does that. It denies American \ncitizens accused of crimes of domestic violence in tribal courts their \nconstitutional rights.\n  Surely we all share the same goal of protecting victims of domestic \nviolence, no matter who they are, but in this case they are people who \nare victims of domestic violence committed on tribal lands. We all want \nto do everything we can to protect Native American women from violent \ncrime. We can do exactly what Indian leaders are asking us to do \nwithout violating the Constitution. It is just that simple. In the end, \nthe choice is pretty basic: Either we will uphold the Constitution or \nwe won't.\n  I urge my colleagues to extend bipartisan support for this bill and \nthe message it sends to America and particularly to the victims of \nsexual assault. I would ask them to put that unified message ahead of \ntheir desire to divide us by denying, in the underlying bill,\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nthe constitutional rights to those accused of domestic violence on \ntribal lands who are not themselves members of the tribe.\n  I would remind all of us of the oath we have taken as U.S. Senators \nto uphold and defend the Constitution. I would urge them to remember \neverything they have said, we have all said, in the past about the \nimportance of upholding civil liberties.\n  Finally, I wish to say a few words to you, victims advocacy groups \nthat have worked so long and hard to pass the VAWA in 1994, and have \nworked so hard to see it reauthorized. My message to you is this: I am \ngrateful for your efforts, and I share your desire to make this law \neven better and even stronger than it is today. Make no mistake, the \nViolence Against Women Act is being held hostage by constitutional \nlanguage in the underlying bill, but we can fix it. All it takes is the \nwill and desire of Senators in this Chamber to work together to fix it \nso that it becomes constitutional, so that it becomes effective.\n  I have done everything in my power to promote a reasonable \nconstitutional compromise. Unfortunately, there are those who have \nchosen to put politics ahead of their desire to actually come to a \nsolution on this issue. That is unfortunate, that is regrettable, but \nthat is the state of play.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak against the amendment being offered by my colleague, Senator \nCoburn. I know he was on the Senate floor earlier today explaining his \namendment, and I also know my colleague from Texas was just out here \nmaking general remarks about the Violence Against Women Act and its \nreauthorization. I am here to continue the debate and to make sure it \nis clear to my colleagues that, make no mistake, a vote for the Coburn \namendment is a vote against Native American women. That is because the \namendment would strip the bill of provisions that are intended to bring \nabout better justice for women who have been the victims of domestic \nviolence crimes on Indian reservations.\n  Many people who have been out here on the floor have been talking \nabout the breakdown in our political system and that somehow this is \nabout partisan politics. Well, I can assure my colleagues this is an \nissue where many women in the Senate have been scratching their heads \nand asking themselves: Why is it the Violence Against Women Act and the \nTrafficking Prevention Reauthorization Act have both been stymied by \nvarious Members in both the House and Senate? These are crimes that are \nmostly perpetrated against women. Why aren't these bills resolved and \npassed so we can give clarity to local officials and partners so they \ncan provide a better justice system and help so many women in the \nUnited States of America?\n  Native American women are raped and assaulted at 2\\1/2\\ times the \nnational average. That means more than 1 in 3 Native American women \nwill be raped in their lifetime and 3 in 5 will suffer from domestic \nassault. Murder is the third leading cause of death among Native \nAmerican women. However, less than 50 percent of the domestic violence \ncases in Indian Country are prosecuted because of a gap in our legal \nsystem.\n  So this isn't about politics. This isn't a debate on what is a good \nway to win votes somewhere in America. This is about the life and death \nof women who need a better system to prosecute those who are committing \nserious crimes against them.\n  My colleagues can certainly take exception to the solution that has \nbeen provided here, but as many of my colleagues have said in the past, \nthey can't own the facts. They can have their opinions, but I am here \nto say the underlying bill does protect the constitutional rights of \nnon-Native Americans who commit these crimes on tribal reservations.\n  We are consulting with the Department of Justice, which did an \nelaborate study and analysis of exactly how to make sure the gap in the \nFederal system, which currently doesn't provide a prosecutor, doesn't \nprovide a judge, which doesn't provide a court on every section of land \nin the United States of America, will be represented with a judicial \npartner that does guarantee the civil liberties of U.S. citizens, and \nguarantee that they are protected in both a fair trial and the ability \nto have habeas corpus review by a Federal court.\n  What we have here are two or three Republican administrations whose \nSolicitor Generals have basically said these rights remain with Native \nAmericans and the Federal Government. The last Solicitor General said:\n\n       The policy of leaving Indians free from State jurisdiction \n     and control is deeply rooted in our Nation's history.\n\n  But this is about a Federal partnership and making sure a Federal law \nis upheld. So if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nsay we are going to provide a Federal prosecutor and a Federal Court \nsystem on every reservation or close to every reservation across \nAmerica, OK, great. My point is if you think you are rooting out crime \nin America, while letting a sieve happen in Indian Country, you are not \nrooting out crime. You are sending a signal to people that this is an \neasy place to go. If you want to conduct sex trafficking of women, go \nto tribal reservations. If you want to escape the law and not worry \nabout violent behavior, then go to tribal reservations. That is what \nyou are saying to people. You are saying this is the place where you \ncan escape the law.\n  We are trying to close that gap. So this is not something that has \nbeen done with sleight of hand. This is something where a great deal of \nthought has gone into it by the Department of Justice.\n  I will remind my colleagues it was one of our former colleagues, the \nIndian Civil Rights Act was crafted by Senator Sam Ervin of North \nCarolina, to grant American Indians the same Bill of Rights in tribal \ncourts as are afforded defendants in any other courts. Those rights \nincluded the Miranda right, a trial by jury, the right to counsel, the \nright to confront their accuser, and a right to habeas corpus. So all \nof these things are actually in the tribal system today. They are a \npart of what is called the Indian Civil Rights Act, and they affect \nNative Americans.\n  My colleague, Senator Cornyn, said these civil liberties provided to \nU.S. citizens are not included in this legislation. They are included. \nThey are included in section 904 on page 182. Those same civil \nliberties are called out in this bill, S. 47, the reauthorization of \nthe VAWA Act. They are called out specifically for nontribal U.S. \ncitizens. So in that court system both tribal members and nontribal \nmembers are protected by the same civil liberties and are protected in \ntheir ability to have federal habeas corpus review in Federal Court.\n  I am not sure to what my colleagues are referring. If I am missing \nsome point, I would love to hear about it. But these safeguards were \nbuilt into this system because this is such an egregious problem that \nwe have to fix. So we are asking Indian Country and tribal courts to \nmeet these same criteria. If a tribal court can't provide legal counsel \nto a defendant, if they can't follow these same things, then no one is \ngoing to be tried under a tribal court system.\n  We are trying to address cases like the one mentioned in the New York \nTimes today of a woman who was battered and beaten by a partner so many \ntimes, yet he was never arrested and tried because it happened on a \ntribal reservation. Only when he showed up at her worksite with a gun \nto kill her--and only because an employee pushed her out of the way is \nshe here today--could something be done. We are trying to close that \ngap and protect everyone's civil liberties.\n  I want to be clear. The civil liberties that are protected under this \nSenate bill--the civil liberties protections of due process, for no \nunreasonable search or seizure, no double jeopardy, a right to counsel, \nnot being compelled to testify against yourself, the ability to get a \nspeedy trial, the right to trial by\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\njury, the right to confront witnesses, the right of habeas corpus \nreview in federal court--are all in S. 47 as it relates to non-Native \nAmericans. Those are the rights that are going to be protected. That is \nwhat we are passing in this legislation.\n  So we shouldn't strip out this provision. We should move forward with \nwhat has been a discussion about how to partner and uphold Federal law \nin the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible, and in \nconjunction with what has been Federal law and determination about \ntribal sovereignty and issues by many Solicitor Generals, by many \nSupreme Courts, by many individuals who have looked at this situation.\n  Members can decide they don't trust Indian Country. They can say: I \ndon't trust this tribe, or I don't trust that one. If that is the case, \nthey should come to the Senate floor and say that. Say they don't \nbelieve they can bring about justice in their courts, if that is what \nthey mean. But under this statute they will absolutely have to, and \nthey absolutely have to today for every tribal member who comes before \nthat court, and they will be required to uphold those same issues for \nnon-Native Americans as well.\n  I would say to my colleagues that this is an epidemic. Believe me, I \nwant to get the Violence Against Women Act passed. I want to get this \nhuman sex trafficking act out of the hands of the House of \nRepresentatives and passed. I know some of my colleagues are trying to \nattach some of that here, but I would say we should pass both of these. \nThis is about an epidemic in America, and we are trying to put together \nsome creative solutions. If I am wrong about the facts and the details \nabout civil liberties, I would love to hear about it. Otherwise, I \nwould like my colleagues to vote against the Coburn amendment, which \nstrikes these provisions, and pass this legislation so we can move on \nand get a final bill that protects women all across America whether \nthey are tribal members or not.\n  Clearly, we should not ignore the statistics and the gap that shows \nus that we need to do something very important to make sure all women, \nincluding Native American women, no longer suffer from these statistics \nthat are just unbearable in the United States of America.\n  So, Madam President, I hope our colleagues will turn down the Coburn \namendment and vote for final passage on this legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I want to acknowledge the comments of \nmy colleague from Washington. As the incoming chairman on the Indian \nAffairs Committee, she is obviously well aware of the challenges--\noftentimes the horrific challenges--so many American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and our indigenous people face when it comes to domestic \nviolence and the inability to access the law.\n  I have been a member of the Indian Affairs Committee now since I came \nto the Senate some 10 years ago, and every year, without fail, we have \nsome aspect of a hearing that focuses on domestic violence. We look to \nthe statistics, and they are staggering. They are staggering and they \nare overwhelming when you put them into perspective in terms of how our \nNative women--particularly our Native women on reservations--deal with \nan epidemic when it comes to domestic violence issues that they face \nwithin their homes and so often have no place to turn. As to the law \nenforcement you and I would hope to be able to rely on in the event of \na true tragedy, far too often women on our reservations are not able to \navail themselves of those protections. It is something our committee \nhas struggled with for far too long.\n  When we talk about VAWA and the importance of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, I think we all recognize the universe we are speaking to is \nall women, but I think it is important to recognize that within this \nparticular demographic, the statistics of those Native women, for \nwhatever terrible, tragic reason, are even that much worse.\n  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I think it will make \nreal improvements in the services that are offered to victims of \ndomestic violence. Even given the very difficult budget environment \nthat we face, we look to those areas where we can make a difference. I \nthink this legislation will make a difference.\n  As I start off my comments, I am talking about indigenous women \neverywhere and the violence and the statistics they face. In Alaska, \nunfortunately, our statistics stand out. They stand out in a way that \nmakes none of us proud. They stand out in a way that requires us to \nturn inward and say, What are we doing wrong? What is happening that we \nare not able to make a difference in the lives of women and other \nvictims of domestic violence?\n  According to the Alaska Victimization Survey, conducted back in 2010, \n59 percent of Alaskan women have experienced intimate partner or sexual \nviolence.\n  In the 10 years between 2001 and 2011, our Alaska State troopers \nresponded to almost 50,000 domestic violence offenses, almost 5,500 \nsexual abuse of a minor offenses, and almost 4,500 sexual assault \noffenses. Seventy-four percent of the victims of sex crimes in Alaska \nwere less than 18 years old. Think about what that does to you. You are \na young child, a young woman, a victim at such an early age. You carry \nthat with you throughout your life.\n  The average rate of reported forcible rape in Alaska was 2\\1/2\\ times \nhigher in Alaska than across the rest of the country. So as a woman in \nAlaska, you have a 2\\1/2\\ times higher likelihood of being the victim \nof a forcible rape. This is a very personal issue for my State.\n  I have heard from people all over the State urging us here in the \nSenate, urging us here in the Congress: Pass this VAWA bill. You had a \nchance last Congress to pass it. You didn't make it happen. You have an \nopportunity now. Make it happen.\n  A mother in Anchorage wrote me:\n\n       This is of utmost importance to me. As one who has \n     represented victims of domestic violence in Alaska under \n     VAWA, I know how very important this legislation is to \n     protect my daughter and all other women in Alaska and \n     throughout our country.\n\n  A woman from Dutch Harbor wrote:\n\n       As a rural Alaskan who is also a board member of my local \n     domestic violence shelter, I can tell you from experience \n     that VAWA saves lives! As you know, Alaska has one of the \n     nation's highest rates of domestic violence, sexual assault, \n     child abuse, child sexual abuse, and elder abuse. The \n     economic downturn makes it even more crucial for us to \n     provide immediate safe shelter to survivors in times of \n     crisis to help them escape further violence.\n\n  Think about it. This woman is writing from Dutch Harbor, AK, out at \nthe end of the Aleutian channel, about 1,000 miles away from Anchorage, \nand an $800 airplane ticket. If you need to get away from your violent \nsituation and you don't have $1,000, where do you go? How do we provide \nthat help?\n  I received another letter from a woman in Fairbanks, who said:\n\n       Tragically, there is not a single Alaska Native woman or \n     girl in Alaska whose life has not been affected by violence \n     against women at some level. Personally, it has affected my \n     life and those that I love for generations. As Alaska \n     Natives, we know that you value and advocate for the rights \n     and welfare of the many people of Alaska. Please continue to \n     be a voice for those who cannot be heard and work to \n     reauthorize VAWA and SAVE Native Women.\n\n  These are the types of requests that I get from men and women all \nover my State.\n  Our Governor, Governor Parnell, has made a very personal effort in \nhis 4 years as Governor to focus on domestic violence and child sexual \nassault. He has launched a campaign that he has dubbed Choose Respect; \nand every year across the State Alaskans gather in a very high-profile \nway to march. We have banners and there are young children and women \nand men and anybody you might imagine, all over the State.\n  This year, March 28, the Governor will again be encouraging us to \nchoose respect. We want to make sure it is more than just overt \ndemonstrations. We need to make this translate into real words that \nchange these statistics, that change the dynamic, because Alaskans are \nright: Our statistics of domestic violence and sexual assault are \nabsolutely staggering--2\\1/2\\ times, again, more than the national \naverage. We need to do everything we can to get a handle on these \ntragic statistics, because they are not statistics, they are lives, \nthey are families, they are people and friends we know.\n  VAWA provides the tools to do so, including in the villages of rural \nAlaska, where victims of sexual assault and domestic violence face some \npretty\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nunique challenges. Many of these villages have no full-time law \nenforcement presence. They may have only a single community health aide \nwho has to tend to every medical crisis in the community. Just being \nable to provide rape kits is a challenge.\n  I mentioned being in a small remote community where everybody knows \neverybody, and you are the victim of domestic violence and there may be \nno place to turn. There may be no way to get out of your village. \nEighty percent of our communities are not attached by roads. It is not \nas though you can just hop in your car and get away. You have to be \nable to fly out. If you don't have the money, you can't get out. If the \nweather closes in, there are no planes even if you did have the cash \nfor an airplane ticket. So how we can be there to be that support is \ncrucial.\n  VAWA is a ray of hope to victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault in our Alaska Native villages, whether you are in Ketchikan or \nwhether you are in Kenai, from Anchorage to Dillingham. And this bill \nwill help that States such as Alaska, with smaller populations and \ntruly great need, are given the same access to grants for victims while \nproviding services and support to all victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence. I am pleased to be able to lend my support.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 11\n\n  Madam President, I want to take a moment to explain an amendment that \nis in order this afternoon. This is my amendment No. 11.\n  It was mentioned earlier by the Senator from Washington State that \nsection 904 and section 905 of the bill would expand the jurisdiction \nof Indian tribes to address issues of domestic violence committed by \nnon-Indians against tribal members. So within section 905(b) and 910, \nthey provide that, within the State of Alaska, this expanded \njurisdiction applies only to one Indian reservation in our State, and \nthat happens to be the Metlakatla Indian Reservation in the southeast.\n  You might say why just Metlakatla. In Alaska, there is only one \nreservation and that is Metlakatla. We have 229 federally recognized \ntribes, but other than Metlakatla, none controls Indian country in the \nState under existing law. The U.S. Supreme Court held in the Venetie \ncase that none of the lands conveyed under the Alaska law is Indian \ncountry.\n  So what we have in the amendment before us is nothing more than a \ntechnical clarification. Both the legislation and my amendment state \nthat the tribes, other than Metlakatla, retain all of the authority \nthey currently have to issue domestic violence protection orders, \nwhether or not that authority is inherent or statutorily created, and \nnone of this authority, to the extent it exists, is diminished by the \nlegislation or by my amendment. In addition, we go on to clarify that \nnone of the authority the State of Alaska has is diminished.\n  So the natural question then would be: What is the difference between \nthe Alaska provisions that are contained in 905(b) and 910? And why \nthen do we even need my amendment?\n  The only difference is that we are attempting to spell out in plain \nEnglish, consolidated in one section of the bill, to make it more \nclear. It truly is a technical amendment in every respect. We had some \nwho actually questioned whether the bill's language was clear enough, \nso we worked with Senator Leahy's folks, we worked with some of the \nIndian law scholars, to allay the confusion. We very simply state the \nrules for Alaska's unique situation.\n  I certainly hope that if we move to vote on this amendment, folks \nwould understand that what we are talking about is mere clarification, \nand I would ask for their support.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                       Thanking First Responders\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I want to first of all begin on this \nday when Connecticut, like other New England States, is digging out \nfrom an historic, truly an epic, snowstorm, to give my thanks to the \nfirst responders and to the men and women who have been working behind \nsnowplows and payloaders for endless hours, literally almost without \nstop since the beginning of this snowstorm, and have risked their \nlives, given boundlessly of their energy and effort to make sure the \npeople of Connecticut and also Massachusetts, our neighbor, and New \nYork, have been made safer and more secure during this time of another \nmonstrous storm.\n  I know much of America in the more temperate zones may not appreciate \nwhat a monstrous snowstorm, carrying 3 feet of snow to many parts of \nConnecticut, poses in the way of challenges and even threats to human \nlife. And I would say without any disrespect--in fact, with great \nadmiration to the Presiding Officer, who happens to be from Hawaii--\nthat it is unlikely in her State that anything approaching this \nmagnitude of snow ever will be approaching. But I know that Hawaii, \nlike every other State, shares its need to confront weather crises, and \nI believe that as a Nation we have always come together, whether it is \ntornadoes, hurricanes, or floods, to address these common challenges \nand we rally together as a Nation. So I hope we will again.\n  The relief is necessary, and the President has issued a declaration \nof emergency for Connecticut. I thank him for that action, and I hope \nit will be followed by tangible aid that will be necessary in the wake \nof this monstrous storm.\n  I come to the floor to talk about the action and bill I hope will be \napproved later today or as soon as possible. The Senate is considering \nthe Violence Against Women Act. I am a cosponsor and a strong \nsupporter. I wish to particularly thank Chairman Leahy, who has \ndemonstrated such patience and perseverance. If the definition of \ncourage is grace under pressure, he certainly has shown tremendous \ngrace under huge pressure. Again, we face the need, a pressing need to \nreauthorize this measure.\n  It was first passed 18 years ago and was permitted to expire during \nthe last Congress. The Senate passed this measure during the last \nCongress by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. It was stalled and then \nstopped in the House of Representatives. I thank Chairman Leahy for his \nexcellent work on this essential legislation. Partly, it was stalled \nover a measure that demands particular focus today. This legislation is \ncritical to the 54,000 Connecticut women who became domestic violence \nvictims in 2011. But it is particularly so to many of our Native \nAmericans and to women who right now are, in effect, caught in a legal \nlimbo when they seek prosecutorial action to vindicate their rights and \nto deter this cruel and unspeakable form of violence against them.\n  Native Americans' predicament is described very compellingly by a New \nYork Times story this morning. The New York Times tells the story of \nDiane Millich, a Native American woman who was abused for years by her \nhusband. She is one of 60 percent of Native American women who will \nexperience domestic abuse. That number is 60 percent. One-third of \nNative American women are assaulted during their lifetime. Native \nAmerican women are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be raped than non-Native \nAmerican women.\n  The provisions of this bill that apply to Native American women are \nmeant to address literally an epidemic of domestic violence and sexual \nassault that right now the law fails to deter and prevent. By any \nmeasure, this epidemic is a tragedy. In human terms, the numbers are \npowerful, but they fail to give a face and a voice to this problem, as \nthe Times did this morning with Diane Millich.\n  These statistics are the result of Federal law that prevents tribal \ncourts from hearing cases against non-Native American abusers of Native \nAmerican women. It is a limbo that is the result of a jurisdictional \ncatch-22. If the abuser is a non-Native American, the tribal courts \nhave no jurisdiction. But if the crime occurs on sovereign tribal land, \nFederal prosecutors face a variety of obstacles to effective \nenforcement. So this measure would protect Native American women who \nright now are so much the victims of abuse.\n  I know Senator Cornyn has just spoken about his amendment that would, \nhe has said, protect the potential defendants, protect their \nconstitutional rights under the Bill of Rights. His amendment is not \nbefore us. What is before us is Senator Coburn's amendment which would, \nin effect, eviscerate these protections for women against those \ndefendants. I wish to respond, though, to Senator Cornyn, who has\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nraised, thoughtfully and pertinently, some important questions about \nthis legislation.\n  Let me answer in two very affirmative and unequivocal ways. First of \nall, this bill would protect all the rights currently guaranteed in the \nBill of Rights. Second, it would provide a right of appeal, first to \nthe tribal courts in whatever process that is provided there but then \nby habeas corpus to Federal courts where actually the Bill of Rights \nwould apply with full force, in my view, as I read this bill.\n  Senators should be clear when they vote on this measure that the \nCoburn amendment, in my view, would destroy, utterly undermine and \neviscerate the purpose of this bill and provisions of this bill that \nare designed to protect Native Americans against domestic violence and \nassault, and it would fully guarantee protections under our Bill of \nRights to defendants who are charged, civilly or criminally, in the \ntribal courts.\n  No woman should be left defenseless because of the identity of their \nabuser. Every woman deserves to know she is protected by the law of the \nland. Again, I thank and commend Senator Leahy for addressing this \nimportant issue in the legislation before us by giving all Native \nAmerican women the protections of these tribal courts. I don't \nunderstand why this should be controversial. We are still facing \nefforts to strip this provision from the bill. I urge my colleagues to \napprove it.\n  I also commend Senator Leahy for offering an amendment that contains \nthe bulk of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. I \nam a cosponsor of that measure and proudly of this amendment as well. \nHe has been the leader in this body and in the Congress and the Nation \nagainst human trafficking. He has been a mentor to many of us on this \nissue. I am very proud to cosponsor this very important amendment.\n  Human trafficking remains a scourge in our world and in our country. \nIt is not some distant abstract problem. It is here and now in the \nUnited States, the greatest Nation in the history of our world, and we \nhave an obligation to counter and combat it as this very important \namendment would do. It relies on partnerships between the States and \nFederal Government, between the public and private sectors, and between \nthe United States and other countries. It allows one piece of the \nlegislation to achieve a massive impact and global reach. Twenty-seven \nmillion human beings are bought and sold as property each year, more \nthan at any time in our history. We must have a solution as broad and \nwide-ranging as the problem we face.\n\n  The Leahy amendment allows the Federal Government to leverage a small \noutlay of taxpayer dollars into a giant system of protections and \nservices for victims of human trafficking, not to mention law \nenforcement actions to put the perpetrators of trafficking behind bars, \nput them in prison where they belong, and send a message of deterrence \nas well as punishment.\n  This landmark proposal also creates new grant programs to help our \nlaw enforcement agencies and service providers respond to sex \ntrafficking of American children--American children who are victims of \nsex traffic. This amendment would help to protect them. These grant \nprograms will help to ensure that child victims of sex trafficking have \naccess to services they need and justice they deserve. They are \nchildren, but they are no less deserving of justice. That proposition \nought to be so obvious as not to need stating in this Chamber. I know, \nfor the purposes of this body, it need not be stated. But the Leahy \namendment recognizes that the traffickers' most effective weapon is \nsimply the ability to take the victims' identification documents. This \nmeasure would make that taking a crime, taking away identification \ndocuments.\n  The Leahy amendment also recognizes that the statute of limitations \ndesigned for other contexts is an unjustified impediment to effective \nprivate enforcement in the trafficking area. It extends the statute \nfrom 6 years to 10 years for civil suits involving violations of \nFederal trafficking laws. That statute of limitations may simply be an \nobstacle that cannot be overcome because the witnesses cannot be \nprovided and because the children themselves may have to grow, in both \nmaturity and physically, before they can effectively help prosecute a \ncivil or criminal action.\n  I have also cosponsored an amendment with Senator Portman, and I am \nproud to have done so, to ensure that youth grants provided under \nsection 302 of VAWA can be made available to child victims of sex \ntrafficking. In this country, sex trafficking remains a problem, a \nserious problem. There are an estimated 293,000 children at risk for \ncommercial sexual exploitation and trafficking. The U.S. Department of \nJustice reports that between 2008 and 2010, 83 percent of sex \ntrafficking victims found in the United States were U.S. citizens and \n40 percent of sex trafficking cases involved sexual exploitation of \nchildren.\n  The fact is a tragic one, an unacceptable and intolerable fact, that \nsex trafficking is a major source of child exploitation, a major source \nof damage to our children, and the voices and faces of those children \nshould be before this body when it considers this amendment.\n  It is a bipartisan amendment cosponsored by Senators Gillibrand, \nBrown, Collins, Ayotte, Rubio, and Cochran. I thank them for their \nleadership on this issue, most especially Senator Rob Portman, my \npartner in this effort, and I again thank Senator Leahy for his \nleadership, which has inspired us to bring our amendment forward. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the Leahy amendment as well as the \none Senator Portman and I and others have brought before this body and \nthe underlying VAWA legislation. We have an opportunity to make \nhistory. We have an obligation to pass this measure and make history. I \nhope we will do so by the same overwhelming bipartisan vote that we did \nin the last session of Congress so the House of Representatives hears \nour message, and it is a message from the country: Domestic violence \nwill not be tolerated. We will come to the aid of Native American women \nand all women who are victims of this heinous crime.\n\n\n                            Amendment no. 13\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Coburn amendment strikes the \nprovisions of the underlying bill that expand the authority of Indian \ntribal courts to try nonIndians.\n  As I have stated, there are a number of constitutional questions that \nthe Congressional Research Service has identified with the language \nthat the Coburn amendment would strike. Some arise with respect to the \nexpansion of tribal court jurisdiction. Others are associated with the \nconstitutional rights that would be provided to nonIndian defendants \nwho would face proceedings in Indian tribal courts.\n  It is not at all clear under the Constitution that Indian tribes \npossess any inherent authority that the bill purports to recognize. It \nis also not clear that Congress can constitutionally delegate to tribal \ncourts the authority to try nonIndians. Additionally, tribal courts may \nnot be able to secure basic constitutional rights to criminal \ndefendants.\n  The jury pool is racially restricted and does not provide the \ndefendant a jury of his peers. Unlike a State, a tribe is not a \nsovereign entity. Therefore, a tribal proceeding can violate double \njeopardy if the Federal government, which would retain concurrent \njurisdiction under the bill, also decided to pursue the case.\n  We recognize that rates of domestic violence are too high in Indian \ncountry. The Federal government has a responsibility to address these \ncrimes, whether committed by Indians or by others. It does not follow \nthat the approach taken in this bill is the right one.\n  We should not engage in a political exercise over tribal sovereignty \nthat has nothing to do with protecting Indian women. We also should not \nprovide an illusion of a remedy that in the end could well be struck \ndown by a court on constitutional grounds.\n  Instead, we should take clearly constitutional action that will \nenable the Federal government to better fulfill its responsibilities to \nwomen in Indian country given the practical issues that make that \ndifficult currently.\n  I will support the Coburn amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today in strong \nsupport of the Violence Against Women Act. The Violence Against Women \nAct\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nis a strong, inclusive, and bipartisan bill supported by the vast \nmajority of our colleagues here.\n  This bill has major, necessary improvements to programs that are \nvital to millions of women, children, and men in every State, and \nneighborhood in our country. The communities served by VAWA deserve to \nhave these improvements. The issues are too important for partisan \nwrangling.\n  I stand here today to call on the entire Senate to enact on these \ncritical issues in order to protect our families, protect public \nsafety, and protect the communities we serve.\n  VAWA is crucial in all of our communities. Every day VAWA is \nproviding vital services to families in desperate need. I hear from my \nconstituents far too often about the challenges they are facing, often \ninvolving significant economic struggles only to be complicated by deep \nemotional pain and fear.\n  This is not about politics. Here are the statistics: one in four \nwomen will be victims of domestic violence. Sixteen million children \nare exposed to domestic violence every day. And over 2 million will be \nvictims themselves of physical or sexual violence each year. Twenty \nthousand cases are in my own State of Maryland. Since we created the \nlegislation in 1994, the national hotline has received millions of \ncalls. Millions of women felt in danger and millions had the chance of \nbeing rescued.\n  In my own State of Maryland VAWA is making recovery possible for \nvictims finding legal help to separate from their abusers. They are \nalso getting vital services at rape crisis centers and navigating our \nimmigration system to ensure protection.\n  I heard from one of my constituents, Jean, on the Eastern Shore of \nMaryland. Jean had been married to her husband for 10 years and shared \ntwo children. She benefited from VAWA's Legal Assistance for Victims \nGrant after being abused so brutally one evening. Jean called the \nhotline and got the legal assistance to file for a protective order, \nwhich she ultimately was awarded and is now living her life safely with \nher children.\n  I also heard from Danielle. Danielle was sexually assaulted at the \nage of 19 by an associate that she knew. She was aided by VAWA's Sexual \nAssault Services program when she made the connection with the rape \ncrisis center a few days after her attack. Danielle got the support she \nneeded at the crisis center. She received personalized safety planning \nand counseling and was provided a lawyer to help her get a peace order.\n  I also hear from law enforcement in Maryland who say VAWA is helping \nthem make communities safer and how the reauthorization will strengthen \nthis. The Lethality Assessment Program, pioneered in Maryland and now a \nmodel for the Nation, is strengthened in this bill. The program is used \nto identify high-risk situations at the outset and link up local police \nwith domestic violence professionals, thereby providing wrap-around \nservices and empowerment to get victims out of harm's way and reduce \nhomicides. This was made possible because of VAWA which provided the \nFederal funding to make this a reality.\n  As chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Justice \nDepartment, I fund the Violence Against Women Act programs. These \nprograms ensure tougher penalties for abusers, coordinated assistance \nwith community organizations, and court advocates for abused to boost \nreporting and prosecution.\n  In the fiscal year 2013 CJS spending bill, I provide a robust $421 \nmillion for Violence Against Women grants. I am fighting for historic \nfunding levels even within the stringent budget reality. I also provide \nstrong investments in core VAWA programs including $189 million for \nSTOP formula grants, which coordinates community response to domestic \nviolence and also trains police, prosecutors and judicial staff; $25 \nmillion for sexual assault services that direct services for victims of \nrape; $25 million for transitional housing grants so victims have safe \nand affordable housing after shelters; and $50 million for Grants to \nEncourage Arrests, which teaches police and prosecutors how to support \nvictims and ensure offender accountability.\n  We know that VAWA works, so approving it should be a nobrainer. The \nSenate VAWA bill makes these improvements, and not just in the ways \nthat get attention, but in ways which will make the difference in a \nvictim's life.\n  I fund this bill, its improvements are measures that I fully support, \nand I put money in the Federal checkbook each year to make sure VAWA is \navailable to those who need it. Maryland has done such a good job, and \nI won't let the United States Congress fail these families in need.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Coburn amendment \nNo. 13; further, that upon disposition of the amendment, the Senate \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each; that following leader remarks on \nTuesday, February 12, the Senate resume consideration of S. 47; that \nthe time until 11 a.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees prior to votes in relation to the amendments included \nunder the previous order and that those votes occur in the order \nlisted; that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; and finally, \nthat all other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Madam President, I join Chairwoman Cantwell, the chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and the senior Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, in opposing Senator Coburn's amendment. The \namendment will remove essential protections for Native women from the \nbill.\n\n  Native women in this country experience domestic abuse at a \nshockingly high rate. A recent study found that nearly three in five \nAmerican Indian women have been the victim of a domestic assault. This \nterrible trend has been perpetuated by a jurisdictional gap that allows \nmany non-Indian perpetrators on tribal lands to go unpunished.\n  This problem is real: nearly half of Indian women are married to non-\nIndian men, and thousands more are in relationships with non-Indians. \nTribal courts have no jurisdiction when these men commit domestic \nviolence offenses, and federal and state officials are not in a \nposition to prosecute in most cases. They are often hours away and lack \nthe resources and local contacts to be able to effectively respond. \nThese non-Indian men can essentially abuse Indian women with immunity \nfrom any consequences. That has to end.\n  The Leahy-Crapo bill addresses this glaring need by allowing tribes \nthat can provide key rights to defendants to prosecute non-Indians for \ndomestic violence offenses under limited circumstances. Our bill also \nclarifies that tribal courts have the authority to issue and enforce \nprotection orders against non-Indians. These are essential tools in \ncombatting domestic violence. Senator Coburn's amendment would \neliminate these crucial provisions.\n  These provisions in the Leahy-Crapo bill are the product of careful \ndeliberation by the Indian Affairs Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee, with input from legal experts. They are identical to the \ncorresponding provision in last year's VAWA reauthorization which \npassed the Senate with 68 votes. Just this week I received a letter \nfrom the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \nAgainst Women voicing their strong support for the tribal jurisdiction \nprovision that is currently in the Leahy-Crapo bill and today I \nreceived their letter strongly opposing the changes proposed in Senator \nCoburn's amendment. I also received a letter from the National Congress \nof American Indians expressing their support for the current tribal \nprovisions and unequivocal opposition to any efforts to alter them.\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\n  Senator Coburn's amendment would reverse the significant progress we \nmade last year when the Senate passed these provisions with strong \nbipartisan support. It sends the message that Native women are not \ndeserving of the same protections as other women. I urge my fellow \nSenators to vote against it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters and other \nletters opposing the amendment be pritned in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                                 February 6, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: The National Task \n     Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence--comprised of \n     national, tribal, state, territorial and local organizations, \n     as well as individuals, committed to securing an end to \n     violence against women, including civil rights organizations, \n     labor unions, advocates for children and youth, anti-poverty \n     groups, immigrant and refugee rights organizations, women's \n     rights leaders, and education groups--writes to express its \n     strong and unequivocal support for the tribal provisions \n     included in Title IX of S. 47, the Violence Against Women \n     Reauthorization Act. As you are aware, these provisions are \n     identical to those that were contained in S. 1925, the VAWA \n     bill introduced in the 112th Congress. As such, the \n     provisions were first voted affirmatively out of the Indian \n     Affairs Committee, then added to S. 1925 and passed out of \n     the Judiciary Committee, and finally were contained in the \n     final version of S. 1925 that passed the Senate last year \n     with bipartisan support.\n       While we understand that some have expressed constitutional \n     concerns with respect to the criminal jurisdiction provisions \n     contained in section 904, Title IX of S. 47, we wish to \n     respectfully point out that the provisions were drafted and \n     put forward by the U.S. Department of Justice, and were \n     thoroughly vetted before they were submitted to the Senate \n     Indian Affairs and Judiciary Committees. We also wish to \n     remind the members of the Senate of the terrifying rates of \n     victimization that American Indian and Alaska Native women \n     experience: 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native women \n     will be raped in their lifetimes, 39% will be subjected to \n     domestic violence in their lifetimes. Sixty-seven percent of \n     Native women victims of rape and sexual assault report that \n     their assailants are non-Native individuals. On some \n     reservations, Native women are murdered at more than ten \n     times the national average. These startling statistics, \n     coupled with the unfortunately high declination rates (U.S. \n     Attorneys declined to prosecute nearly 52% of violent crimes \n     that occur in Indian country, and 67% of cases declined were \n     sexual abuse related cases), provided ample reason for \n     Congress to act in passing S. 47 with Section 904 intact.\n       Additonally, we offer for the consideration of the members \n     of the Senate a letter submitted last year by over 50 U.S. \n     law professors who carefully reviewed the provisions of \n     section 904 and found them to be constitutional. We offer \n     some relevant excerpts below:\n       ``It is important to note that Section 904 of S. 1925 does \n     not constitute a full restoration of all tribal criminal \n     jurisdiction--only that which qualifies as ``special domestic \n     violence criminal jurisdiction.'' So there must be an \n     established intimate-partner relationship to trigger the \n     jurisdiction. Moreover, no defendant in tribal court will be \n     denied Constitutional rights that would be afforded in state \n     or federal courts. Section 904 provides ample safeguards to \n     ensure that non-Indian defendants in domestic violence cases \n     receive all rights guaranteed by the United States \n     Constitution. .  .  .\n       In other words, a defendant who has no ties to the tribal \n     community would not be subject to criminal prosecution in \n     tribal court. Federal courts have jurisdiction to review such \n     tribal jurisdiction determinations after exhaustion of tribal \n     remedies. Section 904 is specifically tailored to address the \n     victimization of Indian women by persons who have either \n     married a citizen of the tribe or are dating a citizen of the \n     Tribe.''\n       In closing, the National Task Force wishes to thank you for \n     your tireless efforts to reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act, S. 47. We appreciate your leadership and look \n     forward to working with you toward a speedy passage of S. 47, \n     including Title IX as introduced with no weakening \n     amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n     The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.\n                                  ____\n\n         NCAI Task Force on Violence Against Women, National \n           Congress of American Indians,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Crapo: The National Congress of \n     American Indians (NCAI), founded in 1944, is the oldest, \n     largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska \n     Native organization serving the broad interests of tribal \n     governments and communities. The NCAI Task Force on Violence \n     Against Women focuses on addressing crimes of violence \n     against Native women. This letter is to express our strong \n     opposition to any amendment offered which would strip or \n     alter the current language in S. 47.\n       The Task Force knows that unfortunately Native women are \n     victimized at rates higher than any other population in the \n     United States. It is estimated that 34% of American Indian \n     and Alaska Native women will be raped in their lifetimes; 39% \n     will be subjected to domestic violence in their lifetimes; \n     67% of Native women victims of rape and sexual assault report \n     their assailants as non-Native individuals, and, on some \n     reservations, Native women are murdered at more than ten \n     times the national average.\n       These startling statistics, coupled with the unfortunately \n     high declination rates (U.S. Attorneys declined to prosecute \n     nearly 52% of violent crimes that occur in Indian country; \n     and 67% of cases declined were sexual abuse related cases), \n     provide ample reason for Congress to act in passing S. 47 \n     with Section 904 intact.\n       Section 904 does not take away constitutional rights from \n     offenders, it guarantees swift justice for Native victims. \n     There are safeguards built into the provision which ensure \n     that all rights guaranteed under the Constitution are given \n     to non-Native defendants in tribal court. Further, the \n     special domestic violence jurisdiction is narrowly restricted \n     to apply only to instances of domestic or dating violence \n     where: 1) the victim is an Indian, 2) the conduct occurs on \n     tribal lands; and 3) where the defendant either lives or \n     works on the reservation, i.e., where the defendant has \n     significant ties to the community.\n       The NCAI Task Force on Violence Against Women is extremely \n     concerned that misunderstandings of the political status of \n     Indian tribes and the internal workings of the tribal court \n     system are causing confusion on how this provision will work \n     on the ground. Indian tribes are not a racial class, they are \n     a political body--so the question is not whether non-Indians \n     are subject to Indian court--the question is whether tribal \n     governments, political entities, have the necessary \n     jurisdiction to provide their citizens with the public safety \n     protections every government has the inherent duty to \n     provide.\n       Amendments which place more funding in the hands of federal \n     authorities will not address this immediate local need. We \n     believe strongly that local government is the best government \n     for addressing public safety concerns. For example, an \n     amendment is being offered today which would require that \n     tribal governments petition a U.S. District Court for an \n     ``appropriately tailored protection order excluding any \n     persons from areas within the Indian country of the tribe.'' \n     This level of procedure for an intimately local issue is not \n     practical and will do little to improve matters on Indian \n     reservations. Tribal courts are the appropriate venue to \n     issue such protection orders.\n       Also, tribal courts and authorities are the appropriate \n     triers of fact for domestic violence matters conducted on \n     Indian reservations. The federal system has proven \n     ineffective in many respects, but none as detrimental to the \n     backbone of a community as the area of domestic violence \n     against Native women. Further many tribal courts operate in \n     much the same manner as state courts, albeit with smaller \n     dockets and lesser degrees of crime as their sister \n     governments: state and federal courts. Also, all tribal \n     courts are bound by the Indian Civil Rights Act, which, as \n     amended, guarantees all of the constitutional rights non-\n     Native defendants have in state courts.\n       For these reasons, the NCAI Task Force on Violence Against \n     Women strongly opposes any amendments to S. 47 and offers its \n     strong support for the current language in the bipartisan \n     Senate VAWA Reauthorization: S. 47. Thanks for your time and \n     your continuous efforts to provide greater protections for \n     women in Indian Country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Juana Majel Dixon,\n\n                             Co-Chair, NCAI Task Force on Violence\n                                                    Against Women.\n\n                                                  Terri Henry,\n\n                             Co-Chair, NCAI Task Force on Violence\n     Against Women.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Vote No on Coburn Amendment #13\n\n\n   A ``NO'' Vote will Retain Vital VAWA Protections for Native Women\n\n       The National Congress of American Indians and tribal \n     governments nationwide oppose Coburn Amendment No. 13. This \n     harmful amendment would strip the critical tribal \n     jurisdiction provisions in Sections 904 and 905 of S. 47 that \n     are so important to deterring senseless violence against \n     Native women who reside on Indian reservations. Section 904 \n     is the same tribal jurisdiction language that passed the \n     Senate last session with strong bi-partisan support. It \n     acknowledges the authority of Indian tribal governments to \n     exercise concurrent jurisdiction over crimes of domestic \n     violence by non-Native suspects. Every suspect will be \n     afforded the full array of constitutional protections.\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\n     This provision is critically important to stopping the \n     epidemic of domestic violence against Native women.\n     Section 904 is Narrowly Tailored\n       Section 904 does not acknowledge blanket jurisdiction over \n     all crimes committed by non-Indians on tribal lands. The \n     jurisdiction would only apply to domestic or dating violence \n     where the victim is a tribal citizen; the crime occurred on \n     tribal lands; and the defendant must be in an established \n     relationship with the victim. The provision is specifically \n     tailored to address a serious epidemic of violence that \n     Native women face each day.\n       The current system of justice on Indian lands is broken. \n     More than 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their \n     lifetimes, and more than 3 in 5 will suffer domestic abuse. \n     Native women are forced to rely on federal officials to \n     investigate and prosecute domestic violence committed by non-\n     Natives. However, U.S. Attorneys declined to prosecute a \n     majority of violent crimes. Between 2006-2009, federal \n     officials declined 52% of violent reservation crimes, \n     including 67% of sexual assaults.\n       In most cases, federal resources are stretched too thin, \n     and federal investigators are located too far from many \n     reservations to serve as an effective deterrent to crime on \n     tribal lands. Lower level crimes of domestic violence go \n     completely unprosecuted--and often unreported, because many \n     Native women have lost faith in the justice system. When \n     lower level domestic violence goes unpunished, the violence \n     increases. The result on some reservations is that the \n     homicide rate of Native women in 10 times the national \n     average. These shocking facts provide compelling reasons for \n     Congress to enact S. 47 with Section 904 intact.\n     Defendants' Have all Due Process Rights under the Proposed \n         Limited Jurisdiction\n       Section 904 ensures that non-Indian defendants in tribal \n     court are afforded due process in a manner consistent with \n     state and federal courts. This includes the right to \n     effective assistance of counsel, the right to a trial by an \n     impartial jury selected impartially, as well as all other \n     constitutional rights guaranteed under the Indian Civil \n     Rights Act. Also, the draft language includes a catch-all \n     provision, which entitles defendants to ``all other rights \n     whose protection is necessary under the Constitution of the \n     United States in order for Congress'' to acknowledge this \n     jurisdiction. This last section ensures that non-Indian \n     defendants will receive a fair trial in tribal courts. The U. \n     S. Department of Justice developed and strongly supports \n     Section 904, as do Bush Administration U.S. Attorneys, and \n     many other experts in the field of criminal justice.\n     The Coburn Amendment Also Strikes Section 905 from S. 47\n       The Coburn Amendment would strike Section 905 from S. 47. \n     This section also passed this Senate last session with strong \n     bi-partisan support. The civil jurisdiction found in Section \n     905 already exists under the full faith & credit clauses of \n     VAWA 2000. This section simply clarifies the intent of this \n     earlier reauthorization by making clear that tribes have full \n     civil authority to issue and enforce domestic civil \n     protection orders against Indians and non-Indians alike.\n       This provision is critical to strengthening tribal \n     regulatory authority over domestic disputes, threats of \n     violence, harassment, or verbal or physical abuse. Women \n     living in Indian country and Alaska Native villages rely on \n     tribal courts each day to obtain civil orders of protection \n     to prevent future abuse in crimes of domestic violence, \n     sexual assault, dating, and stalking. Requiring a woman in \n     need of immediate protection to travel hundreds of miles from \n     her reservation to a state court is not only impractical but \n     also dangerous. We strongly oppose any amendment intended to \n     strike this provision.\n     A Vote Against the Coburn Amendment is a Vote for Indian \n         Country\n       A vote against the Coburn Amendment is a vote for Native \n     women victims of abuse--and for the children who will grow up \n     without such horrific violence. Sections 904 and 905 are \n     sensible, fair and will create a partnership between tribal \n     governments and federal authorities in addressing an epidemic \n     of domestic violence in Indian country. A VAWA \n     Reauthorization without these critical provisions will deny \n     Indian women access to justice and legal protection available \n     to other victims. Native women will be left behind in the \n     national efforts to protect all victims of domestic violence \n     and sexual assault.\n       Coburn Amendment No. 13 would ignore the horrific crime \n     that Native women face on a daily basis. If adopted, Congress \n     will be telling tribal communities that the status quo is \n     acceptable. Violence against any person by any person \n     anywhere is unacceptable. For these reasons, I respectfully \n     request you oppose the Coburn Amendment No. 13 and help \n     Indian Country pass a VAWA Reauthorization that protects all \n     women.\n     Juana Majel Dixon,\n       First Vice President, NCAI, Co-Chair, NCAI Task Force on \n     Violence Against Women.\n     Terri Henry,\n       Council, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Co-Chair, NCAI \n     Task Force on Violence Against Women.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      United South\n\n\n                                     and Eastern Tribes, Inc.,\n\n                                  Nashville, TN, February 9, 2013.\n     Re Stand up for Native Women--Vote No on Coburn Amendment \n         (No. 13) to S. 47.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write to you in two roles. First, I write \n     on behalf of the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. \n     (USET), which is an inter-tribal organization representing 26 \n     federally recognized Tribes from Texas to Maine. Second, I \n     write as a son, father, relative and tribal leader who has \n     seen all too many times the long-lasting tragic consequences \n     of domestic abuse within our communities. It burns our hearts \n     that many of the perpetrators, despite having close ties to \n     our tribal lands and communities, have no fear of punishment \n     because they are non-Indians and therefore fall outside the \n     jurisdiction of the local government--in this case, the \n     tribal government.\n       Please support S. 47 and oppose any efforts, including the \n     Coburn amendment (No. 13), which would deprive tribal \n     governments of critically needed authority to keep \n     reservations safe and protect Native women and other victims \n     of domestic abuse.\n       I have been taught that ``no nation is truly defeated until \n     the hearts of its women are on the ground.'' Native women \n     have strong hearts, but that strength is constantly \n     challenged by the high rates of domestic violence on many \n     Indian reservations. Of course, domestic violence is not \n     limited to women and it is not limited to adults. It has an \n     effect that passes down through the generations. We all dream \n     that our children can live and grow up in a safe place, with \n     loving adults. From such a foundation, our children will \n     create safe and healthy families of their own, free from the \n     scourge of domestic violence. It is well known that domestic \n     violence is a behavior that starts at one level and often \n     escalates over time to serious injury or even death. Tribes \n     need the authority to intervene in early incidences of \n     domestic violence, as well as at any other stage. Only by \n     doing this can we break the chain of domestic violence that \n     weighs down our communities.\n       The pending Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) \n     reauthorization (S. 47) presents an extraordinary opportunity \n     to address the startling lack of law enforcement response to, \n     and prosecutions for, incidences of domestic violence on \n     Indian reservations. After years of struggling with this \n     issue, those of us who live in Indian country have realized \n     that the answer does not lie with the Federal and state \n     governments, but with ourselves. We need to have in place \n     systems of justice that will put fear in the heart of those \n     who consider evil deeds, while also assure that all members \n     of our communities have their basic rights protected. To do \n     this, our Tribal courts must have authority to exercise \n     limited domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over all \n     individuals with close ties to tribal communities who commit \n     domestic violence offenses on Indian lands. Only at the local \n     level can we create the credible community expectations and \n     standards that will significantly reduce this crisis.\n       There have been calls for alternate answers to the issue of \n     domestic violence in Indian Country, but we who live there \n     and know the problem first-hand can see no solution, short of \n     tribal jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes, that will \n     truly deter predators and assure justice for domestic \n     violence victims. Indeed, the solution we seek--acknowledging \n     and strengthening the power of local jurisdictions to respond \n     to local problems--is one that is common throughout the \n     country to address issues of crime and violence and achieve \n     justice in the most effective manner possible.\n       From many conversations with both Republican and Democratic \n     Members of the Senate, I know that we all care deeply about \n     our family, friends, and loved ones and that we all want to \n     stop the scourge of domestic violence. In this, we have a \n     common humanity which rises above philosophical and political \n     differences. We appeal to the leadership and membership of \n     the Senate on the grounds of this shared humanity to reach a \n     compassionate solution that extends the most basic of legal \n     protections to all victims of domestic violence, no matter \n     where in the United States they happen to live, and that \n     empowers Tribal communities to enforce these values on their \n     lands.\n       In addition to opposing the Coburn Amendment (No. 13), USET \n     would urge you to support the Murkowski Amendment, which \n     provides important clarifications for Native Alaskans and the \n     Leahy Human Trafficking Amendment.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Brian Patterson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, any one of us can only imagine what it \nwould be like to be wrongly arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced \nto death for a crime we did not commit. And whatever we imagined would \npale by comparison to reality.\n  Kirk Nobel Bloodsworth, who I am privileged to call a friend, was the \nvictim of such a horrific miscarriage of justice. He served 9 years for \nthe rape and murder of a young girl he never met, based on the mistaken \nidentification by one of Kirk's neighbors.\n  Eyewitness identifications, assumed to be among the best evidence, \nare notoriously unreliable. Case after case demonstrates this. Take the \nmassive search currently underway for Christopher Dorner, the former \nLos Angeles police officer suspected in three killings. The police have \nbeen inundated with numerous false ``sightings.''\n  Kirk Bloodsworth is a free man today not because the justice system \nworked. For 9 years it failed miserably, and during that time the real \nkiller was free. Rather, he had to prove his innocence thanks to DNA \nevidence, which is not available in most cases. One shudders to think \nof the number of factually innocent people who may be serving long \nsentences for whom exoneration through DNA testing isn't an option.\n  A February 5, 2013, article in the New York Times quotes Kirk: ``The \nadversarial system doesn't know who's guilty or who's innocent. The \nmillstone doesn't know who's under it.'' That article, entitled ``A \nDeath Penalty Fight Comes Home,'' is notable because it describes the \ncampaign Kirk is helping to lead to abolish the death penalty in \nMaryland, the State where he was convicted and sent to death row.\n  Kirk is an example of someone who was subjected to the basest \nindignities and humiliation, and who then came back to inspire others \nto prevent future unjust convictions. It is the mark of a man of \nextraordinary character and courage, who deserves our praise and \nadmiration. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 5, 2013]\n\n                    A Death Penalty Fight Comes Home\n\n                            (By Scott Shane)\n\n       Annapolis, MD--Kirk Noble Bloodsworth, a beefy, crew-cut \n     man whose blue T-shirt read ``Witness to Innocence,'' took \n     the microphone in a church hall here and ran through his \n     story of injustice and redemption one more time. Twenty years \n     ago, he walked out of a Maryland prison, the first inmate in \n     the nation to be sentenced to death and then exonerated by \n     DNA.\n       About 60 activists against the death penalty listened with \n     rapt attention, preparing to descend on state legislators to \n     press their case. Maryland appears likely in the next few \n     weeks to join the growing list of states that have abolished \n     capital punishment. Some longtime death penalty opponents say \n     no one in the country has done more to advance that cause \n     than Mr. Bloodsworth. But ending executions in Maryland, the \n     state that once was determined to kill him, would be a \n     personal victory for him.\n       Even for proponents of capital punishment, Mr. \n     Bloodsworth's tale is deeply unsettling. In 1984, he was a \n     former Marine with no criminal record who had followed his \n     father's profession as a waterman on the Eastern Shore of \n     Maryland. A woman glimpsed on television a police sketch of \n     the suspect in the rape and murder of a 9-year-old girl \n     outside Baltimore. She thought it looked like her neighbor \n     Kirk, and she called the police.\n       From there, with the police and prosecutors under intense \n     pressure to solve the crime, it was a short route to trial, \n     conviction and a death sentence for a man whose Dickensian \n     name, after all, seemed to imply guilt.\n       ``I was accused of the most brutal murder in Maryland \n     history,'' Mr. Bloodsworth, now 52, told the church audience. \n     ``It took the jury two and a half hours to send me to the gas \n     chamber.''\n       Only after nine years in the state's most decrepit and \n     violent prisons did Mr. Bloodsworth, through his own \n     perseverance and some aggressive lawyering, manage to get the \n     still-novel DNA test that finally proved his innocence in \n     1993.\n       Even then, prosecutors publicly expressed doubt about his \n     innocence. ``Nobody knew what DNA was then--it was sort of \n     shaman science, a `get out of jail free' card,'' he said in \n     an interview. It took another decade--and, again, Mr. \n     Bloodsworth's own dogged efforts--before officials ran the \n     DNA from the murder scene through a database and identified \n     the real killer, who is now serving a life sentence. He bore \n     little resemblance to the description that the police had \n     compiled from eyewitnesses.\n       Mr. Bloodsworth said he kept pursuing the test to clear \n     himself once and for all, but also to find the killer of the \n     girl, Dawn Hamilton, who was found in the woods stripped of \n     clothing from the waist down, her head crushed with a piece \n     of concrete. ``This was a ghastly, horrific thing,'' he said.\n       Even after his release, Mr. Bloodsworth could never quite \n     escape the false charges that had threatened him with \n     execution. He tried to return, he said, to ``a normal life,'' \n     but he was haunted by what he had learned about the justice \n     system.\n       ``If it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody,'' \n     he said. He threw himself into work against capital \n     punishment and for justice reform, first as a volunteer \n     speaker and later as a professional advocate. Last month he \n     began work as the advocacy director for Witness to Innocence, \n     a Philadelphia-based coalition of exonerated death row \n     inmates who push to end capital punishment.\n       The movement to end the death penalty has garnered more \n     support from politicians and the public as it has shifted \n     from moral condemnation of capital punishment to a more \n     practical argument: that mistakes by witnesses and the police \n     inevitably mean that innocent people will be executed. While \n     DNA gets the limelight, of 142 prisoners sentenced to death \n     and then exonerated in the last 40 years, just 18 were freed \n     over DNA\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\n     evidence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center \n     in Washington.\n       Use of the death penalty has been steadily declining, and \n     17 states no longer have it on the books, with 5 of them \n     abolishing it since 2007, said Richard C. Dieter, the \n     center's executive director. Executions dropped to 43 last \n     year from 98 in 1999.\n       ``These innocence cases are the biggest single factor, \n     because it has spread doubt throughout the system,'' Mr. \n     Dieter said.\n       Mr. Bloodsworth, a tireless public speaker who has visited \n     state after state to lobby for repeal, handing out a 2004 \n     book on his case, called ``Bloodsworth,'' has used his own \n     experience to promote those doubts. ``I think no single \n     individual has changed as many minds as Kirk,'' said Jane \n     Henderson, the director of Maryland Citizens Against State \n     Executions, a lobbying group. ``He's articulate, patient, and \n     he's got a huge heart.''\n       His homespun eloquence has unmistakable appeal, but his own \n     tale is his most powerful argument. Prosecutors and jurors \n     ignored glaring problems with witnesses--two were boys who \n     did not pick Mr. Bloodsworth out of a lineup--and dismissed \n     five alibi witnesses who testified that he was home at the \n     time of the murder.\n       ``The adversarial system doesn't know who's guilty or who's \n     innocent,'' Mr. Bloodsworth said. ``The millstone does not \n     know who's under it.''\n       At the Maryland Penitentiary in Baltimore, he could stretch \n     out his arms and touch the sides of his cell. He stuffed \n     paper in his ears at night to keep the cockroaches out. His \n     skull was cracked by another inmate who swung a sock stuffed \n     with batteries. He was still locked up when his mother died.\n       After his release, he was pardoned and was paid $300,000 in \n     compensation by the state. But even as he worked for death \n     penalty abolition in other states, he became a regular \n     visitor to Annapolis, pressing legislators to learn from his \n     case. ``I'm a walking reminder for them,'' he said.\n       Delegate Barbara A. Frush, a Maryland legislator for 19 \n     years, said a visit from Mr. Bloodsworth two years ago \n     changed her mind about capital punishment, which she had long \n     favored. ``I sat across the desk from him and looked in his \n     eyes and listened to his story,'' she said. ``It sent shivers \n     down my spine. I thought, I can't take the chance that I \n     might send an innocent man to death.''\n       This week, for the first time, he had a private visit with \n     the longtime president of the State Senate, Thomas V. Mike \n     Miller Jr., who has decided to allow a floor vote on the \n     repeal bill. Mr. Bloodsworth left the meeting more optimistic \n     than ever.\n       From time to time, he has heard from the people who sent \n     him to prison. A juror got in touch to apologize. One of the \n     two lead homicide detectives sought him out; ``it seemed like \n     he wanted absolution,'' Mr. Bloodsworth said. One of the \n     prosecutors, S. Ann Brobst, who had called him ``a monster'' \n     at trial, insisted on driving to the Eastern Shore to give \n     him in person the news of the DNA hit on the actual murderer.\n       At the church hall, he turned from his own story to the \n     prospects for action in Maryland.\n       ``What do you smell?'' he bellowed.\n       ``Victory!'' the advocates yelled back.\n       ``It's time to close the case,'' Mr. Bloodsworth declared, \n     raising his arms in anticipation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/11/senate-section/article/S587-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING ROBERT S. TELLALIAN\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert \nTellalian--an attorney, community advocate, and beloved family member \nand friend, who brought joy to many in Connecticut. He was a true \ncommunity leader in a very timeless, enduring way--wisely guiding civic \norganizations, unstintingly contributing time and energy, and \nenthusiastically giving of his great spirit and good humor.\n  After helping the Goodwill of Western and Northern Connecticut to \nincorporate in 1951, Mr. Tellalian served on its board for many years. \nHe also connected with Goodwill's clients and staff personally on the \nfrontlines in quite another way. Donning a red suit and beard for the \nannual Goodwill Christmas party, he shared his good energy and holiday \nspirit with those who needed it the most--the poor and suffering and \nthe Bridgeport employees who had seen it all. He was given Goodwill's \nLeadership Award in 2011. And, as if he had planned it, he passed away \nthis past year on Christmas Day at age 91.\n  He earned a Soldier's Medal for Valor in World War II, fighting at \nthe Battle of the Bulge in the Army's 10th Armored Division, but \ninstead, chose to be remembered through seemingly minor but extremely \nmeaningful gestures of kindness and personal connection.\n  Mr. Tellalian was born in New Haven and raised in Bridgeport. After \nattending Yale University and the University of Connecticut School of \nLaw, he along with his brother, Judge Aram H. Tellalian, Jr., founded \nthe firm, Tellalian & Tellalian. The Tellalian's firm was a fixture in \nBridgeport, and Robert practiced family and estate law for his entire \ncareer. The firm later moved to Trumbull, where Mr. Tellalian continued \nhis involvement. This fact and many others demonstrate his uncommon \ndedication to tradition, intense loyalty for his community and the \npractice of law, and strong, authentic relationship with his brother \nand countless loved ones.\n  Throughout his life, he was intensely involved in a number of \ncharities and local organizations throughout Connecticut, especially in \nBridgeport and Easton. In addition to the Goodwill of Western and \nNorthern Connecticut, he was an active member of the Yale Club of \nEastern Fairfield County, the Bridgeport Area Foundation, and the \nUnited Way. He also served as the secretary of the Easton Senior Center \nBoard of Directors and the president of the Council of Churches of \nGreater Bridgeport.\n  Aside from his tremendous contributions to charity and community, Mr. \nTellalian would most like to be remembered, I believe, for his love of \nmusic. He had great pride for the Greater Bridgeport Symphony and the \njoy it added to Connecticut. He was a man who, in his role of chairman \nof the board, would greet patrons in the lobby of the concert hall for \ndecades. One time, when interviewed by the Connecticut Post, he \ncommented that the opportunity to guest-conduct the Symphony was ``the \nbiggest thrill of [his] life.'' Additionally, he was an avid acapella \nsinger, and treasured the memories he made with his barbershop \nquartet--the Eastonaires--with whom he performed throughout the State \nand country, even on the White House lawn during a Fourth of July \npicnic hosted by President and Nancy Reagan. And, for more than 50 \nyears, he sang in the church choir--most recently for the United \nCongregational Church in Bridgeport--where he and his wife, Jean, who \ndied this past November, were longtime congregants and celebrated their \n60th wedding anniversary.\n  Last month, the United Congregational Church hosted a musical \nmemorial service for Mr. Tellalian. Almost 100 singers and \ninstrumentalists gathered from around the region to volunteer their \ntime in tribute to a man they loved.\n  Robert Tellalian was generous of spirit and filled with compassion, \ndedicating much of his life to the happiness of others. He loved life, \nand lifted others up.\n  Today, I invite my colleagues to honor the life of a man who will be \ndeeply missed, but whose spirit of kinship will live on in all he \ntouched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/11/senate-section/article/S587-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S587-S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CONGRATULATING KONNER ROBINSON AND ANTHONY SCHRECENGOST\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize two of \nNevada's finest, Konner Robinson and Anthony Schrecengost, for being \nnamed Nevada's top two youth volunteers of 2013 by the Prudential \nSpirit of Community Awards. For 18 years, this nationwide award program \nhas partnered with the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals to honor outstanding acts of volunteerism.\n  Konner is a junior at Sage Ridge School in Reno, NV. He created a \nfund to provide grants to local schools to enable them to offer \ntechnology-based learning tools to financially disadvantaged students. \nKonner was inspired to start this project when he discovered one of his \nclassmates could not complete her physics homework because she could \nnot afford to buy a graphing calculator. I commend his commitment to \nproviding access to technology for all students. All Americans should \nfollow Konnor's lead and work to ensure our schools have the resources \nthey need to provide our children with the best education possible.\n  Anthony, an eighth grader at Sig Rogich Middle School in Las Vegas, \nNV, has been a committed volunteer for the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis \nNetwork, FAAN, for the past 3 years. He has been raising both money and \nawareness to help those who, like him, suffer from food allergies. \nAnthony's motivation to work on behalf of others who share his \ncondition is inspiring.\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  On behalf of the residents of the Silver State, I am proud to \nrecognize Konner and Anthony for their accomplishments and \ncontributions to our State. As Nevada's top two youth volunteers of \n2013, my hope is that Konner and Anthony will help serve as an example \nof the importance of volunteer work and service in our community. \nToday, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these two \nexceptional young Nevadans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/11/senate-section/article/S588-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 643(c) of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (Public Law 112-\n240), the Speaker appoints the following individuals on the part of the \nHouse of Representatives to the Commission on Long-Term Care: Ms. Judy \nBrachman of Bexly, Ohio, Mr. Stephen Guillard of Chatham, \nMassachusetts, and Ms. Grace-Marie Turner of Alexandria, Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/11/senate-section/article/S588-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S588-S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-294.

A bill to reduce the deficit and protect important programs \nby ending tax loopholes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am going to be joined fairly soon by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nLevin, to discuss the upcoming sequester and the impact the sequester \nwill have on this country if it is allowed to go forward. Chairman \nLevin has been pretty clear about this, as have our national security \nofficials on the defense\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nside. It is equally harsh on the nondefense side. But most important, \nit will be a real blow to the economy. The economists now are saying if \nwe let the sequester kick in as scheduled, it will cost us 1 million \njobs. One million Americans will lose their jobs because we let the \nsequester hit.\n  Other things--cuts to education; 70,000 young children kicked off of \nHead Start; 10,000 teacher jobs at risk; funding for up to 7,200 \nspecial education teachers and aides and staff could be cut. Food \nsafety--2,100 fewer food inspectors. Research--several thousands of our \nresearchers who are doing cutting-edge research in all sorts of areas \nfrom electronics to finding cures for diseases could lose their jobs. \nUp to 373,000 seriously mentally ill adults and seriously emotionally \ndisturbed children could go untreated at a time when we are talking \nabout the need for more treatment in the wake of the terrible tragedy \nin Newtown, CT. In law enforcement we could see a lowering of capacity \nequivalent to more than 1,000 Federal agents. Nutrition assistance--\n600,000 women and children would be dropped from the Department of \nAgriculture's nutrition programs. More than 100,000 formerly homeless \npeople, including veterans, would be removed from their current housing \nand emergency shelter programs because they would no longer be funded \nunder these cuts.\n  It is a deadly serious thing, the sequester that is coming at us. \nThere are much better alternatives. What I am doing today is filing two \npieces of legislation that would completely eliminate the sequester and \npay for the elimination of the sequester, not by running up the debt or \nthe deficit, but by repealing tax giveaways, giveaways in the Tax Code. \nOne of the bills would put in enough tax giveaways that we could get \nrid of the sequester for about a year, which would allow the budget \nprocess we are embarked on now to conclude and then we would be ready \nto go with the new budget and go forward in the regular order that way, \nletting the budget process drive the decision.\n  The other way is simply to get rid of the sequester for the full 10 \nyears, just get rid of it for once and for all; do it now and the other \nbill I proposed would do that. Both bills do this without raising \ntaxes, by going after tax giveaways, and by avoiding these kinds of \nDraconian defense and nondefense cuts that have been now--I guess \n``estimated'' is probably the right word but I think they are pretty \nconfident would cost America a million jobs. A million American \nfamilies would lose their paychecks because we did this.\n  The first point I want to make as I go about this is these tax \nexpenditures are no small thing. Here is what we collect through the \nincome tax every year from individuals: $1.09 trillion; round numbers, \n$1 trillion. Here is what we give away in tax deductions, loopholes, \ndifferent expenditures and deductions: $1.02 trillion. So on the \nindividual side what we pass through the Tax Code and back to people is \nalmost as big as what we actually collect.\n  When you look at the corporate income tax revenue, the corporate \nincome tax revenue is $181 billion in 2011. Here is what went back \nthrough to corporations in tax expenditures: $157 billion.\n  Another way to look at it is there is $2.1 trillion of tax liability \nin this country. One trillion dollars of it comes back to the \ngovernment in the form of actual revenues and another trillion of it \ngets distributed through the gimmicks and loopholes and deductions and \ntricks and so forth in the Tax Code. On the corporate side there is a \ntotal of $338 billion in tax liability, of which only $181 billion \nactually appears as revenue to the government, and the other $157 \nbillion gets distributed again because of tricks and gimmicks and \nloopholes and provisions in the Tax Code.\n  What some of our colleagues want us to do is say: Well, we raised tax \nrates once--just now. We raised them on only the wealthiest families in \nAmerica. We only raised them back to where they were under President \nClinton when the economy was booming, but we did that and we should \nlook no further.\n  The problem with that analysis is that only looks at the revenue that \nis actually collected. It doesn't look at the loopholes. It doesn't \nlook at the tax expenditures either on the individual side or on the \ncorporate side.\n  It is also worth noting that if we add these two up and we get $2.1 \ntrillion or, more likely on the corporate side, if we add these up and \nwe get $338 billion, there is more money out there which that doesn't \ncount. That is the money that never shows up for taxation in the first \nplace because it has been hidden in offshore tax refuges. People have \npretended their income is in funds in the Cayman Islands, and they have \npretended their intellectual property is in a five-person office in \nIreland. There are a lot of gimmicks by which a lot of the money never \neven gets into this calculation. When we look at the pain the sequester \nis going to cause, it makes a lot of sense to look at the tax \nexpenditures, which amount to a total of $1.17 trillion, and use that \nto offset.\n  Another thing worth looking at, just to remember where we are, is \nthat in the last 2 years on this question of reducing the deficit, we \nhave reduced the deficit by $2.4 trillion, and $1.7 trillion of that \ncame in spending cuts and $700 billion came in the form of new \nrevenues. In terms of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that \nlooks at both spending cuts and revenues, we are not balanced yet. We \nare nearly $1 trillion ahead on the spending cut side. So when \nRepublicans say we are only going to look at spending cuts going \nforward, they are not just saying that all those goodies in the Tax \nCode that go to wealthy individuals and corporations as tax deductions, \nloopholes, and expenditures are off limits, they are also saying that \nwe are going to make it even more unbalanced than it is now.\n  By the way, the way I get to $1.7 trillion is by taking $1.46 \ntrillion, which is the actual cuts, and then adding the interest \nsavings that are associated with it. And I take the same interest \nsavings on the revenue side, so it is even, the way we have allocated \nthe interest.\n  I see Chairman Levin is here, so I am going to yield to him when he \nreturns.\n  Let's look at one more graph while we are here. As we saw here, a lot \nof this is corporate tax expenditures. Every year there is $157 billion \nin corporate tax expenditures, which calls to mind, how are we doing in \nterms of a fair balance between individuals and corporations in the \nAmerican tax system? Well, we have done some research, and it turns out \nthat corporations are providing less and less of our revenues.\n  When we go back to 1935, this chart shows that for every $1 of \nrevenue the U.S. Government got from an individual, it got $1 from \ncorporations. It was 1 to 1--individuals $1, corporations $1. By 1948 \nit became 2 to 1. For every $1 that a corporation contributed to our \nNation's revenues, individuals had to kick in $2. In 1971 we had 3 to \n1--$1 from corporate America, $3 from individuals, regular Americans. \nBy 1984 that was up to 4 to 1--$1 from corporate, $4 from individuals. \nThe ratio as of 2011 is 6 to 1, which means the amount of tax burden \nindividuals in this country bear has climbed sixfold compared to \ncorporations meeting their responsibilities. One of the reasons is that \nso many American corporations are hiding money offshore and away from \nthe taxman. Now, whether these are the kinds of accounts we heard about \nduring the Presidential campaign, such as in the Cayman Islands and so \nforth, or whether it is locating intellectual property in some faraway \ncountry and using internal transactions to move revenue to avoid the \ntaxman over and over, Chairman Levin and his committee on \ninvestigations have looked into this and over and over again, and they \nhave shown this is a really strong area in which an enormous amount of \nmoney can be raised.\n  The problem with doing it the other way--going after Americans again \nand asking them to kick in even more in spending cuts rather than going \nafter the corporate high jinks in the Tax Code--is that leads us down \nthis path of austerity that Republicans have championed. The problem \nwith that austerity path is that when we get into a recession--as we \nhave been in--we should try to cut our way out of it. The problem with \nthat is it has not worked. We argued against that theory from the \nbeginning because it seems wrong, it doesn't make logical sense, and it \nruns against a lot of principles of economics.\n  Over and over again, our colleagues said: No, no, no. We just need to \ncut\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nour way out of this, and that will be our solution. When we get in \ntrouble with the economy, we cut spending.\n  That has proven to be a disaster. Where they have gone to austerity \nin Spain, the unemployment rate is 26.6 percent, and GDP growth is \nnegative. Their economy is actually shrinking. Greece has an \nunemployment rate of 26.8 percent, and their GDP growth is negative 6 \npercent. Their economy is shrinking even more rapidly. In Portugal, the \nunemployment rate is 16.3 percent, and the GDP growth is negative 3 \npercent. By comparison, the United States, although things are not \nright yet, is doing much better.\n  I see that the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nis here on the Senate floor, so I will yield at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Rhode Island, who has done \ngood work in trying to increase revenues, to close some of the \negregious loopholes which have allowed the draining of revenues to the \nTreasury.\n  A few moments ago, the Senator made reference to the offshore tax \nhavens as a way to avoid paying taxes. There was an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal--I don't know if my friend saw this article--about \npharmaceutical companies that were transferring intellectual property \nto Ireland to avoid paying taxes.\n  There was an earnings call by the chairman or the CEO of the Gilead \ncompany. He was telling investors and stockholders that there is a \nsignificant reduction in their tax liability because they had \ntransferred the intellectual property rights to a compound to deal with \nhepatitis C. He announced that the rights of the hepatitis C compound \nare now domiciled in Ireland. It is not that his company is domiciled \nin Ireland, it is that the intellectual property has been transferred \nto a company they own in Ireland. The intellectual property they used \nto own--it is still owned by them, of course, and is now a wholly owned \nsubsidiary, but the hepatitis C compound is now domiciled in Ireland. \nSo intellectual property is now shipped around the world to various \ndomiciles.\n  We have had hearings in our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \non the way in which tax revenue is lost to the Treasury and tax \nresponsibility is avoided by these transfers of intellectual property \nto those wholly owned shell companies that perform no economic function \nexcept tax avoidance. We have to end it, and we can end it. If we do \nend it, it will provide a significant amount of revenues for our \nTreasury.\n  Today, with Senator Whitehouse, I am introducing the Cut Unjustified \nTax Loopholes Act, or CUT Loopholes Act, which is S. 268. This bill \noutlines what I believe is a crucial element to the solution to our \nfiscal problems. It would raise revenues to reduce our deficits and \npreserve critical programs by cutting loopholes in our Tax Code that \nallow multinational corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid \npaying their fair share of the tax burden.\n  Now, we are just a few weeks away from sequestration, and the \nPresiding Officer has spoken very eloquently about what would happen if \nsequestration hits. This collection of mindless, across-the-board cuts \nis going to severely hurt our economy, it is going to undermine our \nnational security, and it is going to threaten programs vital to \nseniors, children, middle-class families, workers, and businesses. \nThese cuts, if they occur, will hurt every single American.\n  I have said repeatedly for more than 2 years that any deficit \nreduction effort must pass the test of balance. Balanced deficit \nreduction requires three elements: cuts to discretionary spending, \nadditional revenues, and entitlement reforms. As the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has pointed out, we have enacted $2.4 trillion in deficit \nreductions. The vast majority of the deficit reduction achieved so \nfar--more than $1.7 trillion--has come from spending cuts. So while \nfurther cuts may be necessary, we must renew our focus on the other two \ncategories: additional revenues and entitlement reforms. The CUT \nLoopholes Act can help us produce the required revenue. According to \nestimates in the Joint Committee on Taxation, this legislation would \nyield at least $189 billion in deficit relief.\n  I hope no Member of this body doubts the damage sequestration would \ndo to our Nation and to our people. The Congressional Budget Office \nwarned us just last month that the enactment of these cuts would likely \nreduce GDP growth by 1.25 percent. George Mason University economist \nStephen Fuller has estimated that these cuts in this year alone would \nreduce GDP by $215 billion and cost the jobs of over 2 million American \nworkers.\n  Tomorrow the Armed Services Committee is going to meet to hear from \nDefense Department officials and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \non the potential effects of sequestration on our national security. \nJust last week, in his final appearance before our committee as \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Panetta warned us of a ``readiness \ncrisis'' that would impair our forces' ability to respond to crises. \nSequestration will also prevent investments needed to protect us in \nemerging areas of concern, such as cyber security. It will threaten our \nability to keep faith with the most important national security asset \nwe possess: the men and women of our military and their families.\n  Secretary Panetta has pointed out that sequestration's ills will not \nbe limited to defense. In a speech last week, he said:\n\n       It is not just defense, it's education, loss of teachers, \n     it's child care . . . It's about health care, 700,000 women \n     and children will no longer receive nutritional assistance. \n     It's about food safety, it's about law enforcement, it's \n     about airport safety.\n\n  Today we are introducing the CUT Loopholes Act to protect those and \nother important priorities.\n  Over the last 50 years, Federal revenues have averaged approximately \n18 percent of GDP. Over that time, our budget has been balanced only a \nhandful of years. Each of those years that had a balanced budget, \nrevenues exceeded 19.5 percent of GDP, but in recent years revenues \nhave fallen off to about 15 percent of GDP.\n  One significant factor in our revenue shortfall is a massive plunge \nin the share of the stocks burden borne by corporations. Corporate tax \nrevenue amounted to as much as 7 percent of GDP in the 1950s, 2.7 \npercent of GDP just 7 years ago, and in 2012 it amounted to just 1.2 \npercent of GDP. Corporations today pay an average tax rate--a real \neffective tax rate--of 12 percent. How is that possible when the \nstatutory tax rate on corporations is 35 percent? Through loopholes in \nthe Tax Code is how it is possible.\n  One of the key abuses is when companies use these various gimmicks \nand tax loopholes to shift their assets offshore. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has spent more than a \ndecade investigating offshore tax loopholes. We have shown how \ncompanies such as Enron used offshore schemes to avoid billions of \ndollars in taxes. Just last year we showed how companies such as \nMicrosoft and Hewlett Packard used tax rules to avoid taxes on billions \nof dollars in income. These gimmicks cost us that much income even on \nproducts developed in the United States and sold in the United States \nto U.S. customers. They often do this by transferring intellectual \nproperty rights and other intangible property developed in the United \nStates to wholly owned subsidiaries and tax havens, thereby avoiding \nU.S. tax.\n  How big is the problem? According to the Congressional Research \nService, American multinationals in 2008 claimed to have earned profits \nin Bermuda amounting to 1,000 percent of Bermuda's GDP. Multinationals \nreported earning more than 40 percent of their offshore profits in five \ntax haven countries, despite the fact that just 4 percent of their \noverseas workforces and 7 percent of offshore investments were located \nin those five tax havens.\n  The CUT Loopholes Act will end abuse of so-called ``transfer \npricing'' agreements. It will allow companies to transfer revenue for \nproducts developed in the United States to tax haven countries. It \nwould strengthen enforcement tools so our tax authorities can \ninvestigate and rectify tax avoidance offshore. It would end the \ntaxpayer-funded subsidy to corporations for expenses in moving jobs and \noperating facilities overseas.\n  It would stop corporations from manipulating rules on foreign tax \ncredits to avoid taxes. It would end the ``check\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nthe box'' loophole that allows multinationals, by a stroke of a pen, to \ncloak offshore income from taxation.\n  Here at home, the CUT Loopholes Act would eliminate a loophole that \nallows large corporations to exploit what is in effect a Federal \nsubsidy that helps pay for the compensation awarded to their \nexecutives. When companies award stock options to their top executives, \nthey are allowed under law to record that expense in two totally \ndifferent ways--one for their books and one for tax purposes. They \nreport one amount to their investors on their annual financial reports, \nbut they can report a much larger expense--often orders of magnitude \nlarger--to the IRS and claim a tax deduction for that much larger \nclaimed expense.\n  One company, Facebook, used this loophole as part of its initial \npublic offering last year. Facebook will use this loophole to claim a \n$16 billion tax deduction. It would then seek a $\\1/2\\ billion tax \nrefund for taxes paid in past years, and then avoid taxes for up to as \nmany years into the future. That is just one company. The amount it \nshowed in its books for that same cost for executive compensation was \nabout 5 percent of what it told Uncle Sam the cost was, and then it was \nable to deduct a much larger cost--20 times as much of its income \ntaxes. So this legislation would end that. By the way, that was just \none company.\n  This legislation would also end two Wall Street tax loopholes. It \nwould end the derivatives blended rate loophole, which gives \npreferential tax treatment in the form of long-term capital gains rate \nfor speculative trades in certain derivatives--derivatives sometimes \nbought and sold in fractions of a second.\n  Now, we have to understand the amazing part of that is these \nderivatives that are sometimes sold in one-millionth of a second--\nbought and sold in one-millionth of a second--are given long-term \ncapital gains treatment. We can imagine the amount of money that is \ninvolved in that and the loss to the Treasury.\n  Another loophole the CUT Loopholes Act would address is in the energy \nsector. Because of a three-decade-old IRS decision, oil produced from \ntar sands, as opposed to traditional oil extraction, is not subject to \nthe tax that funds the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. If spilled into \nthe environment, oil produced from tar sands is just as damaging as oil \nproduced by other means, as residents along the Kalamazoo River in \nMichigan learned in 2010. Cleanup of that oil spill is still underway \nnearly 3 years later. Surely producers of oil from tar sands should \nhelp contribute to the costs of cleaning up these spills--ust like \nproducers of other oil must do.\n  The CUT Loopholes Act also would tighten rules that combat tax-\nshelter promoters, stiffen penalties on those who aid companies or \nindividuals who seek to shirk their fair share of the tax burden, \nstrengthen our ability to collect taxes from tax avoiders when we catch \nthem, and modernize the IRS tax lien process.\n  I know these issues can be complicated. But the American people are \nseeing through that complexity.\n  Americans support these reforms not just because of the great fiscal \nchallenges before us. People recognize that these loopholes are not \nfair. They are wrong in every sense that a policy can be wrong--wrong \nfiscally, wrong economically, wrong ethically.\n  Even if one disagrees with the American people, and sees these \negregious loopholes as somehow justified, how can one argue that \npreserving them is more important than avoiding the damage of \nsequestration? How are these loopholes more important than preventing a \nrecession caused not by the ups and downs of the economic cycle or by \nthe reckless behavior of financial speculators, but by sequestration?\n  I offer these ideas in the genuine belief that they can help bridge \nthe gap, and in the urgent belief that we cannot leave that gap \nunbridged. I urge my colleagues to adopt them for the good of the \nmillions of Americans whose prospects will dim if we cannot reach \nagreement.\n  I will close with this: There was a survey completed last month which \nshows that two-thirds of Americans believe corporations need to bear a \nlarger share of the tax burden. Eight in ten say closing corporate tax \nloopholes should be an important priority for Congress. Seventy-three \npercent approves of efforts to stop corporations and individuals from \navoiding taxes by shifting income offshore.\n  So this is what the survey shows:\n\n       Do you approve or disapprove of the following policies? \n     Prevent corporations from avoiding taxes when they award \n     executives millions in stock options: That is 73 percent. In \n     terms of closing loopholes, allowing corporations or the \n     wealthy to avoid U.S. taxes by shifting income overseas: That \n     is 63 percent.\n\n  By the way, that percentage applies across the board. Americans of \nall political persuasions agree with these points. Mr. President, 8 out \nof 10 Republicans--8 out of 10 Republicans--agree the amount of revenue \nwhich will be saved by ending these kinds of loopholes should go to \neither deficit reduction or to public investments, and only 11 percent \nbelieve the revenue should be used to reduce tax rates on corporations.\n  So I think we have to act to avoid sequestration. Senator \nWhitehouse's bill is directly aimed at that. Our bill, if we can get \nthis passed and get some of these loopholes closed, will clearly help \nto avoid sequestration. There is some overlap between the bills, but \nthe point is the same.\n  These loopholes are draining our Treasury. This is not like \nincreasing tax rates, to say we ought to close these kinds of egregious \nloopholes. These loopholes shouldn't be there. If we had a surplus, we \nought to close these loopholes. These loopholes have helped to shift \nthe burden in this country to middle-income families from corporations, \nand these corporations that avoid these taxes, in many cases, are \nextremely profitable corporations. It is an absurdity that we allow \nmoney to be drained from our Treasury to go to these offshore tax \nhavens where no or little taxes are paid.\n  We can end it. We can end that kind of loophole. We can close it, and \nwe can do a lot of good for our country, both in terms of avoiding \nsequestration in the short term, as well as to help reduce our deficits \nin the long term.\n  I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse again for the leadership he has \nshown and continues to show in this area. Some of these issues are \nextremely complex. We know that. One of the reasons they are difficult \nto end is that these loopholes are very difficult to explain. So we \njust hope our colleagues will follow the instincts of the American \npeople who know these tax havens are wrong.\n  We should put them out of business in terms of their drain on the \nAmerican Treasury, and we can do so. In fact, then-Senator Obama was a \ncosponsor of much of this legislation when he was in the Senate.\n  So I am going to close here, but I will again thank the Senator from \nRhode Island for the leadership he is showing for his bill, which I am \nproud to cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. I appreciate very much that he has signed on as a cosponsor \nof both my 1-year and full 10-year--9 now--sequestration alternatives \nthat avoid a calamity for our economy, the potential crash of 1 million \njobs, by looking exactly where Senator Levin suggests--at the tax \nloopholes.\n  As I showed a moment ago, it used to be, back in 1935, a ratio of 1 \nto 1 of dollars paid by individual Americans in taxes compared to \ndollars paid by corporations in taxes. Now it is 6 to 1--$6 out of a \nfamily's pocket for every $1. What has allowed America's corporate \nworld to lower their tax liability by so much--down to one-sixth of \nwhat it used to be relative to what regular Americans pay? Well, the \nbiggest chunk of it is all the money that flows out through the Tax \nCode. We have virtually the same amount flowing out through the Tax \nCode as we actually keep our hands on as revenue. So for $2 trillion in \ntax eligibility, half of that goes right back, on the personal side, \nand out here, it is $338 billion, and $157 billion that goes back. It \nnever sees the tax man. It goes straight back through the Tax Code.\n  Lobbyists have been here for years working on those loopholes and \nmaking sure different industries and interests get those benefits. That \nis where it\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\nall goes. That is why we are in a situation in which we have what the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan has talked about--all of these \ndisgraceful loopholes.\n\n  I echo his point of view. Now is an important time to do this because \nthe alternative, which is more spending cuts, pushes us down the \nausterity path that has failed in Europe and that is projected by the \nBipartisan Policy Center to cost us 1 million jobs. There is an \nalternative: to go after all of these tax loopholes which, as the \nchairman said--as Senator Levin said--we should be going after those \nanyway. They are just plain wrong on their own.\n  If we had a balanced budget, we should be going after them. It is \nsimply not fair. These are relics of power and lobbying and special \ninfluence and special pleading in the Tax Code, and we need to be rid \nof them. Now is a very good time to be rid of them to avoid pitching \nthe economy into recession.\n  I know my two pieces of legislation are not going to pass. We are not \ngoing to pass a bill that has the sequester 100 percent paid for by new \nrevenues from closing tax loopholes. I wish we would, but I know we are \nnot going to. My point in filing the legislation is to prove that it \ncould be done. It could readily be done. It could be done with pieces \nof legislation that Senators in this body have supported over and over \nand over again. So it is not necessary to walk into the fiscal band saw \nof sequestration: to have our national defense take the hit it is going \nto take; to have regular American families take the hit they are going \nto take; to have the economy, with 1 million jobs lost, take the hit it \nis going to take, all for what? To protect the big oil companies so \nthey can keep getting subsidies from the American people? Is that the \nchoice we want to make? So that a billionaire who puts his name on a \nmuseum gets more charitable tax bang for his charitable buck than a \nregular family when they just give money to their church every week? Is \nthat the stuff we want to protect at that cost?\n  That is the question we will have to answer. I am very grateful to \nthe chairman, Senator Levin. He has been working on this for years. His \nSubcommittee on Investigations has been looking into this in detail. \nHis legislation is a part of what I am proposing as one of the pay-\nfors. I look forward to continuing to work with him.\n  The American people have our back on this one. This is a starker \ncontrast between where the American people want to go and how to \nprotect them and our economy versus special interest politics in this \ntown that has carved out all of these loopholes that allow corporations \nto effectively cheat on their taxes. Effectively. It is not technically \ncheating because they have gotten the law written so it allows that \npractice. But if a person is a regular American who doesn't have a \nlobbyist to get them that same sort of treatment, it looks an awful lot \nlike cheating.\n  Let me close by saying if we go the other path--if we follow this \nausterity route we have seen to be so calamitous in Europe--here are \nsome quotes:\n\n       If the full sequester takes place as scheduled, 1 million \n     jobs may be lost.\n\n  That is the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n  Paraphrasing: Growth in real GDP would be about 1\\1/4\\ percentage \npoints different, depending on which path we choose.\n  We lose 1.25 percentage points GDP growth by hitting this sequester. \nThat is from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  If we look at the American Enterprise Institute, hardly a leftwing \ngroup:\n\n       An abrupt spending sequester at a rate of about $110 \n     billion per year--\n\n  Which is what we are looking at--\n\n     scheduled to begin March 1 could cause a U.S. recession.\n\n  Robert Frank, a very well regarded economics professor at Cornell, \nhas said:\n\n       The cuts scheduled are not a way to run a rational \n     government. Cuts of any kind at this time are not a good \n     idea. It is recessionary. It would slow growth for sure and \n     put people out of work.\n\n  Another organization not known for its leftwing views, the Wall \nStreet Journal, says this austerity method ``threatens to create a \nvicious cycle, as mass layoffs to meet budget targets spark a deeper \ncontraction, reducing tax revenue and increasing welfare costs as well \nas damping consumption.''\n  That is exactly what has happened in other places.\n  Look at what they say in England where they have done this. The \nconservative Daily Telegraph's Jeremy Warner describes what is going on \nover there. ``This is a truly desperate state of affairs. . . . We seem \nto have the worst of all possible worlds, with nil growth, some very \nobvious cuts in the quantity and quality of public services, but pretty \nmuch zero progress in getting on top of the country's debts.''\n  That is not the way we want to go. That is the wrong way to go. There \nis another way, and it is to look at that vast part of the Tax Code \nboth for corporations and, primarily, for wealthy individuals that \nallows literally nearly half of what would be tax revenue to flow back \nthrough the loopholes. That is where we should be doing our work. That \nis where we should be looking.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to respond to some of \nthe debate on the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I \nbelieve misstates the law and the content of the underlying bill \nspecifically as it relates to tribal court jurisdiction.\n  First of all, I start from the premise that tribal courts should be \nable to prosecute domestic violence cases that occur on tribal lands \ninvolving tribal members. The question is, Under what procedure--what \npractice--is it appropriate for them to attain jurisdiction over \nnontribal members who commit these acts of domestic violence whom they \nwish to prosecute in tribal courts? I am not here to question the \nintegrity of the tribal court system for tribe members. The only \nquestion on the table is whether tribal courts, under the law that \napplies to these tribal courts, is required to protect the \nconstitutional rights of nontribe members whom they seek to assert \njurisdiction over.\n  In order to protect constitutional rights, the Constitution as \ninterpreted by the Federal courts must be applied, and there must be an \nopportunity given to individuals who are prosecuted in these tribal \ncourts who are not tribal members to appeal to a Federal court if, in \nfact, they are convicted.\n  First of all, the distinguished Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, has said there is a right of removal to Federal court in the \nunderlying bill, and that is incorrect. There is no right of removal to \nFederal court in the underlying bill. However, in the amendment which I \nhad contemplated offering--which the distinguished bill manager, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, said is not acceptable to him--\nwould include a right of removal to Federal court under some \ncircumstances. So I want to correct the record: There is no right of \nremoval in the underlying bill to the Federal court that might \notherwise correct an unconstitutional provision.\n  Under the tribal court jurisdiction they operate under the Indian \nCivil Rights Act, which is, by definition, a statute and not the \nConstitution. So the rights provided to tribe members and nontribe \nmembers under the Indian Civil Rights Act are not constitutional \nrights. They don't incorporate the Bill of Rights of the U.S. \nConstitution which would be applicable to any American citizen tried in \nany State or Federal court. Since Indian or tribal courts claim to be \nsovereign and don't incorporate those constitutional rights, then \nAmerican citizens who are not tribal members who would be tried in \nthose tribal courts under the underlying bill would be \nunconstitutionally deprived of the protections of the Bill of Rights \nwhich they have by virtue of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Secondly, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, \nargues that habeas corpus protections are sufficient to vindicate the \nconstitutional rights of nontribal members, but that is not the case. \nHabeas corpus is a remedy which cannot be accessed until direct appeals \nare exhausted by definition. Since that is the case, under the \nunderlying bill, the maximum length of sentence an individual can be \ngiven under the Leahy bill is 1 year. So what would happen is an \nAmerican citizen, nontribe member, would be tried in a tribal court and \nwould wrongfully be deprived of their constitutional rights under the \nBill of Rights. Yet they could not vindicate those rights until such \ntime as they exhausted all direct appeals, and then habeas corpus would \nbe potentially available to them.\n  The only problem with that is it is very unlikely that would happen \nbefore they would have already served their sentence under the \nunderlying bill, which is a maximum of 1 year; thus, the habeas corpus \nremedy is illusory and is not real.\n  I hope that helps clarify some of the misunderstandings under the \nbill and my concerns about it. We start from the premise that domestic \nviolence on tribal lands is a serious problem. With the current \nsituation, these crimes are not deemed sufficiently serious for U.S. \nattorneys to typically prosecute these cases. They are serious cases. \nThey deserve to be prosecuted but only consistently with the U.S. \nConstitution. If the tribal courts wish to assert jurisdiction over \nnontribe members, the only way they should be allowed to do so is if \nthey incorporate the protections of the Bill of Rights. That is \nsomething I have proposed to the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, which he has rejected.\n  We also have to have a means for an appeal to a Federal court if a \nnontribe member is convicted in a tribal court. That is not in the \nunderlying bill. It strikes me as somewhat bizarre to have a remedy \nwhich is in the form of my amendment which would confer on tribal \ncourts the requirement that they incorporate the provisions of the Bill \nof Rights when a nontribe member is being tried in a tribal court and \nthat a right to an appeal to a Federal court also be included. That \nwould remove the constitutional objection to the assertion of tribal \ncourt jurisdiction over nontribe members, but this has been rejected \nfor some reason that escapes me.\n  Our only remedy is to go to the House of Representatives once this \nbill passes the Senate--and it will. Ironically, this is a bill that \nhistorically has passed with unanimous agreement--Democrats, \nRepublicans alike. It has not been a political bill. Apparently, in a \ndesire to make it a political statement and to somehow suggest that \nsome people don't believe we ought to prosecute violence against women \nin tribal courts, an erroneous argument has been made by two Senators, \nwhom I mentioned here, which I hope my statement has corrected. We \ndon't need to go there. There is a commonsense solution, but \nunfortunately it has been rejected by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Our only recourse is to take the Senate bill and reconcile \nit with a bill that will be passed by the House of Representatives, \nwhich I hope will fix this provision and have it resolved in conference \nin a way that protects victims of domestic violence on tribal lands \nwhen perpetrated by nontribe members and when those nontribe members \nare tried in tribal courts.\n  I know that sounds a little convoluted, but it is an important \nconstitutional right we are talking about, and I am amazed that such a \nsimple solution, which is right at hand, is being rejected in favor of \ntrying to make some kind of political statement that some Members don't \ncare as much as\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\nothers do about vindicating the rights of victims of domestic violence \non tribal lands.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/11/senate-section/article/S596-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
