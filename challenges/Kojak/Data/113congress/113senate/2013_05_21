Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I called home to check \nto see how things were going, visited with my wife a little bit.\n  She said: You can't imagine what I am watching on TV. It is hard to \nwatch.\n  She was talking about the terrible storm that hit Oklahoma, the \ndevastation and deaths, the injuries. She tried to explain to me. It \nwas hard to relate even though she was watching it on TV. Homes were \ndestroyed, schools were destroyed, even elementary schools were \ndestroyed.\n  I think what Landra did was she described how all of America feels \nand felt upon watching it. Our hearts go out to the families whose \nloved ones were lost. The extent of that we don't know. We are still \nwaiting. Those missing in the devastating tornadoes in Oklahoma, we \nfeel so sad for them. Our thoughts are with those who were affected by \nthis tragedy, and so many people have been affected. Families are still \nsearching for their family members, their children.\n  I recognize and commend the heroic efforts of the first responders \nwho rushed to the scene and have been working tirelessly to help those \nwho were injured. They worked all night. Of course, they are still \nsearching for the missing. I commend the efforts of neighbors, everyday \ncitizens, young and old, who have been heroic in helping.\n  Although we may not know the extent of the damage now, we will \ncontinue to do everything in our power to help the people of Oklahoma \nas they recover from these terrible tornadoes, these acts of nature. I \nwill stand vigilant today and tomorrow, ready to help as more storms \nthreaten the region.\n  Every Federal resource will be made available to help the communities \naffected by this tragedy. I look forward to hearing the President--his \nspeech will start momentarily--on the disaster. I am pleased that FEMA \nAdministrator Craig Fugate is already in Oklahoma assessing the extent \nof the damage and deciding how the Federal Government can best assist.\n  I will continue to monitor the search and rescue efforts. Whenever \ntragedy strikes any part of our Nation, it really strikes us all. I \npledge to the people of Oklahoma my continued support, our continued \nsupport, as they begin to recover from this awful storm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3633-7", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we are all thinking today about the \ntragic loss of life in Oklahoma yesterday, so this morning I would like \nto take a moment to express my condolences to all who lost family and \nfriends in this horrible disaster. It has been a truly heartbreaking \nloss of life--dozens injured and killed yesterday, including many \nchildren. The tornado that tore through Moore flattened entire \nneighborhoods and destroyed at least two elementary schools--Briarwood \nand Plaza Towers--just as students were about to be released for their \nlast week of school before the summer recess. I don't think any of us \ncan comprehend the searing grief of their parents. I am told that two \ncrews from the Louisville Red Cross recently left for Oklahoma to help \nthose who are now suffering.\n  Kentuckians understand the terrible toll these storms can take. Just \nlast March I toured the wreckage after a deadly tornado in West \nLiberty, KY, where churches, businesses, and schools were reduced to \nrubble and where several Kentuckians lost their life. I remember full \nwell the tornado that went through my hometown of Louisville back in \nthe 1970s. It knocked down every house on my parents' street. My mother \nwas in the basement, and mercifully it skipped over our house for some \nreason but leveled all the houses across the street and the ones next \ndoor. It is very hard to accurately describe the devastation a storm \nsuch as this leaves in its wake.\n  As first responders continue to dig through the rubble in Moore, I \nfear we will hear a lot more bad news in the days ahead. That said, I \nam sure we will also hear stories of hope and self-sacrifice, as we \nalmost always do when tragedies such as this strike--of strangers \nshielding strangers, of neighbors helping others rebuild, of volunteers \nworking through the night to sift through the debris to find survivors.\n  As we have seen time and time again in recent years, Americans are at \ntheir best when called upon to help each other in tragic circumstances, \nand this circumstance can hardly be more tragic. So we in the Senate \noffer our heartfelt prayers to those affected by this terrible storm. \nWe offer our gratitude to the first responders. We offer our \nencouragement to Governor Fallin and the many Federal, State, and local \nofficials who are working hard to assist in the recovery and who will \naid in the rebuilding of homes and schools and families and lives.\n\n\n                      Welcoming Burma's President\n\n  Later this morning the majority leader and I will welcome the leader \nof Burma, Thein Sein. He will be here to discuss the reform in that \ncountry and our bilateral relationship. Later today I will have more to \nsay about the reform movement in Burma.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3634-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are now going to resume discussion on the farm bill, \nbut before doing that I see one of the distinguished members of our \ncommittee on the floor who I know would like to make some other \ncomments. But I just wish to thank her in advance for her leadership. \nWe are so excited and pleased to have the Senator from North Dakota on \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  Having had a chance to be in North Dakota--and she has said it to me \na thousand times, so it is burned into my memory--90 percent of the \nland in North Dakota is in agriculture, and so she reminds me of that \nevery day. She has been a key person in helping us bring this farm bill \nto the floor. So before proceeding on the Agriculture Reform, Food and \nJobs Act, I would ask that Senator Heitkamp be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Brad Hejtmanek\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, on the floor of the Senate Senators \noften come to praise a local university football team that just won a \nchampionship or a famous coach who is retiring or maybe even a famous \npolitician who has passed away. Today I come to the floor of the Senate \nto thank a man who will never be written about in the history books or \neven known outside of my small hometown of Mantador, ND. Brad \nHejtmanek's life and his accomplishments were pretty modest by national \nstandards, but nevertheless, for the people of my small hometown, Brad \nwas something special.\n  Brad was a standout high school athlete, a veteran, a softball coach, \na National Guardsman, a coworker, a husband, a father, a gardener, and \na friend. For most of his adult life, Brad was the mayor of Mantador--\nnot exactly the most glamorous of jobs. Mantador runs exclusively on \nvolunteer labor.\n  For years he made sure the city water and sewer were working, the \nChristmas tree got decorated, that barking dogs were attended to, that \nthe garbage got picked up, the roads got fixed, and abandoned lots did \nnot get overrun with weeds and junk.\n  For years Brad got to do the great ceremonies incumbent of a small-\ntown mayor. For example, after I was elected attorney general of North \nDakota, Brad presented me with the key to the city. This was no \nceremonial key; it was the real deal. I wondered for months after \ngetting that key what that key actually opened, until one day I got a \ncall from Brad asking me if I could send the key back. You see, the key \nwas actually to the town dump and spring cleaning was coming. But that \nwas Brad.\n  You can't look anywhere in Mantador and not see his impact. One can \ngo to the small ballpark and remember that Brad organized the National \nGuard to come and clean out the old grove of trees, look to the large \nVFW and remember that Brad recruited folks to come and help build it, \nlook to the fire hall and remember the games of pickup baseball we \nplayed when we were kids, look to the Mantador grade school and \nremember that Brad was the kid who always took the dare, the kid who \nalways organized the pickup football games, and that every kid in grade \nschool knew the lyrics to the ``Marine Corps Hymn'' because Brad made \nsure at every choir practice we sang it not only once but twice.\n  Men and women such as Brad Hejtmanek are the unsung heroes of our \ndemocracy. They step up and volunteer when their country and their \ncommunity need them. They are friends when a person needs a friend, and \nthey never forget where they came from. So even though he will never \nhave a chapter in a history book, he will always have a place in the \nhearts of the people of Mantador. In my book that is an honor \nunequalled.\n  Thank you, Brad, for all you did for your country and your small \ntown. Godspeed, my friend. I and all of Mantador will miss you.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his obituary printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          Bradley C. Hejtmanek\n\n       Bradley C. Hejtmanek, 59, of Mantador, ND passed away \n     Thursday, May 16, 2013 at Sanford Health in Fargo, ND, \n     surrounded by his family and friends. Funeral mass will be \n     Tuesday, May 21, 2013 at 10:30 a.m. at Sts. Peter & Paul \n     Catholic Church in Mantador, ND with Fr.

He attended \n     school in Mantador and graduated from Hankinson in 1972. He \n     earned his associate degree from Chaminade University, \n     Honolulu, Hawaii in 1976.\n       Brad was very active in Mantador & the surrounding area. He \n     enjoyed all sports, especially the Twins, Vikings, Wild & UND \n     hockey. He enjoyed time spent with family & friends, reading, \n     t.v. & of course, popcorn.\n       He is survived by his wife, Karen, 2 sons, Doug (Chaska \n     Guemmer) & Jason (Bri Huotari), granddaughter, Aubrey, 2 \n     brothers, Richard (Ann), Jay (Denise), a sister, Joy (Mike) \n     Schreder, several nieces & nephews, father-in-law, George \n     Thompson, 2 brothers-in-law, Terry (Kathy) Thompson & Brian \n     Thompson.\n       He was preceded in death by his parents, brother, Douglas, \n     nephew, Joseph & mother-in-law, Janice Thompson.\n       Frank Family Funeral Home, Hankinson, ND is in charge of \n     the arrangements.\n       In-line guestbook: www.frankfamily\n     funeralhome.com\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Order for Moment of Silence\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I would I ask unanimous consent \nthat at 12 noon today the Senate observe a moment of silence for the \nvictims of the tornado in Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we know we have other colleagues who \nwill be coming to the floor to talk about the very important jobs bill, \nreform bill, and food bill we have in front of us--a conservation bill \nas well--but I just wish to take a moment to say to our colleagues, if \nthere are amendments they have, as we are moving through the bill--and \nwe are doing our best to finish this by the end of the week or \ncertainly get as close as we can--we are very interested in working \nwith colleagues to get to their amendments. We would appreciate it if \nthey would let us know what they are and bring them down so we can be \nworking with them on any of their amendments.\n  We are very proud of the product we have in front of the Senate right \nnow. There are 16 million people who work in agriculture. I would say \nthat is a jobs bill. I think it is probably the biggest jobs bill we \nwill have in front of the Senate--agricultural jobs directly with those \nwho are producing the food, who are producing the equipment for our \nfood, and who are doing all the pieces around food production and \nprocessing and the efforts in trade around the globe, where we are \nproud to say agriculture is No. 1 in creating a trade surplus for our \ncountry. Other countries are looking to us. There are 7 billion mouths \nto feed in the world today, and American agriculture is at the front of \nthe line feeding families and supporting efforts around the globe. We \nknow that number is growing every day and the leadership of American \nagriculture is going to be even more important in that process.\n  We also know this is a bill that conserves our land, our water, our \nair, and our forests. This is the piece of legislation that focuses on \nconservation for working lands--lands that are owned by someone in this \ncountry, which is the majority of land, and there are incredibly \nimportant partnership efforts that go on. The farm bill improves 1.9 \nmillion acres of fish and wildlife habitat. That is why our \nconservation title is supported by over 650 conservation and \nenvironmental groups all across the country.\n  We have the same conservation title we had last year, and I am very \npleased to say the House also has adopted the structure of reform we \nhave in our bill. It is very similar in the House and Senate bills on \nconservation, and so this is a real landmark piece of legislation as it \nrelates to preserving our soil, our land, our water, our air, and our \nforests, and it is a commitment we make as Americans to future \ngenerations.\n  We have also added in this legislation a commitment brought to us by \nthe commodity farm groups and environmental and conservation groups to \nmake sure, when farmers are using critically needed tools such as crop \ninsurance--which is the mainstay for farmers now, buying crop insurance \nand hoping, in fact, they do not have to get a payout because it means \nthey have had a loss or a disaster; that it is now the foundation of \nwhat we are doing to support farmers across the country--they have \nagreed to tie compliance for conservation practices to crop insurance, \nwhich is a very important policy. This is a historic agreement between \nagricultural groups and conservation and environmental groups. As a \nresult of their agreement and their urging, we have added that to this \nbill, which is a very significant addition and strengthens what we are \nalready doing on conservation.\n  We make a strong nutrition commitment to families. We make sure every \nfamily who currently qualifies for nutrition assistance in our country \ncontinues to receive that assistance. We create savings by looking at \nareas where there has been abuse or misuse by a few States on one \npolicy and by individuals or retailers in other areas and we tighten \nthat up so we have more integrity in the process. We make it clear we \nstand with families who need help; we stand with families who find \ntheir own personal disaster because of the economy, just as we stand \nwith farmers for a strong crop insurance program when a farmer has a \ndisaster as well, but we do make sure there is integrity in the \nprograms, which is very important.\n  We have had at least two cases in Michigan where two people won the \nlottery and continued on food assistance--pretty outrageous. And we \nmake sure that cannot happen again. There have been abuses in other \nareas, where retailers have allowed people to turn in their food \nassistance cards for money for drugs or other illegal activities, and \nwe make sure we clamp down on that. We have gone through the bill and \nwe address misuse, waste, fraud, and abuse in every part of the farm \nprograms but certainly in this area as well. So we can stand before our \ncolleagues and say this is about making sure folks who have worked all \ntheir lives, who have paid taxes all their lives, who suddenly find \nthemselves, through no fault of their own, in a situation where they \nneed some temporary food help are able to get that help for their \nfamily.\n  The good news is those dollars--that part of the farm bill--are \nactually decreasing. The costs are going down and not because we are \ncutting back on support for families but because the economy is \nimproving, so more people are going back to work and don't need the \ntemporary help. That is the way we should be reducing the costs, and \nthat is in fact what we do.\n  I am also very pleased with the fact we focus on rural development \nand reforms that are very significant and very important. Right now, \nthere are actually 11 different definitions of the term ``rural.'' We \nhad local mayors and county supervisors and village residents come to \nus and say: We appreciate the fact that rural development funds allow \nus to provide financing for our businesses and water and sewer projects \nand housing projects and road projects, but could you just give us one \ndefinition, rather than trying to figure out 11 different ways to \ndefine rural. It may sound simple, but it wasn't simple. But we did \nactually get it down to one definition, and we have streamlined the \nprocess and the paperwork so communities, small towns, and folks who \nsupport and need rural economic development help can get that with a \nminimal amount of paperwork.\n  We have done that through this entire bill. Frankly, I truly believe \nthat if, in every part of government, we did what we have done in \nagricultural programs, we would not only be doing what the public wants \nbut we would balance the budget. We have 100 different programs or \nauthorizations we have eliminated because they didn't make sense \nanymore. They were duplicative, not wise spending for taxpayers--things \nsuch as direct subsidy payments for farmers that did not make sense, \ncutting from 23 conservation programs to 13 and putting them\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nin 4 different subject areas with a lot of flexibility so we can \nstretch it out and get more bang for our buck and do a better job \nwithout in any way reducing the commitment to conservation.\n  We have gone through the entire farm bill and made tough decisions, \nsmart decisions. We have saved about $24 billion--more than even we did \nlast year--while having a set of policies that is broadly supported in \nthe conservation community and the agricultural community and the \nenergy community and those who represent small towns across this \ncountry. We did it, again, by making tough decisions and by working \ntogether on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am proud that even though these arbitrary, across-the-board cuts \ncalled sequester, cuts that make no sense--even though those cuts would \nrequire $6 billion in cuts in agricultural programs, we have been \nwilling, voluntarily, to come up with four times that level of cuts. We \nask for your support for a set of policies that works better, that \nstreamlines the system, that cuts back on that which does not make \nsense to do but strengthens the priorities that are important for \neconomic growth, for families, for conservation, for communities all \nacross this country.\n  We are willing and have done our part to step up and meet the \nchallenges of deficit reduction, of balancing our Federal budget, but \nkeeping our commitment to our farmers and ranchers who have the most \nrisky jobs in the world. As I said yesterday, nobody else has to worry \nabout whether it is going to rain or not rain--too much rain, no rain; \nwhether it is going to freeze, as it did in northern Michigan after the \ncherry blossoms came on the trees and the freeze wiped everything out.\n  Nobody else is in a business where they cannot control the most \nimportant factor, which is the weather. We have certainly seen the \nhavoc the weather has played on families across this country, including \nwhat happened yesterday in Oklahoma.\n  We stand here proudly to say we support an effort that is creating \nreform, that is saving money, that is standing up for the folks who \nhave helped create the most affordable and safest food supply in the \nworld--America's farmers and ranchers. We stand here supporting \nAmerican families who need to make sure that when times are tough the \nvery best of America's values are in place, which is to make sure they \nhave the ability to put food on the table for their families.\n  I believe we have others who will be coming to the floor. At the \nmoment I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that following a moment of \nsilence at noon today, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nCantwell amendment No. 919; that upon disposition of the Cantwell \namendment, Senator Gillibrand be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We are also working on a Sessions amendment No. 945, \nwhich we had hoped to line up as well. I understand there is an \nadditional modification being made. If that modification is agreeable \nto both sides, it is our intention to adopt that amendment, as \nmodified, prior to the caucus meetings.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \nmoment of silence for the victims of the tornadoes in Oklahoma.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 919\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 919, offered by the Senator from Washington, \nMs. Cantwell.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me indicate that this amendment would require \ntribes to be included in the development of Resource Conservation Act \nappraisals. It is something that is supported by Senator Cochran and \nme.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to join my effort to fight off the proposed $4 billion worth \nof cuts to SNAP, better known as food stamps.\n  I ask that my amendment, No. 931, be called up for a vote at a time \ndetermined by the manager of the bill.\n  When Congress proposes to cut the food stamp program, it is not a \nnameless, faceless person looking for a handout who suffers--it is \nhungry children, hardworking adults, seniors on fixed incomes, \nveterans, active-duty servicemembers fighting our wars, and the \nfamilies who stand by them.\n  I heard from a single mom in Queens, working full time at a \nsupermarket, doing all she could to make ends meet but still struggles \nin this very tough economy. Her son came home one day from school with \na bag in his hand and told her he saved his lunch for their dinner, and \nthat he asked his best friend if he could have his sandwich to bring \nhome for his brother. Obviously that mother broke down in tears. She \nneeds food stamp assistance.\n  I heard from a senior in Washington Heights in New York City. She \nreceives a limited fixed income, not enough to live on. She relies on \nSNAP to pay for food and for some peace of mind. Without that help, \nputting food on the table will become impossible.\n  I have heard from veterans all across the country who are making \ntheir voices heard to prevent these cuts, such as one very brave \nveteran from Colorado Springs. He served in Iraq, but was declared \nmedically unfit to continue his service. He was released from the \nmilitary and returned home. As he was looking for a job and waited for \nthe VA to activate his benefits, he relied on SNAP to help his family \nmake ends meet. Going from active duty to food stamps, he described, \nwas a culture shock. It was never his plan to go on food stamps. \nWithout that little bit of support, this veteran, his wife, and his \nchildren would have needlessly suffered. Today he is back on his feet \nworking full time, but the program was there for him when he needed it, \nas it should be.\n  These are the people who rely on this critically needed assistance to \nput food on the table and who stand to lose if Congress follows through \nwith these deep cuts to SNAP. Half of all food stamp recipients are \nchildren, 8 percent are seniors, and 1.4 million veteran households \nreceive food stamps. There are some of you here who would have us \nbelieve that these children, seniors, and veterans are gaming the \nsystem just to take advantage of taxpayers. The fact is, it is less \nthan 1 percent of every dollar that goes into this program that is \nwasted, less than 1 percent is evidence of fraud. Imagine if we had \nthat level of efficiency anywhere else in government.\n  In fact, SNAP keeps our economy moving. This money goes straight to \nthe grocery stores, the store clerks, the truckers who haul the food, \nand producers all across the country. Sixteen cents of every SNAP \ndollar actually goes right back to the farmer who grew the crop, \naccording to the USDA. When we cut $4 billion from SNAP, it means there \nis $90 less a month going to half a million households. To folks in \nthis Chamber, $90 a month may not seem like a lot of money, but for a \nstruggling family that is a week's worth of groceries. Imagine telling \nyour children they can't eat the last week of every month. Imagine \ntelling your child at night when he says to you: Mommy, I am still \nhungry, that there is nothing you can do about it.\n  As a mother, as a lawmaker, watching a child, a senior, and a brave \nveteran going hungry is something I will not stand for, and neither \nshould anyone else in this body. Clearly we have to reduce the debt and \nthe deficit, but hardworking parents, their children, seniors, troops, \nand veterans are just trying to keep the lights on, trying to make ends \nmeet, trying to put food on the table. They did not spend this Nation \ninto debt, and we should not be trying to balance the budget on their \nback. They deserve better from us. These are the wrong priorities for \nAmerica.\n  Instead, the amendment I am proposing would reduce a real source of \nwaste in this budget, and that is corporate welfare for large \ncorporations that do not need it, including insurance companies that \nare based in Bermuda, Australia, and Switzerland.\n  My amendment already has the support and advocacy of a third of this \nbody. Thirty-three Senators have signed a letter saying do not cut food \nstamps, because it protects half a million struggling Americans who too \noften do not have a voice in Washington when they desperately need it. \nIt makes modest cuts to an already overgenerous corporate welfare \nsystem. It is common sense. Standing by those who are suffering is the \ncore. It is a core value of who we are as Americans.\n  If it is in your heart, and if you believe feeding hungry children is \nthe right thing to do, then stand with us. Stand with America's \nveterans. Stand with the AARP and America's seniors. Stand with \nstruggling families and children all across this Nation. Let's keep \nfood on the tables of people who need it. When we do, America will be \nstronger, and this body will be stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3637-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            Cost of Gasoline\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I will hold off asking that the pending \namendment be set aside until the manager is here. At this time I will \naddress an enormously important national issue, an issue even more \nimportant to rural America; that is, the skyrocketing cost of gasoline \nat the pump, and oil in general, which is causing enormous hardship for \nthe American consumer, small businesses, truckers, airlines, and fuel \ndealers.\n  The bottom line is in Vermont and all over this country people are \npaying an arm and a leg for a gallon of gas and for home heating oil, \nand it is a very serious economic problem for the individual consumer \nand for the entire economy at large. In fact, as we continue to \nstruggle to get out of this terrible recession, high oil and gas prices \nare enormously detrimental to the entire economic recovery process.\n  These rapidly increasing prices are particularly harmful to rural \nAmerica where working people often are forced to travel 50 to 100 miles \nto their jobs and back. If people are paying $3.80 for a gallon of gas, \nthat adds up, and it is money coming right out of their wallets.\n  Over the last 5 months the national average price for a gallon of \ngasoline\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nhas gone up by more than 41 cents at the pump, even--and this is the \nimportant point to make--as U.S. oil inventories reach a three-decade \nhigh, and demand for gasoline is lower than it was 4 years ago when \nprices averaged less than $2.30 a gallon. In other words, what we \nlearned in elementary school about supply and demand and pricing--the \nfoundation of capitalism, if you like--is when there is a lot of supply \nand limited demand, prices should go down. Right now, there is a lot of \nsupply, less demand, and prices are going up, and I think we need to \nknow why because this impacts our entire economy and millions and \nmillions of consumers.\n  Our goal must be to do everything we can to make sure oil and gas \nprices are transparent and free from fraud, manipulation, abuse, and \nexcessive speculation. Let the principles of supply and demand work. \nLet's eliminate fraud, manipulation, abuse, and excessive speculation, \nwhich is exactly what we are experiencing right now.\n  That is why I will be offering two important amendments that deal \nwith these issues. Both of these amendments are within the jurisdiction \nof the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, which is \nobviously why I am offering them on this bill.\n  The first amendment, No. 963, requires the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, CFTC, and the Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group to \nconduct a 6-month investigation to determine whether any company or \nindividual in the United States has manipulated the price of gasoline, \ncrude oil, heating oil, diesel fuel, or jet fuel. Such an investigation \nis already taking place by regulators in Europe.\n  On May 14, 2013, just 1 week ago, the European Commission announced \nit was investigating allegations that several companies--including BP, \nShell and Statoil--``may have colluded in reporting distorted prices to \na Price Reporting Agency to manipulate the published prices for a \nnumber of oil and biofuel products.''\n  I know Ron Wyden, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, is also looking at this issue--perhaps in a slightly \ndifferent way--and I applaud him for doing that. But this amendment \nbasically says right now the European Commission believes there may be \nfraud among the major oil companies. If that is true in Europe, it may \nwell be true in the United States. So I want the CFTC to investigate \nthat as well.\n  Amendment No. 963 requires the CFTC to work with European regulators \nto determine if any company or individual in the United States provided \ninaccurate information to a price reporting agency for the purpose of \nmanipulating the published prices of gasoline or oil; secondly, to \nrefer any illegal activities to the proper authorities for prosecution; \nthird, to report its findings within 6 months; and lastly, to publish \nrecommendations on its Web site on how to make sure the pricing of \ngasoline, crude oil, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel becomes \nmore transparent, open, and free from manipulation, fraud, abuse, or \nexcessive speculation.\n  The third largest oil company in Europe has estimated that as much as \n80 percent of all crude oil product transactions are linked to prices \npublished by Platts, a private price reporting agency, while just 20 \npercent are linked to trades on the New York Mercantile Exchange or ICE \nFutures in Europe. In order to calculate prices, Platts depends on oil \ncompanies and Wall Street speculators to voluntarily provide details on \nbids, offers, and transactions for various crude oil and petroleum \ncommodities.\n  So that is one of the issues we want to take a hard look at to make \nsure we end those manipulations. The other issue I want to take a hard \nlook at is the issue of speculation on the oil futures market. What we \nknow right now is, according to the CFTC, approximately 80 percent of \nthe oil futures market is controlled not by end users--not by fuel \ndealers, not by airline companies, not by people who actually use \nfuel--but by Wall Street speculators. So that is the issue my second \namendment deals with.\n  This amendment addresses an issue that was not satisfactorily \naddressed in Dodd-Frank, where we attempted to deal with the issue of \nexcessive speculation on the oil futures market. Amendment No. 964 \nrequires the CFTC to use all of its authority, including its emergency \npowers, within 30 days to address this very important issue.\n  Once again the American people are at their wits end in trying to \nunderstand why oil prices go up despite the fact we have sufficient \nsupply and lack of demand. I am not just speaking for myself but many \neconomists also when I say I believe one of the major reasons for this \nsignificantly high price has to do with speculation--speculation on \nWall Street.\n  This amendment requires the CFTC to use all its authority--again, \nincluding its emergency powers, which is not what we have done in the \npast--within 30 days to do the following: to implement position limits \nto eliminate, prevent, or diminish excessive oil speculation as \nrequired by the Dodd-Frank Act, and to immediately curb excessive oil \nspeculation to ensure that oil and gas prices are based on the \nfundamentals of supply and demand.\n  As I mentioned earlier, price is supposed to be determined by the \namount of supply and the amount of demand. Supply now is very high, \ndemand is relatively low, and so we should be seeing a decline in oil \nprices rather than an increase. Further, the International Energy \nAgency recently projected the global supply of oil will surge by 8.4 \nmillion barrels a day over the next 5 years, significantly faster than \ndemand, and nearly two-thirds of the increase in oil supply will be in \nNorth America. So if you are looking at an abundance of supply and \nlimited demand, we have every reason in the world to believe gas prices \nat the pump, oil prices in general, should go down. If they are not \ngoing down, we have to ask why. Many of us believe this has to do with \nexcessive Wall Street speculation on the oil futures market.\n\n  While we cannot ignore the fact that big oil companies have been \ngouging consumers at the pump for years and have made over $1 trillion \nin profit over the past decade, there is mounting evidence that high \ngasoline prices have less to do with supply and demand and more to do \nwith Wall Street speculation jacking up oil and gas prices in the \nenergy futures market. Ten years ago--and this is a very important \npoint for people to understand--10 years ago speculators only \ncontrolled--``only'' is probably the wrong word, but they controlled \nabout 30 to 40 percent of the oil futures market. Today Wall Street \nspeculators control at least 80 percent of the market. In a 10-year \nperiod, we have seen Wall Street speculation double on the energy \nfutures market.\n  What does this mean in terms of oil prices? Everything in the world. \nThe function of Wall Street speculation has nothing to do with using \noil, everything to do with making a profit, driving prices higher. This \nis not just Bernie Sanders talking. There is now a growing consensus \nthat excessive speculation on the oil futures market is driving up oil \nprices. ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, the IMF, the St. Louis Federal \nReserve, the American Trucking Association, Delta Airlines, the \nPetroleum Marketers Association of America, the New England Fuel \nInstitute and many other groups--the Consumer Federation of America--\nhave all agreed that excessive oil speculation significantly increases \noil and gas prices.\n  Interestingly enough, Goldman Sachs--not one of my favorite \ninstitutions but perhaps the largest speculator on Wall Street--came \nout with a report indicating that excessive oil speculation is costing \nAmericans 56 cents a gallon at the pump. Goldman Sachs, speculator, \nthey themselves estimating that excessive speculation is costing 56 \ncents a gallon at the pump for the average consumer, and that may be a \nconservative estimate.\n  A few years ago the CEO of ExxonMobil, again not one of my favorite \ncompanies, testified at a Senate hearing that excessive speculation \ncontributed as much as 40 percent to the cost of a barrel of oil.\n  Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, told the Bush \nadministration back in 2008 during the last major spike in oil prices \nthat speculation has contributed as much as 40 percent to a barrel of \noil.\n  Gary Gensler, the chairman of the CFTC, has stated publicly that oil \nspeculators now control between 80 to\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\n87 percent of the energy futures market, a figure that has more than \ndoubled over the past decade. In other words, the vast majority of oil \non the futures market is not controlled by people who actually use the \nproduct but people whose only function in life being in the oil futures \nmarket is to make as much quick profit as they possibly can.\n  Let me give just a list of a few of the oil speculators and how much \noil they were trading on June 30, 2008, when the price of oil was over \n$140 a barrel and gas prices were over $4 a gallon. Goldman Sachs \nbought and sold over 863 million barrels of oil, Morgan Stanley bought \nand sold over 632 million barrels of oil, Bank of America bought and \nsold over 112 million barrels of oil, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, \net cetera.\n  What we have to understand is that to a very significant degree, \npricing of oil has nothing to do with supply and demand, nothing to do \nwith end users who actually buy the product, and everything to do with \nWall Street speculation. Sadly, the spike in oil and gasoline prices \nwas totally avoidable. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nimpose strict limits on the amount of oil that Wall Street speculators \ncould trade in the energy futures market by January 17, 2011, 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  Unfortunately, the CFTC has been unable to implement position limits \ndue to opposition on Wall Street and a ruling of the DC district court \nwhich is now under appeal.\n  This amendment directs the CFTC to utilize all its authority, \nincluding its emergency powers, to curb excessive oil speculation \nwithin 30 days. We are not going to drag this on for another 5 years. \nThe emergency directive in this amendment is virtually identical to \nbipartisan legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 402 to 19, during a similar crisis in \n2008.\n  Let me conclude by saying that millions of consumers are hurting as a \nresult of excessive speculation. People are paying much more at the \npump than they should for gasoline. This issue impacts our entire \neconomy. It is time that we did something to that. I say to my \ncolleagues: I call up amendments numbers 963 and 964, and ask for their \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from \nVermont for raising all these issues that are so important for the \nAmerican people. At this point in time, we do have an amendment that is \npending, the amendment of Senator Gillibrand. We do not have unanimous \nconsent in order to set that aside so I would have to, at the moment, \nobject to setting it aside, but I assure the Senator I wish to have an \nopportunity to talk to him about these issues.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I look forward to talking to the Senator from Michigan, \nbut I do want her to know this is an enormously important amendment for \nthe people of Vermont and the people of America. We want action. I \nthink we have brought forth an amendment which, in fact, can end up \nsubstantially lowering the price of oil and gas at the pump and I will \npursue this vigorously.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise to speak on behalf of the Agriculture Reform, \nFood, and Jobs Act of 2013, a 5-year farm bill. This bill saves more \nthan $24 billion to help reduce our deficit and our debt, it \nstreamlines farm programs to make them more efficient, and it ensures \nthat our farmers and ranchers continue to have good risk management \ntools, particularly crop insurance.\n  It is vitally important to so many facets of our national interests. \nIt is important to food, of course, but also to fuel, to fiber, to \nrural development, agriculture research, and many other areas. It \ntouches the life of every single American in some of the most basic \nways.\n  This year the farm bill is moving through the Senate because we have \nalready debated and passed more than 90 percent of this bill in the \nlast session. A lot of this bill we worked on very hard in the last \nsession and passed it through this body with a big bipartisan vote.\n  Unfortunately, the House was not able to pass their version so we \nwere not able to go to conference and finish the job. This year we need \nto do that.\n  This farm bill, again, 90 percent-plus we voted on in this body last \nsession. We had a big bipartisan vote to pass it. We need to do that \nagain. We need to get into conference with the House, and we need to \nget this done for farmers and ranchers and for the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  Last week we passed a bill out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \non which I serve, where I had the opportunity to help craft it--again, \nbuilding on the product that we put together last year when we voted it \nout of committee with a big bipartisan vote. The House also passed its \nversion of a farm bill out of their Agriculture Committee last week. \nThey are looking to bring their bill to the House floor in June. We are \nhopeful they will pass it in June, but we need to be ready. We need to \nhave ours done. I think we can show real leadership on this issue and \nbe ready to get into conference with the House and get this important \nwork done.\n  The Senate version we passed supports our farmers and ranchers in \nsubstantive and sensible ways. It gives them the necessary risk \nmanagement tools and ensures that Americans, all Americans, continue to \nenjoy the highest quality, lowest cost food supply, not just in the \nworld but in the history of the world.\n  Among the provisions of the commodity title is the no-cost Sugar \nProgram. I wish to take just a few minutes to talk about the Sugar \nProgram and its importance in the context of this farm bill. The Sugar \nProgram warrants discussion because some Members--I believe certainly \nwith the best of intentions--want to actually weaken this vitally \nimportant program. But weakening our current sugar policy would \naccomplish nothing. In fact, it would subject our producers, consumers, \nand industries to a distorted world market. Further, it would threaten \nmore than 140,000 jobs in 22 States that depend on a vibrant, \ncompetitive sugar industry.\n  The world's sugar market is not a free market. Make no mistake, it is \nnot a free market in any conventional sense of the term. I can tell you \nnow, foreign governments heavily protect and subsidize their sugar \nproducers. For example, Brazil spends between $2 and $3 billion per \nyear to subsidize its producers. Mexico literally owns one-fifth of its \nindustry and subsidizes the rest.\n  Our sugar farmers, along with the rest of America's farmers and \nranchers, have told foreign competitors, time and again, we are ready \nto compete in a truly freely market, but we will not and must not \nunilaterally disarm, nor will dismantling the Sugar Program result in \nlower costs to consumers and American businesses. Once you factor in \ntransportation costs, the world price of sugar is higher than the price \nin the United States.\n  Sugar prices are not only higher in Brazil and Mexico, they are \nhigher worldwide. If we do away with sugar policy altogether and \nsubject producers strictly to a distorted global market, what we will \nsee is not lower prices but rather extreme volatility in the global \nsugar market.\n  Not only are sugar prices lower in the United States and elsewhere, \nbut the cost of sugar in most products is tiny. For example, in a \nHershey's chocolate bar it is less than 2 percent of the cost. Further, \nit should be noted that sugar prices have fallen by more than 50 \npercent in the last 2 years, but candy prices at the store are not \nseeing the same level of reduction at all.\n  The truth is, if consumers are paying higher costs, it is because of \nlabor and health care costs in the United States, not because of the \ncost of sugar.\n  For 10 years now, sugar policy has operated at zero cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer because our farmers are efficient and competitive and \nbecause American sugar policy has always made sure they were playing on \na level playing field. As a result, consumers in\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\nthis country enjoy more affordable sugar than elsewhere in the world \nand American consumers enjoy a safe and reliable homegrown source. The \nbottom line is that sugar policy is cost-effective and fair and it \nshould be retained in the commodity title of the farm bill.\n  But I would like to turn, again, to the broader legislation. Good \nfarm policy benefits every single American. As I said, we have the \nlowest cost, highest quality food supply in the world thanks to our \nfarmers and ranchers and thanks to good farm policy. How do we put a \nvalue on our safe, abundant, nutritious, dependable food supply? It is \ninvaluable. By any standard it is invaluable. Just consider the \nbenefits that this farm bill provides.\n  The farm bill is a job creator and it helps our economy. Agriculture \nsupports 16 million jobs in the United States and contributes billions \nof dollars to the national economy. Year in and year out we sell more \nfood and fiber than we buy from abroad. Further, American agriculture \nproduces a financial surplus. Through relentless innovation, best \npractices, and good stewardship of the land, American agriculture \ncreates a positive balance of trade.\n  The farm bill saves money to help reduce the deficit and the debt. \nThink how important that is.\n  The 2013 farm bill, like the farm bill we passed last year, provides \nmore than $24 billion in savings--more than is required by \nsequestration--to help address the Nation's deficit and debt. Farmers \nand ranchers are stepping up and doing their part.\n  The farm bill also provides a strong market-based safety net for the \nproducers. The safety net in the 2013 farm bill focuses on enhanced \ncrop insurance; that is what they have asked for and that is the \nfocus--not direct payments. Direct payments are limited. It enhances \ncrop insurance with the inclusion of a new product called the \nsupplemental coverage option, SCO. The SCO enables purchasers to \npurchase a supplemental policy beyond their individual farm-based \npolicy, thereby creating an additional level of risk management.\n  The bill also includes the Agriculture Risk Coverage or ARC Program \nthat provides assistance for shallow loss or multiple-year losses, \nwhich again helps our farmers to better manage risk. They are business \npeople and they need to manage their risks.\n  Let's not forget the farm bill strengthens our national security. Our \ncountry doesn't have to depend on other countries for our food supply--\ncountries that don't necessarily share our interests or values--and \nthat makes us safer. The fact is we are secure in that most basic, \nvital necessity--our food supply.\n  The farm bill is about so many things that are important to the \npeople of America. This is about all Americans. Again, I say good farm \npolicy benefits every single American. We have the highest quality, \nlowest cost food supply in the world thanks to our farmers, ranchers, \nand good farm policy.\n  This is about 16 million jobs in this country which are supported by \nagriculture. This is about a positive balance of trade which helps \nbuild our economy. This is about $24 billion in savings where \nagriculture is stepping up and not only doing its share but more than \nits share to help with the deficit and debt. In the most fundamental \nways, a good farm bill makes America stronger, safer, and more secure. \nWe need to pass this farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to congratulate my friend \nfrom North Dakota for his statement and his discussion of the content \nof this farm bill. He was one of the active members of our committee \nwho participated in the markup sessions, attended the hearings in \npreparation for writing a farm bill, and helped to shape the consensus \nthat is reflected in the final work product. Senator Hoeven is a very \nvaluable member of our committee, and I commend and thank my colleague \nfrom North Dakota for his contributions to this process.\n  He very accurately describes that this is a consensus product. It is \nnot a partisan bill; it is not meant to make anybody or any section or \nany commodity group look good or feel good because of favors done in \nthis bill. This is truly to serve the interests of our good and great \ncountry and help improve our trading opportunities in agricultural \ncommodities that are produced on our farms throughout the United \nStates.\n  I think it is going to serve the interests of not only agriculture \nbut the American citizen and, broadly speaking, much of this success is \ndue to the contributions made by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi for his kind comments and also for his leadership on the \nAgriculture Committee as our ranking member. I wanted to express my \nappreciation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, it should come as no surprise that two \nSenators from the great State of North Dakota stand today and talk \nabout the importance of American agriculture. Ninety percent of the \nland we have in North Dakota is engaged in production agriculture. As \nmuch as we have heard--and it is all true--about this great economic \nrenaissance we are having in our State, agriculture is still No. 1.\n  Every year American farmers--North Dakota farmers--bet. They bet on \ngood weather, good prices, that the crop will grow, and they spend \nmillions of dollars on that bet. They are the biggest gamblers in the \nhistory of the world, and they are asking for a farm bill that gives \nthem a little bit of risk help and makes sure when they plant, they \nknow that maybe they have a chance to get cost of production back out.\n  Why is that important? It is important because who is going to take \nthat risk on behalf of the American people, on behalf of a global and \nworldwide supply of food? Who is going to take that risk if we don't \nhelp a little bit?\n  Today in America almost every State which has an agricultural base is \ndoing a little bit better because agriculture has led the way. \nAgriculture has aided this economy. States with an agriculture base \nhave a much lower rate of unemployment, and they have been leading the \nway on our trade deficit.\n  It cannot be overstated how significant this farm bill is not only to \nStates such as North Dakota but to every State and every economy in \nthis Union. There are 16 million jobs which hang in the balance. They \nare waiting for this body--the Congress--to give some assurance, to \npass a farm bill.\n  I applaud both the ranking member and the committee chair for their \nexcellent work. No bill which comes out of a committee with diverse \nopinions is absolutely perfect where everyone will agree on everything \nin the bill, but it is part of the great American compromise we have \nbeen talking about and striving for in this body. We are working to \nmove the issues forward and do what Americans sent us here to do. We \nare here to deliberate, discuss, debate, and compromise, and that is \nwhat this bill is about.\n  Every piece of this bill is important. Every piece is a linchpin to \nmake sure we pass a farm bill. We are going to hear a lot in the next \ncouple of days about the Sugar Program. I will talk broadly about the \nother provisions of the bill tomorrow on this floor, but I want to \nspend today talking a little bit about the Sugar Program within the \nfarm bill because it is absolutely significant and important.\n\n  I know Senator Hoeven outlined some of the statistics we talk about \nwhen we talk about sugar. The U.S. sugar policy defends more than \n142,000 jobs--not just in North Dakota, Minnesota, Florida, and Hawaii, \nbut in 22 States. It defends those jobs from unfair foreign \ncompetition, and it results in nearly $20 billion in annual economic \nactivity in the United States.\n  Of course, many of these jobs are in North Dakota. We grow a lot of \nsugar beets in the Red River Valley, we process a lot of sugar beets in \nthe Red River Valley, and those processing jobs are the value-added \njobs that led the way to a value-added economy in our State. We are \npretty protective of our sugar economy.\n  In many rural communities sugar is the linchpin of the local economy. \nMake no mistake that if we bend to the\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nreforms we will hear talked about or bend to the ideas some have today \nabout the Sugar Program, we will lose our domestic sugar industry. Why? \nBecause we cannot compete. Make no mistake about that.\n  I am not saying our producers cannot produce or compete with \nproducers from other parts of the world if the playing field is level. \nIn fact, not only can we compete, we can best them. However, the sugar \nplaying field is not level. Other countries have subsidized their sugar \nprograms for years. More than 120 countries actually produce sugar. \nEvery one of them intervenes to defend their producers from global \ncrisis where surplus sugar is dumped. No one could survive at historic \nworld-level prices without these government interventions. If our \nfarmers could go head to head with their foreign counterparts, they \nwould robustly compete and, I believe, capture much of the market. \nUnfortunately, with Federal subsidization and protections in place, a \nfair fight is not available to our American sugar beet and sugar cane \ngrowers. Opponents of the Sugar Program would have us do one thing: \nUnilaterally disarm and surrender our market to foreign producers.\n  For over two decades, from 1989 to 2008--and I want everyone to \nremember the date of 2008--the average world cost of sugar production \naveraged about 51 percent more than the world price.\n  Let me say that again: The world average cost of sugar production \naveraged 51 percent more than the sugar price. How does that happen? \nHow does anyone produce a product that costs more than they sell it \nfor? They are subsidized, which means sugar producers have received \nsupport from governments that allow them to stay in business even when \ntheir production costs exceed the price.\n  In order for those sugar industries to survive, governments in \nforeign countries provide some buffer to the world market with a wide \nvariety of import tariffs, nontariff import barriers, price and income \nsupports, and direct and indirect subsidies.\n  We have heard that sugar prices are too high, and if we eliminate the \nSugar Program--the risk program for our sugar growers--that sugar \nprices would drop. Food corporation opponents say the U.S. sugar price \nis too high. They further argue that high sugar prices threaten their \ncompetitiveness given foreign competition for processed foods.\n  The truth is that sugar prices have held relatively stable over the \ncourse of the last three decades. This cannot be said about most other \nagricultural commodities. Imagine if we were debating today about $2-a-\nbushel corn.\n  U.S. raw sugar prices have dropped by more than half since the fall \nof 2011. Prices are now below the average price of the 1980s, below the \naverage of the 1990s, and below the average of the decade of 2000.\n  Our sugar farmers have struggled for decades and many have not have \nsurvived. Since 1985, more than half of the sugar beet and sugar cane \noperations shut down. It is hard to survive in 2013 when the price they \nget for their product is the same price they would have received in \n1980.\n  The amendment we are going to be debating here will drive the U.S. \nsugar price down even further, which will allow more subsidized sugar \nto flow into our market and put our sugar farmers out of business.\n  If we look at all of the commodities that are in the farm bill--look \nat every piece of that compromised bill--and start singling out one \ncommodity for special treatment--let's forget for a minute we are \ntalking about sugar. Let's talk about dairy. Would a sugar bill survive \nif we were to eliminate the dairy program? Would a farm bill survive if \nwe were to eliminate the dairy program?\n  Our concern today is that this industry is critical to our food \nsecurity but also, importantly, it is critical to the compromise of the \nfarm bill itself. This is a farm bill that supports over 16 million \njobs in an economy that struggles except on the farm. These programs \nhave worked.\n  As someone who is from North Dakota, I have lived through bad farm \nbills. My producers have lived through bad farm bills. The last 5 to 6 \nyears have been an enormous improvement, not only to market-driven \ntechniques but it has been an enormous improvement in allowing our \nproducers to make the market decisions they are going to make, but also \nget the help that is going to give them surety.\n  When a small North Dakota producer--and I am not exaggerating--spends \n$1 million putting a crop in the ground, they do that for their family, \nthey do that for their State, but they also do it for the country and \nfor the world because they know the American farmer feeds the world and \nit is a pretty important job.\n  So I say, let the compromise stay. Let the bill stay intact. Let's \nmove this bill forward, let's get it into conference with the House, \nand for once let's tell the American people we can get something done \nin Congress. Let's tell them we can respond to the needs of this \ncountry and move our country forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota. Also, it is a pleasure to \nwelcome her as a new member of our committee. She took an active part \nin the development of this bill, and we appreciate her contributions.\n  I see no other Senators seeking recognition at this time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is Roberts amendment No. 948. This \namendment would help rein in the largest expenditure within the \nDepartment of Agriculture budget--the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee included minimal savings under food \nstamps--around $4 billion over the 10-year budget window. I know people \nhave different views, but I would say that it is certainly minimal. I \nthink we could have done more in committee last week. I introduced an \namendment at that time. I withdrew it to make sure we could get this to \nthe floor. We must do much more in a responsible manner. Look at the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, which marked up a farm bill with over $20 \nbillion in savings from SNAP. That bill was marked up and passed with \nbipartisan support as of last week.\n  We can restore integrity to the program while providing benefits to \nthose truly in need and save approximately an additional $30 billion. \nNote that I say ``while providing benefits to those truly in need.'' I \nam not proposing a dramatic change in the policy of nutrition programs, \nsuch as block-granting programs to States. That would represent a \ndramatic change. Instead, this amendment enforces the principles of \ngood government and restores SNAP and spending to much more responsible \nlevels.\n  Also, SNAP was exempted from the across-the-board cuts known as \nsequestration. However, it is clear there are several areas within the \nprogram that could provide significant savings that were left \nuntouched.\n  First, the amendment eliminates the LIHEAP loophole. Let me be clear. \nEliminating the LIHEAP loophole does not affect SNAP eligibility for \nanyone using SNAP; it only decreases SNAP benefits for those who would \nnot otherwise qualify for the higher SNAP benefit amounts.\n  But at least 17 States, with all due respect, are gaming the system \nby designing their Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--LIHEAP--\nto exploit SNAP. Let me explain. The LIHEAP loophole works like this: \nParticipating State agencies annually issue extremely low LIHEAP \nbenefits to qualify otherwise ineligible households for standard \nutility allowances, which result in increased monthly SNAP benefits. \nFor example, today a State agency can issue $1--only $1--annually in \nLIHEAP benefits to increase monthly SNAP benefits an average of $90--\nthat is $1,080 per year--for households that do not otherwise pay out-\nof-pocket utility bills.\n  If you completely eliminate the LIHEAP loophole, as my legislation \ndoes, it will save taxpayers a total of $12 billion--$8 billion \nadditional compared to the current version of the farm bill.\n  We also tie categorical eligibility to cash assistance, eliminating a \nloophole that States are exploiting by offering TANF-provided \ninformational brochures and informational 1-800 numbers to maximize \nSNAP enrollment and the corresponding increase in Federal food \nbenefits.\n  Categorical eligibility, simply known as Cat-El, was designed to help \nstreamline the administration of SNAP by allowing households to be \ncertified as eligible for SNAP food benefits without evaluating \nhousehold assets or gross income. 42 States are exploiting an \nunintended loophole of the TANF-provided informational brochures and \ninformational 1-800 numbers to maximize SNAP enrollment and the \ncorresponding increase in Federal food benefits and the cost. These \nStates, with all due respect, are also gaming the system to bring \notherwise ineligible SNAP participants into the program.\n  In an ongoing effort to streamline government programs, we should \neliminate the duplicative SNAP Employment and Training Program and the \nSNAP Nutrition Education Grants Program. Combined, these two programs \ncost over $8 billion and do not represent any direct food benefits--any \ndirect food benefits.\n  This amendment also ends the Department of Agriculture practice of \ngiving $48 million in awards every year to State agencies for basically \ndoing their job. Currently, bonuses are given to States for best \nprogram access--signing up as many people for SNAP as possible; most \nimproved program access--how many more people signed up for SNAP \ncompared to the previous year; and best application processing \ntimelines--handling applications within required guidelines. The \nbonuses are not even required to be used for SNAP administration. A \nrecipient State may choose to use the funding for any State priority.\n  Finally, the amendment terminates the ongoing stimulus, enacted by \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which provided \nextra funding to increase monthly SNAP food benefits. I really \nunderstand the importance of domestic food assistance programs for many \nhard-working Americans, including many Kansans. As chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee some years ago, we worked very hard to save \nthe Food Stamp Program and prevent any kinds of efforts to simply do \naway with it or send it back to States because of the very things I \nhave talked about.\n  My goal is simple: to restore integrity to the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program in a commonsense and comprehensive manner. Enacting \nthis package of reforms will allow the Federal Government to continue \nto help those who truly need SNAP food benefits and assistance. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment and these reforms for \nthe benefit of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I inquire of the chairwoman if I might be \nable to speak for about 5 or 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Certainly we want to hear from the distinguished Senator from \nMontana. I\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nknow the Senator from South Dakota has been waiting for some time as \nwell, and we had asked him to wait until Senator Roberts had offered \nhis amendment. I am not sure of the time the Senator from South Dakota \nis requesting right now, but certainly we want to hear from both of the \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, does the Senator from Michigan want to lock \nin a time agreement on the votes?\n  Ms. STABENOW. It appears at this moment we are going to have to have \na little bit more time before we do that, but I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tragedy In Oklahoma\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I first want to start with just a word \nabout the tragedy in Oklahoma. Our thoughts and prayers are with the \nfamilies impacted by yesterday's devastating storms, as well as the \nfirst responders and volunteers who rushed to the scene. I hope all \nAmericans will continue to keep them in their thoughts and prayers and \nbe looking for ways in which they can pitch in and help in this very \ntragic situation.\n\n\n                      Long-Term Budget Challenges\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the long-term \nbudget challenges facing the country and the impact those challenges \nare going to have on jobs, economic growth, and future generations if \nwe do not control spending.\n  Last week the Congressional Budget Office released its updated budget \nprojections, and in conjunction with that they released an analysis of \nthe President's 2014 budget.\n  Once again, the CBO report underscores the long-term budget \nchallenges facing this country. If you listen to many of the \npoliticians here in Washington, DC, and commentators on the Democratic \nside reacting to the Congressional Budget Office report, you would have \nheard claims that the deficit and debt crisis facing this country is \nsolved and that no further deficit reduction is needed. In fact, \nPresident Obama took to the airwaves recently in his radio address and \nboasted about the deficits ``shrinking at the fastest rate in \ndecades.''\n  These claims about last week's Congressional Budget Office report \nstrike me as odd, particularly because the details of the report tell a \ndifferent story. According to the CBO, the deficit for 2013 is \nprojected to be $642 billion or 4 percent of the Nation's gross \ndomestic product.\n  While the deficit may be down from its record trillion dollar-plus \nlevels, the national debt, which is already at $16.7 trillion, \ncontinues to grow at an alarming rate--$642 billion this year alone. \nWhile it is encouraging that the deficit this year will be smaller than \nit was originally projected, part of those savings are due to \nunexpected repayments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the revenue \nincreases from January's fiscal cliff agreement.\n  The fact of the matter is a deficit 4 percent the size of the economy \nis nearly double the historic average. Over the next 10 years covered \nin the CBO's baseline projections, the national debt will grow by \nnearly $9 trillion to over $25 trillion.\n  To put that number in perspective, the country is projected to rack \nup over $2 billion in debt every single day over the next decade, at \nwhich point our national debt will exceed $25 trillion. This assumes \nthe sequester remains in place. Publicly held debt will remain above 70 \npercent of GDP, which is much higher than the historic average of 39 \npercent. CBO projects that publicly held debt will continue on an \nupward path beyond the next decade.\n  This growth is driven by spending, not revenue. The CBO report \nconfirms that revenues are projected to grow by 45.9 percent in the 8 \nyears after the year 2015, while overall spending will grow at 55 \npercent during that time period, despite the fact that inflation will \nbe 19.5 percent and economic growth 24.9 percent during that time \nperiod. Those are CBO estimates about economic growth, inflation, \nspending, and debt over the course of the next decade.\n  In other words, revenues are going up but spending is projected to \ngrow at nearly three times the rate of inflation, meaning we have a \nspending problem, not a revenue problem. In fact, revenues will reach \n19.1 percent of GDP by the year 2023, which is well above the historic \naverage of 17.9 percent since the end of World War II. Spending, on the \nother hand, will continue to grow even with the sequester, driven \nlargely by increases in mandatory spending. Mandatory spending on \nprograms such as Medicare is projected to grow by 79 percent from \ntoday's level over the next 10 years. Federal health care programs, \nincluding ObamaCare, are driving the surge in mandatory spending. \nFederal health care spending is projected to double over the next \ndecade as the health insurance exchange subsidies kick in beginning \nnext year. Medicare and other programs continue to grow without needed \nreforms to save and strengthen them.\n  Spending on mandatory programs and interest on the debt will consume \nnearly three-quarters of all Federal spending over the next 10 years, \nleaving little room to pay for all discretionary programs including, I \nmight add, national defense.\n  To slow the rapid rise in debt this country is experiencing, we have \nto control the largest driver of that debt, which is spending and, in \nparticular, mandatory entitlement spending. The alternative is a \ncrippling national debt that is bad for the economy, bad for jobs, bad \nfor our national security, and bad for our children and grandchildren.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, ``Such high \nand rising debt later in the coming decade would have serious negative \nconsequences.'' The report goes on to say: ``Moreover, because Federal \nborrowing reduces national saving, over time the capital stock would be \nsmaller and total wages would be lower . . . ''\n  The CBO also warns that such high levels of debt increase the risk of \na fiscal crisis. The threat the rising national debt poses to our \neconomy is real. It will impact the American people, and it will impact \nour economy in very real ways. It will slow economic growth, meaning \nfewer jobs. It will drive up interest rates, making it more expensive \nto borrow money to pay for a college education or to buy a home.\n  It is inevitable that the national debt is going to have to be \naddressed at some point. The question is whether we address it directly \nor continue kicking the can down the road, which will only make our \nproblems much more difficult to solve.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also projected in their update last \nweek that interest spending--the amount we spend to finance our debt--\nis going to increase dramatically over the next several years. In fact, \ninterest costs on prior deficit spending are going to grow from $223 \nbillion today to $823 billion in 2023, an increase of 369 percent. Net \ninterest costs will surpass the base defense budget in 2019, 6 years \nfrom now. Think about that. We are going to spend more in interest on \nthe debt 6 years from now than we spend on national security, on our \nnational defense. That is how fast the interest is going to eat up \nevery other area of the budget.\n  I would hope we will be able to take this CBO report and not greet it \nwith great fanfare and be slapping high fives because for 1 year the \ndeficit was reduced by a couple of hundred billion over what it was \nsupposed to be, but, rather, recognize that with $642 billion this year \nand a Federal debt that is going to be at $25 trillion at the end of \nthis decade and interest payments that will exceed the amount we spend \non national security, we have a serious debt crisis in this country \nthat needs to be addressed.\n  It is my wish that Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and \nour Democratic colleagues will work with us and that the President will \nstep forward and acknowledge we have a debt crisis. It is not a debt \ncrisis somewhere out there in the future, it is a debt crisis today \nthat needs to be dealt with. The CBO update, rather than alleviating \nthat concern, puts the fine point that we need to act, and we need to \nact now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson once said: ``Far and away \nthe best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work \nworth doing.''\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\n  I know many Montana farmers and ranchers who understand that exactly. \nThey know what Jefferson meant. They work the soils and tend their \nherds month after month, often through natural disasters such as the \ndrought we had in 2012. It is hard work, but they do it because it is \nwork worth doing. The dirt under their nails and the sweat on their \nbrow puts food on our tables every day. The farm bill supports that \neffort, the bill before us this afternoon. It is work worth doing.\n  Make no mistake, the farm bill is a jobs bill. It supports 16 million \nAmerican jobs every year. In my State of Montana, one in every five \njobs is tied to agriculture. Those jobs are counting on us to get this \nbill done.\n  As we work to tackle the debt, it is important to remember the farm \nbill cuts spending by $23 billion. The farm bill is part of the \nsolution, not part of the problem. Under the leadership of Chairwoman \nStabenow and Ranking Member Cochran, we have crafted a true reform farm \nbill. We worked with farmers and ranchers across the country to create \na farm policy that works for producers and taxpayers both. It provides \nsupport that is needed when they actually experience a loss.\n  As Will Rogers notably said: ``The farmer has to be an optimist or he \nwouldn't still be a farmer.''\n  Farming is capital intensive. Farmers work with paper-thin profit \nmargins. Even the best farmer is left at the mercy of weather and \nchance.\n  The drought last year is an example of the risk farmers face. USDA \npredicts that 80 percent of agricultural land experienced drought in \n2012, making it one of the most expensive droughts in a generation. In \nMontana that means 48 of 56 counties with parched crops and empty \nfields. The revenue program in this bill, combined with the crop \ninsurance products we have fine-tuned over the decades, will help \nfarmers survive disasters such as this and prepare to put food on \nAmerica's tables when weather or market conditions improve.\n  Anyone who has been to Montana knows we have the best-tasting beef in \nthe world too--or at least we think so. For the last year our ranchers \nhave weathered this drought with no support. With hay and water in \nshort supply, they have been forced to thin their herds. Thinning herds \nmeans lost jobs in Montana, because 50 percent of our economy is tied \nto agriculture, and about 35 percent of our total agriculture proceeds \ncome from cattle and calf sales.\n  Livestock disaster assistance keeps our ranchers in business until \nthe rain starts falling again. That is why I created these programs in \n2008, and that is why I fought so hard to make them permanent in this \nbill--to finally provide our ranchers with certainty they can take to \nthe bank. In the last farm bill they were not permanent and caused \nalmost another disaster. I thank the chairman and ranking member for \nworking with me to extend that livestock disaster with limited funds.\n  We did not stop there. We did not stop with reforming the farm bill. \nWe saved $6 billion from in the conservation title without compromising \nthe policy. We did this by consolidating 23 existing programs, bringing \na tight network of efficient and streamlined conservation programs.\n  I made sure we protected the working lands programs, which contribute \nto substantial conservation improvements but still allow for productive \nuse of the land.\n  In the forestry title, we permanently authorized stewardship \ncontracting. This is so important to the western one-third of our \nState. This will help the timber industry sustainably harvest more \ntrees. Anyone in western Montana will tell you that means jobs.\n  We also included support to combat the bark beetle epidemic that has \nkilled over 6 million acres of Montana forests. Senator Bennet and I \nworked together to make sure those dead trees can be harvested more \nquickly before the wood wastes or burns. With fire season already well \nunderway in Montana, this investment is more important than ever.\n  I was also extremely proud of our work to help veterans find jobs in \nfarming. Forty-five percent of our servicemembers come from rural \nareas. This is a national statistic, so farming is a natural fit for \nveterans looking to return home to a rural way of life.\n  In the nutrition title, I am proud to say we kept the fundamentals of \nthe food stamp program intact so low-income families have their safety \nnet in place as the economy continues to improve. We even found a way \nto trump up spending for TEFAP, which provides emergency food for needy \nfamilies.\n  In Montana, agriculture is a way of life. It is our biggest industry. \nOur 29,300 farms produce billions of dollars worth of quality wheat, \nbarley, peas, and lentils--to say nothing of our livestock. Our \nranchers have 2.5 million head of cattle, which means there are more \ncows in Montana than people.\n  The farm bill is not just for producers. It also provides funding for \nrural businesses, from Miles City, to Glendive, to Libby. The farm bill \noffers opportunities for Montanans of all walks of life.\n  The same is true all across America. Our farm policy contributes to \nsecurity in American agriculture, and that is why we spend less on food \nthan any other country in the world. We spend less than any other \ndeveloped country in the world. Americans spend less than 7 percent of \ntheir disposable income to feed their families. That compares with \nalmost 25 percent in 1930.\n  Our producers put food on tables around the world. In 2012, \nagricultural exports reached $136 billion, with a surplus of $32 \nbillion--literally growing wealth from our fertile soils.\n  Like any small business owner, farmers and ranchers all across \nMontana tell me the No. 1 thing they want is certainty. Operating under \nshort-term extensions leaves millions of Americans' agricultural jobs \nstuck in limbo. Farmers and ranchers need certainty they can take to \nthe bank. That is why they need this 5-year farm bill. If we can get \nthis bill passed, we are on the road to moving away from these short-\nterm extensions--which do no one any good--and moving to longer term \nlegislation which does everybody a lot more good. I hope we can get \nthis bill passed, it is so important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to proceed on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                           Burmese Sanctions\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the past two decades, I have been coming to the \nSenate floor to condemn acts of the Burmese regime against its own \npeople. For the past decade, for these same reasons, I have sponsored \nlegislation to impose sanctions on the Burmese Government.\n  Beginning in 2003, import sanctions have been renewed annually \nthrough the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. This act was later \nenhanced in 2008 through the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, a \nmeasure I also cosponsored.\n  Today, however, I come to the floor with a different message. After \nhaving given the matter a great deal of thought and review, I do not \nbelieve Congress should reauthorize these import sanctions.\n  Let me repeat that. I do not believe the Burma sanctions should be \nrenewed for another year. There are several reasons why.\n  First, the objective of the sanctions effort is to change the \nbehavior of the Burmese Government. To a significant extent that has \nactually taken place. As a result of the new Burmese Government's \nactions in the past 2\\1/2\\ years, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace \nPrize Laureate, has been freed from house arrest, has been permitted to \ntravel abroad, and has been elected to office as a member of \nParliament.\n  A free and fair by-election was held in Burma last year. Scores of \npolitical prisoners have been released. A freer form of government has \nbegun to take root. I strongly believe the import sanctions we \npreviously enacted were instrumental in promoting these reforms. They \nhelped deny the previous military junta the legitimacy it had craved.\n  These positive changes, many of which I saw for myself during my \nvisit to Burma in January 2012, should be acknowledged, and we do \nacknowledge them. As Suu Kyi herself said last fall during her visit to \nthe United States, ``the sanctions need to be removed.''\n  Second, I believe renewing sanctions would be a slap in the face to \nBurmese reformers and would embolden those within Burma who want to \nslow or reverse the reform movement. We should\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nbe strengthening the hand of these reformists to show the ``fence \nsitters'' that reform will be met with positive action by the United \nStates. The administration has extended an olive branch to the new \nBurmese Government, and I believe it is time for Congress to do the \nsame. Burmese citizens should not be made to feel that Congress will \nmaintain sanctions no matter what they do.\n  Third, after renewal of the import ban last year, the administration \nwaived most of the sanctions in response to the recent reforms. So as a \npractical matter--as a practical matter--even if the ban were renewed, \nits effect would be largely nullified through an administration \nwaiver--a waiver, by the way, I support.\n  Let me emphasize a few points. By choosing not to renew the import \nban, no one should fall under the misimpression that Congress would be \ngiving up its leverage with respect to Burma. The current restrictions \non importation of Burmese jade and rubies are likely to remain in place \neven without the renewal of sanctions. This is because the \nadministration enjoys authority under other statutes to continue to \nlimit the importation of Burmese gems. So, again, as a practical \nmatter, the restrictions on Burma would be little different without the \nsanctions than they are right now under the sanctions we renewed last \nyear, considering the fact the sanctions were waived last year anyway.\n  Moreover, there are other sanctions, apart from the law I was just \ntalking about, which would remain permanent. They include the authority \nto freeze assets and the authority to deny visas to bad Burmese actors. \nEven if the import ban is not reauthorized, these provisions remain on \nthe books.\n  In addition, a variety of other sanctions that expressly name Burma \nremain in effect and still require outright repeal or modification. \nThey include provisions within the fiscal year 1997 foreign operations \nappropriations bill, the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, and the Foreign \nAssistance Act.\n  If the Burmese Government continues to support political and economic \nreform, then at a later date Congress can consider whether these \npermanent restrictions warrant removal or modification.\n  Beyond the realm of trade, there are other statutes of general \napplication that sanction Burma due to concerns over human trafficking, \ncounternarcotics, and religious freedom, to name just a few such \nissues. Burma must take positive action in order to no longer qualify \nfor sanctions under those measures as well. So, again, legislative \nleverage would remain even without the renewal of this law.\n  There also remains the annual appropriations process as Congress \nconsiders how much and what types of aid Burma should receive in the \nfirst place. For instance, there is some indication that Burma wants to \nimprove its military-to-military relationship with us. Frankly, I think \nthat is a good idea, and such programs and contacts provide additional \ntools for congressional oversight and action.\n  The European Union and Australia have also removed most of their \nsanctions against Burma. Congress, in choosing not to renew trade \nsanctions, would ensure that American companies remain on equal footing \nwith their western competitors and bring greater certainty to those \nU.S. firms which are considering investment in Burma.\n  Finally, if Burma backslides, Congress can always reconsider the \nsanctions.\n  As a Congress, we need to be realistic about the fundamental \nchallenges facing Burma on its road to reform. The country faces major \nchallenges on many fronts stemming from a half century of bad \ngovernance and economic mismanagement. In this post-junta period the \nBurmese people need our help, and bilateral trade can do just that. It \ncan help improve Burmese lives and show the people of Burma that a move \ntoward greater political openness under a new government brings with it \ntangible benefits in their daily lives.\n  A Burmese Government that is more representative of its people and \nreforming economically will be positioned to contribute to ASEAN \nregional stability and grow increasingly independent within the region.\n  While I am pleased with the progress we have already seen, I would \nnote I am not--repeat, not--fully satisfied with the progress Burma has \nmade so far. Much more needs to be done. The 2015 elections will be a \nvital indicator of how strong the reform movement is within Burma.\n  In my view there are several other important benchmarks we will need \nto see achieved going forward. For example, all parties within Burma \nmust work to reduce the clashes between the military and ethnic \nminority groups and begin political dialogue toward peaceful \nreconciliation. All parties within Burma need to work to diminish \nsectarian strife between Buddhists and Muslims. Any arms trade between \nNorth Korea and Burma needs to stop--now.\n  The Burmese constitution also needs amending in several areas. For \nexample, provisions specifically designed to exclude Suu Kyi from \nrunning for President need to be changed. Complete and unconditional \nrelease of political prisoners needs to be undertaken. The military \nshould increasingly be brought under civilian control. Finally, other \nreforms in progress involving enhanced rule of law, protection of \nprivate property, and government accountability need to take place.\n\n  I make this appeal to my colleagues in light of the visit of Burmese \nPresident Thein Sein to Washington this week. This is an important \nvisit reflecting many of the dramatic changes that have taken place in \nBurma. It follows on the heels of Daw Aung Suu Kyi's landmark visit \nlast fall and President Obama's visit to Burma last year.\n  Many of us who have followed Burma for years--in my case, two \ndecades--never thought we would see this reform come to this troubled \ncountry. This is an important moment. I believe it is time for Congress \nto take responsible action to continue to promote progress by \nencouraging those who are risking much--very much--within Burma while \nstill leaving in place other sanctions in order to encourage further \nreform. A decision not to renew the sanctions is an important step in \nthat direction. To do otherwise could send the wrong signal to the \nwrong people.\n  So as a Congress, let's continue to vigorously support democracy and \npeaceful reconciliation in Burma, but let's do so by taking a positive \nstep forward with regard to our sanctions policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I see my friend from Louisiana wishing \nto speak, but I have a unanimous consent request first.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 4:05--5 minutes after 4--the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Roberts amendment, No. 948; that \nthere be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote; that the time until 4:05 be divided with 10 minutes for \nSenator Vitter and the remaining time to be equally divided on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to present two amendments I have \nfiled on this farm bill, and I will be pushing hard for votes on them \nright now. I hope these get a full and extensive debate and a vote. \nThey are relevant and related to the farm bill in significant ways.\n  The first amendment is with regard to the free government cell phone \nprogram, and of course that uses as criteria for eligibility the food \nstamp program and other benefit programs, so it is directly related to \nthat aspect of the farm bill.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this program has been exploding almost \nwithout limit, and I have some fundamental concerns about it. My \nfundamental concerns are pretty simple and pretty basic. They come down \nto two things: First of all, I think the whole program is an \nentitlement mentality gone wild; that we have started the notion that \nfolks are entitled to the government, the taxpayer, providing them \nalmost everything under the sun; and, secondly, and not unrelated, \nthere has been widespread fraud and abuse in this program, and I am \nconvinced it is at the core of this program and can't be scrubbed out.\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n  What is the program we are talking about? Well, it is the free \ngovernment cell phone program. It was started in 2008, and in just \nthose few years since then it has grown from $143 million that year, \nwhich itself is a significant amount of money, to nearly $2 billion \nnow--an elevenfold increase. This program is paid for by you and by me. \nIt is paid for through our land line and cell phone bills. We all get a \ncharge on our bills. So if you actually pay your phone bill, land line, \nand/or cell phone, you get a charge and you pay that charge and that is \nwhat funds this program. So ratepayers, taxpayers, citizens, millions \nupon millions around the country pay for this program.\n  The FCC itself--and the FCC is in charge of the program--estimates \nthat about 270,000 beneficiaries have more than one of these free \ngovernment cell phones. That is interesting, that is important because \nthat is completely against the law and against the rules--completely \nprohibited. The FCC also says the top five companies that benefit from \nthe program could not confirm the eligibility of 41 percent of the \nfolks they signed up. This is from a report in 2011. The FCC did some \nspot-checking and found that 41 percent of the folks these companies \nsigned up couldn't be confirmed as eligible.\n  This has led one of my colleagues, Claire McCaskill, Democrat of \nMissouri, to say the program is rife for fraud, with a ``history of \nextreme waste and abuse.'' That is what my objections are all about--\nrampant waste and abuse and a general entitlement mentality that I \nthink has gone too far.\n  The amendment I offer on this bill, which is at the desk, would \nsimply and completely end the program with regard to free government \ncell phones. Someone might argue: Oh, these programs are being fixed. \nWe are making great strides.\n  Well, I was interested in seeing how far we have come, so this very \nweekend I was talking to a friend of mine back in Louisiana, Clarence, \nand he was interested in that too. So Monday--yesterday--he decided to \ngo to one of these outlets that advertises free government cell phones \nand just see what his experience was.\n  So he walked in and simply told the truth; that he was interested in \ngetting a free government cell phone. He was asked: Are you now on any \ngovernment benefit program, such as food stamps?\n  He answered truthfully: No. He said: I have a job. I don't make a lot \nof money. That was the truth.\n  He was asked to produce two things: a driver's license and a pay \nstub. He showed the people at the counter both of those things. They \nlooked at them. Interestingly, they certainly didn't make any copies. \nThey certainly didn't create any documentation because that could \npotentially get them in trouble.\n  They looked at his documents and gave him a form he had to sign once, \nand then they immediately gave him a free government cell phone. The \nphone was on, it worked immediately, it had minutes on it that he could \nimmediately use. He walked out of that storefront in less than 10 \nminutes with a free government cell phone.\n\n  He then looked up the precise eligibility criteria of the program, \nwhich he did not know before. Guess what. Surprise, surprise. He did \nnot qualify. He should never have gotten one. So he is returning it \ntoday. It will also be interesting to see how long that phone is kept \non even after he returns it because the provider gets $9.25 from the \nratepayer and the taxpayer and the FCC every month for that account.\n  This is his, Clarence's, free government cell phone. This is his \nreceipt. The charge is zero, absolutely free, and completely contrary \nto all of the rules of the program, which is why he is returning it \ntoday.\n  We have serious spending and fiscal challenges in this country, but \nwe have an even greater challenge, which is we have lost the faith and \nconfidence of the American people. We have lost it because of this. We \nhave lost it because there are tents popping out on every street \ncorner. They are handing out these free government cell phones like \ncandy. And why is that happening? Because the people handing out the \nphones have a vested interest in doing that, have a vested interest in \nnot worrying about whether eligibility criteria are met because every \ntime they hand out a phone they get $9.25 per phone per month as long \nas they can sustain that gravy train.\n  They are the biggest welfare abusers of this--rich owners of \ncompanies who milk the system to get richer, whom I would call \ngovernment welfare kings.\n  This abuse needs to stop. We need to recapture the confidence of the \nAmerican people. My amendment would help do that.\n  I will also be presenting and pushing for a vote on an amendment to \nlimit and bar certain people from receiving any food stamp benefits. \nThose are folks who have been convicted of violent and serious crimes \nsuch as violent rapists, pedophiles, and murderers. There is a \nmisconception that ban is already in the law. In fact, it is not. In \nfact, the only ban that exists is for drug felons and in the law is an \nopt-out for States so the State can opt out of even that ban.\n  My second amendment is simple and straightforward. It would establish \na complete ban in the program for anyone who has committed a violent \nrape, a crime of pedophilia or a murder. There would be no opt-out for \nStates.\n  I hope we can form a bipartisan consensus around this basic idea and \nput that basic fundamental limitation in the law. I urge my colleagues \nto look at both of these amendments and support both of these \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining. The Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Presiding Officer \nplease inform the Senator on how much time we have divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 40 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that 2 minutes be granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this is an amendment I have worked on \nconsiderably, along with Senator Thune, Senator Johanns, others on the \nAgriculture Committee, and others as well. We can restore integrity to \nthe SNAP program while providing benefits to those truly in need. Let \nme emphasize that--while providing benefits to those truly in need. We \nare not touching those while we will save an additional $31 billion; \n$31 billion as compared to what? Compared to $800 billion over 10 \nyears. If we cannot at least make those kinds of savings, $31 billion \nto $800 billion, we have problems. I am not proposing a dramatic change \nin the policy of nutrition programs, such as block granting programs to \nStates would represent; instead, this amendment would enforce the \nprinciples of good government and return SNAP spending to more \nresponsible levels.\n  SNAP was exempted from across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. \nHowever, it is clear there are areas within the program that could \nprovide significant savings that were left untouched. Enacting these \nreforms would allow the Federal Government to continue to help those \nwho truly need Federal benefits and assistance but also enact needed \nreforms. Otherwise, food stamps and SNAP will continue to be a target. \nI don't want that. I think we can restore integrity to the program. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. This goes way beyond what we have done in the committee, \nwhich is to focus on waste, fraud, and abuse and make sure there is \nintegrity in the program, to make sure supplemental nutrition \nassistance goes to families who have been working hard all their lives, \npaying taxes, who fall on hard times and need some temporary help. \nThis, in fact, would have a nine times higher cut than what we reported \nout of the committee on a bipartisan vote. It would undercut what we \nare trying to do in employment and training, which is so critical.\n  We all want people to have the opportunity to get back to work. We \nare seeing now, in the area of nutrition, the costs are now going down \nthe way they should be, which is people are getting back to work and no \nlonger needing the help. That is the way we should reduce it, in \naddition to tackling waste, fraud, and abuse, as we do in this bill.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Roberts \namendment.\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe 5 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nGillibrand amendment No. 931; that there be no second-degree amendments \nin order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment \nbecause when Congress proposes to cut the Food Stamp Program, it is not \nnameless, faceless people looking for a handout who suffer. It is \nchildren. It is veterans. It is Active-Duty servicemembers. It is hard-\nworking adults. We have to stand by them in the way they have stood by \nus. The reality of this amendment is that half of the recipients of \nfood stamps are children, 8 percent are seniors, and 1.4 million \nveteran households receive food stamps.\n  Some of my colleagues believe this is some loophole we are closing, \nbut the fact is these programs were designed for efficiency as part of \nwelfare reform. When we put this LIHEAP program in place--the ``heat \nand eat'' program--it was to say families living in cold weather States \nthat have high heating bills need extra money to put food on the table. \nThis particular provision is for people in rental apartments who do not \nhave a heating bill but are also having their heat included in their \nrent. These Governors in ``heat and eat'' States have said we want to \nmake sure our recipients of food stamps are eligible for this benefit \nbecause they need it. Children, seniors, veterans, Active-Duty \nservicemembers deserve to have food on their table.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  No, no, no, no; we are not cutting anybody's benefits that the \ndistinguished Senator from New York is talking about. This amendment \nwould effectively shield over 80 percent of the farm bill from any \ndeficit reduction and prevent the bill from addressing a serious breach \nin the nutrition program. The distinguished chairperson of the \nAgriculture Committee, the Senator from Michigan, already has included \nthe provision in the bill. To say the chairperson is against food \nstamps for needy people is ridiculous.\n  It is important to note this amendment does more than create in a \nState what is called the LIHEAP loophole which we don't want; this \namendment also cuts crop insurance. That is the No. 1 priority of \nAmerican farmers today. It is one of the great success stories. It was \ndeveloped as a way to help farmers manage their own risks, have skin in \nthe game, and head off the need for costly, inefficient, ad hoc \ndisaster programs. These types of cuts can be difficult to absorb. When \nwe are in the third year of drought is not the time to change them.\n  I also wish to add the Senator from New York has been a champion of \nexpanding crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, organic crops in \nher home State. I just think that perhaps she is misinformed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 9 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition. I am a \nfull supporter of this program to make sure families who find \nthemselves in a situation beyond their control because of the economy, \nbecause of what has been happening to so many around the country, get \nthe temporary help they need. What we have done in the farm bill is \nfocus on those areas where there has been fraud or abuse or, in this \ncase, misuse of actually a very good program to be able to provide \nassistance in terms of heat and food. But there are a few States--mine \nis one of them--that have gone beyond and are misusing a well-intended \nprogram.\n  I believe in fighting for the integrity of these programs so we can \ncontinue to fight for increased help for people who truly need it, and \nI believe what we have done in the bill meets the test of integrity and \nis defensible and addresses legitimate concerns raised about the misuse \nand fraud of programs.\n  So I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has now been 59 days since the Senate \nand the House passed our budget resolutions. The American people are \nnow expecting us to get together and do everything possible to bridge \nthe partisan divide and come to a bipartisan deal. On this side the \nSenate Democrats are ready to get to work. Unfortunately, despite their \nfocus over the past 2 years on the need to return to regular order, \nRepublicans have been refusing to allow us to move to a bipartisan \nbudget conference.\n  Many Republicans, including the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Sessions, had been very clear up until recently that \nafter the Senate engages in an open and fair budget markup process--and \nthese are his words--``the work of conferencing must begin.''\n  Minority Leader McConnell said in January that if the Senate budget \nis different from the House budget, then ``send it off to conference. \nThat's how things used to work around here. We used to call it \nlegislating.'' I could not agree more with Minority Leader McConnell's \nwords from back in January. Over the past few weeks we have tried to \nmove to conference eight times, and each time Senate Republicans have \nstood and said no.\n  They have managed to stall for weeks now, but their excuses for not \nwanting to move to conference are changing. At first Republicans told \nus that we needed ``a framework'' before they would allow us to move to \nconference, although they never explained what that meant. And, \nfrankly, a budget is a framework. Then the story changed, and they told \nus they would only let us move to conference if we made certain \nguarantees about the outcome. Then last week the story changed again, \nand Senate Republicans claimed that despite the fact that we engaged in \na fair and open budget process in the Senate less than 2 months ago, \nthey think we need a do-over, with another 50 hours of debate on top of \nthe 50 hours we have already done and another round of unlimited \namendments on top of the unlimited amendments that were moved already.\n  This is absurd. First of all, to claim that regular order involves a \nsecond full Senate budget debate is simply not true. The Senate has \nnever been forced to go through a full debate and open amendment \nprocess twice just to get to conference--not one case. Completely \nunprecedented. In fact, every single time since 1994 that the Senate \nmoved to conference, it was done by unanimous consent, with bipartisan \nsupport, which is the way it ought to be done.\n  Second of all, the Senate engaged in a full and open debate in which \nany Member could offer any budget amendment they wanted to. We did that \na few months ago. I know all of my colleagues remember this. I \ncertainly remember this.\n  I would be happy to quote some of what was said about the process if \nany reminders are needed because as that debate came to a close in the \nwee hours of the morning, Minority Leader McConnell said the Senate had \njust engaged in ``an open and complete and full debate.'' He continued \nand said, ``I know everyone is exhausted, and people may not feel it at \nthe moment, but this is one of the Senate's finest days in recent \nyears, and I commend everyone who has participated in this \nextraordinary debate.''\n  My ranking member, Senator Sessions, said the Budget Committee markup \nwas ``an open process'' where ``everybody had the ability to offer \namendments.''\n  Senator Sessions said on the floor, as debate was wrapping up, he was \nthankful that the Republicans had ``free ability to speak and debate'' \nand for ``helping us move a lot of amendments fairly and equitably \ntonight.''\n  There is no question the Senate engaged in a fair and open and \nlengthy debate about the budget before we passed it. There is \nabsolutely no good reason to ask that we do this all over unless the \nintention is to simply stall the process and push us closer to a \ncrisis.\n  Instead of scrambling to find new excuses for their budget conference \nflipflops, I hope Senate Republicans realize their opposition to \nbipartisan negotiations is not sustainable and will not allow us to get \nto the table and move on this matter.\n  I know there are Members who do not agree with the budget that was \npassed. They will have another opportunity to fight for changes in a \nbipartisan conference, which is how we do this. That is the responsible \nand appropriate path forward, and I hope the Senate Republican leaders \ndecide to move back to the position they maintained just a few months \nago. I know a number of our colleagues on the Republican side have said \nto me privately and in public that they believe we should move to \nconference. I hope we can do that. The challenges before our country in \nterms of our debt and deficit and the investments that need to be made \nand the certainty that Americans are looking to us for cannot be \ncompleted until we go to conference and work out our differences and \ncome back and move this forward.\n  I hope this time when I ask for unanimous consent to go to conference \nSenate Republicans will join with us so the American people can see an \nopen conference move to a debate and solve this very challenging \nproblem we have in front of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the \ndesk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table; \nthat the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; and that the chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to object, it has now been 59 days that \nthe opposition has been trying to orchestrate a backroom deal to raise \nthe debt ceiling. Raising the debt ceiling is an incredibly important \ndebate and shouldn't be done in the back room by a few people. It \nshouldn't be done through parliamentary trickery or chicanery. It \nshould be done out in the full and open and under the ordinary rules of \nthe Senate.\n  We are now borrowing $40,000 every second, $4 billion a day. We must \nborrow from China to run the ordinary functions of our government. In \nfact, it is worse. We borrow from China to send money to China. We \nborrow money from China to send money to Pakistan. We build bridges in \nPakistan with money borrowed from China. It can't go on. No American \nfamily can continue to spend money endlessly that they don't have.\n  All we are asking is for a commonsense resolution that says we can't \nkeep borrowing.\n  What I ask is unanimous consent that the Senator modify her request \nso\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nthat it not be in order for the Senate to consider a conference report \nthat includes reconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit. I \nask that as a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will reserve the right to object to the modification, \nand I will object in just a moment.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nthat for 4 years--for 4 years--we complained about the fact that the \nmajority leader, whom I see on the floor, refused to bring a budget to \nthe floor of the Senate. Then, in what most of us believe was a proud \nmoment--I thought it was a pretty tiring experience at my age, voting \nall night--we approved or disapproved of 70 meaningless amendments.\n  The fact is, we did a budget. All of us patted ourselves on the back, \nand we were so proud that we did the budget. By golly, now we will move \nwith the House of Representatives and we will have a budget and, \nhopefully, at least begin negotiations with the House of \nRepresentatives, in which the majority is Republicans--not Democrats, \nRepublicans. We would decide we were going to do that. Now we are going \nto, according to the objection and the unanimous consent that was just \nasked for, in an unprecedented way, put restrictions on the conferees.\n  The way we usually do it is what I am about to do; that is, we \ninstruct the conferees. We don't require the conferees because that is \nwhy we appoint conferees, and that is why we approve or disapprove of \nthe result of that conference. That is how our laws are made, and that \nis how our budgets are made.\n  What do we keep doing? What do we on my side of the aisle keep doing? \nWe don't want a budget unless we put requirements on the conferees that \nare absolutely out of line and unprecedented.\n  All I say to my colleagues is, can't we, after all those hours--I \nforget what hour in the morning it was--after all those votes, after \nall that debate and all that discussion, we came up with a budget and \nnow we will not go to conference, why is that?\n  I will object to the modification the Senator from Kentucky just \nasked for in a moment, but I would first ask consent that the original \nrequest by the Senator from Washington include two motions: to instruct \nthe conferees, one related to the debt limit, and one related to taxes. \nThat is the way we should do business in the Senate. It is instructions \nto the conferees.\n  The Senator from Washington may not like those instructions, but the \nfact is that is the way we do business, not require the conferees to \ntake certain measures. If my colleagues on this side of the aisle think \nwe are helping our cause as fiscal conservatives by blocking going to a \nconference on the budget--which every family in America has to be on \nbecause of certain requirements they demand--then we are not helping \nourselves with the American people at all.\n  I will object to the modification proposed by the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  I would first ask consent that the original request by the Senator \nfrom Washington include two motions to instruct the conferees: one \nrelated to the debt limit and one related to taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for further \nmodification?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to object, we are talking about two \ndifferent issues. We have passed budgets year in and year out. We \ncontinue to pass budgets. Of course, the budgets on our side don't \nraise taxes; the budgets on the other side raise taxes by $1 trillion. \nThere are parliamentary rules for how we address separate issues such \nas the debt ceiling.\n  What we are concerned about, and all we are asking the opposition to \ndo--including opposition within both parties to do--is that the debt \nceiling vote be a separate vote and that it not be stuck in the dead of \nnight in a conference committee with very few people, selected by very \nfew people. We have a big party on our side that can include people \nwith many different opinions, some who are very concerned about the \ndebt ceiling and the direction of our country and some who are \nconcerned very much about the debt, so much so that our resilience will \nnot flag. We will maintain the position that throwing our country into \nfurther debt is wrong for the country. I think most Americans can \nunderstand that.\n  We are $16 trillion in debt. We are passing this debt on to our \nchildren. It is inexcusable. Somebody must make a stand. Several of us \nare making a stand--not against a budget but in saying we cannot keep \nraising the debt ceiling; we cannot keep adding debt to our country. \nThis burden is going to be passed on to our kids and grandkids. We are \nmaking a stand, and so I object to a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request?\n  Mr. PAUL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I just want to associate myself with \nthe comments of the Senator from Arizona. It is accurate that no one on \nour side of the aisle supported the final budget.\n  The fact is, for the first time in years, a budget was brought to the \nSenate floor. Senator Murray presided over a very open process with \ndebate and with plenty of opportunity for amendments to be offered. \nThere is simply no reason the very reasonable approach suggested by \nSenator McCain that would allow us to go to conference should not be \nadopted.\n  We have called repeatedly for a return to regular order in this body. \nRegular order is going to conference. Both the House and the Senate \nhave passed budget resolutions, and it is important that there be a \nconference committee to work out the differences, which are \nconsiderable, so that we will have a framework with binding allocations \nfor the Appropriations Committees.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question, just one question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that the people with whom the conference \nwould be held on the other side of the Capitol happen to be a majority \nof our party? So we don't trust the majority party on the other side of \nthe aisle to come to conference and not hold to the fiscal discipline \nwe want to see happen; isn't that a little bit bizarre?\n  Ms. COLLINS. It certainly is ironic at the least. It is an \nopportunity for the Republican House to argue for its budget.\n  I voted against the final version of the Senate budget, but I think \nwe should go to conference and try to work out an agreement. The \ninstructions suggested by the Senator from Arizona are entirely \nreasonable.\n  Let's get on with the process. Let's do what the American people \nexpect us to do; that is, to negotiate a conference report that then \nwould be brought back to both Houses for consideration. That is what I \nurge my colleagues to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I, of course, admire--and have for many years now--the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. She is a renowned Senator. She is \nvery good at what she does. We are very proud of her.\n  We have just heard something that is unusual. We heard my friend from \nArizona--the Senator and I came together to Congress some 30-odd years \nago--and another outstanding Senator, Ms. Collins from Maine, come up \nwith a novel idea. It is kind of old-fashioned, but it is called \nregular order.\n  What they are saying we should do is go to conference. We have had in \nyears past many motions to instruct. That is the way we used to do \nthings around here. To get off-base on a debt ceiling matter has \nnothing to do with what we are doing. Let's go to conference. I don't \nknow if when we go to conference we will get anything out of it, but we \nare sure going to try.\n  That is what this is all about. I can't imagine why after 2 months--\nafter 2 months--we can't go to conference and work something out.\n  The Republican leader has told me for a couple of years: Why don't we \ndo our appropriations bills? We have the former chair of the \nAppropriations Committee, who is now the ranking member on the \nAgriculture Committee, he knows as much as anyone here about financial \nmatters. He is a man who is a humble man, doesn't talk a lot--and I \ndon't want to speak for him--but I think everyone here wants this \ninstitution to continue, wants us to do regular order.\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n  I have heard this hue and cry for quite some time on the other side. \nI admire and appreciate very much the Senator from Arizona instigating \nold-fashioned regular order, which we need to do in this body a lot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. There is nothing to object to.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The issue before this body is not a budget. The issue \nbefore this body is not going to conference. The issue before this body \nis one thing in particular: It is the debt ceiling and whether the \nSenate will be able to raise the debt ceiling using a procedural back \ndoor that would allow only 51 votes.\n  My friend from Nevada, my friend from Washington State, both of them \ncould go to conference on the budget right now today if they would \nsimply agree this budget would not be used as a back door to use a \nprocedural trick to raise the debt limit--not on 60 votes but on 50 \nvotes.\n  I commend their candor, because neither one of them is willing to \nmake that representation, and that is commendable. But I would point \nout that nothing in the budget we debated raised the debt ceiling. I \nwould suggest the American people are not interested in procedural \ngames. I think they are tired of games by the Democrats and tired of \ngames by the Republicans. What they are interested in is leadership in \nthis body to address the enormous fiscal and economic challenges facing \nthis country.\n  Our national debt is nearly $17 trillion. It is larger than the size \nof our entire economy. In the last 4 years our economy has grown 0.9 \npercent a year, with 23 million people struggling to find jobs. This \nbody should be debating every day how we get the economy moving, how we \nget people back to work, how we stop our unsustainable debt. Instead of \ndoing that, 2 weeks ago we spent a week voting to add $23 billion in \nnew taxes to small retailers online, creating an Internet sales tax--\ngoing backwards, killing economic growth and killing jobs.\n  This issue is very simple: Will the Senate allow a procedural back \ndoor to raise the debt ceiling and doing so while not fixing any of the \nproblems?\n  My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle believe we should \nraise the debt ceiling with no conditions, with no changes, with no \nspending reforms, with no progrowth reforms, with nothing to stop this \nunsustainable spending. The President likewise has said: Raise the debt \nceiling with no conditions. That is why, I would submit, the majority \nleader is not willing to agree: No, this budget conference report will \nnot be used to raise the debt ceiling, because it is precisely the hope \nto do so. This body may well vote to raise the debt ceiling. But if \nthis body votes to raise the debt ceiling, we should do so after a fair \nand open debate, where the issue is considered and where the threshold \nis the traditional 60-vote threshold and we can address what I think is \nimperative--that we fix the problem.\n  When I travel across the State of Texas, men and women stop me all \nthe time and say: Enough of the games. Go up there, roll up your \nsleeves, work with each other and fix the problem. Getting a new credit \ncard--jacking up the debt ceiling--with no spending reforms, no \nstructural reforms, no progrowth reforms is a mistake and it is the \nwrong path.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is the problem. The people in my State are saying \nthe same thing: Roll up your sleeves and attack the problems. Because, \nguess what. I remember when this budget was balanced, when Bill Clinton \nwas President. It took literally a few months before George W. Bush \ngave a tax break and put it on the credit card, two wars on the credit \ncard, and the debt was off and running.\n  But put that aside, we are where we are. Does my friend not think if \nwe could get into a conference--and I know a lot of us here have been \nin tough conferences--that is where we would roll up our sleeves? I say \nPatty Murray and Paul Ryan are ready to roll up their sleeves and get \nto work. Why would my friend want to give instructions--of course, I \nwould love to give instructions. I would like to give instructions the \nrichest of Americans pay the same effective tax rate as their \nsecretaries. I would love to do that. I would love to order that, but I \nwouldn't do that.\n  Let Patty Murray and Paul Ryan and the respective committees get in \nthere, in an open process, and come back. Doesn't my friend understand \nwhat he is calling for, when he says roll up your sleeves and get to \nwork, is exactly what Senators Murray, McCain, Collins, and lots of us \nwant to do, those of us who believe we need to use regular order? Can \nmy friend comment on that?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from California for that question. She \nmay well be right, that one of the reasons spending is out of control \nis that we no longer have Bill Clinton as President and a Republican \nCongress. Instead we have President Obama who has expanded spending \nmore than any other President in modern times.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator skipped over George W. Bush, who caused the \ndeficits. But let's not argue that.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from California, but I have been quite \nvocal that both Democrats and Republicans have contributed to getting \nus in this mess, and we need leadership from both parties to turn it \naround.\n  I would note in the question the Senator from California raised, she \ndid not say one word about not raising the debt ceiling using 51 votes. \nAnd everything else about this debate is all smoke. It is all about one \nthing, which is do we give an unlimited credit card to the Federal \nGovernment to raise the debt ceiling $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $5 \ntrillion, $10 trillion.\n  If the result of reconciliation was raising the debt ceiling $10 \ntrillion, it would come back----\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for one more question? Then I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield as soon as I finish this point. I will \nbe happy to yield after that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If we went to a conference committee and it came back on \nreconciliation to raise the debt ceiling by $10 trillion, then under \nreconciliation rules, 51 Senators--only the Democrats--could vote to do \nso, and the Republicans would be utterly silenced from participating in \nanything there. It may well be----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question? Does the Senator \nexpect the House of Representatives, a Republican majority in the House \nof Representatives, would not participate in that vote?\n  Mr. CRUZ. What I expect is that each of us is obliged to carry out \nour responsibility to defend the interests of our States. I have 26 \nmillion Texans who I am not willing to go to and say, if they ask \nme: Why did you go along with the procedural game to raise the debt \nceiling, to allow Republicans in the Senate to be shut out, to give up \nany ability to force progrowth reforms, to get jobs back, to get the \neconomy back, to get people working, why did you give up----\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Does the Senator expect he would not have a vote at the end of a day \nafter a conference comes back from the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. CRUZ. We may well have a vote, but if we had a vote----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And isn't that a democratic process?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The vote would be a 51-vote threshold, which would mean--\nand my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle have been very \nexplicit that in their collective judgment the debt ceiling should be \nraised with no conditions. Given that----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Can the Senator answer my question? Does the Senator \nfrom Texas understand the House of Representatives also would have to \npass this? They are a Republican majority.\n  And, by the way, we are not talking about whether we should pay the \nbills this country is already obliged to pay. We are talking about \nputting a budget framework forward for the next 10\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nyears. We had a terrific debate about that and the Senator from Texas \nparticipated in that and offered amendments. He had an opportunity to \ndo that.\n  The House of Representatives did the exact same thing. At the end of \nthe day, the way a legislative democratic process works is the two \nbodies come together and it will have to pass whatever our conference \nagrees to with a majority of Republicans in the House and a majority in \nthe Senate with Democrats. That is going to be where the Senator from \nTexas will have an opportunity to say yes or no to a conference.\n  So I don't understand the Senator saying he would not participate. He \nhas a vote. That is how the Senate works.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the efforts of my friend from Washington to \ndefend the prerogative of the Republican House. What I would suggest is \nthat each of us has a responsibility to our States.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. With your vote.\n  Mr. CRUZ. With our vote, but also to defend the ability to have our \nvote matter, to have it make a difference. Because if this procedural \ntrick is allowed to go forward, what it would mean--this fight right \nnow is the fight over the debt ceiling. Because what it would mean, if \nwe go to a conference committee, as sure as night follows day, we would \nfind ourselves in a month or two with a debt ceiling increase coming \nback and the Democrats in this body voting to raise the debt ceiling \nwith no conditions whatsoever, which is what the President has asked \nfor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? And I thank him so \nmuch.\n  Listen, let's cut through what is happening and tell me where I am \nwrong, and I would respect the Senator's answer. The Senator represents \na lot of folks, I represent 38 million, so we are two big States and we \nowe a lot to our people. That is for sure. What is happening here today \nis very clear. The Republicans, except for Senator McCain and Senator \nCollins, who were here, are stopping us--this Nation--from having a \nbudget, and they are saying their reason is that something might happen \nin the conference. Well, that is not the way we work in a democracy. \nAnything can happen at any moment.\n  Let's get into that conference. Paul Ryan has a budget that I think \nis apocalyptic and that the Senator from Texas may well support. Patty \nMurray has a budget that the Senator probably thinks is apocalyptic. \nThey want to get into that conference and they want to work together. \nThat is called democracy.\n  I will close with this and ask my friend to respond. Ronald Reagan \nsupported raising the debt ceiling about 18 times. He put out a number \nof statements that were totally counter to my friend's. Ronald Reagan \nsaid--and I am paraphrasing, and I will get the exact quote and put it \nin the Record, as I have done in the past--even thinking about \ndefaulting on the government's bills is enough to send shock waves \nthrough the country.\n  The last time the Republicans played that game it cost us $19 \nbillion. We cannot afford that. My friends say they are conservatives, \nbut they are leading us down that road. I beg them to think about what \nthey are doing. I beg them to have faith and trust in this democracy. I \nbeg them to let the people who are very responsible in the House and in \nthe Senate, who are on different wavelengths when it comes to this \nbudget, get to work. And to quote my friend, let them get to the place \nwhere they can roll up their sleeves and get the job done.\n  I think by my friend's continuing presence to stop us from having a \nbudget, he is doing a great disservice not only to this country but to \nhis party.\n\n  That is it for me.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. PAUL. This is a debate, and it is a good debate, because it is a \ndebate about the debt ceiling. I am actually in favor of allowing the \ndebt ceiling to go up under certain conditions where we reform things. \nI think it is unconscionable not to do anything, to simply say: Here is \na blank check, keep doing what you have been doing.\n  We are running the country into the ground. We are borrowing $40,000 \na second. Should we not talk about reform in the process? Many of us \nsupported last time around raising the debt ceiling in exchange for a \nbalanced budget amendment. Seventy-five to 80 percent of the public \nthinks we should balance our budget. They have to, why shouldn't we?\n  I would ask the Senator: Is he not hearing from his people at home \nthat the debt ceiling should not be done in secret, that it should be \ndone, and if it is going to be done, it should be attached to \nsignificant budgetary reform?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Kentucky, and that is exactly what I \nam hearing from men and women throughout Texas.\n  I would note for the Senator from California and the Senator from \nWashington that I respect the sincerity of their beliefs, that they \ngenuinely believe the Democratic budget passed by this body is the \nproper course for this country; that the proper course is to raise \ntaxes yet another $1 trillion on top of the $1.7 trillion that taxes \nhave already increased. They genuinely believe the proper course is \nnever to balance the budget and allow massive deficits to extend into \nperpetuity.\n  I respect the sincerity of their views, but at the same time I \nbelieve those views are inconsistent with the best interests of this \ncountry; that the best interests of this country are to restore \neconomic growth, are to get back to historic levels of growth that \nallow small businesses to thrive and, in particular, allow the most \nvulnerable among us to work and to achieve the American dream.\n  In the last 4 years, under President Obama, we have had 4 consecutive \nyears of less than 1 percent average growth in the economy. I refer to \nthis period as the ``great stagnation.'' The people who have been hurt \nthe most during the great stagnation have been young people, have been \nHispanics, African Americans, and single moms. Right now, if we look at \nunemployment, unemployment for those without a high school degree is \nover 11 percent, for Hispanics it is nearly 10 percent, for African \nAmericans it is nearly 14 percent, and for young people it is over 25 \npercent.\n  When this country has massive spending, massive debt, massive \nregulation, and massive taxes, the result is that small businesses are \nstrangled and die, and the people who lose their jobs are the single \nmoms who are struggling to provide for their kids at home, like so many \nmoms now seeing their hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week because \nof the burdens of ObamaCare. I believe we have an obligation to the \nAmerican people to focus every day on turning the economy around, on \ngetting jobs back, and stopping our unsustainable debt.\n  My friend from California made reference to the prospect of a \ndefault. I absolutely agree the United States should never, ever, ever \ndefault on its debt, and that is the reason why I strongly support the \nlegislation introduced by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, \nthe Default Prevention Act, which says: In the event the debt ceiling \nis not raised, the United States will always pay its debts, pay the \ninterest on its debts, so we never default.\n  I would note my friends on the other side of the aisle right now \ncould join together in taking default off the table entirely.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator to yield for one final question. I \nknow they want to keep talking.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The irony of this is really astounding. By objecting to \nus going to conference, the Senate Republicans who are objecting are \nactually putting us right in the position of being in the place where \nthe debt ceiling, by virtue of timing, will have to--may be part of the \nbudget conference because the House of Representatives wants to appoint \nconferees and have a budget done fairly quickly once they appoint \nconferees because they have told us they do not want to go through a \nseries of votes as we all did. I think it is 20 days. If my colleagues \nobject to going to conference at this point----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now 5:30 having arrived----\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. By objecting to going to conference right now, what \nSenate Republicans who are objecting are doing is pushing us to a place \nwhere the debt limit, by virtue of timing, may be a part of the \ndiscussion. I ask the Senators to think about what they are doing by \ntheir objection, in forcing us into that position, and suggest that by \nallowing us to go to conference--we will have a better chance of not--\n--\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3652-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       AGRICULTURE REFORM, FOOD, AND JOBS ACT OF 2013--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I really appreciate the hard work of \nthe Senators from Michigan and Mississippi, moving a farm bill through \nthe Senate. It is one of the most important bills we will take up this \nyear. Action on this bill is long overdue. I am very hopeful we can \ncontinue to make progress and produce a bill that is excellent for \nevery region of our country. Of course, representing the South, we \nalways like to have special attention given to our agricultural needs. \nThe Senator from Michigan certainly has been attuned to the farmers in \nrural communities in Louisiana. We appreciate her leadership.\n  I come to the floor today, though, just for a few moments to speak \nabout the tragedy unfolding in Oklahoma, in Moore, OK, a city that was \ndevastated--portions of the city in the suburban areas--by a horrible \ntornado, one of the largest to hit our Nation in quite some time. While \nI do not know all of the details, I understand that it was a very high \nlevel tornado that stayed on the ground for almost 40 minutes. This was \nmiles wide and created a terrible path of destruction. There are, of \ncourse, adults and children who lost their lives. Recovery and rescue \nis still underway as I speak. I am certain that the delegations--both \nthe Senate and House Members from Oklahoma--are doing everything they \ncan, working with the Governor and local officials, to provide as much \nsupport as they will need.\n  I come to the floor as the chair of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity and I come to the floor as a Senator who unfortunately has had \na lot of experience in disasters to say how proud I am that there is \nabout $11 billion available, without the requirement or necessity of an \noffset, for the people of Oklahoma. This was a battle that was fought \nover a year ago, led by Senator Harry Reid and me and others. This \narrangement was made in the Budget Control Act so that there would be a \nsignificant pot of money set aside in the event that disasters such as \nthis happened, whether it was a tornado or an earthquake or a fire or a \nflood. It has happened again.\n  We don't know exactly when these disasters are going to happen. We \ndon't know the exact nature of them. But we most certainly know from \npast experience and everything that our science tells us about the \nchanges in the atmosphere that they are going to happen and that they \nare likely going to get worse. That is why I have been very focused on \nthis issue.\n  I am proud of this Senate, Republicans and Democrats, but I am very \nproud of the support of the Democratic leaders on this bill to say now \nis not the time--not this afternoon, not tomorrow morning, not Friday, \nnot Monday--to be debating offsets for victims of the Oklahoma tornado. \nAfter a disaster, our citizens do not need or want a debate on funding. \nWhat they want is help, and they are going to get it from the committee \nI chair.\n  Our people suffered so much in Katrina, Rita, and Gustav. I have \nwatched the east coast have to recover from Irene and from Sandy. I \nhave seen horrible tornadoes in Missouri. The last thing people want \nwhen they are digging their loved ones out of rubble and preparing, \nunfortunately, for funerals that are going to have to occur after what \nhappened--the last thing they want to see Congress do is debate about \nhow and when we are going to pay for this disaster. We are going to \nsend them the money they need to recover.\n  I want to say this to Senator Coburn, my good friend who is not on \nthe floor--I do respect his consistency on this issue. Even when a \ntornado hit his State, he is still calling for offsets. He has been \nconsistent, but in my view he has been consistently wrong. There will \nbe no offsets. There is no need for offsets. I will not support \noffsets. The majority of Democrats, if not the entire Democratic \ncaucus, will not support offsets for Americans in need in disasters. \nWhat we are going to do is support appropriate help and sufficient help \nfor them.\n  Let me say for the record that because of the Sandy supplemental--\nwhich I also fought for with my colleagues from the Northeast--we were \nable to put some reforms in that bill. It was not just ``send the money \nand do what you will with it.'' We sent money to the Northeast. We also \nsent them new tools in a bigger, stronger toolbox to help them with a \nbetter recovery.\n  We have a lot more to do in the Northeast. That is a subject for \nanother day. I realize they are in lots of difficulty. But we did send \nsome new tools that will help, even with Oklahoma.\n  First, we sent them the ability to quickly establish mutually agreed \nupon estimates for project costs. That has been a real problem with \nrecovery in the past, with local governments arguing one thing, the \nFeds offering something else. We now have a better, quicker process to \nagree on what the project costs to get it built more quickly. The \nproject cost will be validated by an independent panel of experts \nprotecting the taxpayer, which is important. Applicants are now allowed \nto consolidate projects in a commonsense way to build back smarter, \nreducing future recovery costs.\n  Most important for this disaster--we fought hard for this in Sandy--\nfinally, there are some provisions in the recovery bill that will allow \nchildren to be the center of attention. Sadly, we have lost some \nchildren in this disaster. Sadly, many children were injured and \nprobably thousands of children have been traumatized. But because of \nthe new bill we passed under Sandy, there are some provisions to help.\n  In addition, families can receive daycare now through their \nsupplemental, so the parents who are going to have to figure out a way \nto get back to work and rebuild their businesses and their communities \nand their houses can have some additional Federal childcare, which will \nhelp.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n  In addition, I think there are going to be more counselors on the \nground helping children than in past disasters.\n  I see colleagues on the floor, so let me finish quickly.\n  We have implemented an automated family reunification database to \nensure children are returned to parents. This is a relatively small \nplace, well known. We do not believe there are any children whose \nwhereabouts are unknown to their parents. All of the statistics, \nhowever, are not in of people missing, et cetera. But there are \nprovisions right now at work with FEMA helping with family \nreunification. Coordinators are already on the ground specialized in \nlooking out for the specific needs of children in disasters. I thank \nthe coalition that worked with me for years to put that into place.\n  Again, there will be no offset. There is no reason to need an offset. \nWe have the $11 billion, thanks to the good work of many people in this \nChamber and on the other side of this Capitol, to provide this funding \nfor these disasters. I know FEMA is on the ground. They will do the \nbest they can.\n  In this case, with tornado insurance, which is carried by many people \nin this area--I am doing a little bit more research into whether it is \nmandatory or voluntary--with a combination of local help and State help \nand Federal help and private insurance and, of course, the great spirit \nof voluntarism, I am confident that after we finish this very sad \nrecovery and shock this community is going through, that we will be \nable to help them build a stronger and more vibrant community of Moore, \nOK, in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today we were asked to give our \nconsent to go to conference on the budget resolution. This is an \nimportant matter because we have now gone more than 4 years without a \nbudget. This has been of great concern to many of us. I do not think \nthere is one Member of this body who would not want Congress to pass a \nbudget this year. We would like to see that happen. We need that.\n  We do, however, have a concern--some of us--with the request that we \ngo to conference without certain assurances. Most important, we want a \nvery simple assurance that any conference report that results from this \nconference will not be used to raise the debt limit. The reason for \nthis is simple. This is an important matter. At a time when we have \nracked up about $17 trillion in debt, we want some assurances that this \nimportant decision will be made under the regular order of the Senate; \nthat the normal rules of the Senate will apply; that this will not be \nnegotiated behind closed doors in a backroom deal. The American people \ndeserve more. They demand more.\n  Those who may have questioned our motives in connection with this, I \nask them a very simple question: Will you give us an assurance that you \nare not going to use the conference report to raise the debt limit? If \nthey can answer that question to our satisfaction, if they can simply \ngive me an assurance that is not what they are going to use it for, \nthen I will gladly give my consent. So I invite that to be the topic of \ndiscussion.\n  All this begs the question. Why would they not give that assurance? \nWhat on Earth is wrong with the regular order? What on Earth is wrong \nwith giving an assurance that, in connection with a conference report \non a budget resolution, they would not be willing to say: If we are \ngoing to raise the debt limit, we are going to do it under the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I was going to talk about the \ntornadoes, but I will take a moment to respond to my colleague from \nUtah.\n  There are Members objecting to going to regular order on the budget, \nand he is one of them. The Senator from Utah himself is objecting to \nregular order, which would allow us to go to conference on the budget. \nHe was one of the critics when he was running for office. He made \nnumerous statements while he was on his way to becoming a Senator by \nsaying that the Senate and the House needed to have a budget.\n  Well, the House has passed a budget, the Senate has passed a budget. \nYet the Senator from Utah is the one--along with the Senator from \nKentucky, and I understand earlier today, the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain--objecting to going to conference to resolve the \ndifferences.\n  I know the Senator from Utah has read the Constitution, just as I \nhave. The Constitution and the laws that created the Senate of the \nUnited States give great strength to the minority--and he is in the \nminority. However, nowhere in the Constitution does it say one Senator \nfrom one State has the right to write the rules and laws for the whole \ncountry. I read it lots of times, and I have never seen that. Evidently \nthat is what the Senator from Utah wants. He said if we would just do \nwhat he wants, we could proceed.\n  Well, I have news for him and the Senators who are objecting. It is \nnot about what they individually want. It is collectively what we want. \nWe represent all the people of our country: Republicans, Democrats, \nconservatives, and liberals.\n  For 4 years this same group yelled and screamed about not having a \nbudget. Now that we have a budget, they are yelling and screaming that \nthey don't want to work out the differences. I honestly don't know how \nto please colleagues like this. We had to literally listen to them \nranting and raving for years about how we didn't have a budget. We \nworked extra hard. At the time we said--and I was one of them--that \ntechnically they're right, we did not have a budget. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, we had something that was stronger than a budget. We had \nspending limits that had the real teeth of law.\n  What people might not realize is budgets are aspirations. Just as \nwhen someone does a budget at home, they can say: My budget this year \nis going to be set at $25,000. It is an aspiration. They might spend a \nlittle more or a little less. There is no mechanism for control; it is \njust an outline, and that is important.\n  We thought what we had, as the Democratic leadership, is better than \na budget. We had actual spending controls, but that wasn't enough for \nthe Republicans. They knew we had spending controls, but they still \nwent on ``Fox News'' and everywhere else explaining to people that we \nhad no budget and inferred there were no controls. And that is patently \nfalse. We had spending controls. We have spending controls now. We have \nspending limits which are agreed to by Republicans and Democrats, \nexcept there are a handful of Republicans who don't agree with those \nlimits. They decided because they represent half of four States that \nthey want their way or the highway, and now the whole Congress cannot \ngo to a conference on a budget.\n  I don't understand this. I understand minority rights need to be \nprotected. I understand it is important to make sure everyone's voice \nis heard. I understand everybody cannot get everything they want. I \ndon't understand when my colleagues--the Senator from Utah, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, and the Senator from Arizona--say: No, we can't go to a \nconference to work out the differences on the budget so the United \nStates can move more quickly to a balanced budget. They have complained \nyear after year that we didn't have a budget. It is the height of \nhypocrisy, and their position is completely unexplainable and \nunacceptable.\n  I am glad I was on the floor. I came to talk about the tornado, but I \nam glad I had a chance to make a statement for the Record about why not \nmany--but there are a few--Republican leaders have stopped the entire \nbudget process until they get their way exactly the way they want it. \nThat is not the way our government works. We don't have kings anymore. \nWe don't have dictators anymore. We don't have people with special \npowers. We are all humans, and we are all on equal footing. We are all \nelected to represent our constituents. No one in this Chamber is \nentitled to write the budget exactly the way they want it.\n  If I wanted to do something, I could say just as easily as he could: \nWell, I am going to object unless you promise me that X, Y, and Z are \ngoing to be in the budget. I could say that, as could\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nthe Senators who sit next to me, Senator Sanders and Senator Carper. \nEvery Senator could say that. We all have things which are very \nimportant to us and our constituency, but if we act like that and we \ndon't act in a mature and sensible way, we will never get anything \ndone, and that is where we are now.\n  We have a handful of Republican Senators--maybe less than five, I \ndon't know--who are objecting every day so we cannot take our budget to \nconference and have it reconciled. They have yelled at everybody for 4 \nyears about how we didn't have a budget.\n  The only way we are going to get a budget is to go to conference, \nhave regular order, and work out the differences in a public meeting \nwith public votes. It cannot happen behind closed doors or in some back \nroom somewhere. It has to take place in a public meeting, during a \nconference so we can talk about what programs or what levels of funding \nshould be reduced, such as what revenues could potentially be raised. \nThen, according to our process, those directions are given to \nappropriations committees. At that point we can do our work on building \nan appropriation for defense, building an appropriation for education, \nbuilding an appropriation for health, and for our veterans.\n  If we don't have a budget, we cannot even go to regular order on \nappropriations. As an appropriator, it is getting frustrating around \nhere to not be able to go to a regular appropriations meeting and sit \ndown as we used to do before this new crew showed up and talked about \nmeeting our budget caps and how we wanted to allocate the taxpayer \nmoney in a public, open meeting instead of cramming things in an \nomnibus bill and doing deals in the middle of the night.\n  If they would let us get back to regular order and do the people's \nbusiness, I promise that the people of Utah would be happy, the people \nof Arizona would be happy, and the people of Kentucky would be happy. \nThey want us to get back to regular order so we can try to negotiate a \nbudget that the majority--and not even the regular majority. We have to \nhave 60 votes to do anything around here. Before a conference committee \ncan come back, there has to be a broad understanding of what was going \nto be in that conference.\n  I have one final argument. I could understand a little trepidation on \nthe part of the minority if they were not in control of the House, but \nthe Republicans have control of the House, and the Democrats have \ncontrol of the Senate. I mean, I could understand their concern if one \nparty had the majority in both the Senate and the House. They might be \nconcerned that what comes out of conference could get rammed down and \nthe minority could be caught off balance. The minority controls the \nHouse. This is as fair a fight as they are going to have with one party \ncontrolling one and one party controlling the other.\n  Yes, the President is a Democrat, but he has indicated what I think \nis very open-minded support for entitlement reform when it is \nappropriate and additional revenues that are being raised. The \nPresident has not put any particular line in the sand that I am aware \nof. He has been quite reasonable, but he cannot sign a budget unless we \ncan get it to his desk.\n  We have three or four Senators, if they can't get it exactly the way \nthey want it, who are going to hold up everything. I don't think that \nis what the American people want, and I am disappointed in our \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3654-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARIE C. JOHNS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, next Friday, May 31, is my friend's--\nMarie C. Johns--last day as the Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration. She has served the SBA and our country's small \nbusinesses with distinction since 2010, and I will miss working with \nher.\n  Her appointment to serve as the Deputy Administrator came at a \ncritical time for U.S. small businesses, when the economy was \nrecovering from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. \nThe SBA needed great leadership, and she brought to the agency an \nimpressive family history of entrepreneurship and professional \naccomplishments.\n  As she said during her confirmation hearing on May 19, 2010, `` the \nspirit of entrepreneurship has been at the core of my professional and \npersonal life.'' She described the landscaping business her grandfather \nowned in Indianapolis, IN. And then later, after her uncle earned his \ndegree in pharmacy at Howard University, her grandfather built a \ncommunity pharmacy so that her uncle could practice as a pharmacist and \nserve the African-American community in Indianapolis. Marie built her \nown career in DC, starting as a first-level manager in \ntelecommunications and retiring as the president of Verizon DC. During \nher 20 years in communications, she held numerous leadership positions, \nhelping small businesses and entrepreneurs. To name just one, she \nserved as the chair of the Small Business Committee for the DC Chamber \nof Commerce, helping small businesses obtain technical assistance and \nmentoring from larger firms.\n  During her time as the SBA Deputy Administrator, Marie and I have \nenjoyed a strong working relationship, which has allowed us, alongside \nAdministrator Karen Mills, to achieve a number of substantial \naccomplishments. Most significantly, we passed the landmark Small \nBusiness Jobs Act of 2010 that provided billions of dollars of loans \nand investment capital to America's entrepreneurs. In 2011 and 2012, \nthe SBA issued its first and second rounds of State Trade and Export \nPromotion, STEP, grants to 47 States and four territories. These STEP \ngrants have maximized the Federal, State, and local resources to help \nsmall businesses export, which in turn has contributed to both business \ngrowth and job creation. And finally, we persevered and improved the \nwomen's contracting program to put women-owned small businesses on the \nsame playing field with other contracting programs so that contracts to \nwomen are no longer capped at artificially low amounts. Recently, on \nMay 8, marking her last time to testify before the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, Marie testified on the important issue of minority \nwomen entrepreneurs and how essential they are to the larger economy. \nThe testimony from that hearing was moving and educational and helped \nraise awareness of this growing segment of job creators.\n  It has been an honor to work with Marie to provide help and support \nto the more than 28 million small businesses in this country. During \nher tenure, the SBA became a more effective Federal champion of small \nbusinesses by assisting these businesses to secure financing, technical \nassistance, training, and Federal contracts.\n  Ms. Johns now leaves the SBA with a strong performance record. This \nNation's small businesses are in a better position because of her work. \nHer dedication to the improvement of the health of small businesses in \nthe United States will always be appreciated. I thank her for her work \nand wish her well as she returns to her many civic duties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3654-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3654-S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF ADMIRAL JAMES STAVRIDIS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I honor a superb leader, scholar, \nand warrior. After a lifetime of service to our Nation, ADM James G. \nStavridis is retiring from the U.S. Navy and his position as Commander \nof the United States European Command. On this occasion, I believe it \nis fitting to recognize Admiral Stavridis' years of distinguished \nuniformed service to our Nation.\n  The admiral is a 1976 distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. He has led at every level from command-at-sea to theater \ncommand. Admiral Stavridis has also served as a strategic planner for \nthe Chief of Naval Operations and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and as the senior military assistant to the Secretary of \nDefense. Prior to assuming command of the United States European \nCommand, he commanded the U.S. Southern Command, focused on Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. Admiral Stavridis assumed command of \nEuropean Command on June 30, 2009, the first naval officer to hold this \ncommand.\n  Admiral Stavridis' contributions to scholarship are also notable. He \nhas graduated with distinction from the Naval Academy, the Naval War \nCollege, the National War College, and the\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nFletcher School at Tufts University, where he earned a doctorate of \nphilosophy in international relations. He has been frequently published \nby many publications, including Foreign Affairs, and the United States \nNaval Institute's Proceedings. Admiral Stavridis was even featured in a \n2012 TED Global where he spoke about the future of global security.\n  His leadership has been consistently recognized formally and \ninformally, to include the Battenberg Cup for the top ship in the \nAtlantic Fleet, and the John Paul Jones Award for inspirational \nleadership. Admiral Stavridis' impact on the sailors and the fleet has \nbeen indelible. He is the author or coauthor of seminal works on naval \nleadership, including ``Command At Sea.'' His impact on soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines will continue well into the future.\n  Our Navy and our Nation will feel his absence. I join many past and \npresent members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in my gratitude \nto ADM James Stavridis for his outstanding leadership and his \nunwavering support of servicemembers. I wish him and his wife Laura \n``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3655-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. ELBERT B. SMITH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, with the recent death of Dr. Elbert B. \nSmith--known to his friends simply as ``E.B.''--I lost a much beloved \nmentor, advisor, and friend.\n  Obituaries in the Washington Post and elsewhere have captured the \nessential facts of his life. Since 1990, he was professor emeritus at \nthe University of Maryland. He served in the Navy in World War II, \nearned his master's degree and Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, and \ntaught at Iowa State University, among other colleges, before joining \nthe faculty at Maryland in 1968. Over the years, he also served as a \nFulbright professor at the University of Tokyo and at Moscow State \nUniversity, and elsewhere. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as \na Democrat in Iowa in 1962 and again in 1966.\n  What those factual obituaries fail to capture is the spirit of this \nremarkable man--his personal warmth, his talent for friendship, his \ngreat love of history and scholarship, and his passion for progressive \ncauses.\n  He was one of the most influential people in my life, beginning in my \nyears as an undergraduate at Iowa State University, where he was a \nhistory professor. He inspired me to get involved in politics and \npublic service. When he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1962, I got involved \nin his campaign. And what a campaign it was--an unconventional, \ninsurgent, student-run campaign against the status quo. This was 6 \nyears before Senator Eugene McCarthy ran a similar campaign for \nPresident.\n  While working on his campaign, I was also president of Young \nDemocrats at Iowa State, and we had just passed a resolution urging the \nadmission of Communist China to the United Nations. Of course, this \ncould have been an embarrassment to the Smith campaign. But to his \ngreat credit, E.B. said: ``That is your call, Tom, stick to your guns, \nI'll stand by you.'' That is the kind of principled person he was.\n  During the campaign, E.B. went to Washington to have his endorsement \nphotograph taken with President Kennedy. There is a picture of E.B. \npresenting JFK with a copy of his scholarly biography of Senator Thomas \nHart Benton, titled ``Magnificent Missourian.'' The reason E.B. chose \nthis gift, of course, was that Thomas Hart Benton was one of the eight \nSenators that Kennedy included in his book ``Profiles in Courage.''\n  E.B. lost that 1962 election, but only very narrowly, against the \nlongtime incumbent Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper. But that campaign \nwas revealing of the kind of man he was: a straight-shooter, a person \nof great integrity, serious but with a sense of humor, a fighter for \nthe little guy, standing up for civil rights and economic justice.\n  Fast forward a decade. In 1972, I was fresh out of law school. Ruth \nand I moved back to Ames, and, frankly, we were flat broke. E.B. \nallowed us to live rent free in a house that he owned in Ames. With \nthat house as campaign headquarters, I ran for Congress again in 1972, \nwith a student-run, insurgent campaign modeled after E.B.'s 1962 \neffort. I lost, but we did well enough to run again in 1974, and win.\n  When I arrived in Washington in late 1974 as a newly elected \nRepresentative, E.B. and his wife Jean were living in College Park, \nwhere he was teaching at the University of Maryland. My wife Ruth was \nserving then as Story County attorney, and had to stay back in Iowa. \nThe Smiths generously allowed me to live with them for the next 3 \nyears. I commuted back to Iowa on weekends.\n  From his days in the Navy, E.B. loved to sail and was an expert \nsailor. Many a time he took me out on the Chesapeake Bay on his boat. I \nalways felt that he liked it best when the weather was cold and foul, \nwith the rain pouring down. The rest of us would be huddled down below, \nand E.B. would be up top, steering the boat, having a great time. It \nreminded him fondly of his days as a Navy deck officer in the Atlantic \nduring the war. Over the decades during my time here in Washington, one \nof my great joys has been my sailing outings with E.B.\n  Of course, the other great joy of E.B.'s life was Jean, his wife of \n58 years, their five children, nine grandchildren, and eight great-\ngrandchildren. After Jean died in 2002, E.B. found another wonderful \npartner--coincidentally, also named Jean--who filled his last years \nwith much happiness.\n  E.B. Smith was a dear friend and an invaluable mentor.

This day commemorates the first raising \nof the American Flag on the Tutuila Island in American Samoa by the \nUnited States Navy on April 17, 1900.\n  An annual Polynesian Flag Day event was established to bring \nPolynesian elders, children families, friends, and communities together \nacross Alaska to celebrate, respect, and share their culture and \nhistory together. Polynesian Flag Day is a time to recognize the \nPolynesian community's years of nationality, freedom, and honor, and to \ncommend the service of Polynesian Americans who have fought and are \nfighting for the freedoms that we all hold dear.\n  This year marks the 8th Annual Polynesian Flag Day celebration in \nAlaska, highlighting a proud cultural exchange between Alaska and the \nPolynesian Islands. The Polynesian Association of Alaska promotes \ncommunity building, fosters leadership skills for Alaskan youth, and \nhelps cultivate an exchange of ideas and respect between elders and \nyouth, further strengthening our communities.\n  I join the Alaska Polynesian community in celebrating the 8th Annual \nPolynesian Flag Day in Alaska.\n  Thank you for allowing me to take a moment to recognize this year's \nPolynesian Flag Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3655-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3655-S3656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH CARTER CORBIN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I wish to pay tribute to Professor Joseph Carter Corbin, founder \nand first president of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.\n  Joseph Carter Corbin, an African-American educator, was born in 1833 \nin the town of Chillicothe, OH, to free parents, William and Susan \nCorbin. After earning two master's degrees from Ohio University, Joseph \nCorbin moved his family to Little Rock, AR in 1872, where he worked as \na reporter for the Arkansas Republican.\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\n  Corbin quickly became a leader and strong advocate for public \neducation in Arkansas. Within a year of moving to Little Rock, he was \nelected State superintendent of public instruction, becoming the \nhighest elected African-American official in Arkansas during \nReconstruction. As State superintendent, he signed the contract for \nconstruction of University Hall, which would become the first building \nat the University of Arkansas and known today as Old Main.\n  Joseph Corbin was instrumental in the adoption of legislation in the \nArkansas State Assembly to establish Branch Normal College, the first \nAfrican-American institution of higher education in Arkansas. He was \nappointed the first president of Branch Normal College in 1875, a \nposition he would hold until his retirement in 1902.\n  Professor Corbin died on January 11, 1911, in Pine Bluff, AR. His \ndedication to improving education standards and higher learning in \nArkansas continues to have a positive impact on our State. The \nUniversity of Arkansas at Pine Bluff currently enrolls more than 3,100 \nstudents in undergraduate and postgraduate programs and continues to be \none of Arkansas's premiere colleges. Arkansas has been fortunate to \nhave had an educator of the caliber of Joseph Carter Corbin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3656-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 258.

Mr. President, today, Senator Fischer and I, rise today \nto speak about the alarming crisis of sexual assault within our \nnation's military.\n  Three particularly disturbing cases have arisen in recent weeks. \nFirst, an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel was arrested for sexual battery, \nand an Army first sergeant is alleged to have engaged in sexual \nmisconduct at Fort Flood. Finally, the Army also relieved a lieutenant \ncolonel from his post for a domestic dispute that violated a stalking \nprotection order. What is most concerning is that all were responsible \nfor either handling sexual assault cases or managing policies \npertaining to military sexual assault.\n  We have seen three incidents of this kind in a period of two weeks. \nThe fact that the cases involved multiple services speaks volumes to \nthe need to elevate all Sexual Assault Prevention Response, SAPR, jobs \nto the level of importance that they deserve. Given the challenge of \naddressing the sexual assault crisis, we need the best and brightest \ntaking on these jobs in our military today.\n  We should take steps to ensure that these jobs are on par with those \nthat the military values most. This will address one of the primary \nfactors at the heart of the issue--the need for cultural change in the \nmilitary. It starts with increasing the value of Sexual Assault \nPrevention and Response positions and enforcing a rigorous application, \nintense record review and an interview process that screens applicants \nprior to selection for those duties.\n  While we appreciate Secretary Hagel's efforts to ensure that \ncandidates for these jobs are rescreened, retrained and recertified, \nthe bigger issue is making sure that there is a robust process in place \nto get the highest caliber candidates into all Sexual Assault \nPrevention and Response jobs at the start. We firmly believe that \nchanges to the military justice system are critical, but we also \nbelieve that changing military culture will require transforming the \nprocess by which we fill these positions. It will also require holding \nthe leadership accountable for selecting those individuals.\n  That is why, today, we are introducing legislation that will make the \nhighest-level Sexual Assault Prevention and Response positions \nnominative ones.\n  Nominative jobs, also referred to as ``high visibility,'' are given \nthat designation because of the caliber of person needed to fill them. \nThese are some of the most significant, challenging and highly desired \npositions in the military. Transitioning SAPR jobs to a nominative \nprocess enables direct leadership involvement from the commander, who \nwould now hand-pick the person to fill the role. Furthermore, there is \na level of prestige that comes with taking nominative jobs because they \nare recognized as premiere jobs within the organization. Applicants \nknow up front that these jobs will be challenging and career-enhancing. \nAs such, only the best of the best need apply.\n  This crisis has reached a breaking point that requires more than the \ntraditional process for filling military positions. We can no longer be \ncomfortable placing the service member in a SAPR position solely based \nupon individual career paths and personal aspirations. As proven over \nthe last several weeks, there are holes in that process. We need to \nenact a stringent application, record review and interview process that \nholds leaders accountable for SAPR job selection and increases the \nlikelihood of getting the best possible applicants.\n  There is a sense of urgency surrounding military sexual assault that \nrequires answers now. Secretary Hagel was correct in saying, ``Sexual \nassault has no place in the United States military'' and that ``the \nAmerican people, including our service members, should expect a culture \nof absolutely no tolerance for this deplorable behavior.'' We could not \nagree more, but we are also of the belief that the change in culture \nwith respect to sexual assault will require more than education and \nawareness training. Our military needs to develop a culture that gives \npreeminence to jobs related to sexual assault prevention.\n  We know that military leaders share our concerns and appreciate the \nleadership demonstrated thus far. We trust that they will also \nacknowledge the benefits of making SAPR jobs nominative positions. We \nhope my colleagues in the Senate will take up and pass this legislation \nas we attempt to address the scourge that is sexual assault in our \nmilitary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 993.

A bill to establish the Social Work Reinvestment Commission \nto provide independent counsel to Congress and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services on policy issues associated with recruitment, \nretention, research, and reinvestment in the profession of social work, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dorothy I. \nHeight and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment Act. As a \nsocial worker, I understand the critical role social workers have in \nthe overall care of our population. Social workers can be found in \nevery facet of community life--in hospitals, mental health clinics, \nsenior centers, schools, and private agencies that serve individuals \nand families in need. They play a crucial role combating the social \nproblems facing our nation and are essential providers in our health \ncare system. Yet, there are not enough social workers to meet these \nneeds.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act provides research grants to social workers to train \nthe next generation of social workers; creates a Social Work \nReinvestment Commission; authorizes workplace improvement grants to \nidentify workplace safety issues and workforce shortage challenges that \nneed to be addressed to improve the services social workers provide in \nour communities; and makes grants available to community based programs \nof excellence to identify, test, and replicate effective social work \ninterventions. I am honored to introduce this bill named after two \nsocial visionaries, Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young. Dorothy \nHeight was a pioneer of the civil rights movement. Like me, she began \nher career as a case worker and continued to fight for social justice. \nWhitney Young, another trailblazer of the civil rights movement, also \nbegan his career transforming our social landscape as a social worker. \nHe helped create President Johnson's War on Poverty and served as \nPresident of the National Association of Social Workers.\n  I believe that social work is full of great opportunities, both to \nserve and to lead. Social work is about puffing our values into action. \nSocial workers are among our best and brightest, our most committed and \ncompassionate. They are at the frontlines of providing care, often \nputting themselves in dangerous and violent situations. Social workers \nhave the ability to provide psychological, emotional, and social \nsupport. Quite simply, the ability to change lives. As a social worker, \nI have been on the frontlines of helping people cope with issues in \ntheir everyday lives. I started off fighting for abused children, \nmaking sure they were placed in safe homes. I will continue to fight \nevery day for our children, seniors, military personnel, and families \non the floor of the United States Senate.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act is supported by the National Association of Social \nWorkers. I thank Senators Stabenow and Cardin for co-sponsoring this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Risch, Mr. Coats, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Wicker, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \n        Hoeven, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 1001.

 \n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 150--TO DESIGNATE THE YEAR 2013 AS THE \n                  ``INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF STATISTICS''\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 150\n\n       Whereas more than 2,000 organizations worldwide have \n     recognized 2013 as the International Year of Statistics, a \n     global celebration and recognition of the contributions of \n     statistical science to the well-being of humankind;\n       Whereas the science of statistics is vital to the \n     improvement of human life because of the power of statistics \n     to improve, enlighten, and understand;\n       Whereas statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, \n     and understanding data that permeates and bolsters all \n     sciences;\n       Whereas statisticians contribute to the vitality and \n     excellence of myriad aspects of United States society, \n     including the economy, health care, security, commerce, \n     education, and research;\n       Whereas rapidly increasing numbers of students in grades K \n     through 16 and educators are recognizing the many benefits of \n     statistical literacy as a collection of skills to \n     intelligently cope with the requirements of citizenship, \n     employment, and family;\n       Whereas statisticians contribute to smart and efficient \n     government through the production of statistical data that \n     informs on all aspects of our society, including population, \n     labor, education, economy, transportation, health, energy, \n     and crime;\n       Whereas the goals of the International Year of Statistics \n     are to increase public awareness of the power and impact of \n     statistics on all aspects of society, nurture statistics as a \n     profession, especially among young people, and promote \n     creativity and development in the sciences of probability and \n     statistics; and\n       Whereas throughout the year, organizations in countries \n     across the world will reach out to adults and children \n     through symposia, conferences, demonstrations, workshops, \n     contests, school activities, exhibitions, and other public \n     events to increase awareness of the history and importance of \n     statistics: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the year 2013 as the ``International Year of \n     Statistics'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Statistics;\n       (3) recognizes the necessity of educating the public on the \n     merits of the sciences, including statistics, and promoting \n     interest in the sciences among the youth of the United \n     States; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to \n     participate in the International Year of Statistics through \n     participation in appropriate programs, activities, and \n     ceremonies that call attention to the importance of \n     statistics to the present and future well-being of the people \n     of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3662-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3662-S3663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 151--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN TO ENSURE \nTRANSPARENT AND CREDIBLE PRESIDENTIAL AND PROVINCIAL ELECTIONS IN APRIL \n  2014 BY ADHERING TO INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS, \nESTABLISHING A TRANSPARENT ELECTORAL PROCESS, AND ENSURING SECURITY FOR \n                         VOTERS AND CANDIDATES\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 151\n\n       Whereas Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission has \n     affirmed that Afghanistan will hold presidential and \n     provincial elections in April 2014 and parliamentary \n     elections in 2015;\n       Whereas Afghanistan's current electoral process was \n     established in 2004 by the Constitution of Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework \n     conditions some international assistance to Afghanistan on \n     the holding of credible, inclusive, and transparent elections \n     in 2014 and 2015, among other measures to improve governance;\n       Whereas Afghanistan lacks a comprehensive and accurate \n     voter registry, and previous voter registration drives have \n     resulted in duplicate or fraudulent registrations, according \n     to a report by the National Democratic Institute;\n       Whereas security concerns and voter intimidation have \n     impeded the ability of people in Afghanistan to cast votes \n     reliably and safely in past elections;\n       Whereas Afghan women in particular are prevented from \n     meaningful participation in the electoral process due to the \n     security environment, the scarcity of female poll workers, \n     and lack of awareness of women's political rights and \n     opportunities, according to the Free and Fair Election \n     Foundation of Afghanistan;\n       Whereas Afghanistan's 2009 presidential election was \n     characterized by inadequate security for voters and \n     candidates, low voter turnout, and widespread fraud, \n     according to the National Democratic Institute;\n       Whereas Afghan officials, including President Karzai and \n     Attorney General Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, disputed the results \n     of Afghanistan's 2010 parliamentary elections and established \n     a Special Election Tribunal to investigate allegations of \n     fraud;\n       Whereas, following the 2010 parliamentary elections, \n     Democracy International's Afghanistan Election Observation \n     Mission concluded that comprehensive electoral reform is \n     necessary to ensure a free, fair, and credible election \n     process in 2014;\n       Whereas the Honorable Hamid Karzai is the first \n     democratically elected president of modern Afghanistan and \n     has served two terms in that position;\n       Whereas the Constitution of Afghanistan states, ``No one \n     can be elected as president for more than two terms.'';\n       Whereas President Karzai stated on January 11, 2013, \n     alongside President Barack Obama, ``The greatest of my \n     achievements [. . .] will be a proper, well-organized, \n     interference-free election in which the Afghan people can \n     elect their next president.'';\n       Whereas, on several occasions since the late 1970s, civil \n     war has broken out in Afghanistan over the legitimacy of the \n     Afghan government;\n       Whereas United States taxpayers have invested more than \n     $89,500,000,000 in reconstruction and humanitarian assistance \n     to Afghanistan since October 2001, according to the Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR);\n       Whereas a democratically-elected and legitimate government \n     that reflects the will of the Afghan people is in the vital \n     security interests of Afghanistan, the United States, its \n     partners in the NATO International Security Assistance Force \n     (ISAF), and Afghanistan's neighbors; and\n       Whereas the most critical milestone for Afghanistan's \n     future stability is a peaceful and credible transition of \n     power through presidential elections in 2014: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the electoral process in Afghanistan \n     should be determined and led by\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\n     Afghan actors, with support from the international community, \n     and should not be subject to internal and external \n     interference;\n       (2) expresses its strong support for credible, inclusive, \n     and transparent presidential and provincial elections in \n     April 2014;\n       (3) urges the Government of Afghanistan to conduct the \n     elections in full accordance with the Constitution of \n     Afghanistan, to include maintaining the quota for women's \n     parliamentary participation;\n       (4) honors the sacrifice of United States, coalition, and \n     Afghan service members who have been killed or injured since \n     October 2001 in defense of the democratic rights of the \n     Afghan people;\n       (5) recognizes the substantial investment made by the \n     United States taxpayers in support of stability and democracy \n     in Afghanistan;\n       (6) recognizes the contributions made by the government of \n     President Hamid Karzai to the democratic progress of \n     Afghanistan, including statements by President Karzai \n     committing to hold presidential elections in 2014 and not \n     seek a third term;\n       (7) recognizes that transparent and credible elections will \n     safeguard the legitimacy of the next Afghan government and \n     will help prevent future violence by groups that may be ready \n     to contest a process perceived as rigged or dishonest;\n       (8) recognizes that a democratically-elected and legitimate \n     government is as important to ensuring the long term \n     stability of Afghanistan as the successful training and \n     fielding of the Afghan National Security Forces;\n       (9) urges the Government of Afghanistan to recognize the \n     independence and impartiality of the Independent Electoral \n     Commission (IEC) and an elections complaints mechanism with \n     clear jurisdiction over the final results, and urges all \n     parties not to interfere with their deliberations;\n       (10) urges the Parliament of Afghanistan to pass \n     legislation that will establish a consultative and inclusive \n     process for appointing elections commissioners and allowing \n     election disputes to be resolved transparently and fairly;\n       (11) urges the IEC to adopt measures to better mitigate \n     fraud, include marginalized groups, and improve electoral \n     transparency of the polling and counting process and \n     communicate these measures clearly and consistently to the \n     people of Afghanistan;\n       (12) urges the Government of Afghanistan to support a \n     credible and effective electoral complaints mechanism whereby \n     its members are perceived as impartial, it is given the \n     ultimate authority on deciding whether a ballot or candidate \n     is disqualified, and it has the time and resources to do its \n     work;\n       (13) urges close and continuing communication between the \n     IEC and the Afghan National Security Forces to identify and \n     provide security for vulnerable areas of the country during \n     the election period;\n       (14) urges the Afghan National Security Forces to make \n     every necessary effort to ensure the safety of voters and \n     candidates;\n       (15) expresses its support for the full participation of \n     Afghan civil society in the election process; and\n       (16) urges the Secretary of State to condition financial, \n     logistical, and political support for Afghanistan's 2014 \n     elections based on the implementation of reforms in \n     Afghanistan including--\n       (A) increased efforts to encourage women's participation in \n     the electoral process, including provisions to ensure their \n     full access to and security at polling stations;\n       (B) the implementation of measures to prevent fraudulent \n     registration and manipulation of the voting or counting \n     processes, including--\n       (i) establishment of processes to better control ballots;\n       (ii) vetting of and training for election officials; and\n       (iii) full accreditation of and access for international \n     and domestic election observers; and\n       (C) prompt passage of legislation through the Parliament of \n     Afghanistan that codifies the authorities and independence of \n     the IEC and an independent and impartial election complaints \n     mechanism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3663-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3663-S3665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 954.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FISHERY DISASTER ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing \n     represents the livelihood of many hard-working people in the \n     United States and, in 2011, fisheries supported more than \n     1,200,000 jobs in the United States.\n       (2) Seafood represents an important source of high quality, \n     nutritious food for the people of the United States, who \n     consumed 15 pounds of fish and shellfish in 2011 on average \n     per capita.\n       (3) Commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing is an \n     integral part of the economic foundation for the coastal \n     communities of the United States.\n       (4) Despite adhering to strict catch limits, many fishermen \n     and historic fishing communities currently face extreme \n     hardship as a result of dramatic declines in stocks due to \n     natural disasters and undetermined causes.\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n       (5) In 2012, using authority under the Interjurisdictional \n     Fisheries Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) and the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of \n     1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), the Secretary of Commerce \n     declared fishery disasters with respect to the following:\n       (A) Mississippi oyster and blue crab, in response to \n     flooding that occurred in 2011, damage from the oil spill in \n     the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and Hurricane Katrina.\n       (B) Northeast Multispecies (Groundfish) Fishery, for Rhode \n     Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and \n     Connecticut.\n       (C) Alaska Chinook salmon, for Chinook salmon fisheries in \n     the Yukon River, Kuskokwin River, and Cook Inlet.\n       (D) New Jersey and New York, in response to Hurricane \n     Sandy.\n       (E) American Samoa, for bottomfish.\n       (6) Whenever a disaster has been declared by the Federal \n     Government, Congress has traditionally provided funding to \n     assist those affected.\n       (7) Since 1994, Federal fishery failures have been declared \n     on 29 occasions and nearly $827,000,000 in Federal funding \n     has been provided for fishery disaster relief.\n       (8) The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (division \n     A of Public Law 113-2; 127 Stat. 4), did not include the \n     funding for all fishery disasters declared in 2012 that was \n     included in the Senate bill and those fisheries continue to \n     face dire economic straits.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is important to support the commercial, \n     recreational, and subsistence fishermen of the United States, \n     who risk their lives to put food on the tables of the people \n     of the United States and to support their communities;\n       (2) it is in the national interest to ensure that the \n     important and storied United States fishing industry survives \n     and thrives well into the future; and\n       (3) funds should be provided, as soon as possible, for the \n     fishery disasters declared by the Secretary of Commerce in \n     2012 and any subsequent fishery disaster declarations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1024.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Farm, Ranch, and Forest \n     Land Private Property Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 13002. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of \n     property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the \n     Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that \n     private property shall not be taken for public use, without \n     just compensation.\n       (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not \n     traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating \n     properties for State and local governments. In addition, \n     farm, ranch, and forest land owners need to have long-term \n     certainty regarding their property rights in order to make \n     the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.\n       (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building \n     blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues \n     to be one of the most important economic sectors of our \n     economy.\n       (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \n     City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to \n     the property rights of all private property owners, including \n     rural land owners.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic \n     development is a threat to agricultural and other property in \n     rural America and that the Congress should protect the \n     property rights of Americans, including those who reside in \n     rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this \n     country and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take \n     farmland and other rural property for economic development \n     threatens liberty, rural economies, and the economy of the \n     United States. The taking of farmland and rural property will \n     have a direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation \n     projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take \n     rural private property for private commercial uses will force \n     increasing numbers of activities from private property onto \n     this Nation's public lands, including its National forests, \n     National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can \n     overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the \n     enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. Americans should \n     not have to fear the government's taking their homes, farms, \n     or businesses to give to other persons. Governments should \n     not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural property \n     owners from their land in order to develop rural land into \n     industrial and commercial property. Congress has a duty to \n     protect the property rights of rural Americans in the face of \n     eminent domain abuse.\n\n     SEC. 13003. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY STATES TO \n                   CONFISCATE FARM, RANCH, OR FOREST LAND.\n\n       (a) In General.--No State or political subdivision of a \n     State shall exercise its power of eminent domain over farm, \n     ranch, or forest land, or allow the exercise of such power by \n     any person or entity to which such power has been delegated, \n     over property to be used for economic development or over \n     property that is used for economic development within 7 years \n     after that exercise, if that State or political subdivision \n     receives Federal economic development funds during any fiscal \n     year in which the property is so used or intended to be used.\n       (b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds.--A violation of \n     subsection (a) by a State or political subdivision shall \n     render such State or political subdivision ineligible for any \n     Federal economic development funds for a period of 2 fiscal \n     years following a final judgment on the merits by a court of \n     competent jurisdiction that such subsection has been \n     violated, and any Federal agency charged with distributing \n     those funds shall withhold them for such 2-year period, and \n     any such funds distributed to such State or political \n     subdivision shall be returned or reimbursed by such State or \n     political subdivision to the appropriate Federal agency or \n     authority of the Federal Government, or component thereof.\n       (c) Opportunity To Cure Violation.--A State or political \n     subdivision shall not be ineligible for any Federal economic \n     development funds under subsection (b) if such State or \n     political subdivision returns all real property the taking of \n     which was found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have \n     constituted a violation of subsection (a) and replaces any \n     other property destroyed and repairs any other property \n     damaged as a result of such violation. In addition, the State \n     must pay applicable penalties and interest to reattain \n     eligibility.\n\n     SEC. 13004. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY THE \n                   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONFISCATE FARM, RANCH, \n                   OR FOREST LAND.\n\n       The Federal Government or any authority of the Federal \n     Government shall not exercise its power of eminent domain \n     over farm, ranch, or forest land to be used for economic \n     development.\n\n     SEC. 13005. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) Cause of Action.--Any (1) owner of private farm, ranch, \n     or forest land whose property is subject to eminent domain \n     who suffers injury as a result of a violation of any \n     provision of this title with respect to that property, or (2) \n     any tenant of property that is subject to eminent domain who \n     suffers injury as a result of a violation of any provision of \n     this title with respect to that property, may bring an action \n     to enforce any provision of this title in the appropriate \n     Federal or State court. A State shall not be immune under the \n     11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from \n     any such action in a Federal or State court of competent \n     jurisdiction. In such action, the defendant has the burden to \n     show by clear and convincing evidence that the taking is not \n     for economic development. Any such property owner or tenant \n     may also seek an appropriate relief through a preliminary \n     injunction or a temporary restraining order.\n       (b) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by a \n     property owner or tenant under this title may be brought if \n     the property is used for economic development following the \n     conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the \n     property of such property owner or tenant, but shall not be \n     brought later than seven years following the conclusion of \n     any such proceedings.\n       (c) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or \n     proceeding under this title, the court shall allow a \n     prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorneys' fee as part of \n     the costs, and include expert fees as part of the attorneys' \n     fee.\n\n     SEC. 13006. REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL OR \n                   THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.\n\n       (a) Submission of Report to Attorney General.--Any (1) \n     owner of private farm, ranch, or forest land whose property \n     is subject to eminent domain who suffers injury as a result \n     of a violation of any provision of this title with respect to \n     that property, or (2) any tenant of farm, ranch, or forest \n     land that is subject to eminent domain who suffers injury as \n     a result of a violation of any provision of this title with \n     respect to that property, may report a violation by the \n     Federal Government, any authority of the Federal Government, \n     State, or political subdivision of a State to the Attorney \n     General or the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (b) Investigation by Attorney General.--Upon receiving a \n     report of an alleged violation, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall transmit the report to the Attorney General. Upon \n     receiving a report of an alleged violation from either a \n     property owner, tenant, or the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Attorney General shall conduct an investigation, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to determine \n     whether a violation exists.\n       (c) Notification of Violation.--If the Attorney General \n     concludes that a violation does exist, then the Attorney \n     General shall notify the Federal Government, authority of the \n     Federal Government, State, or political subdivision of a \n     State that the Attorney General has determined that it is in \n     violation of the title. The notification shall further \n     provide that the Federal Government, State, or political \n     subdivision of a State has 90 days from the date of the \n     notification to demonstrate to the Attorney General either\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n     that (1) it is not in violation of the title or (2) that it \n     has cured its violation by returning all real property the \n     taking of which the Attorney General finds to have \n     constituted a violation of the title and replacing any other \n     property destroyed and repairing any other property damaged \n     as a result of such violation.\n       (d) Attorney General's Bringing of Action to Enforce \n     Title.--If, at the end of the 90-day period described in \n     subsection (c), the Attorney General determines that the \n     Federal Government, authority of the Federal Government, \n     State, or political subdivision of a State is still violating \n     the title or has not cured its violation as described in \n     subsection (c), then the Attorney General will bring an \n     action to enforce the title unless the property owner or \n     tenant who reported the violation has already brought an \n     action to enforce the title. In such a case, the Attorney \n     General shall intervene if it determines that intervention is \n     necessary in order to enforce the title. The Attorney General \n     may file its lawsuit to enforce the title in the appropriate \n     Federal or State court. A State shall not be immune under the \n     11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from \n     any such action in a Federal or State court of competent \n     jurisdiction. In such action, the defendant has the burden to \n     show by clear and convincing evidence that the taking is not \n     for economic development. The Attorney General may seek any \n     appropriate relief through a preliminary injunction or a \n     temporary restraining order.\n       (e) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by \n     the Attorney General under this title may be brought if the \n     property is used for economic development following the \n     conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the \n     property of an owner or tenant who reports a violation of the \n     title to the Attorney General, but shall not be brought later \n     than seven years following the conclusion of any such \n     proceedings.\n       (f) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or \n     proceeding under this title brought by the Attorney General, \n     the court shall, if the Attorney General is a prevailing \n     plaintiff, award the Attorney General a reasonable attorneys' \n     fee as part of the costs, and include expert fees as part of \n     the attorneys' fee.\n\n     SEC. 13007.

This will be the \nsixth or seventh year we have tried to fill vacancies on the DC \nCircuit. There are four vacancies there. I hope the President sends us \nsome more names.

We are going to have a cloture vote on this on \nThursday, as we should do, and hopefully finish by the end of the week. \nIf we get cloture, we will finish by the end of the week if we have to \nstay over another day or so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/21/senate-section/article/S3698-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 22, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
