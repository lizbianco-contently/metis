Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair to allow for a Republican \nspecial caucus meeting with President Obama.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is my opinion. If we allow the United \nStates to default on its debt for the first time in our glorious \nhistory, it will be a black mark on our reputation, and that is a gross \nunderstatement. There will be a financial disaster, and it will spark a \nglobal recession.\n  As I indicated when I began, this is my opinion, but this is not my \nopinion alone. If we listen to the economic leaders of this country, \nrespected economists, bankers, and business leaders, this is what they \nsay.\n  For example, yesterday the chief executive officer of the American \nExpress, whose company is valued at almost $80 billion, said this about \ndefault:\n\n       What's important to understand is if the United States hits \n     the debt ceiling and is unable to pay its debts, the \n     consequences will be immediate and dramatic. . . . If the \n     U.S. defaults, the [global financial] system literally \n     unwinds.\n\n  So no one misinterprets what he said, I will read it again.\n\n       What's important to understand is if the United States hits \n     the debt ceiling and is unable to pay its debts, the \n     consequences will be immediate and dramatic. . . . If the \n     U.S. defaults, the [global financial] system literally \n     unwinds.\n\n  His dire warning has been accepted and echoed by reasonable Members \nof Congress, including many Republicans. Even Speaker Boehner admitted \nin 2011, the last time Republicans forced this country to the brink of \ndefault, that failing to pay the bills would be catastrophic. He said:\n\n       Not raising the debt limit would have serious--very \n     serious--implications for the worldwide economy and jobs here \n     in America.\n\n  But this year Speaker Boehner seemed willing to risk default day \nafter day, holding the full faith and credit of the United States \nhostage to extract extreme political concessions.\n  Yesterday it was very good to see my Republican colleagues, some at \nleast, come around to the idea of a clean bill to avert default. Think \nabout that. They are talking about extending the debt ceiling for 2 \nmonths--for 6 weeks. Please.\n  But some have admitted the clean bill to avoid default should be the \nstandard. I certainly agree with that.\n  I repeat, we do not believe a 6-week delay of a catastrophic default \nis enough to give the economy the confidence it needs to continue \ngrowing and recovering. Using their theory, we would have another one \nof these periods of bedlam in Washington before the most important \npurchasing season at any time during the year, Christmas, right before \nChristmas, when people are beginning to buy things for Christmas.\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n  We will vote tomorrow on a 15-month measure to ensure the United \nStates lives up to its obligations, giving the economy certainty and \nstability over the long term. But Congress's work to restore faith in \ngovernment won't end with avoiding default.\n  The Federal Government is still closed for business, causing hardship \nand heartbreak for millions of American families, such as the \nTrowbridge family in Reno, NV. They have a 17-year-old son Austin who \nwas scheduled to receive an experimental bone marrow transplant at NIH \nin Washington. Without the transplant, he could die, just as his \nbrother did 5 years ago from the same disease.\n  But the National Institutes of Health are shuttered, along with the \nrest of the government and the Centers for Disease Control. The \nassistant Democratic leader has laid out 79 different programs that \nwould need to be reinstated to open the government, and we are getting \nthem piecemeal--piecemeal.\n  In the meantime, people are suffering, not only Federal employees but \nthe people who depend on them. We have four States that are trying to \nwork something out with Secretary Jewell to have the States pay for \nopening national parks.\n  It is time for Republicans to give the Trowbridge family and others \nsome relief. Reopen the government, the whole government, so kids such \nas Austin can get the treatment they need. Families of law enforcement \nofficers killed in the line of duty can't get the death benefits they \ndeserve. Why? Because the government is closed. Every American family \nwho relies on the Federal Government can't get the help and services \nthey need.\n  Reopen the Federal Government, let's pay our bills, and then let's \nnegotiate a sensible budget solution that secures our country's long-\nterm fiscal leads.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Shortly I will join my Republican colleagues at the \nWhite House. It will be a good time to engage in a frank exchange of \nideas with the President, if that is what he is looking for. But if all \nthe President wants is to drag us over there to say he won't negotiate, \nthat won't be particularly productive.\n  Throughout this crisis, the President has taken what you might call \nan unorthodox approach to governing. His basic position could be summed \nup in basically three words: He won't negotiate.\n  I think that has left many Americans scratching their heads. I know \nthe President and the Democratic leaders in Congress want to borrow \nmore money without any strings attached. But the rest of us actually \nwant to enact some commonsense reforms to get our debt under control, \nand we want to keep our commitments to the American people.\n  A key point is: Nobody wants a default. That is why, in 50 years of \nnegotiations over multiple debt ceiling increases, we haven't had a \nsingle default, not a one. We have negotiated over debt ceilings for 50 \nyears and never had a default. Let's put this hysterical talk of \ndefault behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions to \nthe problems.\n  There are a variety of ways to get debt and spending under control, a \nlot of innovative reforms we should consider. But we need to talk to \neach other if we are going to make any of that happen.\n  I will bet that some of my Democratic friends have spending-cut ideas \nas well, and we would like to hear them. Let's sit down and talk this \nout. Members on both sides of the aisle in Congress are discussing \nsolutions, and these discussions will continue as soon as we get back \nfrom the White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7390-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are in the 11th day of the government \nshutdown. We have caused great harm to the people of this country. We \nhave already caused harm. We have hurt the United States on the \ninternational front. The President, as I mentioned previously, was \nabsent at the Asian economic summit. The Asian economic summit was the \nopportunity for America, the President of the United States, to be the \nheadliner. Instead, the President of China, President Xi, became the \nheadliner. There were questions asked about whether America is ``open \nfor business'' with our trading partners. We have been hurt by this \nshutdown, make no mistake about it.\n  Our economy has suffered. Just the threat of defaulting--of not \npaying our bills--has hurt consumer confidence. Consumer confidence \nmeasures whether consumers are ready to go out and buy that car, buy \nthat home, go on vacation. After the terrorist attacks on the country \non September 11, 2001, consumer confidence dropped by about 8.8 \npercent. I could go over other calamitous moments in history, but the \ndebt ceiling debate today is about twice as damaging to consumer \nconfidence as the 9/11 attack. We are talking about paying our bills \nwhen we talk about raising the debt ceiling--bills that have already \nbeen incurred. We are just paying the bills.\n  Mr. President, we are hurting our country. We are hurting our \neconomy. We are wasting taxpayer dollars. We all talk about dealing \nwith the debt. But in the government shutdown, we have wasted over $2 \nbillion of taxpayer money as a result of it.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in this region--Maryland, Virginia, \nthe District--we have over 300,000 Federal workers who are on furlough \nof the 800,000 who are furloughed nationwide. That has a direct impact \non families as well as our economy. These Federal workers are not \nbuying in their local shops, they are not eating in the local \nrestaurants. I stopped into a restaurant for a sandwich over the last \nweekend. I said: How are things going? The shopowner said: Terrible. \nSocial Security employees are not here. I cannot keep my business open \nwithout their business.\n  We have seen the direct impact. I have tried to put faces on these \nnumbers. We could talk about the statistics and the numbers. Let's talk \nabout people, the individual people I hear from--I know the Presiding \nOfficer has received calls from constituents in Virginia. It is the \nsame story.\n  Over a week ago we brought in Amy Fritz who works at the National \nOceanic & Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA). She is a Federal worker who \nis furloughed. She tracks weather conditions and works on the computer \nmodels to predict how storms will behave. It is a pretty important \nposition she has. She was telling of the hardship to her family. The \nBaltimore Sun reported today that at NOAA it is not just the Federal \nworkers, it is the contract workers who are suffering. The Sun cited \nthe example of Tiffany House, a person who lives in Hyattsville, MD. \nShe is a single mom, a contract employee of NOAA, who has been laid off \nas a result of the shutdown. It is more than just 800,000 Federal \nworkers; we have the contract workers who have been laid off as a \nresult of the shutdown.\n  She said, ``Even though we're furloughed and we are not getting paid, \nthe bills keep coming.''\n  There are a lot of hard-working families who live paycheck to \npaycheck. We are 11 days into this government shutdown. Families are \nwondering what they are going to do when it comes to paying their \nbills.\n  The Sun reported about Keith Tate from Hyattsville. He works for FM \nTalent Source in Silver Spring. Almost 30 percent of their contract \nemployees, 92 people in total, have been laid off. He\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nwas starting work on October 1--his luck. He was looking forward to it. \nHe went to work on October 1 but then was furloughed as a result of the \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The effect goes well beyond individual people that you would expect, \nlike Federal employees and contractors. I have a friend, Hugh Sisson, \nwho started Heavy Seas Brewery in Baltimore. It is one of America's \ngreat craft breweries. He is doing a great job and hiring people. You \nmay say, ``How does this affect him? He sells beer.'' Well, beer sales \nare affected by furloughs and a drop in consumer confidence, but it's \nworse than that. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) \nemployees at the Department of the Treasury have been furloughed. \nThey're the people who review and approve new breweries, recipes, and \nlabels. Hugh told me, ``We have eight labels waiting for approval and \n10 formulas we would like to start the process on but can't at this \ntime.''\n  Craft brewers like Hugh Sisson are innovators, constantly introducing \nnew beers and seasonal beers, fresh products. They are being hurt all \nover the Nation as a result of the TTB staff being furloughed. They \ndon't just hire their own staff; they support jobs in agriculture for \nbarley and hops and other ingredients; in manufacturing for stainless \nsteel kettles and fermenters and bottling and canning lines; and in \ndistribution and retail. These are blue collar jobs and white collar \njobs. All across America. These are jobs that won't be outsourced \noverseas. And this shutdown is hurting America's craft brewers.\n  This shutdown is hurting our economy, hurting our country, hurting \nindividuals, hurting taxpayers, hurting businesses. We can do much \nbetter. In my State of Maryland 10 percent of our workforce works for \nthe Federal Government. The dedicated employees at these agencies do \nwork that's important to all Americans, not just Marylanders.\n  As I pointed out previously, Harbor Point is one of the most \nimportant economic developments in downtown Baltimore, but it's RCRA \nsite--that stands for the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act--which \nmeans it requires the consent of government, the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA), before this enormous economic development \nproject can move forward. The people at EPA who would approve this \nproject have been furloughed. This economic project now is on hold.\n  I could mention other examples of agencies that are critically \nimportant. I could also talk a lot more about private employment. It is \nnot just government employment, it is private employment. Convergence \nTechnology Consulting, located in Glen Burnie, MD, does cloud computing \nservices for the Department of Defense. Twenty percent of the firm's 65 \nemployees have been laid off.\n  TW Corporation in Hanover does cyber security work, and one-third of \nits 700 employees were furloughed. The list of the damages caused by \nthe government shutdown goes on and on.\n  My message is pretty simple. We have to make sure government is open. \nWe have to make sure we open government, and we have to pay our bills.\n  I understand we would like to have an agreement on a budget. I would \nlike to have an agreement on the budget. For 6 months we have been \ntrying to go to conference. The Senate passed a budget, the House \npassed a budget. They are different. The Senate budget, one that I \nsupported, the Presiding Officer supported, would provide more \nresources for job growth by investing in infrastructure, by investing \nin education, by investing in research. Yes, we do provide more \nrevenues by closing tax loopholes. We also start to rein in government \nspending and continue to do that. The House-passed budget has fewer of \nthose investments. It does not close the loopholes in our Tax Code. \nThat is what we have to negotiate between Democrats and Republicans. \nThat is what we need to do. But the first order of business is to \nreopen government--all of it--and pay our bills, and then let's sit \ndown and negotiate. We cannot wait. We must have government open.\n  I quoted before from the Baltimore Sun and the paper's analogy of \nnegotiations. It is difficult when this is all one-sided. As Sunpapers \nsaid:\n\n       So when Speaker Boehner lashes out at President Obama for \n     failing to negotiate, one has to ask, what is this thing he \n     describes as negotiation? House Republicans are not merely \n     leveraging their political position--as some dryly claim--\n     they are threatening to do grievous harm to the global \n     economy and the American public. The gun isn't raised to Mr. \n     Obama's head or to the Senate's. The Democrats have no \n     particular stake in passing a continuing resolution or in \n     raising the debt ceiling other than keeping public order and \n     doing what any reasonable person expects Congress to do. No, \n     the gun is raised at the nation as a whole. That's why \n     descriptions like ``ransom'' and ``hostage'' are not mere \n     hyperbole, they are as close as the English language gets to \n     accurately describing the GOP strategy.\n\n  Our message is clear to House Speaker Boehner: Put down the gun. Put \nit down. Open government. Allow us to pay our bills. And, yes, we want \nto sit down and work out our differences. Let the democratic process \nproceed. Open government, pay our bills, and then let's negotiate a \nfair and comprehensive agreement on the budget.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to speak for about 10 \nminutes. I understand there may be other Senators coming to the floor. \nI wanted to express my concerns about a few issues that are really \nimportant to the people of Louisiana.\n  I understand that the meeting with the President and the Republicans \nin the Senate--our friends--has just concluded. I am hoping there will \nbe some positive steps forward from that meeting so we can open this \ngovernment, remove the threat of an economic collapse, and get to the \nbargaining table to which we have literally been trying to achieve for \n6 months. We voted 21 times in the Senate to get to the negotiating \ntable in the budget conference, which is the first starting point to \nagree on numbers and revenues and spending limits.\n  As an appropriator--I would know this as chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee--the next step in regular order is for each individual \ncommittee to negotiate with our Republican counterparts about how we \nallocate the money given to us through that budget process.\n  None of that has been able to happen--none. It is not because \nDemocrats have been unwilling to go to the negotiating table, but \nbecause some friends on the other side have taken hostage innocents--\nFederal employees, the economy generally--and demanded things that are \nway beyond their ability to use their political leverage. So instead of \nusing it correctly, they have held innocent hostages. It is very \ntroubling, and I think it is very wrong. Hopefully, we are going to \nfind a way forward.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  I wanted to spend my time this afternoon talking about what I am \nhearing from the people in Louisiana, such as: Could you all get back \nto work because we have some serious problems that need to be solved. \nOne of the problems--Mr. President, maybe your State is affected by \nthis because the Presiding Officer has a coastal area, as do we--is \nfixing this very broken flood insurance system. In our State it is \nreferred to as Biggert-Waters. It was named after the two Members of \nCongress who led this ``reform effort.''\n  Maxine Waters has subsequently completely disassociated herself with \nthe legislation and said it was not the right thing to do. She has made \nseveral public statements. She has urged, as the leader in the House, \nwith Republicans and Democrats, to get this fixed.\n  For the people of Louisiana, this is our No. 1 problem and challenge \nright now because a year and a half ago the Federal Government passed a \nlaw that was supposed to cure something. But the cure is worse than the \ndisease. The disease was we had a flood insurance program that spent \nmore money than it had taken in. And, yes, premiums were probably too \nlow to sustain the program, but it was giving people at least some \noption and hope when they had a flood, so they could get some of the \nequity in their home protected and recovered.\n  This bill came along and was never debated on the Senate floor. It \nwas\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nstuck in a conference committee report, and now it is being \nimplemented, and it is a disaster. We have 400,000 flood insurance \npolicies in Louisiana, Texas has 700,000, Florida has over 2 million, \nPennsylvania has over 75,000, and Virginia probably has between 40,000 \nand 50,000. I don't have the list in front of me.\n  The problem is that the law that passed had stated one goal: to make \nthe program sustainable. But it left out an equally important aspect: \nto make it affordable. You can sustain a program all day long, but if \nnobody can afford to be in it, A, how long will it sustain itself? Not \nlong at all. And, B, we are hurting the people we are trying to help \nthe most.\n  A group of us have been working for quite some time on fixing this. \nThese new regulations went into effect on October 1. We are going on 11 \nor 12 days--I forget the date, but we are past October 1. These new \nrates have gone into effect, and some people are seeing rates \nquadruple--or tenfold. Some of these rates are going up from $300 a \nyear to $3,000. In some cases we have heard $1,500 to $30,000. I am not \nexaggerating or making this up. This is all in the record.\n  We have a way to fix it. The good news I wanted to share on the floor \ntoday is that we had 24 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, come \ntogether this week and send a ``dear colleague'' letter to our \nleadership--to the Republican leadership and the House leadership--to \nsay that we are very close to a compromise that will do two things: It \nwill give us time to get the affordability study that was supposed to \nbe done actually done. It will allow FEMA to potentially--with some \noversight from Congress--set rates that would keep the program \nfunctioning but not jeopardize people's equity in their homes.\n  It would, of course, remove the automatic trigger provision that has \nbeen very detrimental in the law, which basically says: The rates will \nstay low, but the minute people put a house up for sale or sell a \nhouse, whatever grandfathered rate they had is gone. And it doesn't go \nup 25 percent a year, it goes up to where it should be. In some cases \nthat is a move from $1,000 a year to $30,000 a year. It makes their \nhouse worthless, and that is what is happening to thousands of people. \nThey have lost equity in their home. It is one of many problems this \nCongress has to fix. We can't fix any of them if we can't get back to \nwork. We need the officials that have been laid off at FEMA to go back \nto work.\n  One point I want to make today is let's find a way forward to \nnegotiate. I hope part of the negotiation could potentially be a fix to \nBiggert-Waters. I want to thank Senator Merkley from Oregon, Senator \nMenendez from New Jersey, Senator Wicker from Mississippi, and Senator \nVitter from Louisiana. Senator Isakson has been giving us some good \ninput. I want to thank the realtors and the bankers because they \nrealized that we made a mistake and that the law we passed was not a \ngood one. Sometimes that happens.\n  We have to fix it. We don't have to fix the whole of it, but we are \nworking on some pieces that must be amended so that it accomplishes the \ngoal of having a program and so that taxpayers do not have to pick up a \nbig tab every year. It will allow real estate markets to function, \npeople to be able to retain equity in their home, and to pay their fair \nshare. It will also encourage smart growth and development.\n  Also--and very importantly, which is part of the problem with \nBiggert-Waters--the bill we are trying to fix didn't even recognize \nlevees. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has a lot of levees in \nVirginia, but we have to have them in Louisiana because we are below \nsea level. We have been that way for 300 years. We moved there below \nsea level. We had to be there to create the Port of New Orleans.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson leveraged the whole Federal Treasury to buy us for 3 \ncents an acre, if I remember correctly--the bulk of 19 States. It was \nthe greatest real estate purchase in the history of our country. Alaska \nmay argue, but we think the Louisiana Territory is equally as valuable, \nif not more so, and our State is proud to carry that name. People \nunderstand the history of this.\n  Why would Thomas Jefferson leverage the whole Treasury of the United \nStates to buy something that was not worthwhile. Of course it is \nworthwhile. It was worthwhile then, and it is worthwhile now.\n  People live there because we run the biggest port system in the \nworld, and we need to continue to live there with all of the \nindustries--oil and gas, and fisheries, et cetera.\n  This Biggert-Waters bill undermines our region's ability to function. \nWe produce 17 percent of the GDP for the country, so this is not a \nsmall parochial issue to the Southern States: Texas, Louisiana, \nAlabama, Mississippi, et cetera--but it also affects interior states. \nWe have seen what happened in Colorado. We have seen what happened to \nthe east coast States, with New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, et \ncetera.\n  Let's get to the negotiating table. Let's work together, as we know \nwe can, and let's put on the top of that agenda a potential fix for \nBiggert-Waters.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for working so cordially together even \nin this difficult time.\n  Let me move to another subject for a minute and put into the Record, \nin the event that my colleagues--do I have to ask for an additional 3 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record this letter that I received. I think all of the Members \nreceived this letter that was addressed to Senator Reid, Senator \nMcConnell, Speaker Boehner, and Representative Pelosi from the National \nGovernors Association that came yesterday.\n  Governor Mary Fallin and Governor John Hickenlooper signed the letter \non behalf of all the Governors, and it says:\n\n       The nation's governors urge Congress and the Administration \n     to quickly reopen the federal government.\n       The fiscal health of states is inextricably linked to the \n     fiscal stability of the federal government, and while state \n     economies have improved, a failure by our national government \n     to secure a solution to the current government budget issues \n     undermines our states' recovery and endangers the U.S. \n     economy.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       States have thus far managed to avoid closing or suspending \n     most programs and services by using carry-over funds or, in \n     some cases, by using state spending to fill in missing \n     federal dollars. However, states are not in the position to \n     be the bank for the federal government.\n\n  As a former Governor, the Presiding Officer understands this. I was a \nformer Treasurer. I most certainly understand that the budget of \nLouisiana is almost 70 percent Federal funding. So when the Federal \nGovernment cuts off that funding, it starts to affect the way States--\nand the 300-plus cities in my State--operate, and it affects our \nprivate sector partners that work with us to provide State-level and \ncommunity services. It affects nonprofits such as Catholic Charities, \nwho are running some of our low-income housing, our justice programs in \nsome of our neighborhoods and communities.\n  This shutdown is just bad. It is bad all around. It should not have \nhappened. We need to get this government open and operating, which will \nhelp our States and their economic recovery plans to start focusing on \nfixing things. We need to fix things like Biggert-Waters and repeal \nthat old insurance reform bill so we can find a better way forward.\n  I might also mention two other things quickly. What is also happening \nin our State today--I got news this morning--is that permitting in the \nGulf of Mexico for offshore oil and gas drilling is now shut down. \nRight at the time when America is about to overtake Russia as the \nlargest domestic producer of gas and oil, right when we are about to \ntake first place, the Republican tea party has shut the government down \nand shut down permitting in the gulf.\n  Ever since the Deepwater Horizon, we have been fighting to get that \nback up and going. Now we find it has been shut down again. The people \nI represent cannot take another shutdown of permitting.\n  We have levees to build. We have a big problem in our river parishes, \nas we call them, along Lake Pontchartrain. We have Morganza to the \ngulf, which is an important levee project for Houma, which is one of \nthe centers for oil and\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\ngas production. This not only helps the people of Houma and Terrebonne \nParish, but it helps the whole region and the whole country. It is sort \nof like a little Houston, if you will. Houma is like a little Houston. \nWe don't have all of the corporate structures, but we have all of the \nknow-how, the goods and services, the providers, the boats, the planes, \nthe ships, and the helicopters. They might have the gleaming office \ntowers in Houston, but we have a lot of the hard workers in Houma.\n  The levee that protects them and their homes is now basically--the \nplans for it are shut down along with this tea party shutdown.\n\n                                                          National\n\n\n                                        Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Senator McConnell, Speaker \n     Boehner, and Representative Pelosi: The nation's governors \n     urge Congress and the Administration to quickly reopen the \n     federal government.\n       The fiscal health of states is inextricably linked to the \n     fiscal stability of the federal government, and while state \n     economies have improved, a failure by our national government \n     to secure a solution to the current budget issues undermines \n     our states' recovery and endangers the U.S. economy.\n       States have thus far managed to avoid closing or suspending \n     most programs and services by using carryover funds or, in \n     some cases, by using state spending to fill in for missing \n     federal dollars. However, states are not in a position to be \n     the bank for the federal government. As this impasse \n     continues, we call on Congress and the Administration to \n     commit to fully reimbursing states and territories for the \n     federal expenses they absorb during the shutdown. These \n     expenses include funding for programs, state employees who \n     are paid through federal funds and any other outlays that \n     would normally have been supported by federal funds.\n       As governors, our citizens expect us to work together to \n     balance our budgets and make government work. We will do \n     whatever we can to serve our citizens and deliver the core \n     services they need and expect during this uncertain time. In \n     return, we ask our federal partners to quickly find a path \n     forward that reimburses states for incurred federal expenses; \n     restores certainty in the federal budget process; creates \n     long-term stability; and strengthens the fiscal condition of \n     the nation for the benefit of all citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Governor Mary Fallin.\n                                       Governor John Hickenlooper.\n\n  It is time to open our government. It is time to get back to work, \nsolve real problems, and negotiate in good faith without taking \ninnocent hostages. There are too many innocents being harmed, whether \nit is children with cancer, whether it is businesspeople who have put \neverything on the line for their business and through no fault of their \nown now have no customers coming in the front door and can't pay their \nnote--and the banks aren't going to wait until we get our act together.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I wanted to, if I could, take 1 more \nminute to speak on behalf of the people who don't have a Senator here; \nthat is, the District of Columbia.\n  The District of Columbia is technically not a part of the Federal \nGovernment. They are not an agency of the Federal Government. They are \nnot a department of the Federal Government. The District of Columbia is \nthe district in which the Federal Government resides. Contrary to \npopular belief, they raise most of their money through their own tax \nrevenue generated--about 75 percent local. Twenty-five percent of the \nbudget of the District of Columbia--which has about 750,000 people, \nwhich is a pretty big city as cities go--comes from the people who live \nhere. They have been caught up as if they were an agency of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Let me argue on their behalf to my colleagues and suggest that they \nare a group of innocents--a city. Baltimore's budget is not shut down, \nRichmond's budget is not shut down, New Orleans' budget is not shut \ndown, Chicago's budget is not shut down, New York's budget is not shut \ndown, San Francisco's budget is not shut down, but the DC government is \nshut down because of this threat. They have gotten caught up. They \nshould be let go, and we can then negotiate on all other things.\n  I think the President understands this. I know majority leader Harry \nReid understands this. I am hoping minority leader Mitch McConnell will \ngive his support so this can be done in a bipartisan way, recognizing \nthis is the Nation's Capital--not asking for any special preference for \nthem, just allowing them to use their own money and operate their own \ncity while we try to figure out how to get the rest of the government \nopen and operating. I hope we can do that today. We have been working \nacross the aisle.\n  I thank Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton for her leadership. The \nDistrict of Columbia does not have Senators, so a few of us have to \nstand and speak for the people of the District, and I am happy to try \nto do that on occasion when I, of course, believe strongly in what they \nare asking.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is no secret to anybody that the \nAmerican people are frustrated and they are disgusted with what is \ngoing on in Washington.\n  The Presiding Officer may have seen The Onion magazine, the satirical \nmagazine that ran a story which says that at a time when 5 percent of \nthe American people approve of what is going on in Congress, The Onion \nreported psychiatrists are deeply worried about the mental health of 5 \npercent of the American public. In other words, all over this country, \nregardless of political persuasion, people literally cannot understand \nwhat is going on, and they have every reason to be outraged and \nfrustrated because so many people today are being hurt.\n  We can disagree about the Affordable Care Act. We as a nation can \ndisagree about how we address Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nglobal warming, or any other issue out there. But what should not be \nhappening is that this government and the American people should not be \nheld hostage by an extreme right wing of the Republican Party saying: \nWell, yeah, we lost the election by 5 million votes, we lost two seats \nin the Senate, we lost seats in the House, but nonetheless, unless we \nget the agenda we campaigned on and lost, we are going to shut down the \nFederal Government. We are going to punish millions of Federal \nemployees and tens of millions of taxpayers who paid for Federal \nservices. Also, for the first time in the history of the United States \nof America, we are not going to pay our bills and as a result perhaps \nthrust the American financial system and the world's financial system \ninto a horrendous recession.\n  What the American people are saying over and over, regardless of \npolitical persuasion, is, yes, we can disagree on issues; no, we cannot \nbring the U.S. Government to a halt and default on our payments because \na particular faction disagrees on certain legislation.\n  Interestingly enough, a couple of days ago I gathered that we had to \nbring the government to a halt and that we had to not pay our bills and \nbring the world's financial system into crisis because of the horrors \nof ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. That was the reason. Well, 2 \ndays have come and gone and guess what. It is not the Affordable Care \nAct. That is no longer being discussed. Today, I gather--I haven't seen \nthe news in the last 15 minutes, but the last I heard the reason we are \nshutting down the government and threatening not to pay our bills is \nthat we are spending too much money and the deficit is too high. I \ngather that is the latest reason.\n  Clearly, a deficit of $700 billion and a debt of $16.7 trillion is \ntoo much, but let's make a couple of points about that issue.\n  First, in the last 3 years we have cut the deficit in half. A few \nyears ago it\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\nwas $1.4 trillion, and today it is $700 billion. That is not an \ninsignificant effort.\n  Second, and perhaps most important, we have to understand how we got \nto where we are in terms of the debt and in terms of the deficit. Do we \nhave a large deficit because we are spending too much on Social \nSecurity? Well, actually not because Social Security is independently \nfunded through the payroll tax and hasn't added one nickel to the \ndeficit. So it is not Social Security. We will talk about Medicare and \nMedicaid in a moment. But the reason we have seen a spike in the \ndeficit in recent years has to do with the fact that many of my deficit \nhawk Republican friends--and some Democrats--voted for the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, but they forgot to pay for that war--just a slip; they \njust forgot about it--and those wars are going to cost between $3 \ntrillion and $6 trillion. So I want everyone to remember that the great \ndeficit hawks who are busy trying to cut every program that working \nfamilies in this country need forgot to pay for wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan that will cost between $3 trillion and $6 trillion.\n  The third issue is that our great deficit hawks had no problem during \nthe Bush era giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry.\n  Fourth, of course, is that as a result of deregulation and greed and \nrecklessness and illegal behavior, Wall Street brought us to a \nfinancial collapse and a recession, with the result that revenue \nsubstantially declined.\n  I raise those issues, giving a little bit of history about how we got \ninto the deficit today, because now, I guess, Congressman Ryan and \nothers have decided that the reason we shut down the government is not \nbecause of ObamaCare, it is because there is too much spending, and \nthat translates into their desire to cut Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and to cut other vitally important programs for the middle-\nclass and working families of this country.\n  Before we talk about the pain that would be caused by making savage \ncuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, it is important to put \nthis discussion in a broader context. If we go out to the American \npeople and ask people in Virginia and people in Vermont and people all \nover this country and if we look at virtually every single poll that \nhas been done in recent years asking the American people what they \nconsider to be the most important issues facing them, do we know what \nthey say? They say the deficit is important, but what is much more \nimportant is the issue of high unemployment and the economy in general. \nThat is what every single poll shows. And the American people are \nright.\n  The deficit is important. What is even more important is addressing \nthe reality that almost 14 percent of our workforce--if we count those \npeople who have given up looking for work and are working part time, \nalmost 14 percent of our workforce today is unemployed. What the \nAmerican people are saying to Congress is create jobs, deal with \nunemployment.\n  The other issue out there that all across this country people are \ndeeply worried about is that most of the new jobs being created--and \nthis has been the case for a number of years now--most of the jobs \nbeing created are part-time, low-wage jobs.\n  How is somebody supposed to survive working for $10 an hour and \ngetting 25 hours of work a week? You cannot do it, and we are seeing \nmore and more of those types of jobs in the economy--by the way, jobs \nthat provide little or no benefits.\n  What the American people are saying is raise the minimum wage. I \ncannot remember what the last poll was, but surely more than 70 percent \nof the American people have said: A minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a \nstarvation wage. We need to raise the minimum wage.\n  Anybody who has kids in college today understands it is harder and \nharder for working-class and middle-class families to send their kids \nto college. The American people are saying to us: Do something. You \ntell us what is true--that it is hard to make it into the middle class \nunless kids have a college education. Well, do something to make \ncollege affordable. Do not have my kid leaving college or graduate \nschool $50,000 in debt or $80,000 in debt. Do something about that.\n  Anybody who drives anywhere in America, in Vermont or in Indiana or \nanyplace else, understands that our infrastructure--our roads, our \nbridges, wastewater plants, water plants, our rail system--is \ndeteriorating rapidly, and they say: Do something about the \ninfrastructure.\n  As global warming is perceived as more and more of a crisis, people \nare telling us: Do something about energy efficiency. Why are we \nemitting greenhouse gas emissions into the air when we can be a much \nmore energy-efficient country?\n  On and on it goes. The American people are hurting, and they want us \nto address their problems.\n  The other point that needs to be made is that when we talk about the \nfinancial and economic problems facing this country, it is terribly \nimportant to take an overview of what is going on in the economy in \ngeneral. There is no debate about this: The middle class in America \ntoday is disappearing. Median family income today is less than it was \n24 years ago. Despite all of the increase in productivity and \ntechnology, median family income is less today than it was 24 years \nago. That is rather extraordinary.\n  We have 46.5 million people in this country living in poverty--more \nthan at any time in the history of this country; 22.5 percent of our \nkids live in poverty. That is the highest rate of childhood poverty in \nthe industrialized world. Poverty among senior citizens is increasing. \nSo we have major economic challenges that we face.\n  Our Republican friends, who a few days ago were telling us they had \nto shut down the government and threaten not to pay our bills because \nof the horrors of ObamaCare, now apparently are no longer concerned \nabout ObamaCare, and they are now concerned about the national debt and \nthey are concerned about our spending.\n  Well, this is what I want to say: If we want to have a conversation \nor a conference or a discussion or a special committee--call it \nwhatever you want--we cannot just look at cutting Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, as Congressman Ryan and many others want. We \nhave to put into that discussion how it happens that one out of four \nmajor corporations in this country does not pay a nickel in Federal \nincome taxes.\n  Do you think that should be part of the discussion? I think it should \nbe. We have to put into that discussion how it happens that corporate \nAmerica is putting their money in the Cayman Islands and in other tax \nhavens and avoiding paying tens and tens of billions of dollars in \nFederal taxes. Do we need that in the discussion? I think we do. If you \nare going to talk about a conference on the economy, the conference \nmust include the need to create millions of jobs, it must include the \nneed to raise the minimum wage, it must include pay equity so that \nwomen get the same wages men get for the work they are doing, and it \nmust include rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  This discussion on the economy cannot simply happen on Republican \nterms. We live in a country in which the middle class is in rapid \ndecline while the wealthiest people and the largest corporations are \ndoing phenomenally well. Any discussion we have--after we reopen the \ngovernment, after we pay our bills--has to include that important \nreality. We cannot and we must not--for moral and economic reasons--\nbalance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, \nand low-income people. The wealthiest people and the largest \ncorporations have to get involved, have to pay their fair share of \ntaxes, and we have to create the millions of jobs this country \ndesperately needs.\n  As I see the constantly changing agenda on the part of my Republican \ncolleagues as to why they have shut down the government, I want to make \nit clear that the first thing that has to happen is they have to \nunderstand this government has to be reopened, and it has to be \nreopened with a strong budget that lasts for the rest of this fiscal \nyear. And we have to pay our debts so this country and the entire \nglobal economy does not descend into financial chaos. We have to do \nthat, and if Mr. Boehner were to give the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives a vote on that issue today, I expect it would win.\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\n  But as we go forward and we discuss broader issues, as we should, the \nagenda cannot simply be the agenda of the Republican candidates for \nPresident and Vice President who lost by 5 million votes. The agenda \nhas to be what the American people want, and that is expanding the \nmiddle class, creating jobs, raising wages, rebuilding our \ninfrastructure, pay equity, and making college affordable. Those are \nthe issues that have to be on the agenda as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friends in Vermont watch what is going \non, and it is hard to explain it to them--especially people who are \nhard working, who rely one way or the other on government programs and \nthey do not come through.\n  It was in the press today about the polls, saying how angry people \nare at the small group in the other body who has held things up. And I \nunderstand that. It is probably difficult for those people, who work \nhard every single day, pay their bills, trust in their government, and \nthen see what is happening.\n  I appreciated the meeting with the President yesterday. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer was there. I know how much President \nObama wants to have the shutdown end, have people go back to work, have \nthe United States pay its bills. And I agree with him. I think the vast \nmajority of Americans agree with him. Now he has to get a tiny minority \nin the Congress to agree with him. It is unfortunate--it is \nunfortunate--that they do not because ultimately we should be serving \nthe best interests of our country, not what might work at a tea party \nrally or a fundraiser to get one's face on television.\n  I will give an example. When September 30 came and went, it was not \njust the Federal Government that shut down. The farm bill extension \nalso expired. I can speak to this with some sense of knowledge of how \nthat works. I have been able to serve on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee for 38 years. I have served as the chair of it. We have a \nsuperb chair now in Debbie Stabenow. But I have seen both Republicans \nand Democrats in that committee traditionally over the years come \ntogether, work closely together.\n  I think of two people who were nominees of their parties for \nPresident who were miles apart in political philosophy--Senator George \nMcGovern, a Democrat, and Senator Bob Dole, a Republican; one a liberal \nDemocrat, the other a conservative Republican--but on the farm bill, on \nthe nutrition programs, they worked closely together for what was best \nfor America, what was best for the country.\n  We passed an excellent farm bill, a bipartisan farm bill in this \nbody, in the Senate. But because the other body would not take it up \nand either pass it or vote to improve it, the farm bill extension \nexpired. This one-two punch of political reality is needlessly harming \nour Nation. It is leaving farmers with great uncertainty about the \nfuture of vital farm programs, all the while with no staff at USDA to \nanswer farmers' questions.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has a lot of agriculture \nin his State. His State is much larger than mine. But we also have a \nlot of agriculture in the State of Vermont.\n  There is a basic essential responsibility of Congress to fund the \ngovernment. Why has that been ignored? Regular business is replaced by \nbumper-sticker politics. This shutdown is and was entirely avoidable. \nIt is perpetuated by the reckless leadership of the House that is \nwilling to imperil the economy and negatively impact every single \nAmerican family.\n  They are not asking for compromise. Compromise has already happened \nhere in the Senate. We conceded to the House terms. We adopted and \nleader Harry Reid had to fight to get the votes to give the House what \nthey had asked for by adopting an appropriations bill at the funding \nlevel the House wanted, which maintains sequestration.\n  But even though he had been told by the House leadership that would \nget us back, that would have the government stay open, after we did it \nthey said: Oops, we changed our mind. They moved the goalposts again.\n  You cannot run government like that. That is by whim. That is not by \ncommitment. That is by changing your views by the moment. It is not by \nkeeping your word. Anyone claiming that the Senate has been unwilling \nto compromise has conveniently ignored the fact that the Senate came \nforward and passed a continuing resolution at the level the House \nrequested.\n  So I, like the American people, certainly like my fellow Vermonters, \nam tired of having a political process obstructed. It is time to reopen \nthe government for business. Stop the silly season. Stop the games. \nStop rushing to the TV cameras to get your face on there and say: I am \nthe only person serving America, as I try to destroy America.\n  Let's reopen. For the farmers in Vermont who have found their local \nUSDA office dark, they know the shutdown is even more troubling, \nbecause it has diverted attention from the now-expired farm bill. This \nmanufactured crisis is making it next to impossible to reach compromise \non this important agriculture, rural development, and nutrition \nlegislation.\n  The bipartisan Senate farm bill would provide $25 billion in savings. \nThis is a bill both Republicans and Democrats voted for in the \nAgriculture Committee and on this floor--$25 billion in savings that \ncould be applied toward reducing the federal deficit.\n  But no; instead, the House forced us into the shutdown, which is \ncosting the Federal Government hundreds of millions of dollars a day, \n$1.6 billion a week, for nothing. So they can go on television and say: \nLook at us. Rally to us because we are standing up for America.\n  No, you are costing American taxpayers $1.6 billion a week. That is \nstraight to the taxpayers. But more and more of the damage of the \ngovernment shutdown is spreading across the Nation. In every city and \nevery community, with each passing day, the State governments, local \ngovernments feel the pinch and may go bankrupt.\n  We heard last week that the CME Group, the world's largest futures \nexchange, informed their customers that the shutdown and USDA furloughs \ncould affect dairy and livestock contracts. While much of Wall Street \nis worried they will not have the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment \nnumbers this month, on Main Street and our Nation's farms, our \nagriculture businesses, the concerns are growing about missing \nagriculture pricing information that impacts dairy and livestock \nfutures contracts and options for milk, cheese, butter, and other dairy \nproducts. That may sound esoteric to some, but if you are one of those \nfarmers who gets up before dawn, works hard all day long, until after \ndark, 7 days a week, paying your bills, paying your mortgage, being an \nintegral part of the community, this is real. The farmers are doing \ntheir work and their job. We ought to do ours.\n  Let me give you an example of the uncertainty the shutdown is \nimposing on farmers and businesses from coast to coast. Vermont's own \nCabot Creamery Cooperative, which makes some of Vermont's award-winning \ncheeses, could be hit by the missing pricing information. In recent \nyears, Cabot, being good business people, has increased the use of \nfutures contracts as an active part of its risk management effort. It \nmakes sense. We have seen many farmers and food companies and dairy \ncooperatives across the country do the same after the disastrous \ncollapse in milk prices in 2009.\n  But the USDA staff is furloughed, and farmers and businesses like \nCabot can no longer have a daily or weekly report of cash prices for \nagriculture products. These are the benchmarks of these futures \ncontracts that are used to hedge against risk and big price swings.\n  To make matters worse, the entire USDA Web site is shut down, keeping \nfarmers from seeing and using previous agriculture reports from the \nagency. These are the same people who are working long hours. They are \nobeying the rules. They are doing what is expected of them. But \nsuddenly they are\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nhaving their legs taken out from under them.\n  I have heard from the Vermont Economic Development Authority. We call \nit VEDA. It is Vermont's statewide economic development finance lender. \nThey are focused on supporting Vermont industrial, commercial, and \nagriculture enterprises. Nearly their entire agricultural portfolio, \n$70 million--probably not much in some States, but a lot in my little \nState--intersects in some way with USDA. Their ability to service \ncurrent loans and work on new agriculture loans is quickly freezing up. \nThe list is growing for the number of customers that are going to be \nlocked out in the cold because the shutdown is quickly causing the \nwhole agricultural lending scene to seize up.\n  I am hearing from our apple growers in Vermont. We have a very short \nharvest this time of the year in Vermont. Fall harvest, and then it \nsnows. They are in the middle of a fantastic, long-awaited harvest. \nThey have to keep one eye on the weather forecast on how their crops \nare doing, and the other on the Department of Labor to ensure that \ntheir apple harvest workforce, which is a seasonal workforce, will \nactually be there.\n  Many of our farms use the Federal H-2A temporary worker program. I am \nstarting to hear a litany of problems due to the tea party shutdown of \nthe Federal Government. Farmers are unable to get their workers \nrequired Social Security numbers, because the Social Security \nAdministration is not issuing new numbers and cards during the \nshutdown--during the tea party shutdown.\n  These farmers are Republicans, Democrats, Independents. They do not \nwant to play politics. They want to play by the rules. They cannot \nunderstand why the tea party is playing politics with their business. \nIt is resulting in farmers needing to pay huge amounts of backup \nwithholding taxes, which they otherwise would not need to do if their \nworkers would be able to acquire Social Security numbers.\n  Farmers needing new H-2A workers are being stymied in the application \nprocess since the Department of Labor is not administering the \nnecessary parts of that process thanks to the artificial, made-in-\nCongress, tea party shutdown. The ripple effects of the shutdown are \nspreading ominously outward across Vermont and every other State.\n  I spoke about one aspect of agriculture. My colleagues represent all \nparts of this country and could talk about a whole lot of other aspects \nof agriculture. That is just one multi-multi-multibillion dollar \nindustry across this country that is being hurt and ultimately being \ndevastated. Some will go out of business, all because of the tea party \nshutdown.\n  All these problems could be solved right now. They can be solved this \nafternoon. So let's stop this shameful politicking. The House should \nend the shutdown. Vote on the Senate-passed continuing resolution. \nAfter all, it has the numbers the House asked for. All they have to do \nis keep their word. We in the Senate did. Now it is time for them to.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, there are two issues wrapped together \nright now that are causing dire consequences for people all across the \ncountry. The first, as we know and as we have been debating, is the \ngovernment shutdown and all that has happened in terms of people being \nhurt, jobs being lost, small businesses not being able to get the loans \nthey need, people not being able to complete their mortgage \nrequirements to get the homes they want, the concerns about health and \nsafety and all of the other issues, children, what is happening to so \nmany people, senior citizens, veterans, and so on--very, very serious.\n  This is the 11th day of the government shutdown that is costing us \njobs, slowing the economy, and hurting families all across the country. \nIt is an absolute drag on the economy, on our markets and on, frankly, \nAmerica's standing in the world, which we should all be concerned about \nright now.\n  It is, frankly, an embarrassment that in the greatest, wealthiest \ncountry in the world our government is shut down while a small minority \ntries to score political points. Unfortunately, that is what has been \nhappening.\n  The second issue is also very important; that is, the lapse of a farm \nbill, the agriculture and food policy bill in this country. The farm \nbill has been actually expired for 376 days--376 days--because it ended \non September 30 of 2012.\n  Last January there was a partial extension that extended subsidies \nthat we all said should be eliminated as it did not include reforms and \ndid not include deficit reduction, but there was a partial extension \nuntil September 30 and that has also lapsed.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer from Indiana, who is a \nmember of my committee, fights very hard for Indiana. I am grateful he \nis a member of our committee. I know the Senator understands and shares \nmy tremendous concern and urgency, both about the government shutdown \nand that we are seeing agricultural programs and rural economic \ndevelopment shut down because we don't have a farm bill.\n  Nowhere is this felt more strongly now than in South Dakota. The \nPresiding Officer and I are not from South Dakota, but we have \ncolleagues in the Senate who have been speaking on the floor. I have \ntalked to the Senators from South Dakota who are deeply concerned, as \nwell as the Senators from North Dakota.\n  In South Dakota last Friday, October 4, an early autumn blizzard \nkilled an estimated 75,000 head of cattle. This is one of the many \npictures of what is happening as a result of this blizzard. Many \nproducers lost half of their entire herd. Keep in mind that many \nthousands of these cows would have produced calves in the spring. These \nlosses are huge for ranchers and families and will be felt for many \nyears to come. These cattle ranchers and their families have no safety \nnet, zero safety net. They don't receive direct payment subsidies. They \nnow have zero safety net. They only had livestock disaster plans which \nexpired on October 1, 2011, 741 days ago. Their losses are expected to \nreach into the tens of millions of dollars.\n  Our Senate farm bill, which we passed with strong bipartisan \nmajorities last year and this year--we have actually done it twice--\nincludes permanent livestock disaster assistance for these ranchers' \nfamilies to make sure ranchers, such as those in South Dakota, don't go \nbankrupt, which is what is going to happen if we don't get this farm \nbill in place as soon as possible.\n  But there is no farm bill. Even if there were, those farmers wouldn't \nbe able to get help because the farmers can't document their losses or \nget the answers they need from the Farm Service Agency offices because \nthey are closed due to the shutdown.\n  These ranchers, such as many other ranchers across the country, are \ngetting a one-two punch by not being able to go to their local FSA \noffice to get the help they need, while at the same time not having the \nlong-term certainty of agricultural policy and a safety net when there \nis a catastrophe.\n  Three things have come together to make this a major disaster for \nranchers, such as the need for a farm bill with livestock disaster \nassistance, which we have. We have a great livestock disaster \nassistance program in our bill.\n  The good news is the House has one as well. If we can get a farm bill \ndone, which could be done any day--we are willing to be a part of any \nagreement anyone does--and we will be able to help those South Dakota \nranchers. Of the three items, one is that we don't yet have the final \nfarm bill, even though the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, has done its \njob twice.\n  Secondly, we have a government shutdown that is not allowing these \nranchers to get the help they need.\n  Thirdly, we have a blizzard.\n  Two out of three of these are self-inflicted. Think about it. Because \nthere is no farm bill, because there is a government shutdown, \nsomewhere ranchers are going to lose everything--their homes, their \nland, everything--because\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\nof the freak blizzard in early October. We can debate the larger issues \naround that as well.\n  The irony is those ranchers in South Dakota have 3 days under the law \nto dispose of their dead cattle. They were just hit by blizzard, \nsuffered unbelievable losses, and they have 3 days to clean it up. They \ndon't get an extension. They can't kick the can down the road. They \ncan't wait forever either. They can't wait any longer for us to get a \nfarm bill done. This needs to be done right now. If there is the \npolitical will to do it and there is support from the Speaker to do it, \nwe can get this done quickly.\n  Those cattle ranchers aren't alone. Producers in the Midwest, the \nNorthwest, the West, and much of the South went through one of the \nworst droughts in a generation last summer. Many producers sold off \nmost of their herds because there wasn't the grass for the cattle to \ngraze on. Feed was scarce and expensive. As a result, cattle \ninventories dropped to their lowest levels in five decades, 50 years. \nFor all of us who enjoy eating meat, we are seeing the consequences of \nthe lowest level in five decades. Farmers all across the country \nsuffered from this drought. In addition, fruit growers from my State \nsuffered heavy losses last year from an early spring followed by a late \nfrost, and our cherry growers were some of the hardest hit. In fact, \nthey were virtually wiped out. Their crop was wiped out last year. They \nalso don't have a safety net. Similar to ranchers, they aren't eligible \nfor direct payment subsidies and they weren't able to get any crop \ninsurance either.\n  We worked hard in this farm bill to make sure there were risk \nmanagement tools, not only subsidies because a farmer grows something. \nAs taxpayers, we can't afford to do that. It is not the right thing to \ndo. We have a deficit we have to address, and it makes no sense. We \nwork hard to make sure the risk management tools are available to help \nfarmers and ranchers manage their risk when there is a disaster such as \nSouth Dakota, but there is no help until we get the farm bill signed \ninto law.\n  For all the men and women, all the families--and the vast majority we \nare talking about are middle-class families--small farmers, medium-\nsized farmers who are working hard from sunrise to sunset, day-in and \nday-out with the riskiest business in the world, they can't kick the \ncan down the road. When the crop is ready to be harvested, they have to \ndo it.\n  They are looking at us and saying: Get the job done. Get the farm \nbill done now.\n  All of those middle-class families and 16 million people in this \ncountry have jobs because of agriculture. They are saying we have \nwaited long enough. How many disasters have to happen without the right \ntools before this gets done? With 16 million people, the biggest bill \nwe are going to pass this year is the farm bill. This is for rural \neconomic development, energy, food-related industries, conservation \nefforts, our help for people who are caught up in their own personal \neconomic disasters, which is so critical, and they are all counting on \nus.\n  The men and women who are working hard to bring in the harvest are \ncounting on us to get this done. We did a farm bill. I am grateful to \nleaders on both sides of the aisle who came together. That is how I \nknow we can stop this shutdown and pay our bills because we have done \nthings together in the Senate. We need our colleagues in the House to \nbe willing to step in and do the same.\n  People have waited long enough. It is time to get it done, and it is \ntime to get it done now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have been on this floor many times over \nthe past 2\\1/2\\ years, and here we are again, talking about yet another \nfiscal cliff, another drama, another soap opera playing out before us.\n  The American people are wondering what in the world is going on down \nthere in Washington? How come we can't get resolution to some of these \nproblems? Why can't we remove the dark cloud of uncertainty about the \nfiscal future of this country? It is stifling economic growth.\n  We are growing at an anemic 4-to-5-year rate of less than 1 percent. \nThat does not put people back to work. That does not solve our \nunemployment problem. It only makes it worse. That does not revive an \neconomy. Even with all the new discoveries in energy and the lower cost \nof manufacturing and more competitiveness, we have not revived the \neconomy for the American people--whether they have just graduated from \nschool with a degree and can't find a job except at maybe a fast-food \nrestaurant, or whether they are a middle-aged man or woman who had \ntheir hours cut back, or they have been laid off; whether it is a \nfamily trying to save for their children's education--people are \nhurting all the way up and down the line and it is frustrating. It is \nfrustrating for all of us.\n  It is particularly frustrating for the people I represent in Indiana, \nand I think for all Americans, to watch the dysfunction taking place in \nWashington, this inability to come together to find a solution to our \nproblems, and this careening from cliff to cliff, debt crisis to debt \ncrisis; with people on edge and markets on edge, up 300 1 day and down \n250 the next, waiting for any glimmer of hope for some solution--or, \nreacting with gloom and doom if we fail to come forward with a \nsolution.\n  Now we have a government shutdown; now the clock is ticking toward \nthe debt limit expiration, and we have not yet come to any resolution \nor solution to these problems. People are sick and tired of this broken \nprocess here in Washington, DC. I am sick and tired of it. My \ncolleagues are sick and tired of it. Yet we have not been able to find \na solution that addresses the problem.\n  Republicans just came from a constructive 2-hour meeting at the White \nHouse with the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of \nTreasury. It is a step forward. It is not a Neil Armstrong step forward \nbecause it is not a giant leap for mankind. It is a baby step forward. \nAnd it is an important first step forward because unless you come to \nthe table to negotiate, unless you are willing to open up where you are \nin the same room together sharing your concepts, your thoughts, and \nyour concerns, you can't even begin to find a solution. So this was a \nstep in the right direction.\n  The President met with House Republican Members yesterday and Senate \nRepublican Members today. Our meeting was candid and transparent. Most \neverybody was able to say what was on their mind and talk about \npossible solutions.\n  I wish I could say we walked out and stood together, as has been done \nbefore in solving these types of problems between Presidents and \nMembers of the leadership in both the House and the Senate. I wish I \ncould say we were able to do that, but we weren't. But going from ``I \nwill not negotiate, period, don't even bother to even think about it,'' \nto, ``Let's sit down and at least talk this through and see if we can \ncome to a resolution'' is a step forward. So I take some hope from \nthat.\n  I made the decision in early 2010 to come back to the Senate to try \nand solve what I thought were some of the most fundamental issues \naffecting the future of this country that perhaps we faced in a long \ntime; namely, this continued deficit spending and plunge into debt, \nthis accumulation of a debt that is so jeopardizing our future and our \nchildren's future and the future of America.\n  The passage of ObamaCare by one party without any bipartisan support, \njammed through the Congress by a waiver of the rules, has turned into a \nnightmare--a nightmare of implementation. It is part of the fiscal \nproblem. I didn't come here today to necessarily talk about that. I \nhave been here before talking many times about what I think we need to \ndo to address our health care problems--clearly in a different way than \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  We see unfolding before our eyes yet another dysfunctional piece of \nlegislation that can't even be implemented, even though the party that \npassed this law has had 3\\1/2\\ years to implement it.\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nWe hit the October 1 date when people can start to enroll, and the \nsystems aren't even up and ready. Now if this law had been in effect \nfor 3 or 6 months, we could say they rushed it. It has been 3\\1/2\\ \nyears--actually 3\\3/4\\ years, and they still don't have it right. There \nstill are major questions. This is an issue we must continue to deal \nwith. We haven't been successful so far because we have not gotten any \nbipartisan support to make any significant reforms. That is part of our \nfiscal issue, and that fiscal issue is eating up the promise of \nAmerica which has been given to every generation in the history of this \ncountry, and stands ready to be denied to the next generation and \nsucceeding generations because of our inability to summon the political \nwill to do what we all know we need to do.\n\n  We cannot keep spending more than we take in. We cannot keep \nborrowing money to cover that difference. We have seen in just the last \n4\\1/2\\ years of this administration a staggering increase in the amount \nof debt we have accumulated--from just a little over $10 trillion to \nnow $17 trillion in the space of one administration, with 3 more years \nto go. It is unsustainable. I doubt there is a Member of this body--\nRepublican or Democrat, liberal or conservative--who could simply \nignore it and say this is not a problem. It is a huge problem. Every \nday, every week, every month, every year we postpone it, the problem \nbecomes worse.\n  We have made effort after effort--bipartisan effort, Simpson-Bowles, \nDomenici-Rivlin, laying out plans as to how to address this over a \nperiod of time to put us on a path to solvency, the Gang of 6, all the \nefforts of a Republican, Saxby Chambliss, and a Democrat, Mark Warner, \nand those of us who supported those efforts to try to find a way to \nsolve this problem, the supercommittee, the dinner group which I was \npart of, substantive discussions with the White House, with the Chief \nof Staff, with the President himself over a 7-month period of time--we \nhave been unable to reach a resolution, unable to even come to the \nconclusion that this problem is so great it needs to be dealt with now, \nnot pushed down later for some other administration. It has been too \nmany Congresses and too many administrations simply saying, We can't \nget it done.'' We will have to push it off for yet another term, yet \nanother election, yet another President.\n  Well, time is running out. So despite all these efforts, we have \nfailed. In my opinion, and I think in the opinion of most, the reason \nwhy we have failed is because we have not had Presidential leadership. \nThe kinds of changes that are needed to address a problem this large, \nto bring parties together, to put us in the position where we are \nwilling to risk our careers, willing to stand up and do what is right \nfor America regardless of the political consequences, willing to stand \ntogether--Republican and Democrat--to basically say this problem \ntranscends politics, and not use it against each other, but stand \ntogether and say this problem is of such magnitude that we have to \nstand together and have the will to go forward--that can only be \naccomplished, and only has been accomplished if you look to past \nhistory, by Presidential leadership.\n  I was privileged to be here as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives when we faced not as great a problem, but still a \nsignificant a problem with entitlement spending--in this case Social \nSecurity. The trust fund was running dry. The case was made to the \nAmerican people. A Republican President reached out to a Democrat \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives--a divided government, \nDemocrats in one House, Republicans in the other--reached out and said, \nWe have a problem and it can only be solved if the two of us stand \ntogether in a bipartisan way. And that they did. It wasn't easy, but it \nwas successful, and through it we made a substantial, meaningful change \nto our Social Security system, which bought about 35 years from \ninsolvency.\n  Now we face an even more dire crisis than that, but the solution will \nbe the same--and that is, we need to have Presidential leadership.\n  I have proposed a number of things. It looks as though we are going \nto be limited. I did not get any indication from the President that he \nis willing to take these kinds of risks to so-called go big.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am not going to wait to speak, but if I \nmight ask the distinguished Senator from Indiana a question, and then \ncertainly agree to however much time he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator from Indiana is very sincere as he has worked \ndiligently and in a bipartisan way to tackle this budget problem. It is \nthis Senator's hope we can continue those kinds of discussions we had a \ncouple of years ago.\n  Would the Senator agree that the shutdown situation we find ourselves \nin, however--which started for a different reason than the budget \nquestions. It started for the reason of people wanting to defund \nObamaCare--that the shutdown creates a crisis atmosphere in which it is \nvery difficult to have those budgetary discussions the Senator yearns \nto have, as does his colleague from Florida?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I answer to my friend from Florida, who did \nwork with a group of us, Democrats and Republicans, in past efforts to \naddress the larger question which I am addressing, I know he is as \ndisappointed as I am that we were not able to come to a resolution.\n  Republicans do not want a shutdown. We want a solution. We have found \nin the past that the leverage of a financial situation often gives us \nthe opportunity to raise the issues and hopefully reach at least a \npartial solution. That has happened in the past.\n  I stand with those who simply say: I want to find a solution to the \nlarger problem, including the shutdown of the government. I was \nfocusing my efforts on the debt limit we are reaching because it is \nvery hard to make a case for asking the American people for yet another \ntrillion dollars of debt loaded on their shoulders without some efforts \nto address why this debt is being accumulated and why it continues to \ngo forward. Why has the Congress not stepped up to address this \nspending?\n  It is like having a credit card and the bank calls and says you have \nhit your limit. You have asked us several times in the past to raise \nthat limit, and we have done so, but you keep reaching the limit and \nyou keep asking for more credit. At what point are you going to amend \nyour reckless spending so you do not have to keep coming in here and so \nwe do not have to keep giving you more credit? How do we know you are \never going to pay this back? How do we know you are not just going to \ndeclare bankruptcy and insolvency because you have simply hit the point \nwhere you do not have the means to pay this back? We might be willing \nto give you some increase in your credit, but first you have to give us \nsomething back; that is, you have to get off your addition to spending \nthat keeps driving you into this situation.\n  What I was trying to address here is, yes, a solution to get this \ngovernment back to work combined, hopefully, with a renewed effort--by \nthe Senator from Florida, myself, and others--to strip out the \nunnecessary spending, the duplication, the egregious misuse of \ntaxpayers' dollars for nonessential functions of this Federal \nGovernment.\n  There is no disagreement between us that we need to fund our national \nsecurity. There is no disagreement about some of the essential cancer \nresearch and a number of other things this government engages in that \ncannot be handled at the State level, cannot be handled at a private \nlevel, substantially. But there is a lot of concern about excessive \nspending that continues to push us more and more into debt.\n  In answer to the question from my friend, Republicans do not like \nthis shutdown any more than Democrats. We want to have some solution to \nthe underlying problem. The underlying problem is the merger of not \nonly excessive spending but the debt limit that is the result of that \nspending.\n  I know my time is rapidly running out, down to zero here. Let me \nconclude by saying I believe we have a duty--a duty to the American \ntaxpayer but beyond that a duty to the future of this country, which is \nnot just our children and grandchildren but everybody's\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\nchildren and grandchildren, all the generations to come. We have a duty \nand a moral responsibility not to so laden them with debt that they \nwill not have the opportunities many of us enjoyed, simple \nopportunities of owning a home, saving money for our kids so we can \ngive them a good education, getting the bills paid on time, and living \nthe American dream. That is not to become a millionaire or \nbillionaire--maybe for some, but for most, to live just a quiet, \nnormal, peaceful life, passing on those values and giving our children \nthose opportunities we have found for ourselves.\n  I suggest that until we summon the political will to do so and until, \nfrankly, we have a President who has that same will, we will not solve \nthat problem.\n  I will conclude with this. It is a story--maybe you heard it before. \nA man walks into the doctor's office and says: I don't feel well at \nall.\n  The doctor gives him all the tests and all the exams and calls him \nback in and says: The disease you have is terminal. It is going to kill \nyou. There are two ways to address this. There is a cure. It has some \npain attached to it. You cannot just ignore it. But if you will agree \nto this medicine we are going to give you and these procedures, we can \nsave your life. If you are not willing to do that, if you do not have \nthe will to go through that process to get yourself back to health, \nthere is another alternative. The alternative is that we can transplant \nthat disease into your children and into your grandchildren and then \nlet them deal with it.\n  That is exactly what we are doing here by not having the will, \nsummoning the will to do the things we all know need to be done to \nprevent this country from becoming insolvent, from denying and \ndestroying the American dream. The future of this country rests with \nour decisions. To date we have not made those decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I see the great junior Senator from \nVirginia waiting to speak. I would like to make a quick statement.\n  I again want to remind the Senate and anybody who is listening what \nbrought about the shutdown. It has been going on now for a week and a \nhalf, and we do not see any relief in sight. What started the whole \nthing on the shutdown is this: Shut down the government unless you \nagree to reverse a law that was passed and declared constitutional by \nthe Supreme Court. By reversing that law, by taking the funding away \nfrom the Affordable Care Act--that is what started this a week and a \nhalf ago.\n  I have just come from the commerce committee, where Senator \nRockefeller had a hearing on everything from consumer finance and the \nconsumer federation on how consumers are not being protected; \neverything from the National Transportation Safety Board and how all of \nthese accidents that have occurred within the last week and a half of \nthe shutdown cannot be investigated because all of their staff is on \nfurlough; to the aerospace industry--they cannot deliver airplanes that \nare ready for delivery because they have to have their final FAA \ncertificate; to, of course, the space program in NASA, and 97 percent \nfurloughed; to over 60 percent of NOAA furloughed and all of the \nweather satellites we are trying to get going. Then you take all these \ngovernment employees who are furloughed, and what about all the \ncontractors to the government who are now laying off all the \ncontractors?\n  We had an Alaskan captain talking about how he needs the government \ncertificates so he can go to sea on the Alaskan crab catch. He cannot \nget that. Guess who is lurking out there. Russian captains, to come in \nand start supplying the world market, including the domestic U.S. \nmarket, with crab. You can go through the whole thing.\n  Then, of course, the other side says, in the midst of the shutdown, \nwith the default of the credit rating of the government facing us, you \nare not negotiating.\n  That reminds me of a story. Two people are talking.\n  One says: Can I burn your House down?\n  No.\n  Can I burn your second floor down?\n  No.\n  Garage?\n  No.\n  How about your utility room?\n  No.\n  Oh, you won't compromise.\n  You cannot compromise over something that is hurting so many people's \nlives and is threatening the security and safety of people's lives. You \ncannot compromise on that. You cannot compromise on this Nation going \ninto financial default.\n  Come on. Let's use a little common sense and get back into government \nfunctioning again and stop the nonsense about threatening a default of \nthis country. Then let's do what the very sincere Senator from Indiana \nsaid. Let's continue those discussions about what we can do for the \nlong-term financial integrity of this country.\n  I yield. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to deliver a status report on what \nthe government shutdown has meant to Virginia this week. I gave one \nlast week, and I am back on the floor to share some additional news.\n  I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Florida. I \nwill talk about some similar effects. These effects are felt \neverywhere. It is not just furloughed employees; it is contractors, it \nis local communities and nonprofits, and it is the housing market.\n  Let me talk a bit about Virginia. Some of the pages might have been \non the floor last week when I talked about a tiny community in \nVirginia, Chincoteague, which is a barrier island off the eastern shore \nof Virginia. It is not the place you might think of when you think \nabout where Federal shutdown effects would be felt in a very specific \nway. But Chincoteague's economy is oriented around tourism. There is a \nnational seashore and national wildlife refuge there, adjacent to \nChincoteague Island, and so these few thousand people over the years \nhave built up an economy that is hotels, motels, restaurants, grocery \nstores, drive-ins, and other shops for visitors. The fall is a very \nbusy time. The island gets about 1.5 million visitors a year, and they \nare coming to the National Wildlife Refuge and the National Seashore.\n  On October 1, when government closed down the seashore and wildlife \nrefuge closed down, the visitors have stopped coming. All those \nbusinesses, all those small mom-and-pops--I can see the faces of Tommy \nand Donna, and Jack Tarr, who is the mayor, and Glenn and Jane, my \nfriends over there--they have called me to say: We are hit so hard \nbecause this is a busy time for us and we are closed down.\n  Last weekend there was a huge festival. There is a historic \nlighthouse on the island, and they have been working for 6 years to \nrestore it. The opening was last week, and they were expecting hundreds \nor even thousands of visitors. They had to cancel it because it is on \nthe wildlife refuge.\n  This weekend there was another big festival. Some of you might have \nread the book ``Misty of Chincoteague,'' which is about the \nChincoteague Island ponies. Children read this book about ponies, \nprobably ponies that came there from Spain, swim across the sound twice \na year to Chincoteague, get shots, get inoculated. In the spring, some \nare sold for population control so they do not overrun the island. This \nweekend was the fall pony roundup. They had to cancel it because the \nwildlife refuge is closed.\n  It is not just a tourism event. It hurts all the businesses, but it \nis more than that. It is a fundraiser for the volunteer fire department \nthat keeps every home and business on Chincoteague Island safe. They do \nnot have a fire department other than the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire \nDepartment. They have two fundraisers a year. This weekend was one of \nthem. They have canceled it. The volunteer fire department put up on \ntheir Web site: ``The fall pony roundup is closed because of the \nchildish and idiotic antics of our Government.''\n  The other main economy in Chincoteague is NASA. There is a facility \nat Wallops Island, 5 miles away, and over 80 percent of the thousand \nemployees and contractors who work at NASA, 5 miles from Chincoteague \nIsland, are furloughed.\n  So you pull the guts out of the tourism economy, which this community\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nrelies on, and you pull the guts out of NASA, which the community \nrelies on--this community has been devastated by the government \nshutdown, and why? Why?\n  Mark Wright is a retired lieutenant colonel from the U.S. Army who \nserved in the Army for 23 years, including service tours in Iraq--a \nvery solid veteran. We are so proud. One out of eight Virginians is a \nveteran--an amazing number of people. When he retired, he got a job at \nthe Pentagon as a civilian, a DOD civilian. He got that job earlier \nthis year. Mark Wright was furloughed earlier this year because of the \nsequester. He has a wife and two kids in elementary school. He was \nfurloughed, days off work, less pay, he got through that furlough. Then \nOctober 1, furloughed again. So this veteran who served his country, \nput himself in harm's way, and fought in theaters of battle more than \nonce has been furloughed twice this year.\n\n  Mark Wright and his wife and children live in an apartment in \nStafford County--south of DC. They wanted to buy a home for the first \ntime in their lives. They are in the housing market. They decided they \ncan't buy a home now because he doesn't know if he will have a paycheck \nto make a mortgage payment. He will be lucky enough to keep making the \nrent payment every month. It hurts their family, but it also hurts the \nreal estate market in Stafford County.\n  Just this week it was reported that foreclosures in Virginia are up \n52 percent from August to September, the biggest jump since the start \nof the recession because of the effect of sequester and these kinds of \nfoolish antics, as the volunteer fire department described. So what \nMark Wright and his family are asking is why; why are we doing this?\n  I had an employee roundtable with about seven furloughed employees \nand contractors on Wednesday afternoon in my office. They shared their \nanxieties about their own finances. They shared their own anxieties \nabout having kids at home and getting a paycheck and what it would mean \nto them. I said to one participant: Tell me about your family. He said: \nI am lucky. I don't have a family. Then he caught himself and he said: \nI wish I was married and had a family, but for now when I am not \ngetting a paycheck and I don't know whether I will get a paycheck, I am \nlucky I don't have a family. This was a DOD civilian who was a West \nPoint grad who served as an Active-Duty Army officer for 10 years and \nfought overseas.\n  Others talked about how it felt to be kicked around just because they \nare trying to serve their country. One said: I have gone on \nunemployment. I never wanted to go on unemployment, but I have to for \nmy family. Even those who were financially secure said: I am looking \nelsewhere for a job. Why would I put myself and my family through this? \nI have other skills. Maybe I can't serve the public anymore if the \nCongress is not going to back me.\n  Why are we doing this to these people?\n  A Virginia business that I am going to leave nameless called me the \nother day. They have thousands of employees in Virginia. The shutdown \ncaused their weekly revenue to fall by 85 percent immediately. They are \nstill doing work, and they are still being told--because they are \ncontractors--that they will get paid, they are just not told when they \nwill get pay. But they are paying for office rent and they are paying \nfor utilities and they are paying salaries of employees and they are \npaying monthly health insurance premiums. They don't know when they are \ngoing to get paid, but they are having to write checks to others every \nday.\n  The owner of the business said: A few more weeks of this, and we will \nbe bankrupt and hundreds of people will lose their jobs.\n  Why are we doing this to these businesses?\n  Yesterday the Presiding Officer was with me in a hearing before the \nArmed Services Committee, and a woman by the name of Jo Ann Rooney was \nnominated to be Under Secretary of the Navy. I asked her a question \nabout morale in the Navy and the Pentagon now. Her answer was \ninteresting.\n  Jo Ann Rooney had been working in the Pentagon for quite a while and \nthen left 1 year ago to be president of a women's college. So she has \nbeen away from the Pentagon for 1 year. Now she is back in the Pentagon \nas a nominee to be Under Secretary of the Navy. Her name is pretty \nimportant in Virginia.\n  She said the difference in the Pentagon and with the Navy folks she \nwas working with from when she left 1 year ago to today is completely \nstark. In the year that she has been gone, the furloughs hit and now \nthe shutdown has hit. She said she is walking around the halls and \nlooking at how people are responding. They feel like they are not \nsupported when they are doing this important mission. She had one \nquestion: Why are we doing this to people who are working for the U.S. \nNavy whom we count on to protect us every day. Why?\n  We know, as the Senator from Florida said, that the House pushed this \nshutdown through unwillingness to have a budget conference. We passed a \nbudget in March. We wanted to sit down and find a budget compromise \nwith a very different House budget. We were going to have to compromise \nand do that, but Senators and House Members have blocked a conference. \nWith no conference, we don't get a compromise. With no compromise, we \ndon't get a budget. With no budget, the government shuts down. They \npushed this through a shutdown and only after the shutdown have they \nsaid: All right. Let's talk.\n  Yesterday they revealed a new plan in the House. Their plan was we \nneed to make sure we don't default on our debt, but after 11 days of \nshutdown, we just want to keep the government shut down. We will make \nsure we pay our foreign creditors, but we want to keep the government \nshut down.\n  Why? Why cause this pain? Why hurt the economy? Why push businesses \nto the brink of bankruptcy? Why harm the housing market? Why degrade \nand devalue public servants, especially those who are veterans? Why \njeopardize cities and towns such as Chincoteague? Why hurt nonprofits \nsuch as the Chincoteague Island Volunteer Fire Department? Why leave \nfamilies vulnerable to unemployment and force them to go on \nunemployment for the first time in their lives? Why cause all this \npain?\n  No one in this country is benefiting from the U.S. government being \nshut down. So why is the House continuing to insist that this \ngovernment remain closed?\n  I am continually reminded of the words by the Founder of the \nRepublican Party 150 years ago at Gettysburg--Abraham Lincoln. At the \nend of that amazing speech, he resolved, and we resolved, that \ngovernment of, by, and for the people shall not perish from the Earth, \nnot for a year, not for a month, not for a week, not for a day, not for \nan hour, not for a minute, and not for a second.\n  Why can't the House agree to open the government and stop all this \nunnecessary pain?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tomorrow morning--unless it has otherwise \nchanged--we will be voting on the request from the majority leader and \nthe President to raise the debt ceiling by more than $1 trillion. It \nwill not actually be a dollar figure. It will be suspended for roughly \n1 year--the debt ceiling, that is. So everybody understands what the \nmajority leader and the President are asking us to do: America has \nmaxed out its credit card. It is about $16.7 trillion.\n  I know we talk about millions and billions and trillions as if we \ncould actually conceptualize what that means, but here is an \ninteresting comparison: Under President Obama--he has been in office \nfor about 5 years now--our national debt has gone up $6.1 trillion. The \ndebt accrued by all 43 previous Presidents was $10.6 trillion.\n  Our national debt is $16.7 trillion, and President Obama has asked to \nraise that credit limit another $1 trillion. Here is the catch: If he \nhad a plan to actually deal with how we are going to pay down this \n$16.7 trillion, then maybe there would be a discussion. What he wants \nis what he called a clean debt ceiling, which is a blank check. \nPresident Obama wants a blank check to continue to borrow more and more \nmoney--not so we, the present generation, can live up to our \nresponsibilities and make sure we are fiscally\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\nresponsible but, rather, to foist that debt off onto the next \ngeneration and beyond with absolutely no plan in place to repay it.\n  We have heard discussions about grand bargains. We were with the \nPresident this morning. He was kind enough to invite Republicans in the \nSenate over to the White House. He sort of chuckled about the grand \nbargain that he and Speaker Boehner and others have been pursuing over \nthe last few years. He likened it to a unicorn. In other words, he \nlikened it to a mythical creature no one has actually ever seen. That \nis what the grand bargain is, at least under this administration.\n  We reminded the President this morning that none of us wanted a \ngovernment shutdown. This is not what we actually want, and we are all \neager to end it. We also told the President that now is the time--and \ndivided government is perhaps the best time--to end our fiscal crisis \nand to be responsible for the $16.7 trillion and come up with a payment \nplan.\n  If you went to the credit card company and said: I want to raise my \ncredit card limit another $10,000, they would say what is your plan to \nactually pay down the debt you already accumulated? If you come back to \nus with a plan, then maybe we can talk about raising the limit on your \ncredit card.\n  As I said, for the 220 years between the start of George Washington's \nPresidency and the end of George W. Bush's Presidency, the Federal \nGovernment accumulated $10.1 trillion in debt. During the Obama \nPresidency alone, it has been $6.1 trillion. If the President gets his \nway tomorrow in the vote, we are going to have to get a blank check to \nraise it another $1 trillion-plus. It won't be $6.1 trillion; it will \nbe $7.1 or $7.2 trillion with no plan to pay down the debt and deal \nwith the impact of this growing indebtedness on our economy and on our \nnext generation.\n  It is important to remember what the President has said about the \ndebt. In 2008, when he was a Member of the Senate, he said adding $4 \ntrillion to the national debt was, in his words, ``irresponsible'' and \n``unpatriotic.'' That was President Obama back in 2008, and here he is \nagain asking for a higher debt limit with no plan to repay the $16.7 \ntrillion or any portion of it.\n  President Obama is also the same person who said in 2009: ``I refuse \nto leave our children with a debt they cannot repay.'' He is the same \nperson who said in 2010 that America's massive debt ``keeps [him] awake \nat night.'' I can't imagine he is getting much sleep these days if that \nis true.\n  This is the same person who in 2011 echoed the comments of the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mike Mullen when he was asked \nwhat his biggest concern was as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nAdmiral Mullen said the greatest long-term threat to America's national \nsecurity is America's debt. President Obama said he agreed with that.\n  Finally, President Obama is the same person who in 2012 said he was \nrunning for reelection ``to pay down the debt in a way that's balanced \nand responsible.''\n  The most amazing thing I thought about the meeting we had with the \nPresident this morning is that he was actually taking credit for a \nreduction in the deficit. Of course, the deficit is different from the \ndebt. The deficit is how we measure the amount of money coming into the \nTreasury and how much goes out in a given year. We are now spending \nroughly 16 cents on the dollar of borrowed money; in other words, more \nmoney than what is coming in.\n  The President was actually taking credit for the annual deficit's \ndecrease. The deficit can be zero this year, and we would still have \n$16.7 trillion in debt. Those are related but different issues because \nthe debt accumulates over many years when you spend more money than you \nhave actually coming in.\n  In fact, if we look back, the two reasons the deficit has gone down \nthis year is because, No. 1, one of the largest tax increases in \nAmerican history that the President demanded in January of this last \nyear--that was the fiscal cliff negotiation--and, secondly, it was the \nBudget Control Act and the sequester, which has actually capped \ndiscretionary spending for the last 2 years. That is what has caused a \nreduction in the deficit, not anything else.\n  So now the President said it is no big deal, this debt--$16.7 \ntrillion is no big deal. And $17 plus trillion is no big deal, either, \nto hear the President say it today.\n  Now the President has changed his tune. Earlier he told ``ABC News'': \nWe don't have an immediate crisis in terms of debt. In fact, for the \nnext 10 years, it is going to be in a sustainable place.\n  Well, besides being completely irresponsible and not making decisions \ntoday but, rather, kicking the can down the road to the next generation \nand beyond, this high debt is having a present-day impact on slow \neconomic growth. All we have to do is read the Congressional Budget \nOffice reports, which say when the Federal Government borrows this much \nmoney from foreign governments such as China and elsewhere, that is \nmoney--the Federal Government is actually competing in the marketplace \nagainst the private sector for credit and it actually drives down \nprivate sector investment. With the debt this high, people know \nsomething is going to happen. Either the Federal Government is going to \nhave to cut spending to deal with this debt or the President is going \nto want to raise taxes again, and that is exactly what he has requested \nyear after year.\n  Speaking of the next 10 years, the President's latest budget \nproposal, which he unveiled in April, would increase our debt by $7.4 \ntrillion as well as raise taxes by another $1.1 trillion, even though \nthe President has raised taxes by $1.7 trillion already.\n  There is a reason why our economy is growing so slowly, why the \nprivate sector is sitting on the sidelines rather than investing and \ncreating new jobs. There is a reason why the percentage of people \nactive in the workforce is at a 30-year low. That is called the labor \nparticipation rate. All we have to do is Google the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics and it will tell us what the labor participation rate is. It \nis at a 30-year low.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So not only is the unemployment rate unacceptably high, \nthose are people still looking for work. We know more and more people \nare simply giving up because they have quit looking, and they are \nreflected in that smaller percentage of people actually in the \nworkforce.\n  As we all know, the President has had multiple opportunities to make \nthat grand bargain for long-term debt reduction. He has endorsed a \ngrand bargain but walked away from his own bipartisan fiscal \ncommission, the so-called Simpson-Bowles Commission, in December of \n2010. He might have also endorsed a grand bargain put forward by the \nBipartisan Policy Center's Domenici-Rivlin Commission, but he walked \naway from that one too.\n  President Reagan negotiated with Tip O'Neill. President Bush 41 \nnegotiated with George Mitchell. President Clinton negotiated with Newt \nGingrich. President Bush 43 negotiated with Ted Kennedy. That is what \nPresidential leadership requires, and which is so obviously missing in \nthis context.\n  I hope the President will follow up on this meeting we had this \nmorning and begin the kind of negotiations that would provide a payment \nplan to pay off the debt America already owes--by the way, it is not \njust America, it is every man, woman, and child in this country--before \nhe comes back here and asks us to raise the credit card limit by \nanother $1 trillion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the Senate floor to \ntalk about how the government shutdown is affecting North Dakota \nranchers and farmers, particularly my ranchers who were hit by last \nweekend's storm and lost a vast number of cattle, jeopardizing their \nlivelihood for years to come, and aren't getting the help they need \nfrom the USDA and the Farm Service Agency.\n  Today I wish to talk about another devastating consequence of this \nshutdown, and that is the consequence of this shutdown on Indian \nCountry in my State, and undoubtedly Indian Country all across this \nNation.\n  In North Dakota we have five Indian reservations which are home to \nmany Native-American families. These are communities where economic \ndevelopment and many times employment\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\nhave been trying to get a foothold, trying to catch up, and where many \nof my State's most vulnerable individuals live. We have heard a lot and \nmuch has been made about the United States living up to its \nobligations, its contract obligations, its obligations to the entities \nthat hold our debt, but we haven't talked about the United States \nliving up to its treaty obligations to Indian tribes in this country. \nThis shutdown poses a serious--and I am not exaggerating--a serious \nthreat to the basic services the Federal Government provides to Native-\nAmerican families as part of its trust, its contract, its obligation to \nNative Americans and Native-American nations.\n  I recently had a discussion with tribal chairs all across North \nDakota. I was hearing more and more of the kind of horror stories we \nhear when all of a sudden weather is coming and food assistance is \nneeded and fuel assistance is needed. I wish to share with this body \ntoday the stories I heard, because they are telling stories about how \nfoolish and how dangerous this government shutdown is to many very \nvulnerable families, particularly vulnerable Native-American families.\n  By way of introduction, most of the five tribes in North Dakota are \ndirect service tribes, which means BIA itself performs critical \nfunctions to help Native-American families. So BIA is the place where \npeople go to get assistance. With the shutdown, there are few or no BIA \nemployees in each reservation to carry out this very important work. \nThat means BIA's general assistance programs are no longer able to \nserve, for example, the 600 families on the Turtle Mountain Reservation \nwho would otherwise receive an average of $97 per person to meet \nessential needs of food, shelter, and utilities. The food banks and the \nfood pantries are overrun. It is not an exaggeration to say this \nshutdown has caused people in the Turtle Mountain Reservation to go \nhungry.\n  At the Spirit Lake Nation, something we have heard a lot about in the \nlast year is that social services are stretched to the max, where we \nhave problems in even a fully funded government; but today the vast \nmajority of BIA child social service agencies have stopped, leaving \nchildren stuck in limbo in the court system, waiting for someone to \nfind them a safe and decent home. Some examples: A woman wishing to \nreport a sexual abuse of her son has been attempting to contact Child \nProtective Services for over a week now. When she went to the office, \nthe doors were shut and the 24-hour on-call person didn't answer the \nphone.\n  At the same time, BIA law enforcement is limited--and there is a lot \nof acreage out there that they have to cover--to one officer per shift. \nThey are patrolling 252,000 acres with one officer.\n  At the Sisseton-Wahpeton Reservation, almost 50 percent of the \ntribe's ongoing budget consists of Federal funds. The tribe is \npreparing to furlough more than 200 employees. Right now, the tribe is \nable to pay them out of carryover funds, but unless the government \nreopens soon, it won't be able to afford to pay these employees and \nthey will be furloughed.\n  In a couple examples of great tragedy, the Sisseton-Wahpeton \ncommunity recently lost a 3-month-old baby and, because of the \nshutdown, the mother has been turned away for burial assistance for her \nchild.\n  Gerald Thompson, an elder at Sisseton-Wahpeton and a Vietnam vet--and \nI know on the floor with me is our Senator from South Dakota and he can \nattest to the great number of Native Americans who serve in our \nmilitary, at a much higher rate than almost any other group. Gerald is \na proud Vietnam vet. He receives a small Federal stipend which is not \neven enough to cover the basic essentials. His stipend is no longer \navailable because of the shutdown. His wife is suffering from diabetes \nand stage 3 kidney disease. He worries about not being able to afford \nthe gas to drive her to Fargo once a week, and he wonders how he is \ngoing to buy propane for heat for his family and his home.\n  At Indian Health Service facilities, health care workers such as \nthose at Standing Rock recognize people still need medical attention, \nso they are still coming to work with no promise of a paycheck and \nprobably, some people would argue here, doing so illegally.\n  The Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, which is at the epicenter of \noil and gas development in the Bakken oil shale in North Dakota, will \nsee that development slowed. There is always competition for rigs in \nNorth Dakota. Where are those going to move? Everybody is waiting for \nthe rig to show up and begin to drill their wells. The tribes have had \na tremendous opportunity not only to develop the resource that will \nhelp them economically, but to develop this resource which is moving us \nin the right direction for energy independence. But because of the \nshutdown, MHA Nation is losing a substantial amount of Federal oil and \ngas revenue. Right now, the tribes aren't able to get energy \ndevelopment agreements. They can't get drilling permits approved or \nhave environmental impact assessments completed because BLM and EPA are \nshut down and not available. Those rigs will move someplace else. The \ntribe has hundreds of drilling permits awaiting approval and this is \nonly going to delay them further.\n  The situation is also dire in urban Indian communities. U-Tech, \nUnited Tribes Technical College, is one of several tribal colleges that \nserves over 600 students trying to better themselves and another 300 \nchildren who attend their K-through-8 elementary school on the college \ncampus. But because of the shutdown, they are reducing those education \nservices to both the college students and to children.\n  The list goes on and on and on. It will only get worse. If we \ncontinue to not address this problem, we are turning our back on these \nvery real needs. But I think also, importantly, we are turning our back \non an obligation this country undertook when it signed treaties with \nthe tribal people of my State.\n  All across North Dakota, families, workers, children, people who are \ndisabled, are losing access to services and assistance and are losing \ntheir paycheck. Why? Why is this happening? Because Congress, arguably \nthe greatest democratic body ever envisioned, is bickering and plagued \nwith inaction. House Republicans continue to bring up individual bills \nthat only address the issues of the day and programs that have only \nbeen written about in headlines. Whenever there is a headline, we can \nfund that because we want to say we are responding to those needs. \nWell, I think I need a headline for our Native-American families who \nare in dire straits, and for the Bureau of Indian Education as well as \nBIA. So I ask: What about Native-American families who are unable to \nget critical social services to afford food or housing because BIA is \nclosed during the shutdown? Where is the bill for them? Also, equally \nimportant, where is the public safety for them? Where is the public \nsafety for those tribal members?\n  What about the ranchers who lost a huge percentage of their herd not \nonly in my State in the southwest corner, but also all across West \nRiver and South Dakota, who can't get assistance from the Department of \nAgriculture? Where is the bill for them?\n  What about our young farmers who are trying to build the farms of \ntomorrow and feed our country, who aren't able to receive their income \nchecks because the Farm Service Agency is shut down? They can't even \nget their money. Where is the bill for them?\n  What about North Dakotans trying to start a small business or get a \nhome mortgage and aren't able to access those Federal programs? Where \nis the bill for them?\n  It is time we stop this. It is time we respond to the very real hurt \nin America.\n  We hear a lot about who is winning and who is losing politically. \nThat is a sad day when that is the deliberation we have, because it is \nthe American people whom we are here to serve. It is the American \npeople to whom we have an obligation. We need to end this impasse and \nto open the government.\n  My people in Indian Country in North Dakota need and want and believe \nthey have earned that respect and a commitment to their treaty rights.\n  Thank you so much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                     Livestock Disaster Assistance\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, a week ago today western South Dakota was \npreparing for a coming storm, but\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nno one had any idea it would be one of the worst and most devastating \nsnowstorms in that area's history.\n  I grew up in western South Dakota. I was born and raised there. We \nsaw a lot of nasty blizzards over the years--storms that swept through \nthe middle of our State and all across our State, with the destructive \nimpact that can have, the way it would close down roads, the difficulty \nit would create for people and, obviously, the loss of livestock that \ncomes with that. We have seen over the years blizzards that have taken \ntheir toll on one of our State's most important industries.\n  But the storm damage I saw yesterday when I toured western South \nDakota was epic, looking at the mountains of branches that were piled \nhigh waiting for disposal, or the gut-wrenching scenes of fence lines, \ndraws, and pastures that were scattered with dead livestock.\n  This snowstorm started out as heavy rain--and I know the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer had much of this in her State of North \nDakota as well--but that soaked the livestock. Then it turned into a \nraging blizzard, with heavy snow and sustaining winds of 60 to 70 miles \nan hour. These winds drove livestock for miles--some more than 12 miles \nfrom their pastures. The fortunate ones lasted through the storm, miles \nfrom their origination, but still alive.\n  As I speak, South Dakota ranchers are still assessing their losses, \ntrying to determine ownership of those that survived but are miles away \nfrom home, and hauling away or burying the tens of thousands of dead \nlivestock. To add even more challenges to an already devastating \nsituation, this area is now experiencing heavy rains. Flash-flood \nwarnings have been issued this morning for areas of the Black Hills, \nwith an additional 2 or more inches of rain in the forecast.\n  This storm-damaged area of 17 counties in western South Dakota \ncontains more than 6,000 ranches and more than a million cattle and \nsheep. For most of these ranchers, their livestock is their sole source \nof livelihood. These ranchers have a 365-day-a-year obligation to care \nfor their livestock, which they have done for generation after \ngeneration.\n  Madam President, I want to show you the impact of this storm and what \nit did to some of these livestock. As shown in this picture, this is an \narea we saw from a helicopter yesterday--a low-lying area where there \nwas some water. As you can see, there are upwards of 40, 50 head of \nlivestock that are lying there dead in that area.\n  We saw numerous examples like that yesterday.\n  This is another photo we took yesterday of trucks, rendering trucks \nthat were coming to pick up some of the dead livestock. As you can see, \nnot only are the trucks filled, but there are livestock along this \nroad. We saw that situation, that image, over and over yesterday, as \nwell, along highways in western South Dakota.\n  The point I am simply making is, this was an incredibly powerful \nimpact--this storm--that created an enormous amount of damage to the \nNo. 1 industry in western South Dakota. The people who work the land, \nthe people who raise these animals, they are independent, they are hard \nworking. These ranchers are the best friends and neighbors anybody \ncould have, all willing to lend a helping hand. They are first to \nprovide assistance and the last to seek it.\n  The best thing we can do right now, the most effective assistance we \ncan offer them right now is found in the livestock disaster section of \nthe farm bill, which has passed here in the Senate, is now passed in \nthe House of Representatives, and is awaiting action by a conference \ncommittee.\n  The Livestock Indemnity Program, known as LIP, was something Senator \nBaucus and I authored as part of the 2008 farm bill. It provides much-\nneeded financial assistance to these livestock producers. But in order \nto get this assistance to them, a new farm bill has to be passed.\n  This program, the Livestock Indemnity Program, or the LIP program, in \nthe farm bill is fully paid for with cuts in other farm programs, and \nit has eliminated the need for ad hoc disaster assistance that was the \nstandard emergency assistance in past years.\n  I remember past years, when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, something like this would happen, and we would have to \ncome to Congress for ad hoc disaster assistance, emergency assistance. \nThe whole point of getting a disaster title in the farm bill was to \neliminate the need for that ad hoc disaster assistance on an annual \nbasis sometimes.\n  So this title was put in the farm bill back in 2008. It created a \npermanent program, paid for. As I said, the one in the farm bill that \nis being considered now is offset by cuts in other areas of the farm \nbill.\n  What we are waiting for is for the conferees to get together in a \nconference to work out the differences between the two bills and to \nreport them back to the House and to the Senate, where they can be \nvoted on, hopefully, passed and put on the President's desk. That is \nwhat it is going to take to get assistance back to these livestock \nproducers, because the existing disaster title, as I said--the \nLivestock Indemnity Program in the disaster title of the farm bill--\nexpired. It expired at the end of 2011.\n  When we passed a bill in the Senate in 2012, it reauthorized it, and \nin the farm bill that passed this year it has been reauthorized. But \nuntil we get the farm bill passed, that authority that can help \nproducers in circumstances like this no longer exists. That is why we \nhave to get conferees together in a conference committee and, \nultimately, a bill on the President's desk that can be signed into law \nthat would allow the Department of Agriculture to issue the regulations \nthat are necessary to put this program back into effect.\n  I have been encouraged by reports I have heard that they are going to \nsoon name conferees to move a farm bill forward in the House. I wrote a \nletter earlier this week to Speaker Boehner asking him to name \nconferees so the conference committee could begin its work and make \nthis assistance available to livestock producers.\n  I have also sent a letter to Secretary Vilsack asking him to \ndetermine that the Farm Service Agency personnel in the impacted \ncounties are essential so they can open these offices and begin the \nprocess of preparing damage assessment reports that are going to be \nneeded for Federal disaster declarations. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer mentioned in her remarks the impact this is having in western \nSouth Dakota. In western North Dakota, the Farm Service Agency \npersonnel are not working, and in this circumstance they are the ones \nto whom the producers would go and the States and affected parties \nwould look to to do the damage assessments.\n\n  So I am hoping Secretary Vilsack, who has that authority, \nparticularly in this sort of a situation where you have an emergency, \nwill declare these people as essential and get them back on the job so \nthey can begin those damage assessments and prepare the way for, \nhopefully, when a farm bill passes and the disaster title is authorized \nagain.\n  So those are a couple of things that have to happen, in my view, \nfairly quickly. And I will be the first to say that I have had concerns \nabout the farm bill as it worked its way through the process here. \nThere were some things in the commodity title that I thought could have \nbeen done differently--perhaps a better policy approach and, arguably, \nsomething that is more compliant with our World Trade Organization \nobligations and less market distorting. There were a number of things \nin the commodity title, there were some things in other titles of the \nbill that we had some concerns with, but there were a number of things \nin the farm bill that we worked very hard to have included, and the \ndisaster title was one of those.\n  I am hoping as this farm bill works its way through the process, and \nhopefully as conferees get named by the House of Representatives, they \ncan begin their work, work out some of those differences, and I will \ncontinue to be a strong proponent of the livestock disaster assistance \nthat was created in the 2008 farm bill and was included in both \nversions of the 2013 farm bill--both the one that passed the House and \nthe one that passed the Senate.\n  I appreciate the work Chairman Stabenow has done, and our ranking \nmember Senator Cochran. I thank them for their tireless efforts to try \nand get a new farm bill enacted as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n  This past week's snowstorm is only one example of the urgency behind \nthat to get it done so the programs can once again support our farmers \nand ranchers and the millions of others whose jobs rely on agriculture. \nAgain, in my State of South Dakota, it is our No. 1 industry. It always \nhas been and it probably always will be. We have so many farm and ranch \nfamilies who look to their leadership here in Washington, DC, to \nprovide some certainty with regard to the rules they are going to play \nby. When we do extensions such as the one we are in the middle of right \nnow--we did a 1-year extension last year of the old farm bill--but we \ndo not make the reforms, some of the changes that are necessary to \nupdate farm policy, then we do not give producers the certainty they \nneed as they make their planning decisions for the future. So getting a \n5-year, a multiyear reauthorization in place is important, and it is \ntimely.\n  My hope would be that in the very near future the conferees can sit \ndown, they can work out the differences between the two bills--\nreconcile those differences--and get this thing moving again. I say \nthat not only because it is critically important to these livestock \nproducers in western South Dakota but because it is critically \nimportant to all producers across South Dakota.\n  The farmers in the eastern part of my State, the people in the entire \nfarm belt and the regions of this county who depend upon agriculture \nfor their existence need to know what the policies are going to be, \nwhat the results are going to be, so they can plan and plan \neffectively, and so we have the mechanisms in place, so when something \nlike this happens--like happened in western South Dakota this past \nweek--there is a mechanism in place, there is a way in which we can \nrespond and provide support for the hard-working farmers and ranchers \nand the millions of people whose jobs rely on agriculture.\n  Looking at those images yesterday was very gripping, in many ways \nvery disturbing. As you fly over these areas and you see these massive \nlosses of livestock, you realize what that means for the people who are \nout there every single day, who for generations have made their living \non the land by raising these cattle, and it has contributed in such an \nenormous and significant way to the economy not only of western South \nDakota but of this entire economy--people who literally every single \nday are out there feeding not only America but feeding the world. \nAgriculture has a tremendous impact domestically, obviously, but it has \na profound impact around the world, and it is something that from an \neconomic standpoint creates thousands and thousands and millions of \njobs here in this country.\n  I hope we can get the farm bill done. I hope the conferees will get \nnamed soon by the House, and that we will be on our way toward passage \nof a farm bill and, hopefully, the certainty that producers across this \ncountry need and the ability to respond to this type of emergency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, we are now in the 11th day of this \nunnecessary government shutdown. Just as my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Thune, pointed out, there are some impacts in South \nDakota as a result of this shutdown. We are seeing those very real \nconsequences in New Hampshire as well, and I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer is seeing those in North Dakota.\n  It has become clear to me by talking to people in New Hampshire that \nthe longer the shutdown goes, the worse the impact on families, on \nsmall businesses, on people who need the services from this government.\n  But as difficult as the shutdown is, there is actually another crisis \nthat looms on the horizon that would have even more disastrous \nconsequences for our economy, and that is the possibility of a first-\never default on this country's debt.\n  For the first time ever, if we default, the country would not pay the \nbills it has incurred--the bills it has incurred because of decisions \nmade by this Congress or previous Congresses.\n  As economists across the ideological spectrum have warned, the \nconsequences of a default would be severe. We could see businesses stop \nhiring. That would have an impact, as we are already seeing as a result \nof this shutdown, on the economic recovery we are experiencing. \nRetirement accounts and families' nest eggs would lose much of their \nvalue in a very short time. Interest rates would rise, which would mean \nhigher costs for consumers, for small businesses, and for the Federal \nGovernment, as we need to borrow. And consumer confidence, which is so \nimportant for small businesses and for the economy, would drop sharply.\n  Some people have suggested that these are scare tactics. But these \nconsequences are very real, and we know that because we have been here \nbefore. In 2011, which was the last time we came close to defaulting on \nour debt, the mere prospect of that default was enough to have \nsignificant impact on our economy.\n  In late July and early August of 2011, the period that led up to the \ndebt deal in 2011, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,000 \npoints. As a result American families saw their household wealth \nplummet by $2.4 trillion. We saw a sharp drop in consumer confidence, \nand by the way the current circumstances that we are in have seen a \nsimilar drop in consumer confidence over the concerns about the \nshutdown and the default.\n  In the last few weeks we have seen the biggest drop in consumer \nconfidence since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Then in 2011 our \ncredit rating was downgraded for the first time in America's history. \nThe crisis in 2011 resulted in $1.3 billion in additional borrowing \ncosts for the Federal Government, thereby increasing the Nation's debt.\n  So for all of those people who said we are not going to raise the \ndebt ceiling, we are not going to pay the bills this country has \nincurred because we are worried about the debt and deficits we face, \nthe fact is that action alone increased our debt by $1.3 billion.\n  There is no question that we need to get this country's debt and \ndeficits under control. I think all of us who are here believe that. \nBut the best way to do that is to reach a comprehensive long-term \nbipartisan agreement that looks at all areas of spending, that looks at \nthe domestic side of the budget, at the defense side of the budget, at \nmandatory programs and at revenue.\n  Despite the partisanship that we have seen too much of here, I still \nthink that kind of an agreement is possible and that is critical. \nSenator Thune talked about certainty for farmers who are not sure what \nis going to happen with the farm bill. But that kind of uncertainty is \ngoing across the economy for businesses, from whatever sector they are \nin, because people do not know what we are going to do here in \nWashington about dealing with this country's long-term budget.\n  As some of my colleagues have noted, the response to the financial \ncrisis and the great recession led to a higher deficit. There is no \nquestion the country was in trouble. One of the ways we helped to \naddress that was to increase spending on vital safety net programs, \nwhile revenues declined--to try to stimulate the economy, to put people \nback to work.\n  Those policies as well as the fiscal policies that were enacted over \nthe past decade, including two wars, tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans, all of those things made the country's debt and deficits \nincrease. Actually in the last few years we have seen significant \nprogress to reduce spending and to narrow our deficit.\n  We put in place discretionary spending caps that have reduced \nspending by the Federal Government, and we let the tax cuts for \nwealthiest Americans expire which raised additional revenue. All told, \nwe put in place approximately $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction. This \nhas not been easy. There has been a lot that has been affected that I \nwould not have chosen, but the fact is we are on a more sustainable \nbudget path.\n  One of the best ways we can improve our budget outlook is by growing \nthe economy, by focusing on jobs that boost revenue and decrease the \nneed for social programs. While we certainly have more work to do on \nthat front, consistent job growth has helped increase revenue and \nreduce our deficit.\n  Since this President took office, we have seen this country's deficit \nfall by over 50 percent. That represents a remarkable improvement, and \nall that is coming with the financial crisis and the recession that \nbegan in 2008. So\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\njust think about that. We have reduced this country's deficit by over \n50 percent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that our deficit will drop \nto 2.1 percent of GDP by 2023 from its current level of 4.2 percent. We \nhave made great progress, and we are on a path to make even better \nprogress. The budget that the Senate passed is a very good place to \nlook at how we achieved additional savings and how we continue to grow \nour economy.\n  That budget would give us an additional $1.8 trillion in deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years. It would also make very important \ninvestments in our economy, in families in this country, in \ninfrastructure, in business, in education. That is a conversation we \nneed to have. I think we should go to a conference committee on the \nbudget. It has been unfortunate that we have not been able to get \nagreement in this body to do that because we have a small group of \npeople who keep preventing that.\n  But that is not really what I wanted to talk about this afternoon. \nWhat we need to do is, we need to get this government back up and \nrunning. We need to agree that we should pay the bills this country has \nincurred and not default. We are continuing to see, as I said when I \nstarted, the very real impact of this government shutdown on families \nand small businesses across New Hampshire and the country.\n  I talked earlier on the floor about some of the small businesses that \nhave been affected in New Hampshire. But today I want to talk about \nsome of the Federal employees who are affected. I heard from an \nemployee at the Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, NH. This is \na medium-security prison. It is new. It has not even been completely \nstaffed, and it does not have all of the inmates there yet. This is \nfrom one of the employees who is currently working there--without pay \nas she points out.\n  She told me that her husband had already seen his hours cut at his \njob. Now she says:\n\n       I sit in fear that I will not receive a pay check at all. I \n     will not be able to pay my mortgage payment, my student loan \n     payments, our vehicle payments, or any other debts. I also \n     assume that my daughter's daycare is not going to accept an \n     IOU. I also will not have the money to buy pellets for my \n     stove or fuel for my furnace for the upcoming winter.\n\n  She is worried about the long-term mental and physical well-being of \nthose who are working without paychecks at the prison because many of \nher colleagues are living paycheck to paycheck.\n  We have talked a lot about the courage and dedication that many of \nour Capitol Police officers showed on October 3 during the shooting \nincident here. It was extraordinary to see people put their lives on \nthe line without getting paid. The same is true of people who are \nworking at our Federal prisons. They are putting their lives on the \nline every day they go into work in a dangerous environment.\n  I heard from another furloughed employee of the prison. She said:\n\n       I am a single parent with two sons . . . My sons depend on \n     me and only me. I have to pay for my sons' lunch and \n     extracurricular activities, which keep him out of trouble and \n     gives him something to do. I also have medication that my son \n     and I need on a monthly basis which we cannot go without . . \n     . The oil here in Berlin, NH, is absolutely high.\n\n  Berlin is in the north country of New Hampshire so it gets cold there \nin the winter. She concluded:\n\n       What are we going to say to the bill collectors? Can anyone \n     answer that?\n\n  What kind of answers can we give to these people who are putting \ntheir lives on the line every day working for the government to protect \nall of us? Yet we are not giving them the paycheck that they earned.\n  I also heard from a furloughed employee with the Department of \nAgriculture in New Hampshire who is on furlough. She said:\n\n       It is an understatement to say I am a bit anxious and \n     scared. I live from paycheck to paycheck.\n\n  She told me she is worried about going into debt as a result of this \nshutdown. She said, ``I love my job at USDA and feel I make a \ndifference every day to make this a better world.'' She urged me to \nwork with my colleagues here to get her back to work.\n  Those are just a few examples of the stories that we are hearing \nevery day from people in New Hampshire who are affected by this \nshutdown. The consequences are very real and they get worse with every \nday that it goes on.\n  As bad as that is, the consequences of a default of this country \nrefusing to pay its debt are even worse. While Social Security and \nMedicare have not been affected by the shutdown, that would change if \nwe default. A default could delay or disrupt Social Security checks \nthat are due to go out at the beginning of November. Medicare, \nMedicaid, veterans benefits, and military salaries, all of those could \nbe affected by a default. According to the Treasury, delayed or \ndisrupted payments would prevent 57.5 million Americans from receiving \nSocial Security benefits in a timely manner and interfere with payments \nto 3.4 million veterans.\n  This could put the most vulnerable in jeopardy and prevent them from \nreceiving the benefits they have earned. That is why the majority in \nboth parties, in both Chambers in Congress, recognizes that defaulting \non this country's obligations is not an option.\n  My former colleague and fellow Senator Judd Gregg, who is a \nRepublican--and while we do not agree on everything, this is one issue \nwe certainly agree on. In an op-ed published by The Hill newspaper he \nsaid that brinkmanship on default is:\n\n       The political equivalent of playing Russian roulette with \n     all of the chambers of the gun loaded. It is the ultimate no-\n     win strategy . . . A default would lead to some level of \n     chaos in the debt markets, which would lead to a significant \n     contraction in economic activity, which would lead to job \n     losses, which would lead to higher spending by the federal \n     government and lower tax revenues, which would lead to more \n     debt.\n\n  In other words, as Senator Gregg said it so well: It is short-sighted \nand irresponsible. There is no doubt we need to keep working on a long-\nterm budget for this country. But we have to do it in a way that is \nresponsible. That is why I certainly hope that the Senate will be able \nto agree on the legislation that is currently before this body. I hope \nthe House will come to the table. I hope we can all agree that allowing \nthis country to default on our debt, to not pay our bills, would have \ndisastrous consequences.\n  We are not going to be that irresponsible. We still have some time to \nget this done. Not long. So far the financial markets and the American \npeople have been more than patient. Everybody is frustrated. Everybody \nunderstands that it is time for us to act and to act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as we know, this is the 11th day of a \ncompletely manufactured crisis, a self-inflicted wound that came about \nbecause our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are obsessed with \nrepealing a law that is called the Affordable Care Act--a law that \npassed almost 4 years ago, and the benefits have taken root. I will go \nover those benefits for all Americans and a group of Americans who have \nhad a very hard time getting insurance. We are only now being able to \nsee them enroll for health insurance, and for some of them, this is the \nfirst time.\n  Because our colleagues are so obsessed with repealing this law, which \npassed almost 4 years ago and was upheld by the Supreme Court as being \ntotally constitutional and about which there was a Presidential \nelection and a Senate election in which the people who wanted to keep \nthis law and make it better won, of course--the Republicans can't \naccept it. As a result, they have shut down the government.\n  We wouldn't know it if we listened to the speeches now because they \nhave somewhat changed. Now they are saying they want cuts in Medicare \nand Social Security. That is what they want.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nBut when we go back 11 days, before the government shutdown, Speaker \nBoehner was crystal clear. He said: The American people don't want a \ngovernment shutdown, but they don't want ObamaCare either.\n  The government shut down. They didn't listen to us. We explained to \nthem that if the government shuts down, that won't stop the Affordable \nCare Act because those funds come from a different part of the \ngovernment; they don't come from the appropriated moneys. At least 85 \npercent of the Affordable Care Act comes from another part of the \ngovernment. We begged them and told them: If you shut down the \ngovernment, health care is going to go forward anyway. Why on Earth \nwould you shut down the government? They didn't listen. Now people in \nthe country are saying: What are you guys doing?\n  I am prayerfully hopeful they will turn around and let us reopen this \ngovernment--the government of the greatest country on Earth--and that \nthey will also allow us to pay our bills and stop the possibility of \ndefault. If default happens, it will be first time in our history.\n  Yes, we are in the middle of a crisis, but it is manufactured and it \nis made up. If you think about deficits, look at what has happened \nsince President Obama took office. Deficits have been cut in half. It \ncan't be about deficits. The Affordable Care Act is not going to be \nstopped. What is this all about? A temper tantrum? A childish way to \nhandle a situation about which they are not happy?\n  So Republicans who are listening to me know, I have served five \nPresidents since I came to Washington, first as a House Member and then \nas a Senator representing the largest State in the Union, the most \nfantastic State in the Union--but that is only my personal view--\nCalifornia. There have been five Presidents--three Republicans and two \nDemocrats. Obviously, I didn't agree with these Presidents all the \ntime. Sometimes I really disagreed with them, such as over the Iraq war \nand tax breaks for billionaires. Both of those added mightily to the \ndeficit. I opposed those, but I accepted the fact that all I could do \nwas work to change things in a democratic way, try to pass legislation \non those issues to bring the troops home and to make sure everyone pays \ntheir fair share. I didn't win those issues.\n  We all know that, yes, there are many times one votes against the \ndebt ceiling as a show of displeasure, but we have never brought down \nthe full faith and credit of the United States. The last time the \nRepublicans tried this a couple of years ago, the Dow Jones average \nplunged and it cost us $19 billion. You would think they would have \nlearned a lesson from that, but they didn't. You would think they would \nhave learned a lesson from the Newt Gingrich shutdown that made their \npoll numbers plunge then.\n  We need to behave like grownups. I am prayerful and hopeful that we \ncan see the talks that are starting in the Senate continue across party \nlines to resolve this.\n  Let's be clear. It is easy to solve this problem. This is the great \nnews: It is easy to solve the problem. Allow our bill that passed here \nabout 12 days ago to be voted on in the House--it will allow this \ngovernment to reopen--and do not attach any riders to it, such as \ncutting Medicare, Social Security, or whatever your pet idea is. Then \nlet's sit down and negotiate through the Appropriations Committee \nchairman, Barbara Mikulski, and through the Budget Committee chairman, \nPatty Murray. Then they can sit down with their counterparts and \nresolve our differences on spending, the deficit, and deficit \nreduction. It is very easy.\n  What Senator Reid is saying is absolutely the right thing to say. Pay \nour bills, and don't allow us to default. Pay our bills, open the \ngovernment, and then we can talk about anything and everything that has \nto do with the budget.\n  Last week when we were in the middle of this, I went home to see how \nthe Affordable Care Act was working in California. We are a State that \nhas fully embraced the Affordable Care Act. We are 38 million strong, \nand we have millions of uninsured--millions of uninsured. I am getting \ndaily reports from constituents. They are talking about the Affordable \nCare Act and what it means to them. These are constituents such as \nJanice Brown, a semiretired travel agent from Prather, CA. She called \nthe help line and downloaded an application to buy a plan for $1,500 a \nmonth for herself and her husband. She said to the Associated Press \nthat was $1,000 less than her current private plan. She said:\n\n       I'm thrilled. The coverage is better. It's fantastic.\n\n  Why do my friends want to shut down the government and stop Janice \nBrown, a semiretired travel agent from my State, from getting \naffordable health care? Why? Does it make them feel better to do that? \nI would hope not.\n  Dr. Travis Sanchez runs a chiropractic clinic in Salinas. It is one \nof the small businesses buying coverage under Covered California. Under \nthe Affordable Care Act, Sanchez plans to offer his full-time employees \nthe health care coverage which they currently lack. Do you know what he \nsays? The Affordable Care Act is going to be life-changing for many of \nthe people whom I see as a clinician every day.\n\n  Then Covered California told us about Paul Torrigino of Sacramento. \nHe enrolled in a bronze plan. In California, you can get a gold plan, a \nsilver plan and a bronze plan and the higher the plan--the gold plan--\nthe less of a copay. The bronze plan is less costly. So he said he \nenrolled in a bronze plan that was extremely affordable. He said:\n\n       Oh my gosh, the insurance has been going up for the last \n     few years like crazy. All our money was going to pay for \n     medical insurance.\n\n  Now he has this very affordable plan.\n  Leslie Foster, a 28-year-old freelance filmmaker in Hollywood, told \nthe Wall Street Journal he found a plan that will cost him $62 a month. \nBecause Leslie earns $20,000 a year, Federal assistance will pick up \nthree-quarters of the cost of his premium. Leslie says he hasn't had \ncomprehensive health insurance since 2006.\n  Why are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to stop \nLeslie from getting comprehensive affordable health insurance? Because \nthey didn't like the results of the election? Because they were mad the \nSupreme Court said the bill was constitutional?\n  I am at a loss to understand it.\n  Then I have San Franciscan Paul Cello. He told KQED that he selected \na plan that would save him more than $300 a month. He said:\n\n       It's like a whole 'nother world. The coverage is better . . \n     . a lower premium, no pre-existing condition exclusions, I \n     get mental health coverage, so there's way more coverage than \n     I had and I'm going to be saving.\n\n  These are real people with a heart and a pulse and a life and hopes \nand dreams and they are finally getting health insurance. Yet my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are stamping their feet and \nhaving a tantrum because they don't like it. I don't know why they \ndon't like it. They ought to come to meet these people.\n  I have Rachel Mansfield of La Quinta. Nothing could dissuade her. She \nsent in an application for Covered California on Tuesday. She has been \nwaiting for the exchange to start so she and her husband could get \nhealth insurance. She got it. Her new premium will be around $400 for \nboth of them, with higher quality coverage than she currently has.\n  Melissa Harris, a communications student at Fresno State, stopped at \na Covered California tent on campus Tuesday. She is paying $600 a \nmonth--with help from family members--for insurance through her former \nemployer. She has diabetes, hypertension and other medical issues and \nlives on disability payments. Under the Affordable Care Act, which \nprevents insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing \nconditions, Harris said she can afford health insurance on her own. \n``It's a godsend for me--a blessing,'' Harris, 33, said.\n  At the Fresno County Department of Social Services, people were \nsigning up for Medicaid. ``I came in for food stamps,'' Kevin Burke, \n51, told the Fresno Bee. An assembly worker, Burke said he has been out \nof work for two years. He had Medi-Cal previously, but was disenrolled \nwhen his daughter turned 18, he said. Under the Affordable Care Act, \nAmericans under 133% of the federal poverty level are now eligible for \nMedicaid, regardless of how older their children are, or if they have \nchildren at all.\n  At Vista Health Center, Rufina Arango, who is diabetic, filled out an\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\napplication for coverage through a significant expansion of Medi-Cal, \nthe state's Medicaid program. Rufina and her family lost their health \ninsurance several years ago, when her husband was laid off after 22 \nyears working for a wood products manufacturer in Windsor. ``It's \ngreat, because it is going to help many of us. If not for Obamacare, \nmany of us would not qualify for health insurance,'' Rufina told the \nPress Democrat.\n  I have to point out an op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington \nPost this week about the experience of one of my constituents with the \nAffordable Care Act. This constituent of mine and her son were also on \nthe Lawrence O'Donnell show last night. Anyone who watched that show--\nanyone with heart and a soul--would understand how amazing it is for \nher that the Affordable Care Act passed. Let me tell you the story.\n  Janine Reid is a writer from the San Francisco Bay area. This is the \ntitle of her opinion piece that ran in the Washington Post. ``ObamaCare \nsaved my family from financial ruin.'' Let me repeat the title. \n``ObamaCare saved my family from financial ruin.''\n  She relates her experience with her loving son, Mason. He had brain \ncancer and he had to undergo major surgeries and multiple surgeries. He \nwould have hit his lifetime limit and the family would have been driven \ninto, in her words, the ``financial abyss'' without the Affordable Care \nAct. Do you know what she says? She writes that the family thanks ``God \nand whoever else would listen for our good fortune to have coverage.'' \nShe ends her piece with this line: If I could get those who are trying \nto repeal this law:\n\n       . . . on a conference call, I would explain this to them. I \n     would tell them that while they were busy trying to derail \n     the Affordable Care Act over the past two years, Mason has \n     again learned to walk, talk, eat and shoot a three-point \n     basket.''\n\n  Why would anyone--anyone in the Senate, in the House, in the \ncountry--want to hurt a family like that? I am just saying, I don't get \nit. Because a law is a law is a law. We don't decide that one day we \nare going to undermine a law. You don't do that. You live by the law. \nIf you want to change it, of course, you have a chance. They tried 43 \ntimes to repeal it. It didn't get repealed. They shut down the \ngovernment over it and it didn't get repealed and it will not get \nrepealed. My constituents are not going back. No one is going to take \naway their benefits.\n  Most Americans may not even realize the benefits they are already \ngetting under the Affordable Care Act. Wherever they live, whether in \nthe State of the Presiding Officer or my State, 3 million young adults \nare now covered through their parents' plan. Three million young adults \nare now insured through their parents' plan, and 71 million Americans \nare getting preventive care, such as checkups, birth control, and \nimmunizations. Let me say it again. Millions of Americans are \nbenefiting from the Affordable Care Act. Seventy-one million Americans \nare getting free preventive care, such as checkups, birth control, and \nimmunizations. Three million young adults are now insured through their \nparents' plans.\n  Why do my colleagues want to take that away from Americans? Why do my \ncolleagues want to shut down the government? Because they don't like \nit. What is it they don't like about this; that some young person \ndoesn't have to fret or his parents don't have to be worried sick that \ntheir kid doesn't have health insurance. Now 17 million kids with \npreexisting conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, can no longer be \ndenied coverage. Why do my friends want to take that away from the \nfamilies in the United States of America? Why? Why did they shut down \nthe government to take that away? What are they thinking?\n  Insurers can no longer cancel your health insurance because you get \nsick. The Chair knows as do I that you could be going along 100 miles \nan hour and all of a sudden get an illness and be shocked and all of a \nsudden imagine getting a note from your insurer saying: Sorry you just \ngot sick, Senator Boxer, but we are canceling your health insurance. \nThat happened every day of the week, but it can't happen anymore. Why \ndo my Republican friends want to cancel out that benefit? No lifetime \nlimits on coverage.\n  I just told the story about the woman who lives in the San Francisco \nBay area whose son was born with a brain tumor and who needed constant \noperations. They hit up against the lifetime limit. But when ObamaCare \nwent into effect, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, guess \nwhat, no more lifetime limits and the child was saved and the family \nwas saved from financial ruin.\n  These are just some of the benefits that are going into effect and \nnow are in effect.\n  Then the Republicans said: Oh, the Affordable Care Act is going to \nmake everything cost so much. No, health care costs are growing at the \nslowest rate in over 50 years, and insurance companies have to justify \npremium hikes, so we are getting back checks if they overcharge us. \nListen, 8.5 million Americans have received rebate checks from their \ninsurance companies because of the Affordable Care Act. Do my friends \nwant to get that money back, take it away from the people? They shut \ndown the government. They must think that is a very bad idea.\n  I can't answer the question as to why they want to take away these \nbenefits, but I can guess at their motivation. They are throwing a \ntemper tantrum. They don't like the way the election turned out. They \ndon't like what the Supreme Court did. A law is a law.\n  I don't get it. Speaker Boehner said he is shutting down the \ngovernment, punishing people, because of ObamaCare. We told him you \ncan't stop it. He tried and failed 43 times to repeal it. He stamped \nhis foot and he shut down the government. Now that we have proven to \nhim he can't stop the Affordable Care Act, now that he sees how many \npeople are benefiting from it, he should open the government. Eleven \ndays the greatest country in the world has been shut down.\n  I have to tell you, in my great State--and we could all talk about \nour States, I know the Chair did this--we have a magnificent national \npark called Yosemite. Honest to God, the first time I stepped on that \nvalley floor I thought I was in Heaven. I had never seen anything like \nit. There are 3,500 Park Service employees who have been furloughed, \nwith 600 of them at Yosemite.\n  Here is the thing people don't seem to understand. It is not only the \npain of the people who have saved to get to a place such as Yosemite \nand saved for their families and are looking forward to this \nopportunity, it is also the small businesses that surround the park.\n  Douglas Shaw, co-owner of Yosemite Bug Rustic Mountain Resort, may \nhave to lay off 30 percent of his staff. He said:\n\n       We're a good example of a business that could die if this \n     continues. This is all we've got, and I'm scared, honestly. I \n     don't think a lot of people realize how important this issue \n     is for a great many people whose livelihoods are at stake.\n\n  Derek Arakelian and his wife Marielle Debree were laid off from their \njobs at Yosemite. They held a yard sale to raise money. They held a \nyard sale to raise money. They said:\n\n       We've got a new little boy and a lot of expenses. We need \n     to make money to pay our bills.\n\n  Why are they shutting down the government? The Affordable Care Act is \nmoving forward. A law is a law is a law is a law. We all have our \nissues. Serving here for a long time, as I said, I have opposed wars, \nopposed tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, I have opposed rollbacks \nin environmental regulations that I thought were critical, and I saw us \nturn away from sensible ways to protect our people. I wasn't happy. I \nhave a right not to be happy, and they have a right not to be happy. \nBut I don't have a right to decide which laws I am going to say should \nbe enforced. I have an obligation, if I don't like the law, to work my \nheart out in the next election and change things. That is what you do \nin a democracy. You don't pick and choose.\n  Then they have their little bills coming over here. I call it \ngoverning by press release. Something gets hot, they hear a story I am \ngoing to tell, and they say: Oh, well, we will open that little \nsegment.\n  We don't run a country that way. We don't run a country by press \nrelease. We don't run a country in order to get political cover. We \nhave an obligation to keep the doors open, to make sure things work \nbetter, to negotiate over\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nbudgets. You don't negotiate by taking hostages. This time the hostages \nare the American people--people such as Doug Shaw, co-owner of Yosemite \nMountain Resort, and people who are laid off--firefighters at the \nForest Service. They are working without pay. Lovely. We are getting \nour pay. One of these firefighters says:\n\n       Most people here live paycheck to paycheck.\n\n  It is a disgrace. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will \nstop its seasonal flu tracking program, and furloughed 9,000 employees. \nMy understanding is they have brought back some of their employees, but \nthey are not getting paid, and they are standing sentry.\n  David Johnson of San Francisco is the CEO of GigaGen, which does \nimmune system research to help organ transplant succeed. The NIH \nawarded him a small business grant of over $1 million. He has already \nhired staff, but he can't get the funds until this shutdown ends. How \nmany of us have read about people who get into trouble because their \nbody rejects the organ? Here is a guy getting $1 million from the NIH, \nand he can't get the funds. It is shocking.\n  Why do they shut down the government? They don't like the health care \nbill that is helping so many people. Now they don't even talk about it. \nNow they talk about cutting Social Security and Medicare. That is their \nnew dream. That is what they want now. I don't know how that makes us a \nbetter country. They can explain it for themselves. Open the \ngovernment, pay our bills, stop the default, and then we can negotiate. \nThe President has been clear. There is nothing he won't talk about.\n  Speaking as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and as a member of the commerce committee, 93 percent of the \nEPA have been furloughed. The Environmental Protection Agency has the \nsupport of about 75 percent of the American people, if not more. They \nare under attack constantly. That is one reason we never saw a mini-\nbill to restore the Environmental Protection Agency. They don't care \nover there. But what do these employees do? They guard our landmark \nenvironmental laws. They ensure our drinking water is safe, our rivers \nare safe to swim in, and our air is safe to breathe. They make sure \nthat Superfund sites are cleaned up. Five hundred Superfund sites, and \nthey have stopped the cleanup. And look at what a Superfund site is: It \nis a toxic brew of toxins that can hurt you, such as arsenic, benzine--\nyou name it, the worst things. My Republican friends shut down the \ngovernment because they want to stop the Affordable Care Act. They are \nalso now stopping cleanup of Superfund sites in their own communities \nwhere they are a threat to children, to pregnant women, and to our \nfamilies and our seniors. How does that make us a better country when \nwe have no inspectors on the ground, not one in California, to make \nsure the air is safe and the water is safe?\n  Then, if we care about farming--and I know most of us do--EPA is \nresponsible for the inventory of pesticides imported from abroad. This \nmeans that millions of dollars of imported agricultural chemicals have \nbeen stuck at U.S. ports because EPA personnel are not on hand to \napprove them for entry. This could be devastating for our agricultural \neconomy, and it could further raise food prices for consumers.\n  Somebody explain to me how a government shutdown helps the farmers \nwho are waiting for these pesticides to be cleared by the EPA. Somebody \nexplain to me how a government shutdown helps when we have many road \nprojects that are just getting ready to go forward, but we don't have \nany of the agencies ready to complete the studies to make sure they are \nsafe enough to go forward. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs at \nstake, and most of them, when it comes to the highway bill, are in the \nprivate sector.\n  We just learned yesterday that 92 percent of the workers at the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission have been furloughed. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission fulfills a critical mission. The NRC was created \n``to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials.'' Anyone who has \nbeen alive the last year or so knows about Fukushima and what happened \nto the people there and understands when you are dealing with \nradioactive materials you are dealing with danger. The NRC had to \nfurlough 92 percent of the workers because the Republicans don't like \nthe Affordable Care Act, and they shut down the government.\n  Open it up. Enough is enough. Give the people back the government \nthey asked for in this last election.\n  I understand. I didn't like it many times in my life, but I dealt \nwith it. Grow up. Curling up in a corner and having a temper tantrum \nwith a blanket and your teddy bear is not the right way to deal with \nit. Open the government, sit down with us, and tell us what you want to \nfix.\n  We have already agreed to a low number in the continuing resolution, \na number we don't like at all and think is too low. We think it is a \nhardship. We agreed to the lower number because we wanted to have a \nchance to negotiate. Senator Mikulski is ready. Senator Murray is \nready. We tried 21 times to get to conference with them and negotiate a \nbudget, and 21 times they objected. And then they have--I have to use \nthe word now--the chutzpah to say we won't negotiate when we tried 21 \ntimes to go to conference. There are no inspectors on the job to make \nsure the air is clean, to make sure the water is safe, and to make sure \nthe nuclear powerplants are safe.\n  The Republicans talk about the parks, and I appreciate it. But they \nfail to mention that the Army Corps manages 12 million acres of public \nlands and waters nationwide, and the recreation areas host 370 million \nvisits annually. These recreation areas support local businesses like \nresorts, marinas outfitters, grocery stores, gas stations, and hotels \nwhich provide goods and services to visitors as well as boost our \nNation's economy. Because of this Republican shutdown the Corps closed \nLake Mendocino located north of San Francisco. Lake Mendocino hosts \nhalf a million visitors annually, and in 2010 visitors spent $12.7 \nmillion at businesses within 30 miles of Lake Mendocino, supporting 106 \njobs and $2.8 million in labor income.\n  So we get a little mini-bill over there, open the parks. No, open the \ngovernment. Open all our recreation areas. Don't do this government by \npiecemeal, government by press release, government by your favorite \nagency. It is ridiculous. No party, Republican or Democratic, has the \nright to say to a community: You will thrive, but you will die. No \nparty has the right.\n\n  I have a community near Los Angeles called University Park. The L.A. \nTimes did a big story. The children there are suffering illness and \neveryone believes it is from an oil and gas site nearby. It is an \nenvironmental issue. The kids are suffering, and we don't know what is \nwrong with them. We called the EPA. They said: Senator we will be right \non it. The government shut down. We don't have any inspectors in \nCalifornia.\n  Those kids are sick. So we get a small bill. Let's help the kids with \ncancer. Of course we want to. What about these kids? We don't know what \nthey have. No party, Republican or Democratic, should say this child \nlives, and we are not sure about this child.\n  That is not America. This is one nation under God, indivisible, with \nliberty and justice for all. It is not for the Republicans to decide \nwhat they want to fund. It is for all of us to decide. Open the \ngovernment. You shut it down because of the Affordable Care Act; I \nappreciate it. Fight that. We were with the President for a couple of \nhours yesterday. Republican Senators were with him today. He said he \nwould look at everything. But don't keep this government closed and \ndon't bring us to the first default we have ever had.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board furloughed 380 of its 400 \nemployees. In my State we had an investigation going on into the Asiana \nAirlines Flight 214 crash. This crucial hearing was to include the \ntestimony of foreign officials from Asia. Its postponement and the \nongoing shutdown will delay the entire investigation. We need to know \nwhat went wrong, but this shutdown has shut down that investigation. \nTwo weeks ago there was a small plane crash at the Santa Monica Airport \nthat killed four people, and the NTSB is unable to investigate the \ncrash. They had to take their materials, stick them in a file, and \nhopefully, some day they will come back to it.\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\n  Open this government. Don't say this community will thrive and that \none will die, this family will get help and this one won't, this \nFederal worker will get paid, but we are not sure about that Federal \nworker, while they take their checks. This is stunning.\n  It is no wonder the American people are expressing their views, and I \nhope they will continue to put pressure on those who have this \ngovernment shut down. There is no winner in a shutdown. It is \ndevastating. And my friends keep saying they don't want it.\n  So open the government. It is easy. We did it here. It is waiting \nover there for John Boehner to call it up. Don't add your pet peeves to \nit. I have a lot of pet peeves I would like to add to it, too. This \nshutdown is devastating for our workers, our businesses, our \ncontractors, for our economy.\n  Speaker Boehner, put that bill on the floor. Let's open this \ngovernment. Let's not default for the first time.\n  I was here in the House when Ronald Reagan was the President. Here is \nwhat he said about default:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of \n     the dollar.\n\n  We named an airport after him, a building after him. Let's pass this \ndebt ceiling in his honor. He warned us. What has gone wrong with the \nparty of Ronald Reagan? Where have they gone? What are they thinking--\nshut down the government? The last time they did, it cost a fortune. \nThe last time they played with the debt, it cost a fortune. We hear \nabout people dumping American bonds. Is that what they want?\n  Open up the government. Let the people have their government. It is a \nself-inflicted mess.\n  It is as though you wake up in the morning, it is a pretty nice day, \nyou feel pretty good and, all of a sudden, you decide you are going to \nhit yourself with a brick. Oh my God.\n  These little mini bills--how ridiculous.\n  That reminds me, one of my friends gave me this analogy, which I \nthink is right on, which is you see a woman drowning and you grab her \nand you take her halfway to the shore and you leave her and she drowns \nanyway. That is what these mini ``press release'' bills are. You find \nsomeone bleeding to death but you only sew them up halfway. It is a \nself-inflicted mess. That is the bad news.\n  The good news is, because it is self-inflicted, it is easy to get out \nof it. All you have to do there is take up the Senate bill and pass it. \nThe Presiding Officer knows, she served there proudly. It has the \nRepublican budget numbers in it, which we think are way too low, but we \nagreed to them as a compromise because we did not want to see the \ngovernment shut down.\n  Take up the bill and pass it. Then we can talk about all these \nissues. Don't allow the greatest Nation in the world to default.\n\n       Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United \n     States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and the value of the dollar.\n\n  I used to work on Wall Street--a very long time ago. We saw what \nhappened when the markets thought we were not going to get together and \nresolve this default situation. The markets started to go down, 300 \npoints, 200 points, and then at the mere hope that we could fix this \nproblem, the markets shot up. The markets are watching. They know what \nis happening here. We are going to have a vote to lift the debt \nceiling, to make sure we do not default on bills that were already \nincurred.\n  Let me be clear on that. We are talking about paying the bills we \nalready incurred. You have to do that when you are a homeowner. You pay \nyour mortgage. You pay your bills.\n  Then they started to say, what is a default? That was unbelievable. I \nlooked it up in Black's Law Dictionary. If you don't pay your bills, \nthat is a default. Don't tell me you pay the interest on the debt but \nyou cannot pay the other bills--no, no, that is not the Black's Law \nDictionary definition. Pay your bills. Don't make this Nation a \ndeadbeat. If you want to treat your family that way, that is your \nchoice, but this is the USA family. We do not default and we do not \nthreaten default. Ronald Reagan warned us:\n\n       Open up the Government, pay your bills.\n\n  It is basic stuff. It is not complicated. Majority Leader Reid has \nbeen clear. He is a guy who can compromise, negotiate, talk--he has \nbeen around a long time. But he just said it: Open the government, pay \nour bills, and we will negotiate.\n  We are going to hear a lot of words, but I want people to understand \nwhy the government is shut down. The government is shut down because \nthe House, Republican House under the leadership of John Boehner or \nEric Cantor or Paul Ryan--we are never sure. Every day it is someone \nnew but it is supposed to be John Boehner--fine. I like him. That \ndoesn't change where we are. They refuse to take up the bill that opens \nup the government--let's be clear--just until November. And it takes \nthe numbers the Republicans like and we do not like and we say OK, we \nwill give you that, let's keep the government open. We did it over \nhere. I thank my Republican friends who voted to allow us to vote on \nthat bill. That was a hard vote for them and I am very appreciative of \nthat.\n  All Boehner has to do is take up that bill and pass it. That is all. \nThen we are out of the shutdown mess and that self-inflicted wound is \ngone. We can negotiate over the budget as we should. Then all they have \nto do is join us and make sure we do not default for the first time in \nhistory and make this country a deadbeat nation. How horrible. How \nembarrassing.\n  I will close with this. This self-inflicted wound mattered so much \nthat President Obama had to cancel a trip to the Asian countries. That \ntrip was important for our economy and for jobs and to get foreign \ninvestment. They did not care. We did our best, we sent the best face \nwe could, Senator Kerry, Secretary of State. He did his best, but I \nknow that was not a good thing to do because it gave China the upper \nhand. China made some cracks about the dysfunction here in the West. We \nare dysfunctional here, self-inflicted dysfunction, self-inflicted \ncrisis.\n  This is not Hurricane Sandy. This is not the horrible blizzard that \nhappened in South Dakota. I want to send my best to our colleagues \nthere who are suffering because of what happened from that blizzard. \nSomeday we will talk a little bit about climate change--maybe we can \nmove forward--and the extreme weather that is happening. But I am not \ngoing to talk about that now. I have enough problems.\n  What we need to do today is the right thing for the country: Open up \nthe government that belongs to the American people. It is easy. That is \nour job. Make sure we do not default. Then we sit down as friends, as \ncolleagues across the aisle, and we negotiate all the important issues \nthat Republicans care about and Democrats care about. I look forward to \nthose negotiations.\n  I hope as they are going on around now in little back rooms around us \nthat we are finding a way out of this mess. But we cannot forget what \nbrought us here and the reason I wanted to be here today is to make it \nknown in this Congressional Record the harm that has been done. There \nis a reason why there has not been a shutdown since I think it was \n1996. There is a reason--because the people who lived through it \nrecognized it was devastating. I guess the memory faded. People say: \nOh, there have been 19 shutdowns. Yes, but there has not been one in \nall those years, since 1996. It is a lot of years. The reason is, it \nwas devastating.\n  I want to put in the Record, first of all, how the Affordable Care \nAct is benefiting the people of this country already. Yes, it has had \nits major problems on getting on its webpage and the rest. We had that \nthe first day in California, but we had millions of visits to the site, \nmillions. We didn't expect it. It is going to be smoothed out. Yes, \nthere will be ways to fix it. But I wanted to put in the Record the \nindividual stories of my people and how they will benefit and how, it \nseems to me, so counterintuitive to stop a bill that was passed almost \n4 years ago, upheld by the Supreme Court, and now finally is going into \nplace. It is wrong to shut down the government because of such a law \nthat is bringing peace of mind to so many--tens of thousands already in \nCalifornia signed up. I had to make that point.\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\n  I also want to reiterate what Ronald Reagan said, President Reagan, \nabout playing with the full faith and credit of the United States. I \nwant the American people to think about why we are in this place and \nhow they can stop this from ever happening again, because I think it is \na disgrace and it is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I have enjoyed--well, not really, but I \nlistened to my colleagues from the left talk about just reopening the \ngovernment. I think to myself as she used the analogy of saving \nsomeone's life, dragging them halfway to the shore and stopping--I \nthink to myself, think about the veterans. The House of Representatives \npassed a bill to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I think about all those veterans who served our Nation, put their \nlives on the line. The House of Representatives sent over a bill to \nfund the very crucial needs of our veterans. Yet the Senate has failed \nto take it up. I think about the national parks and all the \nopportunities we have to see our parks reopen, see our veterans from \nWorld War II not denied. But, no, the Senate refuses to take it up.\n  I think of NIH and the critical funding that is necessary to continue \nthe research. Yet our friends on the left refuse to take up this \ncritical piece of legislation.\n  I enjoy being lectured to. I call it ``the Democrat lecture series,'' \nbut at the end of the day we ought to have action and not simply words. \nI understand it is important for us to figure out who to blame.\n  In politics, the lowest common denominator is always fear. Our \nfriends on the left do a very good job of assigning blame to someone, \nsomeplace, somehow, all the time, but what we need is leadership, not \nmore information about polls but leadership. We need people committed \nto a cause. In a town that seems to be the epicenter of activity for \nthe economy, we have two-thirds of this legislative process, the White \nHouse and the Senate, being run by our Democratic friends. Yet they \nwant to blame the Republicans for the shutdown.\n  I call this, no question, undeniably the Democratic shutdown. I hope \nwe find ourselves in a position to tell our veterans we were not \nkidding when we made the promise. Promises made should be promises \nkept. There ought to be no question of our commitment. We have seen \nthat commitment demonstrated by our friends in the House, Republicans \nand Democrats, working together to pass legislation to take care of our \nveterans. We need more of that. That is leadership, working together, \nfinding common ground to take care of those who have made America \npossible. But not today, not in this Senate, not when those bills sit \nidle. But the men and women who served our country cannot sit idle. \nThey go without their benefits. I wonder why. I wonder why we are not \nseeing the sense of urgency to take care of those areas where there is \nfull agreement. Why are we not taking advantage of the opportunities \npresented to us on a consistent basis by our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives? I do not understand that. I simply do not understand \nthat.\n  I will say I do find it very difficult to find common ground in the \nSenate at times. It is going to be very difficult for Republicans and \nDemocrats to find something we have in common. I believe we strive to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion on a consistent basis, and I will tell you \nthat on the most important issues it is very difficult. But I have been \nencouraged in my research in the last few days of looking for common \nground--I have been encouraged that I have found some friends on the \nleft who actually seem to agree with my position on some of the most \nimportant issues facing the Nation today. I will even quote some of my \nfriends to the left as I think through the debt ceiling debate.\n  As a matter of fact, the first quote I will start with from my \nfriends on the left:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\n\n  I concur with my friend on the left. Another quote:\n\n       Interest payments are a significant tax on all Americans. A \n     debt tax Washington did not want to talk about.\n\n  I concur and agree with my friend to the left. Another quote:\n\n       Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \n     internationally. Leadership means that the buck stops here.\n\n  I agree with my friend on the left. My colleague on the left is now \nthe President of the United States. These are quotes from Senator \nBarack Obama.\n  Our President of the United States and our Vice President, combined, \nvoted approximately I think it was 10 or 11 times not to raise the debt \nceiling of our country. They called it a failure of leadership. I think \nit is interesting. As a small business owner for the last 15 years I \nhave had the opportunity to borrow what I considered at the time real \nmoney. Now that I am in Washington, I have to redefine the definition \nof real money. But at the time I was trying to get my business started. \nI went to a bank to borrow some money. The banker had some very \ninteresting questions for me. He wanted to know how I was going to pay \nit back. He wanted to know what assets I was willing to put up in order \nto receive the resources I needed to fund my business.\n  I see the debt ceiling debate as a debate over how we explain to our \ninvestors, the American taxpayers, that we are handling responsibly the \nunderlying causes for the need to increase our debt. I cannot tell our \ninvestors that we are handling our debt--our spending responsibly. I \ncannot tell our investors that we have a plan to balance our budgets. I \ncannot tell our investors, the taxpayers of America, that we are even \nthinking about controlling our spending. No. As a matter of fact, over \nthe last 5 years we have spent nearly $5 trillion more than we brought \nin. And our friends on the left want to have a serious conversation \nabout the spending of this country.\n\n  I cannot tell our investors, the American taxpayers, what I want to \ntell them, but I can tell them that we do not deserve an increase in \nthe debt ceiling unless we produce a plan. I can tell our investors \nhere at home that we do not deserve an increase without balancing our \nbudgets. I can tell them, the taxpayers of America, that until we are \nwilling to cut our spending at the same rate that we increase our \ncredit card limit, we don't deserve their confidence in raising the \ndebt ceiling.\n  Some would ask: Senator Scott, where, pray tell, would you find the \nrevenue when our friends in the House of Representatives say that there \nis just no more money for us to cut? We can't find any place to cut \nanything in this $4 trillion spending plan. Really? Well, there are \nmany options on how to cut spending here in America.\n  Senator Tom Coburn regularly shares reports on government waste. Last \nyear he showed how the Market Access Program provided $20 million to \nthe Cotton Council International. They used that money to create \nreality TV shows in India intended to promote the use of cotton. India, \nfor the record, is an exporter of cotton and produces twice the amount \nthe U.S. does.\n  The OMB released a report that improper payments for Medicare \namounted to $47.9 billion in 2010, or 9 percent of Medicare's budget. \nThe Chamber of Commerce looked at the Davis-Bacon requirements and \nfound that it inflates the costs of Federal construction projects by as \nmuch as 15 percent and costs the taxpayers over $1 billion annually.\n  There are over 1,500 programs in the U.S. Government that are in \nduplication and costing the taxpayers more than $400 billion.\n  I would like to be able to share with the investors of America, the \ntaxpayers, that we have a plan. I would love to share with the \ntaxpayers of America that one day we will balance our budget. I would \nlove to tell the taxpayers of America, our investors, that they can \nhave confidence in our ability to lead us in such a way that future \ndebt increases will be less likely to happen. I have not seen such a \nplan. I have not heard conversations about controlling our debt, only \nconversations about increasing the limit to create more debt.\n  I am concerned that as we wrestle with the problems of today we have \nno focus on tomorrow. I hope that this body will work diligently not \nonly to have a conversation about the debt limit of America but to have \na conversation about how we take care of the underlying problem.\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings are \nthis week, and President Kim is expected to propose and seek approval \nfor significant changes to the Bank's strategy, organization, and \nbudget. After years of promised but undelivered change, serious and \nlasting reform at the World Bank is long overdue.\n  An October 9th Washington Post article, entitled ``Wider Impact \nEludes World Bank,'' describes the limited impact of billions of \ndollars spent by the Bank on some 700 projects in 100 countries since \nthe global financial crisis because of delays, poor oversight, cost \noverruns, and projects that did not deliver promised economic benefits.\n  This track record raises serious questions about the World Bank's \nrelevance as developing countries struggle with growing demands for \nenergy, water, food, education, health care, and jobs.\n  There are many capable, dedicated people at the World Bank who chose \nto work there because of their belief in its development mission. But \nfor too long the Bank has been an insular, inflexible, arrogant, and \nrisk-adverse institution, more responsive to government elites than the \nneeds of the poor.\n  Beyond that, an October 7th New York Times article entitled ``World \nBank, Rooted in Bureaucracy, Proposes a Sweeping Reorganization,'' \ndescribes a recent survey of the Bank's 10,000 employees. The survey \nrevealed a ``culture of fear'' and a ``terrible environment for \ncollaboration.''\n  I have voiced concerns about this culture myself. Fiefdoms are \njealously guarded by Bank managers. Staff has been retaliated against, \nostracized, and had their careers destroyed because they had the \naudacity to complain about incompetence, corruption, waste, or \ninstances of sexual harassment and abuse.\n  For literally decades, I have heard promises of reform from one \npresident of the Bank after another, yet the Bank's bureaucracy has \ndefended the status quo. The Bank has become expert at appearing open \nto reform while fiercely resisting change.\n  So it is refreshing to hear a World Bank president openly acknowledge \nthat the Bank has drifted away from its core mission of fighting \npoverty, and that its bureaucracy has become ``concretized.'' President \nKim has denounced the culture of fear that leads to risk avoidance, and \nhe has shown a willingness to challenge the conventional wisdom.\n  He has said that the employees of the World Bank's multiple \ncomponents must work together if they are to have any hope of meeting \nthe goals of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 and increasing the \nincomes of the poorest 40 percent. He has also said that the World Bank \nmust become more efficient and responsive to balance the increasing \ninfluence of countries like China. And to get there, he is proposing \nthe first major strategic realignment in 17 years.\n  How does President Kim propose to change the Bank?\n  He has already shaken up senior management and brought in new people \nfrom outside. And he is proposing changes to the way the World Bank is \norganized and does its work. He wants to take down the bureaucratic \nsilos that are inefficient, promote rivalries, and keep people from \nworking together.\n  President Kim wants the technical staff to have greater influence \nwithin the Bank and he wants them to share their knowledge with \ncountries. He thinks the Bank should be a better partner, helping \ngovernments make sound education, health, and job training investments \nfor their people.\n  President Kim recognizes that the Bank requires increased resources \nto achieve its goals but that the Bank's long-term financial health is \nultimately dependent on its ability to become more self-reliant. He \nwants to leverage private sector funding, increase revenue, and seek \nnew financial tools to support country development.\n  He proposes to cut the World Bank's operating costs by $400 million \nover 3 years. He estimates that for every $100 million reduced in the \nBank's operating budget an additional $1 billion would be available for \nnew loans.\n  I am encouraged by President Kim's energy, focus, and willingness to \naddress long-standing entrenched problems at the World Bank. He and the \nBank's many employees should know that those of us in Congress who are \nresponsible for appropriating the funds for the U.S. share of payments \nto the World Bank will be strongly supporting his efforts, and basing \nfuture appropriations on the results.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7411-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this month, our Nation commemorates the \n10th anniversary of National Cyber Security Awareness Month--a time to \nraise awareness about the need to ensure a safe and secure environment \nfor all Americans in cyber space.\n  All of us have a stake in improving the Nation's cyber security. That \nis why I join with stakeholders in the government, academia and the \nprivate sector in calling attention to the need to address new cyber \nthreats.\n  In today's digital age, we face new challenges in securing our \ncomputer networks from cyber threats and cyber crime. Even as the \nInternet and other rapidly advancing technologies spur economic growth \nand expand opportunity, there is growing uncertainty and unease about \nhow Americans' sensitive personal information is collected, shared and \nstored. National Cyber security Awareness Month provides an important \nreminder about the need to update our Federal laws to keep pace with \nthis new reality.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I continue to work to \nupdate our outdated Federal privacy laws. Earlier this year, I \nreintroduced bipartisan legislation to update the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, ECPA. The bill requires that the government \nobtain a search warrant--based upon probable cause--before gaining \naccess to the content of our email and other electronic communications, \nwhen those communications are stored with a service provider. This \ncommon sense legislation, which I have cosponsored with Republican \nSenator Mike Lee, enjoys broad support from a diverse coalition of \norganizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans \nfor Tax Reform, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the \nHeritage Foundation.\n  I remain disappointed that a Republican Senator has objected to the \nunanimous consent request to pass this bipartisan bill, which \noverwhelmingly passed the Judiciary Committee in April. These privacy \nreforms are too important to delay. I hope that the Senate will \nconsider and pass my bipartisan privacy bill without further delay.\n  I will also continue to work to better protect Americans from the \ngrowing threats of data breaches and cyber crime. For several years, I \nhave sought to enact comprehensive data privacy legislation that would \nestablish a single nationwide standard for data breach notification and \nalso clarify and strengthen the criminal penalties for violations of \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. These critical privacy proposals will \nhelp make all of us safer and more secure in cyber space and I will \ncontinue to push for enactment of these privacy reforms.\n  I commend the many citizens from Vermont and across the country who \nare holding events to recognize National Cyber Security Awareness \nMonth. I look forward to working with these stakeholders and with \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle to help ensure that our \nright to privacy is protected in cyber space.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7411-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7411-S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GILLESPIE RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier this week the majority leader \nquoted from a speech delivered on September 30 by Ed Gillespie, the \nformer chairman of the Republican National Committee and the current \nchairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee.\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nThe majority leader used this quotation to attack Congressional \nRepublicans and defend the hardline strategy embraced by Democrats. \nUnfortunately, he took Mr. Gillespie's words out of context and failed \nto mention some of the other remarks Mr. Gillespie made in that very \nsame speech.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. Gillespie has responded with a letter. He ends \nhis letter by saying: ``Republican governors and legislators work \nacross the aisle daily to solve the most critical issues in their \nstates. It's an example of executive and legislative leadership you and \nPresident Obama would do well to emulate.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nMr. Gillespie's entire letter, along with his entire speech to the 2013 \nRepublican State Leadership Committee Annual Meeting.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        RSLC Chairman Ed Gillespie Letter to Senator Harry Reid\n\n       Washington, D.C. (October 9, 2013).--Today the Republican \n     State Leadership Committee released the following letter from \n     Chairman Ed Gillespie:\n       Dear Senator Reid, Yesterday on the Senate Floor you cited \n     remarks by me at the Republican State Leadership Committee \n     National Meeting to bolster your own flawed policies. I'm \n     sending you a copy of the remarks as they were released so \n     you can see that they explicitly criticize your position and \n     support Republicans in Congress.\n       Specifically, at the beginning of my remarks you'll see \n     that I said: ``It's hard to see how President Obama could \n     oppose a legislative extension of the individual mandate when \n     he's issued an extension for big businesses by executive \n     fiat, and it's hard to see how Harry Reid could oppose \n     funding the rest of the government just to protect a carve-\n     out for himself and his colleagues.''\n       You neglected to mention this in your floor statement \n     yesterday.\n       Nor did you quote the full context of my RSLC remarks, \n     which were: ``On top of that, Republicans in the House \n     majority and Senate minority, are nearly always in the \n     position of talking about what they're against--what they \n     want to block or repeal or defund.\n       ``And we join them in staunch opposition to the President's \n     harmful policies--but our party might be better off if we \n     spent more time speaking in positive terms about WHY we're \n     against those policies and, more importantly, why we're FOR \n     the policies we're for--as our state Republican leaders do so \n     consistently.''\n       To be clear, I agree with House Speaker John Boehner when \n     he said, ``The way to resolve this is to sit down and have a \n     conversation to resolve our differences.''\n       Republican governors and legislators work across the aisle \n     daily to solve the most critical issues in their states. It's \n     an example of executive and legislative leadership you and \n     President Obama would do well to emulate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Ed Gillespie,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     Republican State Leadership Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\nChairman Ed Gillespie Remarks at 2013 RSLC Annual Retreat, as Prepared \n                    for Delivery, September 30, 2013\n\n       As we're meeting here today, things are pretty messy in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       And Americans are growing increasingly frustrated with \n     President Obama and Congress. The approval ratings for \n     everyone in Washington are dropping, but sadly Republicans in \n     Congress are the ones in the basement, with approval ratings \n     below President Obama and Democrats in Congress.\n       I'm hopeful today's decision by the House leadership to \n     pass a Continuing Resolution which funds the government while \n     delaying the individual mandate in Obamacare for a year, and \n     eliminating its subsidies for Members of Congress and staff \n     will change that.\n       It's hard to see how President Obama could oppose a \n     legislative extension of the individual mandate when he's \n     issued an extension for big businesses by executive fiat, and \n     it's hard to see how Harry Reid could oppose funding the rest \n     of the government just to protect a carve-out for himself and \n     his colleagues.\n       So while there has been some very positive developments in \n     this debate, I also think our Republican friends at the \n     Federal level could benefit from sounding more like state \n     leaders like those here today--lieutenant governors, \n     attorneys general, house speakers and senate leaders--who \n     talk all the time about improving the quality of life for the \n     people you serve, in tangible terms.\n       When it comes to improving schools, growing jobs, creating \n     opportunities, making communities safer, helping families in \n     need, providing affordable housing for the working poor, \n     fixing roads, and effectively responding to natural \n     disasters--Republicans at the state level practice what they \n     preach.\n       And the majority of Americans--53 percent to be exact--who \n     live in states with a Republican governor and Republican \n     majorities in their state legislatures, like what they hear \n     and, more importantly, what they see.\n       Our caucuses continue to grow, expand and set records \n     because of the positive leadership people like the elected \n     officials we're honored to have with us here today are \n     providing back home.\n       Now, I worked on Capitol Hill for more than a decade, and \n     I've served in the White House as Counselor to the President. \n     I was there for the confrontations between Speaker Gingrich \n     and President Clinton, and President Bush and Speaker Pelosi. \n     So I understand the dynamics when one party has control of \n     congress and the other the presidency, from both ends of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue--and the advantage of the ``bully \n     pulpit'' over often competing voices.\n       On top of that, Republicans in the House majority and \n     Senate minority, are nearly always in the position of talking \n     about what they're against--what they want to block or repeal \n     or defund.\n       And we join them in staunch opposition to the President's \n     harmful policies--but our party might be better off if we \n     spent more time speaking in positive terms about WHY we're \n     against those policies and, more importantly, why we're FOR \n     the policies we're for--as our state Republican leaders do so \n     consistently.\n       I mean . . . when it comes to health care, Republican \n     policies would protect people with pre-existing conditions, \n     hold down premiums which are skyrocketing today, let people \n     truly keep the health insurance they have if they like it, \n     and allow workers to earn wages for 40 hours per week instead \n     of 29.\n       Republican energy policies mean lower gas prices at the \n     pump, lower home heating bills in winter, high-paying \n     American jobs and less reliance on foreign sources of oil.\n       Republican economic policies mean more working families \n     enjoying a better quality of life, and more people knowing \n     the difference between holding a job as opposed to building a \n     career.\n       We want American companies to expand jobs here rather than \n     invest profits abroad by eliminating loopholes and tax breaks \n     to bring the tax on business down from the highest in the \n     world, so 401(k)s and pensions get bigger for those wanting \n     to retire and young people graduating from high school and \n     college are able to start a life on their own instead of \n     living with their parents.\n       A friend once told me, ``The American dream is not just \n     owning your own home, it's getting your children out of it.''\n       Those are some of the positive impacts of Republican \n     policies in people's lives, and voters of every kind would \n     welcome hearing about them--and they could lead more \n     minorities, women and young people to think about voting \n     Republican.\n       Unfortunately, all they too often hear from us is, ``Repeal \n     Obamacare. Approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Pass tax \n     reform.''\n       Repeal. Approve. Pass.\n       Short-hand process arguments that resonate strongly with \n     people who already agree with us, but not really music to \n     independent ears. We need to break out of a speech pattern \n     that dwells on process, and discipline ourselves to talk \n     about the benefits of Republican policies.\n       Democrats talk more than we do about lifting people out of \n     poverty, expanding the middle class, and addressing income \n     inequality.\n       And yet it's our policies that actually do those things and \n     their policies that make them worse.\n       Most Americans realize that the constant stream of taxes, \n     mandates, regulations and programs coming from the Obama \n     Administration are not making our lives better, and certainly \n     not helping our economy.\n       And I think deep down, many worry that these policies are \n     not only killing U.S. jobs, but--worse--they run the risk of \n     destroying the American work ethic.\n       They're worried about themselves and their families, and \n     are pessimistic about our country's future.\n       Now, I sometimes find myself feeling angry and frustrated \n     that more of my fellow Americans aren't more angry and \n     frustrated. But while expressing anger and frustration gives \n     voice to our core voters, it doesn't do much for all those \n     worried and pessimistic voters.\n       They want hope and optimism.\n       They want to know how Republican policies will make things \n     better, and it's our job in the states to explain that in \n     relatable terms and demonstrate it with tangible solutions \n     based on our conservative principles of freedom, liberty and \n     equal opportunity.\n       Republicans understand that prosperity results from an \n     economy based on creating wealth, not just redistributing it; \n     and that if you truly care about helping the least among us \n     and lifting millions of people out of poverty and expanding \n     the middle class, history proves you should favor a system of \n     democratic capitalism over a government managed economy.\n       We need to start measuring compassion not by how many of \n     our fellow Americans are living off government programs, on \n     food stamps, or in public housing but by how . . . many have \n     become able to provide for themselves and their families \n     through good jobs, like we're seeing more and more in \n     Republican-led states.\n       It is no coincidence that the boom in natural gas occurring \n     across our country is taking place in the one sector of the \n     energy industry regulated by the states rather than the \n     Federal government--and no coincidence that so much of that \n     is taking place in states with Republican governors and \n     legislatures who know how to protect our environment and \n     property rights while also unleashing a transformative source \n     of abundant domestic energy.\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\n       Republican policies promote equal opportunity. We know that \n     eliminating discrimination is a moral imperative, but it does \n     not alone guarantee the equal opportunity we all believe in.\n       So Republican attorneys general not only enforce anti-\n     discrimination laws, Republican state legislators fight to \n     improve our schools, empower parents and give children in \n     poor neighborhoods a quality education that enables them to \n     get into college or qualify for a good paying job.\n       The quality of a child's school should not be decided by \n     the zip code in which she lives, and state legislators like \n     the ones in this room are the ones who consistently stand up \n     for those children against entrenched education \n     establishments.\n       Another issue that's being resolved in the states is a very \n     sensitive one, and it's being worked out in a more respectful \n     way than it would be at the Federal level. I'm talking, of \n     course, of same sex marriage.\n       As with, I'm sure, many of you, I have friends and family \n     who are gay. And according to the tenets of my Faith, I \n     accept them for who they are and love them. But the tenets of \n     my Faith also hold that marriage is between one man and one \n     woman. Indeed, in the Catholic Church, marriage is one of \n     seven holy sacraments.\n       You see, for me, this is not a matter of opinion, or even \n     really a choice. But I understand that what is a sacred rite \n     to tens of millions of Americans is also in our civil law the \n     means by which couples garner survivorship benefits, hospital \n     visitation rights, insurance coverage and other benefits. So \n     while I don't support same sex marriage, I do not begrudge \n     its advocates their position on the issue.\n       And, I don't believe that everyone who supports same sex \n     marriage is anti-Catholic, or a religious bigot. But in the \n     same vein, it would be nice if so many of them would stop \n     accusing everyone who doesn't share their views of being \n     anti-gay or homophobic. Freedom of Religion is still in the \n     very first Amendment to the Constitution.\n       We may not all agree on whether we should redefine what \n     constitutes marriage, but hopefully we can agree not to \n     redefine what constitutes tolerance.\n       So on the state level, and in particular in states with \n     Republican leadership, we're seeing the benefits of \n     respectful dialogue, problem solving policies and fiscal \n     responsibility. Republicans are balancing budgets, reducing \n     tax burdens, improving schools and making families safer and \n     better off.\n       I know you're all familiar with our Future Majority Project \n     at the RSLC, where we are recruiting hundreds of candidates \n     for state legislatures who more fully reflect the growing \n     diversity of our nation. So in addition to a positive \n     message, we'll have fresh-faced messengers as well.\n       The RSLC's sole purpose is to help elect Republicans. Doing \n     that means getting a majority of votes in thousands of \n     different districts, and dozens of states.\n       We understand that Republican legislators here in Hawaii \n     will not pass legislation identical to those in Texas or Ohio \n     or North Carolina; and that attorneys general in North \n     Dakota, Georgia, or Idaho won't have the same list of \n     priorities.\n       But their shared beliefs, principles and values take each \n     of their states in a much better direction than their \n     Democratic opponents would.\n       Republicans don't seek to win elections to gain power, but \n     to translate our principles into policies that make our \n     country stronger and make lives better for our fellow \n     citizens. And that means winning majorities in legislative \n     chambers, electing governors and other statewide \n     officeholders, and--ultimately--winning a majority of the \n     Electoral College again.\n       If Republicans can have unified state government where a \n     majority of Americans live, we can win back the White House. \n     But to do so, we'll have to learn valuable lessons at the \n     national level, and those lessons are being taught at the \n     state level.\n       The United States of America is a great nation, but we can \n     see how President Obama's policies are making us weaker--here \n     at home and in the world. The Republican Party is a great \n     Party.

Each year approximately 100,000 patients die from hospital-\nacquired infections. These deadly infections affect patients who are in \nthe course of receiving healthcare treatment for other conditions; \ntherefore, the patients often already have compromised immune systems. \nThese two doctors created a revolutionary model to identify and halt \nthe spread of infection for the rest of the health care industry to \nfollow.\n  Over the course of a 12-month period in 2011 and 2012, a rare and \ndeadly ``superbug'' was spreading from patient to patient at one of the \nNation's premier research hospitals, the National Institutes of \nHealth's Clinical Center. This two-woman team--Dr. Tara Palmore, a \ndeputy hospital epidemiologist, and Dr. Julie Segre, a senior \ninvestigator--partnered with a talented team of doctors to accomplish \nan extraordinary achievement. For the first time ever, they were able \nto sequence the bacteria's DNA to decipher how the pathogen spread from \npatient to patient. This allowed doctors to detect the origins of the \ninfections, trace the transmission, and implement measures to put an \nend to the outbreak.\n  Tragically, 18 seriously ill patients acquired the bacteria and seven \nultimately died from the infection, but this use of genomics could \nprofoundly change the way hospital-acquired infections are identified \nand halted, leading to quicker response times and saving tens of \nthousands of lives. Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the NIH said,\n\n       ``It is a groundbreaking advance in one hospital that will \n     now have an impact across the world and will become the \n     standard. It is a fantastic example of taking a challenging \n     medical problem and applying technologies in a new way to \n     come up with a remarkable result. We now have a new weapon in \n     the battle to stop the spread of drug-resistant organisms.''\n\n  Dr. John Gallin, the Director of the NIH's Clinical Center, said the \nbreakthrough by the NIH team is ``a magnificent demonstration of how a \nhospital can contain these infections when they occur.''\n  There are a limited number of antibiotics available to fight these \ntypes of highly resistant bacteria, so this new discovery provides a \nnew approach for hospital infection control that will benefit numerous \npatients in the future. I congratulate Drs. Palmore and Segre for their \nhard work and critical contributions to the health care community and \nto all of their colleagues for the great work at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7413-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7413-S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ORTHEIA BARNES\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, on November 3, the many friends \nand admirers of Ortheia Barnes will gather in Detroit to pay tribute to \nher remarkable life and career. ``Careers'' would actually be more \nappropriate in Ortheia's case, because this extraordinary lifelong \nDetroiter has excelled in multiple fields.\n  Some Detroiters know Ortheia as an entertainer. They have heard her \nvoice accompanying Motown legends and recording stars such as Aretha \nFranklin, heard her powerful renditions of gospel songs or watched her \nsing during the annual Thanksgiving parade downtown or they have seen \nher in stage productions or local television programs.\n  Other Detroiters know Ortheia from her civic involvement. She is \nactive in a host of charitable endeavors, from the American Cancer \nSociety to Focus: HOPE, to programs that help people recover from \naddiction.\n  Some may know Ortheia from her political activism. She has long been \nactive in Michigan elections, from city council to Senate, and she is \nan energetic advocate for the idea that every American, regardless of \nrace or creed or color, is welcome and needs to be active in the \npolitical process.\n  If you do not know Ortheia as an entertainer or supporter of worthy \ncauses, you know her for her faith. She has ministered around the \nworld, not only sharing her faith but doing the good works that are so \nfundamental to it.\n  I am fortunate to know Ortheia for all the gifts she has given our \ncommunity and in one more way: My wife Barbara and I have known her as \na longtime family friend. Her family and ours have been linked through \nthree generations, beginning with Barbara's and Ortheia's mothers. \nOrtheia herself briefly babysat our kids while she was in high school. \nWe know how proud Ortheia's warm and wise mom Belle was of her daughter \nback then and of her growing pride as the multigifted adult Ortheia \nemerged.\n  When Detroit gathers on November 3 to celebrate Ortheia's birthday, \nthe dress will be sharp, the music will be proud, and the stories will \nbe many. Whether we know Ortheia from the\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\npulpit or the stage, from campaign strategy sessions or gatherings of \nfamily and friends, Detroiters admire her spirit, her energy, her \ndedication and her talent, and we thank her for all she has done and \nall she will do for our community and its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7414-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

Madam President, the Republican Senators met with \nPresident Obama earlier today and discussed many of the financial \nissues facing America and the difficulties we are having in achieving \nan agreement that puts us on a sound financial path. There surely are \nactions we can take together to improve our situation. I believe there \nwas some progress made, and there are some avenues for progress that \ncould be opened in the hours to come. I hope we can do that.\n  But now it is well to recognize that our Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms are surging in costs, and--as the President rightly noted to \nus at our meeting earlier today and has done so for a number of years--\nthat government health care costs are the biggest drivers of our debt. \nIn other words, it is increasing at a faster rate than other programs, \nand we project it will continue to increase at those rates.\n  I think that is true. It is true. We have a huge challenge there. But \nimportantly to this whole discussion, I recall during a formal address \nto a joint session of Congress in September 2009, the President \npromoted his Affordable Care Act and stated that he would help fix this \nproblem of growing costs of health care and then flatly and \nunequivocally promised, ``I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to \nour deficits either now or any time in the future, period.'' That is \nastoundingly inaccurate, and we have to know this. We are voting and \nwrestling on what to do about our health care bill and other spending \nprograms. But one thing that has been overlooked is this promise that \nthe health care bill--the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare--is not paid \nfor as it was promised, and it is astoundingly over budget.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about this issue and its importance. As \nwe work together to try to reach a compromise, we have to understand \nthat fact. As we work to deal with some of our long-term financial \nchallenges, we need to focus on that matter.\n  Indeed, it appears, according to the Government Accountability \nOffice, that over the long-term accounting period used to evaluate the \nunfunded liabilities of the United States, that the Affordable Care Act \nwill add $6.2 trillion to the unfunded liabilities of America. That \ndoes not count the interest on that over this long period of time which \nmay well double that figure. It puts it almost equal to the liability \nof Social Security--and maybe even more. So this is a big deal.\n  I want to share with my colleagues some thoughts as good faith \nnegotiations are going on by Members. Republicans and Democrats are \ntalking, the White House staff people are talking, and House Members \nand the Speaker are talking. There are some principles they need to be \naware of as we go forward. I have a budget warning, and will make this \npoint: Trust fund improvements--Social Security and Medicare \nprimarily--are produced by savings or increased revenues in these \nprograms. A number of ideas have been floated that could do that, and \nthey need to be done. But those savings through revenue or new cutting \nof expenses cannot be used to justify or pay for breaking Budget \nControl Act caps, and that is very important.\n  It is essential in these hours of financial debate that all Members \nof Congress and the American people understand that the savings gained \nfrom much-needed reforms of our financially unsound Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds can only be used to strengthen those funds and not \nbe used simultaneously to support spending for a new program, such as \nthe Affordable Care Act. We can't use the money twice.\n  Our vital Social Security and Medicare programs are not solvent at \nthis time. We know they are going into deficit right now. Our revenues \nwill increase for those programs or costs to those programs will be \nbrought down--as many ideas are being floated, and indeed, a number of \nthem are in the President's budget and have some merit--and the \nresulting funds can only be spent once. The Budget Control Act \nrestricts discretionary spending. It says: We are not going to increase \nspending over a certain rate. We are going to reduce the rate of \nincrease in government spending.\n  The Budget Control Act is in the law. It was negotiated by the \nPresident, Senator Reid--the majority leader here--the Speaker, and \nSenator McConnell, and they agreed on certain limits on spending over \nthe next 10 years. At that time we were projected to increase spending \nover 10 years by $10 trillion. If it was flat spending, we would spend \n$37 trillion; under projected growth it would go to $47 trillion.\n  Under the Budget Control Act we said: OK, we are going to cut \nspending. It really wasn't a cut in spending. But we would reduce the \ngrowth of spending from $10 trillion to $8 trillion, and that is why we \nare hearing so much today.\n  In the 2 years-plus since that agreement, Congress--except for a few \nbudget gimmicks that my staff members bring up--has largely stuck to \nthose limits. The President and the Democratic Senate have openly and \ndirectly opposed those limits. The President--6 months after signing \nthe Budget Control Act--submitted a budget to this Senate that would \nincrease spending $1 trillion over the limits agreed to in the Budget \nControl Act. Can you imagine that? There was a bipartisan meeting. As \nwe worked on the debt ceiling to raise the debt ceiling $2 trillion, we \nagreed that over 10 years we would cut spending by $2.1 trillion.\n  Six months later, the President submits a budget to the Senate and to \nthe House that calls for spending $1 trillion over that amount. So I \nthink that was a breach--a serious act of the President to move away \nfrom the promises he had made and the act he signed into law.\n  To be more specific about it, one of the proposals in the President's \nbudget that received a lot of discussion is an alteration of the way we \ncalculate the inflation index for Social Security. It has been referred \nto as chained CPI. It is projected to save a certain amount of money--\nmaybe $128 billion or maybe more. Let's just say it is going to save \n$100 billion--chained CPI--and it would, in fact, increase the revenue \ninto Social Security, and it would reduce the amount of money that is \npaid out of Social Security. It would save, let's say, $100 billion. So \nthis would strengthen Social Security, there is no doubt about that. It \nwould strengthen Social Security because the Social Security \nliabilities are going down and the revenue is going up.\n  What I wish to say to our colleagues as they wrestle with how to \nbring our numbers into better balance is that those savings cannot \nbenefit Social Security and simultaneously justify increased Treasury \nspending over the Budget Control Act levels.\n  We can't use the money twice. This is so basic. We are talking about \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  CBO, our Congressional Budget Office, has analyzed this kind of \nmaneuver, and they have clearly affirmed that even though the budget \nscore over 10 years, using the unified budget accounting methods, would \nsuggest otherwise, we cannot spend the money in both places.\n  So if we know how to ask a question of CBO, over the 10-year budget \nwindow, it can give the appearance that we have this money because it \ncreates more money coming into the government that we can spend over \nhere. But the money is dedicated to Social Security. It is Social \nSecurity money. It can't be spent twice. If it is going to strengthen \nSocial Security, it can't be spent over here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer most graciously.\n  CBO has flatly called this in a letter, at my request, double-\ncounting. Can\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nmy colleagues imagine the Congressional Budget Office saying that the \nU.S. Congress is double-counting? Actually, in that case, in dealing \nwith the Affordable Care Act, $500 billion of money extracted out of \nMedicare was being used to claim it would pay for the Affordable Care \nAct when it was Medicare's money.\n  So I am talking at this point and just sharing an example from Social \nSecurity and the chained CPI, but the principles are the same because \nboth are trust funds. So it is double-counting.\n  In fact, any Social Security or Medicare trust fund savings so \nproduced are legally assets of the trust fund, and debt instruments of \nthe U.S. Treasury are issued and interest paid from the U.S. Treasury \nto Social Security and to the Medicare trust funds on the monies that \nare borrowed in that way. If the savings, as is likely, do not result \nin a trust fund surplus, then there is really no surplus that they can \nborrow. It simply tends to show more income to the U.S. Treasury--\nfalsely showing that because, again, the money is committed off-budget \nto Social Security.\n  The critical fact is that all of those moneys are already obligated \nto Social Security and Medicare and will be needed by those programs, \nand more money, actually, is going to be needed by those programs to \nmeet the future obligations of those trust funds, which are insolvent. \nThey don't have enough money coming in to pay the obligations they will \nbe required to pay in the years to come.\n  So the scope of this abuse of our accounting system is truly enormous \nand threatens our Nation's very financial future. For example, it has \nallowed the President to falsely assert that the Affordable Care Act \nwould not add one dime to the debt when, absent double-counting, the \nact would increase our debt by over $500 billion over the next 10 \nyears--$500 billion. It is going to adversely impact the financial \ncondition of America.\n  The same accounting manipulations enabled many supporters of the Gang \nof 8 immigration bill to assert that their legislation was paid for. \nThey were going to spend all of this money and they were going to make \nus safe from illegal immigration and it was all paid for--every dime of \nit--and wouldn't add to the debt. Do my colleagues know how they did \nthat? Well, they were going to give Social Security cards to millions--\n11 million or however many would come forward--and they would pay \nSocial Security, and they would have more Social Security money coming \ninto the U.S. Treasury, and therefore that would pay for the extra \nborder patrol and other expenses they said they have to spend money on.\n  But I ask my colleagues to think about it. The money paid by the \npeople who have been given legal status, the Social Security they have \npaid for is their money. It is their money. They are going to draw out \nevery penny of it when they get older. We can't say it is available to \npay another expense today. If we do, it is not going to be there, to \npay for their Social Security when they retire. How simple is this? \nThis was the message here on the floor. They steadfastly insisted that \nthe bill was paid for, double-counting Social Security money.\n  So we have to get straight about this, I have to say. Legislation \nmust be adopted to stop this double-counting. It is open to abuse and \nmanipulation and has been done, really, by both parties in the past but \nnot as much as we have seen lately. It is enabling the Nation's \ndangerous financial trajectory.\n  Finally, as we work to end the Nation's financial impasse, another \nwarning is needed. All should understand that consent to passage of a \ncontinuing resolution or debt ceiling bill cannot be achieved until we \nhave sufficient time to have a complete CBO score of it so we know what \nkind of maneuvers are being used in the bill. So I am going to object. \nWe are not going to wake up one day and say we have to run to the floor \nand pass a bill with 30 minutes' notice or 3 hours' notice. That would \nbe a mistake.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first of all, I wish to follow up on a \ncomment my friend from Alabama just made on Social Security and \nMedicare. I think it is very important that we listen carefully to what \nhe had to say, that if we do things that are so-called reforms--and I \nthink there are many places where we could reform those programs--we \nshould use those savings to save those programs. We shouldn't say we \nare going to have reforms in Medicare, more likely, perhaps, right \naway, then Social Security, and then not use those reforms to extend \nthe life of these important programs.\n  These are programs, we have told Americans--in the case of Social \nSecurity since the mid-1930s, and in the case of Medicare since the mid \n1960s--that people would be able to rely on. We see that those programs \ncan be extended and adjusted and reformed, but I think our leader on \nour side of the budget effort who spends so much time trying to make \nthe case for the right kind of budget decisions is clearly pointing out \nthat if we make savings in these programs and then use that money to \nfund other discretionary spending, is that the fair thing to do with \nSocial Security or Medicare? I don't think so, and I think the Senator \nfrom Alabama has raised a very good point.\n  As we try to figure out how to move forward this year, we need to be \nsure that savings are real savings, that they are not double-counted, \nthat we are not saving money in one program that clearly should go \ntoward the priority of that program rather than the other priorities we \nhaven't yet set.\n  This brings me to the topic of setting priorities. We had the \nopportunity to go to the White House--the Democrats yesterday, \nRepublicans today--to talk to the President about how we move forward \nwith the budget year, the spending year that has already started. When \nwe were there, the President made it clear once again that we shouldn't \nnegotiate, but on more than one occasion in the morning when we were \nthere, the President said we shouldn't be allowed to negotiate for \nthings we couldn't get or didn't get in the regular process.\n  My view of that is there is no regular process. As the President said \nthat, I thought, this is like pouring gas on a fire of frustration for \nMembers of the Senate and particularly in the House who are frustrated \nthat there is no process. There is no place earlier than a crisis to \nsay: Let's debate these issues, let's debate these priorities.\n  How many of the 12 spending bills for the year that began 11 days ago \nhave we had on the floor of the Senate? One. One of the bills that \nshould have been done starting in about last March and April and that \nshould have been completed over the summer. That money would have been \nspent beginning October 1. Not one of the 12 was on the floor, and, \nfrankly, it was a bill the majority leader had every reason to believe \nwouldn't pass if it was brought to the floor. Let's assume it would \nhave passed. It still would have just been one of the 12 bills we need \nto run the government.\n  So when the President or anybody else says we shouldn't use these \ncrisis moments to try to get our priorities discussed, they are the \nonly moments we have. They are the only time we have.\n  I don't like government by crisis. I think it is very unfortunate for \nthis Presidency that if we really look at how the government has worked \nin the last 5 years, it is from one crisis to another. If I could do \nanything to help President Obama pull away from this crisis management, \nI would be inclined to want to try to do that, particularly if pulling \naway from crisis management meant we were going to come back and have a \nfair debate between a divided Congress that leads to some way forward \nthat can actually accomplish something.\n  The idea that we won't negotiate at this moment--or the President, \nfeeling that somehow he won't be held hostage to the debt limit--I am \ncertainly going to vote tomorrow not to even move forward with this \ndiscussion for a $1 trillion debt ceiling increase with no discussion \nof what we are going to do to change our behavior.\n  President Obama, to his credit, entered into a negotiation just 2 \nyears ago, in August of 2011, and in return for $2.5 trillion worth of \nspending cuts over a decade, he got $2.1 trillion in additional debt \nceiling. Now, the President\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nagreed to that in August of 2011 and then in October of 2013 says \nnobody should ever negotiate on the debt ceiling.\n  Fifty-three times since 1978 we have had a change in the debt \nceiling, and since 1978 more than half of those debt limits included \nlegislation dealing with either spending or other matters.\n  The President says: I will not put this on future Presidents, to be \nthe President who goes forward with increasing the debt ceiling under \nsome--with a negotiation.\n  Well, every President since 1978 has had the same situation the \nPresident had in August of 2011, the same situation the Presiding \nOfficer and I would have if we were going to get our line of credit \nextended and we had exceeded our line of credit. Whoever is going to \nextend that line of credit is going to say: What are you going to do to \nchange the behavior that allowed you to blow through your last line of \ncredit?\n  The President and others will say: This is about America paying its \nbills. This is about wanting the current Congress to pay the bills it \nhas incurred.\n  Well, most of the bills that have been incurred weren't incurred by \nthis Congress; they were incurred by past legislation. Sixty-two \npercent of the spending is now in last year--it will probably be higher \nin the year we are in at this moment--62 percent of the spending was \nmandatory spending. It was spending put in place by Congresses \nbeginning in the 1930s, through the health care bill. That is mostly \nmandatory spending. The current Congress didn't get to vote on the \nhealth care bill, but more importantly, most of the current Congress \nwasn't alive when the Social Security Act passed. Many of the Members \nof the Congress and even some of the Members of the Senate were not \nalive when Medicare passed.\n\n  This is the time for this Congress to look at those pieces of \nlegislation and say: What do we need to do to adjust them to the future \nneeds of the country? What do we need to do to adjust them to the \ncurrent and future demographic realities of society? People live \nlonger. People need these services longer. What do we do to make this \nwork in a way that these programs can last?\n  These are not programs put in place by this Congress. These are not \nbills incurred by this Congress. These are bills, in fact, for which \nthis Congress and this President can decide we are going to look for \nthese programs and be sure they last and look at these programs and be \nsure they can be paid for.\n  That is exactly the kind of discussion we should be having when we \nask the American people, through their Congress, to extend the line of \ncredit.\n  The idea that we will not negotiate on the debt ceiling or we will \nnot negotiate on how to spend the money--if we do not negotiate on how \nto spend the money by bringing the appropriations bills to the floor, \nhow are we supposed to negotiate and set priorities and let democracy \nwork? I do not like democracy by crisis. Whatever we do in the next few \nweeks or months that it takes to finish out the year we have already \nstarted, what we should all do is commit ourselves for the year that \nbegins next October 1 to be prepared for that like the Congresses until \njust 6 or 7 years ago generally were prepared at or near that date.\n  When there was a government shutdown in 1995, six of the \nappropriations bills had been passed, signed into law, and all those \nparts of the government were working after a debate that provided \nfunding.\n  So I would just say, as I conclude, we need to move away from \nmanagement by crisis, but we also need to understand that if we do not \ndo the work the regular way, there is no other place to take a stand, \nthere is no other place to have this debate. As to the President's \nsense that you could get this at some other point, there is no other \npoint if the Congress and the President are not doing their job.\n  I will just say, we should do our job, we should do it in a way \npeople can see. We should do it in the small bites that the budget \nprocess is set up to allow us to look at and debate. We have not done \nthat over the last 12 months. We have started this year in about the \nworst possible way. Hopefully, we will get through this and then \nresolve to do the work the right way for what begins 1 year from now. \nBut at this moment, the President thinking we can just go ahead and \nmove forward without negotiating is a wrong decision on the President's \npart.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/11/senate-section/article/S7417-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
