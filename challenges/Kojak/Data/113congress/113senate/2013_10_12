Madam President, it is very hard to comprehend that 4 days \nfrom today, unless and until a few extremist Republicans--we hope it is \na few--too radical to compromise, could force a default on the Nation's \nfinancial obligations for the first time ever. Economists say it won't \nbe long before financial markets react negatively to this continued \nuncertainty.\n  I believe Monday is a legal holiday and I believe the markets will be \nclosed. That is good. What I see staring us in the face is not a \npleasant picture.\n  Everyone should understand that a bad day on Wall Street doesn't only \naffect these great big banks or wealthy investors. It affects everyone \nin our country, not only those with 401(k)s but those who have no \nsavings. It affects everybody, because everyone will lose, not only in \nAmerica but around the world. The life savings of ordinary Americans \nare at risk, and that is an understatement.\n  While this uncertainty is bad, default would be unthinkably worse. To \nshow my angst is real, one only need look at what took place in the \nHouse of Representatives this morning. They walked out of another \nmeeting, a conference, a caucus--call it what you\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\nwant--defiant: We couldn't do anything.\n  Therefore, the government remains closed, and the debt ceiling is, \nevery day, closer and closer--every hour now. While this uncertainty is \nbad, I repeat, default is unthinkably worse.\n  Because of the collapse on Wall Street a few years ago, the State of \nNevada and States all over the country were hammered. This was only 5 \nyears ago. Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings, \nas did people around the world. The country is beginning to recover, \nbut it is not in great shape.\n  The crisis we now face is one of even greater proportion. The \ngovernment has remained closed for 12 days. Think about this. Four \nStates are buying into programs so national parks can stay open. \nNational parks. They were the brainchild of Republican Theodore \nRoosevelt.\n  It is very sad what is happening to our country. Defaulting on our \ndebt would risk millions of American jobs--not thousands, not tens of \nthousands, not hundreds of thousands, but millions of jobs. Social \nSecurity checks will likely be halted, Medicare payments and even \npayments for our troops wouldn't happen.\n  Without exception, the most respected economists and business minds \nof our time have said that if America defaults on its debt, there will \nbe dire consequences here and around the globe. We have heard this from \neverybody, not only economists but business people.\n  I was pleased to see the Republicans engaged in talks with the \nPresident, the House Republicans. That is over, it is done. They are \nnot talking anymore. We learned that this morning.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side of the Senate, time is \nrunning out. They have urged their more radical Members to compromise.\n  For example, my senior friend from Arizona came to the Congress of \nthe United States with me and the assistant leader. We have been \ntogether for 31 years. These are the sensible words of the senior \nSenator from Arizona:\n\n       Sooner or later, the government will resume its function. \n     Sooner or later we will raise the debt limit. The question is \n     how we get there. . . . Why don't we do this sooner rather \n     than later? Why doesn't the Senate lead?\n\n  To that end we are trying. We are going to have a vote in 50 minutes \non a long-term measure to avert default and give the economy what it \nneeds.\n  I have told my Republican friends that allowing the government to \noperate again is not a favor to me; it is not a favor to the Presiding \nOfficer; it is not a favor to Democrats on this side of the aisle. It \nis something that should happen. We shouldn't consider this a time for \ndoing favors for individuals or groups. We should understand the \ngovernment should open because it should never have closed in the first \nplace.\n  The debt ceiling--reasonable Republicans should understand this \nshould be extended, not for a couple of weeks or a couple of months, it \nshould be extended for a long time. We shouldn't have this fight. To \nthink that this is only a motion to proceed to the legislation, it is \nnot a vote on the measure itself, and the Republicans, I have been \ntold, are all going to vote against this. What a sad day for America. \nThey are voting to not allow us to even debate whether the debt ceiling \nshould be raised. Are they afraid of that? Do they want this to go \naway? It is not going to go away. Each hour that goes by, we are closer \nto a calamity for our country.\n  The economy needs more stability than short-term Republican \nproposals. Congress and the country must not be back in a position a \nfew weeks from now wondering whether Republicans will force our Nation \nto default on our financial obligations.\n  To think the House Republicans are saying: Well, we will extend the \ndebt for a little while but we are not going to reopen the government, \nwow, that is so logical, sensible and good for the country--and I say \nthis very sarcastically.\n  The Senate Democrats' position has been and remains this: We open our \ngovernment and pay our country's bills so we can move forward with \ngood-faith negotiations on a long-term budget. It is not too late for \nmy Republican colleagues to do what is right for this country.\n  I am very concerned. It seems the worry about whether our country \nshould have a functioning government and should extend the debt ceiling \nis only from Democrats. This isn't the way it should be.\n  I admire President Obama for what he has done the last few days. He \nhas invited every Member of Congress, 535, to meet with him. First he \nhad the House Democrats and then the Senate Democrats, another meeting, \nthen Senate Republicans, and House Republicans. Remember, the last time \nmy friend Speaker Boehner was on television, he said: Maybe, oh, 18 \ntimes, I haven't counted.\n  He wanted to have a conversation. The President took him up on that. \nHe invited all 232 Members of the Republican Caucus to come to the \nWhite House and visit with him. They refused that. They sent down 20.\n  I appreciate the President being willing to talk with all of us, and \nhe has done that in detail. The problem is the conversation is one way. \nThe Republicans are not interested, it appears at this stage, of doing \nanything constructive to extend the debt ceiling and open the \ngovernment. ``Later'' is what they always say.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12 noon will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, at 12 o'clock noon we will vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1569. It is barely 1 page, but it is of more \nsignificance than anyone can imagine. It basically is an opportunity \nfor us to start the debate--not to end the debate but to start the \ndebate--on whether the United States of America will default on its \ndebt for the first time in the history of this Nation. Other nations \nhave defaulted: Argentina, Venezuela, Cameroon. We have never \ndefaulted.\n  As a result, the U.S. dollar is the soundest currency in the world. \nThink about it for a second. Where else would you turn? The U.S. dollar \nis the soundest currency. Buying the debt of the United States is \nconsidered to be the single safest investment any person, business, or \ncountry can make.\n  We didn't just inherit this. We earned this, because every year the \nUnited States has been a nation, we have paid our bills, and now this \nis being brought into question.\n  Today at noon on the floor of the Senate there is going to be a vote \non whether we proceed with the debate over paying our bills. Sadly, we \nare told not a single Republican Senator will join us in allowing the \ndebate on paying our bills. That is a sad commentary. When we think \nabout it, it is taking the events of the past week or two to the \nextreme.\n  It was bad enough to shut down the United States. When Republicans \ndecided that shutting down the government was a great political move, \nthe American people said: Are you out of your mind? Eight hundred \nthousand people are going to be furloughed, and we are going to stop \nthe services of our government?\n  For the last 12 days we have seen every single day another indicator, \nanother piece of news, about how this government shutdown is hurting \nordinary people across America, whether it is those who were denied \nclinical trials at the National Institutes of Health outside of \nWashington, DC--clinical trials that were literally life-and-death \ndecisions; whether we are talking about food inspection, reading the \nnewspaper about salmonella poisoning and realizing the Republican \ngovernment shutdown is reducing the number of food inspectors. The list \ngoes on and on and on.\n  But I will tell you this: As sad and unfair as it is for the \nRepublican shutdown of the government to result in 800,000 furloughed \nFederal employees, the hardships on their families and the hardships on \nall Americans who count on their jobs and on the basic services of the \nFederal Government is worse.\n  This is worse. The Republican shutdown has reached a new level of \nrecklessness, a new level of irresponsibility if we default on \nAmerica's debt. Sadly, it will mean the victims will not just be \nFederal employees and their families. No, not even just those who count \non government services. The victims\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nwill be virtually every person and every family in America.\n  Is that an exaggeration? Is it just another politician reaching \nextreme rhetoric here on the floor? Let me quote a few people who do \nthis for a living--the people we trust. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in \na Finance Committee hearing on October 13 said:\n\n       Failing to raise the debt ceiling will impact everyday \n     Americans beyond its impact on financial markets. Between \n     October 17 and November 1, we have large payments to Medicare \n     providers, Social Security beneficiaries, and veterans, as \n     well as salaries for Active-Duty members of the military. A \n     failure to raise the debt limit could put timely payment of \n     all of these at risk.\n\n  Of course, he is a government employee, an appointee of the \nadministration. One might say: Well, let's discount that. He is just \nputting the President's political spin on this. Let's go to Frank \nKeating, no friend of the administration. He is the head of the \nAmerican Bankers Association. Before a banking committee hearing on \nOctober 10, he said:\n\n       Ordinary Americans will bear the brunt of the damage if our \n     leaders do not prevent the United States from defaulting on \n     its debt for the first time in history.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It would . . . raise the cost of borrowing for businesses, \n     meaning job losses and price increases . . . be a blow to \n     retirement funds, leaving fewer resources available for \n     retirees. For banks, which hold $3 trillion in Treasury, \n     agency and mortgage-backed securities, the sharp decline in \n     value of these securities would translate into fewer \n     resources available for mortgages, business, auto, credit \n     card and student loans.\n\n  To put it in layman's terms, Mr. Keating, the head of the American \nBankers Association, is saying if the Congress fails to extend the debt \nceiling, as we are proposing to do today, interest rates will go up--\ninterest rates on ordinary Americans, ordinary families, and ordinary \nbusinesses.\n  This is entirely preventable. Let me just lay the cards on the table. \nI have been in the House and in the Senate. Nobody wants to vote for \nthis because most people don't understand it. They think: Oh, so you \nwant us to go further in debt, Senator? That is why you voted for it.\n  But that is not the case. The debt limit is paying off the bills we \nhave already incurred. It is like going to a fancy restaurant and \nordering the best meal on the menu, eating the meal, and when they come \nto ask you to pay the check you say: No, I am not paying the check. You \nsee, I am a fiscal conservative. I just don't believe in extravagant \neating. But you just ate the meal, and now you are not going to pay the \ncheck?\n  That is what this is about. We have incurred these bills, and now the \nquestion is whether we will pay these bills. That is what it comes down \nto. This is basic and fundamental.\n  At noon there will be a vote on the floor of the Senate which will \nhave a direct impact on everyone in this country. The question is \nwhether the Republicans, fresh from the failure of their government \nshutdown, are going to dig a deeper hole, not just for their party--\nforget that completely--but for this Nation; whether they are going to \ncreate a new group of victims beyond Federal employees that includes \nevery person, every family, and every business in America. That is what \nis at stake.\n  Madam President, I am not exaggerating. I think this may be the \nsingle most irresponsible thing I have seen in the time I have served \nin Washington. To let this happen is not good for this Nation, and it \nis not fair to the people of this Nation.\n  The majority leader said the markets are closed on Monday. It turns \nout, I am told, that the bond market is closed, but the stock market is \nopen. That stock market, incidentally, is where mutual funds live, \nwhere the stocks people own for their savings and retirement live, and \nwhere their savings live. This irresponsible action, sadly, is likely \nto create a decline in the value of their hard-earned savings.\n  But it can be avoided. What would it take? Six Republicans. That is \nwhat it takes. The Democrats are prepared to move forward and extend \nthe debt ceiling. We need six moderate Republicans to step up and join \nus. If they will, we will move forward. We will accept the \nresponsibility of ultimately voting for whatever bill there is to \nextend the debt ceiling. We are asking six Republicans to give us a \nchance to vote. If they say no at noon today, the consequences could be \nawful for this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I hope the country listens to what the \nsenior Senator from Illinois has said about the ramifications of this \nshutdown. This is not a political exercise. This is not a bumper \nsticker thing. This is hitting every single family, every single person \nin America. It doesn't make a difference whether they are Democrats, \nRepublicans or Independents. It is going to hurt and hurt badly. \nWhether you are saving money for your child to go to college, to put \naway for your retirement or are paying bills for an illness, all of us \nare going to be impacted. So I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Illinois for those comments.\n  Madam President, on this 12th day of being paralyzed by this \nunnecessary shutdown, there are real results that will come about \nbecause of it. I have given several examples on the floor about how \nVermonters are suffering due to this tea party shutdown. And I am sure \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer probably has similar examples from \nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts or others as well.\n  Earlier this year I worked with Senator Crapo, a Republican from \nIdaho, to build the support we needed to reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--VAWA--and I was proud when both the Senate and House \npassed the legislation with strong bipartisan votes and the President \nsigned it. We put our differences aside--and we are philosophically \nvery different--to help the people we serve, whether they are in Idaho, \nVermont, Massachusetts or anywhere else. We sent a clear message that \nviolence against women will not be tolerated. We put the needs of \nvictims first when we promised rape crisis centers and domestic \nviolence shelters they would have the resources they need to keep their \ndoors open and to keep their 24-hour hotlines staffed. But now we are \nhere in October, which marks Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and so \nmany of the lifesaving programs we put in this legislation are caught \nin the crossfire of the tea party shutdown.\n  Today, as Federal funds are being held hostage by the tea party \nshutdown, we are starting to see the real toll of this brinkmanship. In \nFranklin County, VT, a northwestern county in our State, advocates were \nhopeful when they learned a new grant would allow one staff person to \nhelp victims of LGBT domestic assault in that rural region. Of course, \nthis hope has given way to frustration because the funds promised on \nOctober 1 did not come through due to the shutdown.\n  Barre City, Vermont, is the town where my father was born. It has a \npopulation of 9,200. In Barre City, the police force has furloughed two \nhalf-time detectives who were providing 24/7 coverage for special \nresponses to domestic violence cases. They were also providing critical \ntraining for their colleagues on how to answer these challenging calls.\n  I was a prosecutor in Vermont, and I saw how terrible these domestic \nviolence cases could be, and they occur in every State. I would bet \nthat every single State can give an example of what this shutdown has \nmeant, the same as Barre, VT.\n  There is a long list of programs funded with VAWA grants that \ncontinue to provide services to victims--and incur the related costs--\nbased on the hope they might be reimbursed once funding is restored. \nMeanwhile, the tea party says maybe the check will be in the mail. They \nhave no choice because despite what the tea party might think, when you \nclose the spigot of funding, it doesn't mean the victims go away.\n  I still have nightmares of some of these scenes I saw at 3 o'clock in \nthe morning when I was a prosecutor. They are still occurring. We can \nat least cut way back on them and help people in America.\n  But I also want to know what is going to happen to victims and their \nchildren when the money for WIC and the TANF programs runs dry. We know \nmany victims of domestic violence have to rely on this support when \nthey leave their abusers. In the past they had to stick with their \nabusers because\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nthey had to feed their children. Now at least they have a lifeline out \nthere. If you combine that with the impending cuts to the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program the tea party wants, I wonder whether this \nis going to cause these victims and their children to stay in the homes \nof the abusers just so the children can be fed. That is shameful.\n  This is America. This is America. All of these tea party members get \npaid. They are getting paid today. They get their expenses. They get \ntheir staff. They can fly back and forth. They can go on television and \nall of that. They are not facing this abuse or the question of how they \nfeed their children.\n  Kris Luken, director of Voices Against Violence in St. Albans, VT, \nsays the uncertainty is the hardest part, both for her agency and for \nthe victims it serves. At the end of last week, the first of the tea \nparty shutdown, she said:\n\n       We are fielding a lot of calls from survivors who don't \n     know how they are going to make ends meet. People just don't \n     know what the impact will be.\n\n  So you get abused first by whoever the abuser is, and now you are \ngoing to get abused by this tea party shutdown. In these difficult \neconomic times, it is more important than ever to ensure that our \nsafety net is in place. We cannot turn our backs on these families--\nthat is not who we are as a country.\n  When we reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act this year, we \nincluded provisions to specifically address the high rate of domestic \nand sexual violence experienced by Native American women. Sadly, this \nshutdown disproportionately affects that already vulnerable population. \nTribal lands rely heavily on Federal funding and one tribal domestic \nviolence shelter in South Dakota has lost 90 percent of its funding. \nThat shelter is at capacity and the loss of funds means victims are \nbeing turned away. They are left with no place to turn. That is simply \nunconscionable.\n  The District of Columbia's Sexual Assault Nurse's program relies on \nFederal funds to provide necessary medical assistance to rape victims, \nincluding rape kits. Absent emergency funding which will soon dry up \nunless we end this foolish shutdown, rape kit examinations will cease, \nleaving victims without the specialized care they deserve and the DNA \nevidence they need to prosecute and convict their rapists.\n  Let's end the uncertainty. Let's end the shutdown and fulfill our \npromises to the people we are here to represent.\n  The continuing resolution passed by the Senate--a resolution which, \nafter all, was asked for by the House of Representatives and was a \ncompromise with them--could end this stalemate. The leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives should have the courage to bring it to a \nvote--the courage not necessarily for their own political needs but the \ncourage for the needs of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I first of all want to thank my \ncolleague, the Senator from Vermont, for his comments and his \nrelentless voicing of the concerns of folks who are not often heard in \nthe halls of this institution. I thank him for his work and for letting \neveryone know who continues to be hurt by this absurd government \nshutdown.\n  I really think we are almost in a kind of era of the theater of the \nabsurd at this point. We have a government shutdown for 11-plus days \nand are 4 days, 5 days from a default. What I keep wondering is--we \nhear about some of the least fortunate who are being hurt--how much of \nour economy is being hurt all across the board.\n  I received a call 2 nights ago from the chairman of a company from \nNorthern Virginia with 5,500 employees. This company has been built by \nthis first generation of Americans. He is extraordinarily proud of what \nhe has done for his company, for his employees. His company serves our \ngovernment as a so-called government contractor. A lot of these \ncompanies are not only in Virginia, in Maryland, but across this region \nand across this country.\n  When the shutdown started, 30 percent of his 5,500 employees were \ntold they are not essential. So the company has been trying to make \nends meet keeping these folks furloughed but not firing them, trying to \npay them a little something during this period. The remarkable thing is \nthat 70 percent of the employees that were deemed essential are not \ngetting paid either--even though the government says they are going to \npay them--because the folks who process the checks are furloughed.\n  Anybody who operates a business on a cashflow basis knows that when \nthe money runs out, even if you have a potential IOU, if you can't go \nto the bank and borrow money, you shut down. This company, 25 years in \nthe building, this CEO, this chairman, said if this goes on 1 or 2 more \nweeks, his life's work and--more importantly than his life's work, he \nsaid--the 5,500 people who depend upon this company's existence may \nvery well disappear. That is just part of the government shutdown.\n\n  Today we are going to vote on an issue that I never thought in my \ntime in the public sector or the private sector we would be seriously \nconsidering; that is, the default of the United States of America. I \nhave spent more time in the private sector than I have in the public \nsector, but I never thought I would see the headline I saw this week in \nthe Financial Times, an international financial newspaper, where the \nheadline was that Japan and China and Russia Say: America, pay your \nbills. America, pay your bills. America, the largest economy in the \nworld, the country that, because of our exemplary behavior for decades, \nhas been granted the status of the reserve currency.\n  What does reserve currency mean? It means that every American \nbusiness does a little bit better than every other business around the \nworld because the dollar is the currency everybody else goes to when \ntimes are tough.\n  There are countries--not all of them friendly to us--that are saying \nthat maybe the dollar shouldn't be the reserve currency anymore, and if \nwe lose that status, it doesn't come back overnight. It is not where \nthe tea party crowd can say: Maybe we made a mistake; we want to roll \nthat back. Once it is gone, it could take literally decades to get it \nback.\n  Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has only been one \nindustrialized country in the world that has defaulted since the year \n2000--Argentina. America is not Argentina, but back in December 2001 \nArgentina defaulted. Prior to that time, Argentina--per capita income--\nwas the richest country in South America, way ahead of Chile, Brazil, \nand other nations in that region. Once Argentina defaulted, the value \nof its currency fell by 75 percent, inflation hit over 100 percent a \nyear, and every Argentinean family lost over half of their net worth. \nToday, 12 years after Argentina defaulted, on an annual average income \nbasis, it falls way below most of the countries of South America.\n  America is not Argentina. It may not be that catastrophic, but why \nwould anyone take the chance? Why would anyone decide in this \nunchartered area to potentially threaten default? That is like playing \nRussian roulette with one bullet and only two chambers. No responsible \nnation would do that.\n  We have heard from some on the other side: Here is what we ought to \ndo. Maybe we will kind of default, but we will pay our bonds and we \nwill pay Social Security, pay our military, and then everything else \nwill be put on hold.\n  That, to me, shows a remarkable, fundamental lack of understanding of \nhow government or economics works. No government has ever tried that. \nBut for the sake of argument, let's suppose that somehow that \n``prioritization'' scheme might stave off America defaulting for 1 or 2 \nweeks.\n  Here is the other half of the story they don't acknowledge. Even if \nAmerica pays its debt, on that list of prioritization does not appear \nMedicaid, education, transportation, law enforcement, and those dollars \ndon't stay spent at the Federal level, they are spent at the State \ngovernment level and the local government level.\n  I had the great honor of being Governor of Virginia before I came to \nthe Senate. We worked really hard to keep a triple-A bond rating. The \nCommonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, Louisiana--every one \nof these States, at least one-third of their State budgets are dollars \nthat pass from the Federal Government down to the State level. We could \nsee within a week or maybe even less every State government and every \nlocal government in\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nAmerica either have a budget crisis or default. What is happening in \nDetroit could happen across every community in America--not because of \nmistakes made at the local level or the State level but because of the \nirresponsibility of a group of folks up here who don't understand the \neconomics that you don't mess with the full faith and credit of \nAmerica.\n  What other costs are we playing with? Many of the folks who have been \nmost adamant about keeping the government shut--which, by the way, will \ncost the taxpayers more and will not save us a dime. Federal employees \nwill be paid, but starting and stopping all these government contracts \nwill hurt the economy, decrease tax revenues, and actually cost \ntaxpayers more.\n  But what may be even more jeopardizing than those actions with this \nkind of irresponsible testing of the markets or brinkmanship is that we \ncould see interest rates rise. Every 1 point of increased interest \npayment on our debt accounts for $110 billion of additional Federal \nGovernment payments every year. A 1-percent interest in the debt \nincrease over a 10-year basis is an extra $1 trillion of government \nspending that has a priority over any other aspect of Federal \nGovernment spending. Talk about a tax hike that gets America nothing \nfrom a group who says: We don't want to increase taxes at any cost--\nwell, playing with the debt ceiling, 1 percent interest, a $110 billion \ntax hike on every American family and every American business, and \nagain, you can't say a few days later ``oops'' and the market would \nthen take back down our interest rates.\n  I know other colleagues are here and want to speak as well. In my \nbusiness life, in my time as Governor, in my time as Senator, I have \nnever seen an action nearly as irresponsible as the actions taken--and \nI don't think this is the majority of the colleagues on the other \nside--by a small cohort of ideologues who are willing to do whatever, \nincluding burn down the house, to try to achieve their goals.\n  We will have a chance here in the Senate in about 20 minutes to \ndecide whether we will take off the threat of America defaulting. The \nAsian markets open within 40 hours. The world is going to see whether \nAmerica is going to maintain its position as reserve currency, the \nworld's largest economy, and the most stable financial basis. I hope we \nwill take a step today to at least remove the threat of default, to \nencourage our friends on the House side to do that as well as reopen \nthis government, and then, yes, let's get our fiscal house in order. \nBut putting America's fiscal reputation and putting companies in \njeopardy with the shutdown is not the kind of governance America needs \nat this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for \nhis outstanding work. He knows this from a business perspective, an \neconomic perspective, and a political perspective, and has been such a \nstrong and vibrant voice about America paying its bills.\n  I would like to add a couple of things.\n  We have a group of people in the House and the Senate--not a \nmajority--whom we call debt ceiling deniers. They deny that letting the \ndebt ceiling lapse and going into default could be cataclysmic for \nAmerica. They are wrong. Every person who has studied this knows it is \nwrong.\n  The debt ceiling deniers fall in two camps. Some say: Well, we can \npay certain debts and not other debts and that would be all right.\n  Well, let them choose. Pick Social Security over veterans? Pick \npayments to pregnant mothers versus payments for food safety? We can't \ndo it.\n  Then they say: Well, maybe we should just pay Treasurys that come due \nand not pay Social Security.\n  Well, let me tell you, as somebody who has consulted experts on the \nmarket, the overwhelming view is that if we don't pay any of our bills \nfor the first time in U.S. history, the markets could very well freeze \nup, tighten, and create huge damage to our country.\n  The second group of debt ceiling deniers say: Well, we don't know the \ndate.\n  And we don't. The markets are mystical, but once they come to their \nown most magical conclusion that the United States is going to default, \nwe will be in trouble. That could be the 17th. It could be a day or two \nbefore, importuning us to action as soon as possible. It could be a \nlittle bit later. But we don't know when it is. And what a risk.\n  We are like a blindfolded man walking toward the edge of a cliff. If \nwe keep walking, we will fall off. We can debate whether we fall off in \n5 yards, 50 yards, or 500 yards, but we will fall off and we don't know \nwhat that line is. Why risk it?\n  I have one final point. This could be as bad or worse than the 2008 \nrecession. It is the same basic principle. A very important security--\nin that case, mortgage securities, and in this case, Treasurys--loses \ntremendous value, the markets freeze, loans can't be made, interest \nrates rise, and then all the ensuing economic damage. Auto sales will \ngo down and thousands of autoworkers will be laid off. Home sales will \ngo down and construction workers will be laid off. That is what \nhappened in 2008, and it could well happen again and be worse because \nthis will be worldwide. U.S. Treasurys are probably the most widely \nheld denomination of assets on financial institution books and deeper--\nmore institutions have more of them than have mortgage securities. So \nwe are playing with fire.\n  I make a plea to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I know \nwe all have political agendas. I very much would like to see the \nimmigration bill passed. We all have agendas that are very important to \nus. Please do not hold the debt ceiling and paying our debts hostage to \nany other condition. Pass the debt ceiling unconditionally, and then we \ncan go back to our business, debate these issues, and see where the \npolitical chips fall. But please, for the sake of this country, for the \nsake of the men and women who labored before us and never let us \ndefault, do not play with fire, pass a clean debt ceiling, and let's \nmove on and debate the other issues that so much deserve debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor today to add my \nvoice to the voices that have spoken since 11:00 our time about the \nimportance of opening this government and sending a strong signal that \nthe Congress will not default on its debt; that we will pay our bills \nand we will honor the commitments we have made not only to bondholders \noutside of our country but to our own constituents who hold Treasury \nbonds in their pension funds and their 401(k)s, who use it to balance \ntheir investments in their businesses because they know they can count \non those notes being paid. Until just a few days ago it seemed as if \nthat would happen.\n  Recently, in the last 48 hours, there is a real question as to \nwhether a small group of Republicans in the House understands how high \nthis cliff is and how close we are to it. This problem is completely \nmanufactured by a group of people elected to office to do this exact \nthing--shut the government down at any expense and, as the Senator from \nVirginia just said, burn the whole house down with the children inside. \nThey came here with that express purpose. They are wrong, and they are \npushing this country to a terrible place.\n  Leader Reid has explained it. Senator Schumer from New York has \nexplained it. Mark Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, who is \nliterally one of the finest Governors we have had in the last 50 years \nin America--and I say that respectfully and honestly; we all know what \na great Governor he was--he is now joined by another great Governor \nfrom Virginia, Governor Kaine--these men are Senators, but they \nunderstand our Governors now are at risk, every Governor, Republican \nand Democrat, and all the leaders of the State governments and the \nthousands of cities and villages.\n  Yesterday we received a letter signed by the Governors Association, \nDemocrat and Republican Governors, saying open the government. Do not \nlet the government default. Why? Because in our system of government, \nwhich is the best in the world--it is not perfect, but it is the best \nin the world ever created by men and women. We are frail human beings. \nWe make a lot of mistakes. We made so many mistakes in the creation\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\nof our country and we still continue to do it, but we are trying to \nbuild a model of democracy, the best the Earth has ever known.\n  There is a group of people in the House who decided that for some \nreason they do not like the democracy. I do not know what they want to \ngo back to, but it has taken us 230-plus years to get here. I don't \nthink anybody wants to go back to a place where the world had no \ndemocracy.\n  There were elections. People won those elections. President Obama won \nhis election. He did not carry my State, but he won his election fair \nand square. He campaigned on providing middle-class families for the \nfirst time in America a way to purchase health insurance--not a single-\npayer system, not the government system--to purchase health insurance \nso they would not be one accident away from financial ruin. ``Shame on \nPresident Obama. Shame on him for suggesting something so radical that \nmoms and dads could go to sleep at night knowing that if an accident \nhappened the next day they would not have to take bankruptcy or choose \nbetween a child disfigured or a child who needed to go to college. \nShame on President Obama. How dare he suggest such a thing.''\n  If they do not like the bill, they can change the bill. We did not \nwake up one morning and declare this the law. The people of the United \nStates declared this through us as their Representatives. If they do \nnot like it, they can unelect us. Believe me, they will have a great \nchance because I am up for reelection right now. They will be able to \ndo that. But that is the way you do it. You do not threaten to shut \ndown the government.\n  I am going to run for reelection. I am standing in this election as a \nsupporter of the Affordable Care Act--not because it is a perfect law \nbut because it is much better for all the people I represent than what \nwe had before--the wealthiest people, the middle-class people, and the \npoor people.\n  We argued and fought in public, in meetings for 40 years on how to do \nthis. This was not a last-minute, behind-the-scenes deal that nobody \nread. Have they lost their minds? We debated this for 40 years through \nevery kind of President you can think of, conservative, liberal, \ndifferent kinds of Congresses.\n  I know we have devoted 10 minutes, and I know other people want to \nspeak, but I will take just a few minutes.\n  Contrary to popular belief and what FOX News said, people here read \nthe bills. For 40 years we read the bills. But we did not have to read \nthe bills; all we had to do was look at the faces of kids dying of \ncancer who had no way to get cured. All we had to do is talk to people \nwho came to our office every day who said: Senator, can't you do \nsomething? My insurance is going up. I can't afford it. I want to get \nout of my job. I worked for GE my whole life. I have a better idea. I \nwant to get a better job, but I can't leave because my wife has cancer.\n  I don't need to read a bill. I listen to my constituents. That is \nwhat this is about. Then when they decide they are going to shut down \nthe government because they can repeal this law--now they are deciding \nthat did not work so well. That is not making a lot of sense to people. \nNow we are going to negotiate on we don't know what, but we have to get \nsomething out of this. How dare they? How dare this group of radicals, \nled by the Senator from Texas--how dare they take the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth hostage? Who gives them that right? Do they think \nthey are divined by God? They are not--none of us here are.\n  God could run this world perfectly, but he doesn't run it. He is in \nHeaven. Until then we, as imperfect as we are, have to figure out His \nwill through the democratic process. But they have decided that is not \ngood enough.\n  I don't know anything on Earth that is better. Maybe they can figure \nit out in the next 48 hours. People have been thinking about that for 6 \nor 7 or 8,000 years or longer. I don't think 48 hours is going to help \nthem.\n  Anyway, we are here today. What I would like to say is that I agree \nwith everything my Senate colleagues have said. I urge our colleagues \nto vote to open the government, to not hold the U.S. Government and the \nworld and all the kids in the world, all the adults in the world, all \nthe businesses in the world hostage over their antics. In Louisiana, \nlet me say, we have 400,000 people who need us to fix flood insurance. \nThey are truly hurting. We have 200,000 people who live in Houma who \nhave been waiting for a levee around their city for 25 years. Then they \nwere told by the Corps, yes, they will build it. Then they didn't; yes, \nthey will build it. Then they didn't. I need to get on that.\n  We have permits in the Gulf of Mexico, I say to Senator Boxer. I see \nmy friend from California. I am going to turn it over to her. We have a \nlittle different view on this, Senator Boxer and I, but people in \nLouisiana would like to drill for oil. We would like to get our permits \nto do that. But because this ideological group has shut down the \ngovernment, there are no permits being issued to produce the oil and \ngas necessary to keep our country strong. I could go on.\n  Let us reason together. We can find many issues to negotiate about. I \nam open to many negotiations, as are the Democrats, but to threaten the \ncore of this democracy, fought for so long and hard over decades by men \nand women, is beyond the pale.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana. I \nam so appreciative of her because she is telling it like it is. She is \nsincere. She cares about her State.\n  Let me reassure her, she and I do not agree in terms of the \nparameters of oil drilling and Keystone and other issues. That has \nnothing to do with our friendship. But the Senator is exactly right. \nShe deserves to have the permits run through the process. It is \nridiculous. Just as the roadbuilders are waiting to have the EPA finish \nthe environmental studies so they can get these roads--this government \nshutdown is brutal.\n  The reason I am rising--very briefly because I want to leave time for \nmy friend from Oregon to say a few words--is because I wish to be so \ncrystal clear to the people who might be watching us on this unusual \nSaturday session. We are in the midst of a Republican government \nshutdown. I am going to say that again. We are in the midst of a \nRepublican shutdown of the government of the United States of America. \nThe Senate passed a clean bill to reopen the government. It is sitting \nover there at Speaker Boehner's House, and he is blocking all ability \nto open this government. That is No. 1.\n  Now we are getting frighteningly close to a default. We are getting \nvery close to the point where America will not be able to pay its \nbills. The cost of that to our Nation, to our people, to our \nreputation, to our economy, to our taxpayers cannot be overstated: \ndisaster. We have a chance now to pass a clean debt ceiling bill, which \nmeans we will not default. I hope my colleagues will vote for it. They \nare filibustering it. We need 60 votes. I hope somebody will come to \ntheir senses over there because the results of not doing it would be \ndisastrous. I think Senator Warner has spoken very clearly about what \nthis means from the perspective of both a former governor and a \nbusinessman.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a newspaper \narticle entitled ``Business, labor and nonprofits demand that the \nshutdown end `immediately.' ''\n  I am going to read a little bit from it and leave the remainder of \ntime for my friend from Oregon:\n\n       The most prominent names in business, labor and the \n     nonprofit world on Friday demanded that Washington \n     ``immediately'' end the government shutdown.\n       In a joint letter sent to President Obama and lawmakers, \n     leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and \n     United Way Worldwide said the shutdown shouldn't continue \n     another day.\n       ``As leaders of business, labor, and the nonprofit sector, \n     we are writing to urge you to end the federal government \n     shutdown immediately,'' the letter says.\n       ``While we may disagree on priorities for federal policies \n     and we even have conflicting views about many issues, we are \n     in complete agreement that the current shutdown is harmful \n     and the risk of default is potentially catastrophic for our \n     fragile economy.''\n\n  It goes on. I want to say to my Republican friends: Wake up. This \nisn't a letter from one Democratic group or a liberal group or even a \ncentrist group. This is a letter from America, from the business \nleaders and the workers and the nonprofit leaders. You are so out of\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nstep it is frightening. Vote with us for a clean debt ceiling so we \nwill not default and we do not send a terrible message to the markets. \nOpen this government now. Take up the Senate bill over there, Speaker \nBoehner, put it up for a vote. Let's open this government and give it \nback to the American people because they deserve it. They do not \ndeserve to be treated this way. They do not deserve to be hurt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, Oct. 11, 2013]\n\nBusiness, Labor and Nonprofits Demand That Shutdown End ``Immediately''\n\n                          (By Kevin Bogardus)\n\n       The most prominent names in business, labor and the \n     nonprofit world on Friday demanded that Washington \n     ``immediately'' end the government shutdown.\n       In a joint letter sent to President Obama and lawmakers, \n     leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and \n     United Way Worldwide said the shutdown shouldn't continue \n     another day.\n       ``As leaders of business, labor, and the nonprofit sector, \n     we are writing to urge you to end the federal government \n     shutdown immediately,'' the letter says.\n       ``While we may disagree on priorities for federal policies \n     and we even have conflicting views about many issues, we are \n     in complete agreement that the current shutdown is harmful \n     and the risk of default is potentially catastrophic for our \n     fragile economy.''\n       The signatories on the letter were Tom Donohue, the \n     Chamber's president and CEO; AFL-CIO President Richard \n     Trumka; and Stacey Stewart, the U.S. president of United Way \n     Worldwide.\n       ``Our three disparate sectors share a common view--no one \n     benefits from the current shut-down and everyone will be \n     harmed if the government defaults. It is in the interest of \n     our nation that Congress restore the normal functioning of \n     our political process, fund the government immediately and \n     quickly move to resolve the impasse over the debt ceiling \n     limit,'' the letter says.\n       The shutdown is in its 11th day even as the Oct. 17 \n     deadline to raise the debt ceiling approaches. Talks between \n     the White House and Republican lawmakers to resolve the \n     budget crisis picked up on Thursday, but an agreement is far \n     from certain.\n       Business leaders fear a failure to raise the debt ceiling \n     by the deadline will send the stock market into a tailspin \n     and plunge the economy into recession.\n       Labor unions have been protesting the government shutdown \n     since last week. Trade groups have also been active--from the \n     American Hotel & Lodging Association to the International \n     Franchise Association--telling lawmakers that the shutdown \n     has hurt business.\n       The Chamber, the AFL-CIO and United Way said both parties \n     need to work together to resolve the impasse.\n       ``We urge all of our leaders in Washington to set aside the \n     many issues we disagree about, reach across the aisle and end \n     the shutdown and the threat of a national default,'' the \n     letter concludes.\n                                  ____\n\n       To President Obama and Members of Congress: As leaders of \n     business, labor, and the nonprofit sector, we are writing to \n     urge you to end the federal government shutdown immediately.\n       Our country is navigating the most challenging economic \n     times in a generation. While we may disagree on priorities \n     for federal policies and we even have conflicting views about \n     many issues, we are in complete agreement that the current \n     shutdown is harmful and the risk of default is potentially \n     catastrophic for our fragile economy.\n       Large and small businesses, the workforce (especially \n     federal workers), people who rely on public and privately-\n     funded social services, and communities at-large, are being \n     harmed by the shutdown. The federal government is our \n     nation's largest consumer of goods and services, our largest \n     employer, and the single largest source of financial support \n     for state and local governments and for private social \n     services. Several hundred thousand public servants are at \n     home without pay. The longer the shutdown continues, the more \n     people and communities' economic security will be damaged. \n     Ultimately, our economy could be driven back into a \n     recession.\n       As we often have in our history, our country benefits from \n     strong differences of opinion on many important issues \n     affecting both federal legislation and the federal \n     government. We believe it is important that we turn to the \n     normal processes our government has for resolving these \n     issues. We cannot afford to have either our government closed \n     or our nation's creditworthiness called into question as part \n     of the way we resolve these important issues.\n       Our three disparate sectors share a common view--no one \n     benefits from the current shutdown and everyone will be \n     harmed if the government defaults. It is in the interest of \n     our nation that Congress restore the normal functioning of \n     our political process, fund the government immediately and \n     quickly move to resolve the impasse over the debt ceiling \n     limit. We urge all of our leaders in Washington to set aside \n     the many issues we disagree about, reach across the aisle and \n     end the shutdown and the threat of a national default.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas J. Donohue,\n       President and CEO, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n     Richard L. Trumka,\n       President, AFL-CIO.\n     Stacey D. Stewart,\n       U.S. President, United Way Worldwide.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The word's ``fiscal responsibility'' have echoed in this \nChamber time after time and they have been put forward in defense of a \nseries of strategies this year that can only be described as incredibly \nirresponsible.\n  Let's turn the clock back 6 months. We tried to convene a budget \nconference committee with the House and it was blocked. The budget \nconference committee was not blocked with the argument of fiscal \nresponsibility. Yet there was a blockade of putting together a budget \nso we could have a smart plan to go forward and a foundation for the \nappropriations bills.\n  Then colleagues across the aisle blocked the appropriations process. \nThey argued it was fiscally responsible to do so. But that meant \nkeeping programs that are not working and continuing them rather than \nreplacing them with better plans. So that, too, was irresponsible.\n  Then we had folks argue it would be fiscally responsible if we shut \ndown the government. But this is costing America. This is decreasing \nrevenue. This is increasing expenses and it is increasing the deficit. \nTherefore, we have imposed by this group who argues in the name of \nfiscal responsibility that we have a tax across America, the government \nshutdown tax imposed on families across the land. If that was not \nenough, not enough to block the budget process, not enough to block the \nappropriations process, not enough to shut down the government, now we \nhave a group wanting to go even further. They have their grand default \nstrategy. They want the United States to default and they argue this \nwill do us well fiscally.\n  They could not be more wrong. In the Banking Committee we had a \nseries of experts come in and we asked the question, What will happen \nif we default? Just simple examples were given. For example, the \ninterest rate will go up on mortgages. A 1-percent increase on a \nmortgage means for a family buying a 200,000 house, about $120 more a \nmonth. That is the shutdown and the default tax that colleagues are \nimposing on families across America.\n  It doesn't stop there. Everything based on interest rates goes up. \nEverything based on income from economic activity goes down. Expenses \nof safety net programs go up; in other words, the deficit goes up and \nthe debt goes up.\n  Let's stop this irresponsibility of blocking the budget process, \nblocking the appropriations process, shutting down the government, and \nimposing a default tax on families across this land. It is not only \nincredibly wrongheaded, it is doing great damage to families in every \ncounty, in every State across the United States of America. At this \nmoment in this vote we are about to have, let's end this attack on the \nAmerican families. Let's end this irresponsibility.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 53, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, was I originally recorded as ``yes''?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The record should reflect that I have changed that to \n``no.''\n  Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by which \ncloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to S. 1569.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be \npermitted to speak now during our morning hour business for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have just been told by my able assistant here that we are \nstill on the motion to proceed. So we are not in morning business.\n  Now, Mr. President, just a quick announcement: Democrats will caucus \nin the Mansfield Room forthwith, right now.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate for everyone--this has \nbeen cleared with Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REID. Following the remarks of Senator Landrieu and Senator \nJohanns, I would ask that--well, I will say that the Senate will stand \nin recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the Members of the Senate are \ngoing to be retiring to caucuses to try to figure out how we are going \nto move forward, and I am confident, with the good work of the people \nin this Chamber, we will find a way.\n  Senator Johanns and I have been working, along with many of our \ncolleagues, to try to come to some resolution about funding a city in \nthe United States, the District of Columbia, that is not an agency of \nthe Federal Government that happens to be the city that the seat of \ngovernment sits in.\n  While I am not going to ask for consent now, I want to, through the \nChair, ask Senator Johanns to express, if he could, a few views about \nthis, as we try to work our way forward for sometime maybe later this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the good working \nrelationship with Senator Landrieu. We have been talking back and \nforth. We exchanged phone calls through the evening--never quite did \nconnect--but we have been talking here today. It is our desire to find \na solution to this issue.\n  We understand that what the District of Columbia is asking for is the \nsimple ability to use its funding. We are talking and working, and I am \noptimistic we are going to find a solution.\n  I would also say, as a former mayor, I can only understand the \nsleepless nights the mayor is going through. So both of us want to try \nto solve this issue, and I think the Senate does.\n  What I would like to do is continue our conversations over the next \nhour or so. They have been fruitful, and I think we are working our way \ntoward a solution.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am opposed to S. 1569. Our \nnational debt is nearly $17 trillion and has nearly doubled since the \nbeginning of the Obama administration. If we allow the Nation to \ncontinue on its current path, it will only lead to economic \ndestruction. Raising the debt ceiling without any strings attached \nwould be irresponsible and reckless.\n  The President has already increased the debt limit five times since \ncoming to office. The first occurred just a month after President Obama \ntook office. At $789 billion, the increase was provided to pay for his \nmassive, unsuccessful stimulus package. With supermajorities in the \nHouse and the Senate, the President was able to push nearly everything \nhe wanted into law.\n  Because the stimulus package ended up being more expensive than \nexpected, the President got another increase of $290 billion just 10 \nmonths later. Then, just 2 months after that, the President pushed \nanother increase through, this time for $1.9 trillion. Thirteen months \ninto his Presidency, President Obama had already increased the debt \nlimit by nearly $3 trillion.\n  Then, following the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans in Congress \nwelcomed reinforcements, which changed the dynamic. With control of the \nHouse and an increased margin in the Senate, Republicans were able to \nforce spending cut concessions from the President before agreeing to \nany debt limit increase.\n  In August 2010, after nearly exceeding the debt limit, the President \nagreed to increase the debt limit by $2.1 trillion in exchange for $2.1 \ntrillion in spending cuts, including what has become known as \nsequestration. While I supported the total reduction in spending \nenacted by the bill, I voted against it because I believe the cuts \nshould have been allocated in a different way. In total, nearly $1 \ntrillion was cut from national security spending, which is having a \nvery real, hollowing effect on our ability to protect the Nation. \nFurther, these cuts did not include anything from mandatory entitlement \nprograms like food stamps, and too little of it came from other \ndomestic programs that are better suited for the States to run.\n  Earlier this year, the President demanded another debt limit \nincrease. He received it, but only after agreeing to force Senate \nDemocrats to consider a budget, which until this year had never been \ndone during the Obama administration. This bill also suspended \nCongressional pay until a budget was agreed to. I oppose this bill \nbecause I do not believe that simply passing a budget was enough. Real \nspending cuts with real reforms to our permanent programs are needed.\n  Today we find ourselves in the same situation, and my position has \nnot changed. Spending is continuing to spiral out of control, and if we \ndo nothing to rein it in, our national debt will skyrocket to $25 \ntrillion in the next decade. Even the President agrees with those \nnumbers. We cannot allow this to happen, which is why I oppose S. \n1569.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/12/senate-section/article/S7426-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7426-S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. I understand that we are in session for \nSenators to speak for up to 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, we are here on Saturday, and we just had a very \nsignificant vote in the Senate. The vote was on whether we would move \nto a bill, fully debatable, to raise the debt ceiling without any \nstrings attached.\n  The Republicans, en bloc, voted against that. As a result--since we \nneed 60 votes to bring a bill to the floor--the vote was 53 to 45. \nThere should be no mistake in anyone's mind. This was a very clear \nvote, simply to move to a bill, fully debatable, amendable even, but \nthe Republicans would not even vote to go to that bill today.\n  Quite frankly, I must admit that when I was driving in to the Senate, \nI was thinking about this. I thought what we will do is that we will \nget on the bill. Obviously they will vote for cloture to proceed to the \nbill, and then we will get on the bill. I was wondering to myself how \nlong we will have to be on the bill, what kinds of amendments would be \noffered, and then would we have to file cloture on that bill also.\n  I was quite surprised to see every Republican vote against even going \nto the bill. It begs credulity. I am incredulous at this, especially \nwith the markets opening in Asia later tomorrow, on Sunday. How are \nthey going to read this? I think if we had voted to at least move to \nthe bill and debated it, they would have stabilized somewhat because \nthey would say at least they are willing to talk about it. Now they can \nlook at the bill and say simply, Republicans are not going to discuss \nthis.\n  It is shocking that this would have transpired today at this last \nminute. No one gave up anything in the bill. It was simply to move to \nthe bill, and the Republicans said no.\n  We have been closed for 2 weeks. I have come to the floor several \ntimes, as I know others have, to talk about this irresponsible and \ndangerous episode in our Nation's history. I understand that different \ngroups are coming together trying to float some kind of an idea.\n  I hope something comes of it. I truly hope cooler heads will prevail \nand we will reach some agreement that will allow the government to \nreopen, allow the debt ceiling to be extended with no strings attached \nfor at least 1 year or more--at least to get us through the next \nelections of 2014--and then we ought to go to negotiations.\n  Our Budget Committee passed a budget. The House passed its budget. \nThey should meet and try to work it out in conference. Our \nAppropriations Committee passed our bills. The House hasn't passed all \nof them. Then we could go to work and work these things out in the next \n6 weeks, up to December 1. I hope that works and we get that kind of a \ncompromise, but I do not want to see some kind of compromise which says \nto one side or the other that you have to do this or you have to do \nthat.\n  It should be open. Our Budget Committee is under the able guidance \nand direction of Senator Murray of Washington. I am not a member of the \nBudget Committee, but they ought to go to conference without any \nstrings attached or some artificial levels put in. They ought to take \nwhat we passed as the budget, as the House did.\n  What is happening is that--and it is getting worse every day, another \nweek, another 2 weeks--it is unfathomable how many more people are \ngoing to be hurt.\n  A lot of Americans may think sequestration wasn't a big deal or that \nclosing the government wasn't. I saw a piece in the paper where some \ntea party people were meeting. What came through is they weren't being \ndirectly hit or hurt by the government shutdown.\n  One respondent was quoted in the paper as saying: We need to go back \nto the late 1800s, the way this country ran then, where everybody grew \ntheir own vegetables.\n  I would say to that person: If you want to grow your own vegetables, \nyou can grow your own vegetables. If you want to live somewhere without \nelectricity, air conditioning, with no health care, and never go to the \ndoctor, you should be able to do that. But why should you make the rest \nof the country go back to the 1800s?\n  This is what a handful of people are trying to do. They can't do it \nlegislatively, they can't do it through the courts, they can't do it \npolitically, and they can't win elections on that basis. So they are \ntrying to do it by holding a gun to our heads, keeping the government \nclosed, and threatening to default on the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States.\n  I wish to say in the few minutes I have remaining what another \nyearlong sequester would mean in human terms. These are things that \ncome under the jurisdiction of my Appropriations Committee, which I \nhave been privileged to chair or where I have been the ranking member \nsince 1989. We have never had these kinds of problems before--\nRepublicans or Democrats--when Republicans ran it or Democrats. I have \nbeen back and forth on this many times, in terms of Republicans \nchairing it--Democrats, Republicans, Democrats. We have never had these \nkinds of problems.\n  If we go 1 more year under sequester, that means 177,000 fewer \nchildren will get Head Start services--177,000--and 1.3 million fewer \nstudents will receive Title I education assistance. What is Title I? \nThis goes to the poorest kids, the poorest families, the poorest areas. \nSo 1.3 million low-income kids won't be helped.\n  Oh, our kids will be fine, kids from the middle class, the upper \nclass, and of Senators and Congressman. They have money. I am talking \nabout the poor kids, and there are 1.3 million.\n  There are 760,000 fewer households that would receive less heating \nand cooling assistance under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, and mostly they are elderly poor people.\n  There will be 9,000 fewer special education staff in the classroom. \nIn other words, under IDEA we provide money for special education \nteachers and support staff for special education students, and 9,000 \nwill be cut.\n  There will be $291 million less for childcare subsidies for working \nfamilies, for people who need childcare subsidies. They are low income, \nthey are going to work every day, but they need some childcare help--\n$291 million cut away from that. How many will not be able to go to \nwork or what will they do with those children? Will they put them in \nsubstandard childcare facilities?\n  One thing that is mind-boggling is we have a program in Medicare that \ngoes after fraud, waste, and abuse. We know from the past that for \nevery dollar that we put into that, we actually recover $7.90. I don't \nmean something phony. I mean we actually bring back $7.90 for every $1 \ndollar we put into it.\n  Because of the cut under sequester that means in the next year there \nwill be $2.7 billion that we will not recover. By reducing the number \nof people in the fraud, waste and abuse section, that means it opens \nthe door to fraud. People say: Oh, they are not there. They are not \nchecking, right?\n  People say: Well, now we are going to give them flexibility under \nsequester. But there is no flexibility. That has to be cut.\n  Another yearlong continuing resolution under sequester means $2 \nbillion less for the National Institutes of Health, which means 1,300 \nfewer research grants.\n  Again, I would say that people say: Well, we will give flexibility. \nMy colleague on the other side says: We will have sequester, but we \nwill leave flexibility to the departments.\n  Let's see how that goes.\n  The funds for the Administration for Children and Families--what \nwould they do? Would they preserve Head Start slots by cutting \nchildcare subsidies?\n  At NIH, would you preserve cancer research by cutting Alzheimer's \nresearch? These are terrible choices. Flexibility does not answer these \nquestions. It is not the answer.\n  When they talk about flexibility, I know what is on their mind--\nmilitary spending. Everybody likes to talk about the sequester and the \nlevel of sequester. Do you know what the House did? A sequester says it \nis 50/50, 50 percent cut from defense, 50 percent from\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\nnondefense discretionary. What the House did in the Ryan budget was to \nleave things whole and take it out of things like Head Start, IDEA, \nspecial education, and programs such as that. They took it out of \nthere, but they left defense whole. That is not at all what was in \nsequester.\n  In my area of Health and Human Services, education, labor, Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, NIH, next year we would cut about \n$34 billion. People will say, I don't know what that means. As I said, \nit is how many more children will not be in Head Start, how many more \nfamilies will not get childcare subsidies, how many more research \ngrants will not be funded by the NIH. We will not have our Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention epidemiologists out in the field \nwatching for food outbreaks, food-borne illnesses, et cetera.\n  It is a disaster if we continue with the yearlong sequester and a \ncontinuing resolution. That is why we need a short-term one, so our \ncommittees can go to work. Perhaps cooler heads will prevail, and we \ncan get a better budget for next year before the end of the year. To \nme, this is the way to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I commend the words of our chairman, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa, for his warnings about the impact of sequestration and the \nacross-the-board indiscriminate cuts. We are grateful for that because \nwe need to be thinking about what happens down the road when we have a \nbudget agreement.\n  I want to start today with a brief comment on what happened earlier. \nAt about noontime we had a vote, which is a procedural vote which I was \nhoping would go in a certain direction, but it didn't. It was a vote to \nmove forward on the question of how we are going to avoid default. I \ndon't think it is the last word on this issue for the next few days, \nbut I was hoping that the Republicans would at least allow a debate on \nhow we can avoid default. So far that hasn't happened, but we are \nconfident that in the next couple of days we will resolve this. But I \ndo think it is important we lay a foundation for why we need to avoid \ndefault, because we have talked a lot about the consequences and the \nimpact of a government shutdown--and that remains what might be called \na clear and present danger to the middle class and to our economy--but \nwe have to talk at the same time about the consequences of default \nbecause we are only days away from the deadline.\n\n  Maybe the best way to start is not with numbers but with part of a \nletter I received from a constituent this week. The letter was dated \nOctober 8, so my assumption is that most of what is contained in this \nletter are fears about and the impacts from the shutdown only. The \nsentiments expressed in this letter will only grow in significance and \nseverity as we get closer to the deadline and closer to default. I am \nreading just in pertinent part. This particular constituent is from \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, about an hour from where I live, but in the \nsame basic region. She talked about her own circumstances and that of \nher husband and then she continued on:\n\n       Besides our personal difficulties due to the budget \n     impasse, my elderly parents live with the worry of when and \n     if they will receive their Social Security checks. At 85 and \n     83 they should not have this uncertainty. These should be \n     their golden years. It breaks my heart to hear my mother say \n     she can't sleep and has a stomachache from the worry about \n     where our country is headed. Middle- and low-income families \n     cannot afford another economic downturn. We are just barely \n     recovering from the last one.\n\n  That is what she says about her parents. Now, again, it is my \nassumption the worry and the anxiety expressed in that paragraph are \nsolely attributable to the government shutdown. Those worries and \nanxieties, and, frankly, real pain, the physical pain expressed in that \nparagraph about her mother, will only grow the closer we get to \ndefault, because we know the consequences of default are almost \nunimaginable--about the worst economic hit we could take as a country. \nSo that is why we have to take every step necessary to avoid it.\n  But I think the words of a constituent from Pennsylvania speak in \nthis case for the Nation. Why should people have a worry, even if that \nworry is unfounded? We know Social Security checks are going out now, \nthankfully, but they are slowed down substantially if there is a \ndefault. We know even in a shutdown, if you reach the age of 65, it is \ngoing to take you a while to get the checks you are entitled to because \nthe process of validating your eligibility is held up. But why should \nthere be uncertainty? Why should any mother or father or grandmother or \ngrandfather have an anxiety and a worry that leads them to have a \nstomachache, in the case of this letter, or where they can't sleep \nbecause of the political agenda of one part of one political party in \none House of Congress?\n  So that is where things are with people's feelings and their \nanxieties, and we have to be able to respond to that.\n  The default question itself is of great significance now. Maybe 10 \ndays ago it wasn't, but I am afraid we are in a period now where just \nthe talk of default, just getting close to default, will have an \nadverse impact on our economy. This did happen in 2011. That is \nirrefutable. All the data, all the facts, show just getting close to \ndefault has an adverse impact on the economy. By one estimate, a recent \nestimate, that was almost a $20 billion hit to the economy, if you \nmeasure it over 10 years. There are all kinds of other consequences \nthat I won't dwell on right now.\n  There were two statements made by Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew \nin his opening statement to the Finance Committee on Thursday morning \nthat I think we should be reminded of. This was in reference to the \nquestion, what if you go over the line in default and you have to \ndecide which bills to pay, which is the wrong way to go, but Secretary \nLew posited these two questions.\n\n       How can the United States choose whether to send Social \n     Security checks to seniors or pay benefits to our veterans?\n\n  That is question No. 1. Question No. 2.\n\n       How can the United States choose whether to provide \n     children with food assistance or meet our obligations to \n     Medicare providers?\n\n  These are the kinds of questions we are all going to have to answer \nif we--as some people apparently want us to do--go over the default \nline for the first time in American history. To say it is fiscal \nmadness doesn't begin to describe it.\n  Secretary Lew also said something else which we should contemplate \ntoday. He said:\n\n       It is irresponsible and reckless to insist that we \n     experience a forced default to learn how bad it is.\n\n  We have heard talk in this body and in the other body about maybe we \ncan survive if we go over the line; that maybe it is okay, maybe we can \nprioritize payments. I think we should be reminded of those words. \nAgain, that quote:\n\n       . . . to insist that we experience a forced default to \n     learn how bad it is.\n\n  It makes no sense and, fortunately, there is a consensus against it, \nbut we still have work to do to prevent it from happening.\n  I will read as well a couple of lines from a letter I received from a \nfriend of mine who has spent a lot more years in the financial markets \nand has spent a lot of years trying to get both parties in Washington \nto come together fiscally. I will read some lines from this memo he \nsent me. He was talking about what happens with default. It is like \nanything else--if you default on your mortgage, if you default in your \npersonal life, you have a credit problem. He said:\n\n       From the standpoint of our creditworthiness, a default is a \n     default. Once you have defaulted, you are a--\n\n  And I will leave the word out he put in there because it may not be \nappropriate for this Chamber, but I think people can figure out what \nthe word might be here.--\n\n     And everyone fears they will be the next party not to be \n     paid. As in the Lehman bankruptcy--\n\n  And here he is talking about the fall of 2008.\n\n     the potential for unintended consequences that spiral out of \n     control is enormous. In short, toying with default is not \n     akin to playing with fire but is more like handling financial \n     weapons of mass destruction. It is a violation of the trust \n     we place in our elected leaders to safeguard the welfare of \n     our country.\n\n  That is what this person, who I know has a lot of experience in the \nmarkets, describes could happen in the event of default.\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\n  I will conclude with some quick references to the impact of default \nas described by economists, as described by experts in the field of \nmeasuring the impact of default, and folks who know a lot about what \nwould happen. I will read them as quickly as I can, because we know \nsome of these already but we have to remind ourselves: Increasing \nborrowing costs. Many have talked and written about that. Damaging \neconomic growth. Higher interest rates. Higher debt payments. Slow \neconomic growth.\n  One expert was talking about the Lehman bankruptcy and then putting \nthat in the context of a default, and making the case that a default \nhas a much bigger impact than even the Lehman bankruptcy had.\n  Consider this: In 2008, the Lehman bankruptcy was an ``event that \ntriggered the financial crisis that caused the stock market to lose \nhalf its value over just 5 months and helped to trigger the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression.''\n  That was just the Lehman bankruptcy. Imagine in the context of \ndefault how much worse it could be.\n  Retirement savings. According to newer data, an equivalent hit could \ncost--comparing it to what happened in 2011--the average person in his \nor her fifties, who has been saving for 20 or 30 years, as much as \n$11,000.\n  Mortgage payments would be hiked. After the 2011 shutdown, mortgage \nspreads jumped by 70 basis points, which would have added $100 per \nmonth to the cost of a typical mortgage.\n  So we have data from 2011 that measures the adverse impact on \nmortgages just by getting close to default, not in the event of default \nitself.\n  Disrupted payments. Delayed or disrupted payments would prevent 57\\1/\n2\\ million Americans from receiving Social Security benefits in a \ntimely manner and interfere with payments to 3.4 million veterans.\n  I will read two more. Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi, who has \ntestified in front of the Senate many times--who, parenthetically, as \nrelates to the shutdown testified yesterday over in the House, because \nthe Joint Economic Committee is a joint committee--predicts that, just \nas it relates to the shutdown, in this fourth quarter, the fourth \nquarter we are in, we will have lost \\1/2\\ point of growth. So instead \nof the GDP growth in the fourth quarter being 2\\1/2\\ percent, as Mark \nZandi would have projected absent a shutdown, with the shutdown we will \ngo from 2\\1/2\\ percent growth to 2 percent. That is a shutdown in one \nquarter. Just imagine the impact on growth if we default.\n  Here is what Mark Zandi says. I am quoting him directly:\n\n       It would be devastating to the economy. Confidence will \n     evaporate, consumer confidence will sharply decline, \n     businesses will stop hiring, consumers will stop spending, \n     the stock market will fall significantly in value, borrowing \n     costs for businesses and households will rise.\n\n  And he goes on from there. But, look, you don't have to be an \neconomist to know the impact of default. All you have to do is read \nwhat economists are saying across the board. These are people who \ndisagree on a lot of things. They might disagree on a budget item. They \nmight disagree on econometric modeling. They might disagree on tax \ncuts. They might disagree on a usual Democrat versus Republican \napproach to the economy. They might have fundamental disagreements on \neverything, but on this they are speaking with one voice: Don't \ndefault, they are telling us. Don't even get close to defaulting. Don't \neven talk about or debate defaulting. Just prevent it from happening. \nThat is the overwhelming consensus.\n  Let me conclude with one reference here. When I got to the Senate, \none of the leading Republican voices on the budget--because he happened \nto be the ranking member on the Budget Committee--was Judd Gregg from \nNew Hampshire. He had been a Governor of New Hampshire and then served \nin the Senate for many years. This is what he had to say recently in \ntalking about what would happen in the event of default and \nbrinkmanship with the debt limit.\n\n       [It] is the political equivalent of playing Russian \n     roulette with all of the chambers of the gun loaded. It is \n     the ultimate no-win strategy. A default would lead to some \n     level of chaos in the debt markets, which would lead to a \n     significant contraction in economic activity, which would \n     lead to job losses, which would lead to higher spending by \n     the Federal Government and lower tax revenues, which would \n     lead to more debt.\n\n  So says the former ranking member of the Budget Committee, the former \nRepublican Senator from New Hampshire. So the idea that some think for \nsome reason we could go into default or even get close to it doesn't \nmake a lot of sense.\n  I will conclude with this thought. That letter I started with from my \nconstituent in Pennsylvania, who speaks for the country, I believe, \nwhen she was talking about her parents--her 82- or 83-year-old \nparents--and about the uncertainty they have, about the worry and the \nanxiety that is literally causing, in the case of her mother, according \nto this letter, physical pain, but even if it didn't rise to that \nlevel, just the idea of a government shutdown coupled with the \npotential default is causing that kind of anxiety and is really \ndisturbing, and I think it is an insult to so many Americans.\n\n  We have to come together and open the government at long last and \nmake sure we pay our bills and not even get close to defaulting, and \nthen we can have negotiations and discussions for weeks and months \nabout long-term and short-term issues. In the meantime, we have to make \nsure we pay our bills and open the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we exited the Chamber to go to our \nDemocratic caucus, I am certain my Republican colleagues and friends \nwere talking among themselves as well, trying to find a way forward.\n  A reporter stopped me and said: What do you think the Senate is going \nto do?\n  I don't know the specifics, but I am most certainly hopeful and \nremain cautiously optimistic that the Senate will step up to the job at \nhand and fulfill the promise and hopes of our Founders, who created the \nSenate to operate at times just like these where there seems to be no \nway forward, to find a way forward; where the political winds have \ngotten so bitter and cold, for the 100 of us to find a way forward to \nhelp keep our economy whole and operating and functioning well, not \njust for our Nation but for the world, which is important; to help \nsupport and bolster the recovery that is underway; to set aside the \nbitterness and the rancor and try to find a way forward.\n  I am very encouraged despite the fact that the vote was very \ndivisive--all Republicans on one side and all Democrats on the other. I \nam confident because I know Members of this body well and I have been \nhere long enough to know that the many people of good will on both \nsides of the aisle can try to find a way forward. And I know the \nPresident of the United States is open to negotiation.\n  Maybe we can find resolution within the political parties, but that \nis not what is important. What is important is finding a resolution in \nthe Senate of the United States for all of the people of the United \nStates. We do not represent narrow districts with narrow ideologies. We \nrepresent States--big ones, such as California, medium-sized ones, such \nas Louisiana, and small ones, such as Delaware. But inside of Delaware, \ninside of Louisiana, and inside of California, there are people of all \ndifferent political persuasions. As Senators, when we run for office we \nhave to listen and take all of that in and then try to make the best \ndecisions we can. It is an honor to serve in the Senate even though it \nis tough, it is hard, and it is very difficult at times.\n  I have been proud to serve here for 18 years and be among many groups \nthat have found compromise and the middle ground, that have tried to \nwork to understand where the other side is coming from and move our \ncountry forward. It has not always been perfect, and none of us are \nperfect here, but I am proud I have at least been one to say: Count on \nme to try to see what we can do to resolve the situation. I want to say \nthat today for my constituents. That is what they want me to do. That \nis what they sent me here for 18 years ago and what I know they want me \nto\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\ncontinue to do. I do feel strongly on their behalf that the government \nshould open and the 21,000 of them who have been wrongly laid off by \nthe actions of a minority--the government needs to open, and the debt \nof the United States most certainly needs to be honored so this \neconomic recovery can continue.\n  But there are plenty of things we can negotiate. The debt of the \ncountry is too high. We do need to have some earned benefit and \npotential entitlement reform--not necessarily cutting benefits from \npeople who count on them but for the government to do its part to meet \npeople halfway. There are always efficiencies that can be created if we \nwork together.\n  So on behalf of my constituents, I am very hopeful that we can find a \nway forward. I think Senator Reid has been providing extraordinary \nleadership, and hopefully we can find a way forward.\n  I would briefly mention that there have been some very good \nconversations going on about funding for the city of Washington--not a \npart of the Federal Government--which has not been resolved yet, but \nRepublicans, Democrats, and the White House are working together to \nfind a way so the District of Columbia, the city of Washington--with \nits own mayor and city council, its own budget, its own local funds--\ndoes not have to be caught up in a very tough circumstance that is not \nof their making. They are not part of the Federal Government, and \nneither is New York, Chicago, New Orleans, or Baltimore. They are \nseparate cities, and they should be treated that way. We haven't found \na way yet, but we are working on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, but I want the Record spread with the work she has done \nthat I have seen in our years together in the Senate. No one has been \nmore of an advocate for a State than the senior Senator from Louisiana. \nWhat she did after that terrible hurricane hit that area is now \nlegendary--the ability that she had to change what had been standard \nprocedures and law in this country for decades. We changed that for a \nlot of reasons. One was her advocacy. We did it because of her.\n  In fact, the Democrats in the Senate voted for things they never \nvoted for before because of the good Senator from Louisiana. It was not \ndone to help on a temporary basis but long term for the State of \nLouisiana.\n  I hope they understand what a difference one person can make. She has \nmade a difference and she has changed things forever in Louisiana \nalready. I am sure the best is yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/12/senate-section/article/S7430-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

It is the \nfirst discussions we have had here, period, during the whole pendency \nof this artificially driven government shutdown and not raising the \ndebt limit when we should.\n  I am confident Senator McConnell understands that defaulting on our \ndebt would mean millions of jobs in the United States, not thousands, \nnot hundreds of thousands but millions.
