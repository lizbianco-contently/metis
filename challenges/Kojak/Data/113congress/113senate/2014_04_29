I object to any further proceedings with respect to this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week the Senate will begin \nconsideration of an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n  Over the next few days Members of this body will come to the floor \nand make their case for or against increasing the minimum wage. Most of \nthe statements we will hear today will be in favor of it because the \nRepublicans are not anxious to come here and speak against raising the \nminimum wage. They will be very silent most of the time, and they will \nnot talk much about an increase in the minimum wage, which is so \nvitally important to our country.\n  The American people will be inundated with figures and facts \nregarding the economic impact of an increase to $10.10. Why was that \nnumber chosen? It was chosen because at that number--$10.10 for 40 \nhours--a person is no longer in poverty.\n  As supporters of this legislation, Senate Democrats have ample \nevidence to back our position that an increase in the Federal minimum \nwage is good for America. A recent study from the Economic Policy \nInstitute indicates that increasing the minimum wage and tying it to \ninflation would raise wages for 28 million American workers. That is \nabout 10 percent of the American people. Contrary to what Republicans \nwould have us believe, these 28 million Americans aren't just high \nschool kids looking to make a few bucks after school. That same \nanalysis reported that the median age of minimum wage workers is 35 \nyears old, proving that these employees are grown men and women, most \nof them with families. If we needed any more reason to pass this \nimportant legislation, the most recent polling data reveals that about \n75 percent of Americans back an increase in the minimum wage.\n  So the evidence supporting an increase in the minimum wage is ample, \nand it is there for all of us to see. However, the real issue \ntranscends political polls and studies. The heart of the minimum wage \ndebate is not found in statistics but, rather, in a question we should \nask ourselves: What kind of a country do we aspire to be?\n  This Nation is home to the greatest economy on Earth. Even as we \ncontinue to recover from the great recession, there is no question that \nwe are the richest country on the planet. Can anyone in this Chamber \ndoubt that our economy has the capability of providing livable wages to \nAmerican workers? The fact that in America there are full-time working \nmothers and fathers who must juggle two to three jobs just to provide \nfood and shelter for their children is unconscionable.\n  Before any sulking billionaire comes forward as upset and pens an op-\ned in some newspaper calling me a collectivist, as they have done, let \nme be clear: This is a question of fairness. Do\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\nwe believe it is fair that fellow Americans who work full time be paid \nless than a livable wage? I hope not. Or do we value all American \nworkers and reward them with, at the very least, a baseline wage that \nenables them to provide for their families?\n  There was a recent story in Nevada about a young man named Dalven who \nworks at McDonald's. He works hard, but his wages are so low he is \nforced to get another job. Working two jobs, what is this young man \ngoing to do? Is he going to go to college? Of course not. Is he going \nto go to trade school? Of course not. He is too busy working. What is \ngoing to happen to him to better his life?\n  Just a few months ago an incredibly successful businessman visited \nCapitol Hill. He said he put himself through college attending Harvard, \nand he did that being paid $2 an hour, which was the minimum wage at \nthe time. He now is an elderly, very successful businessman. He worked \nfull-time over the course of the year and was able to pay Harvard's \ntuition. The tuition at that time was $2,400 a year--which was a lot--\nat one of America's premier schools. Jim even claims he had money left \nover after paying his college fees. Jim's daughter is now preparing to \nenroll at Harvard. If she were to be employed at today's minimum wage, \nshe would need to work full time for 4 years to afford even one year of \ntuition and room and board at Harvard. The young man at McDonald's I \njust talked about, Dalven, could never dream of putting himself through \nHarvard or UNLV or any other place because he is working two jobs and \ncannot do it.\n  Simply put, it is not fair that working families are being stripped \nof the American dream. That is what Dalven has, as does everybody else, \nand as did the Presiding Officer and as did I--the dream to better \noneself, to maybe even be better than what their family was able to be.\n  So, again, put simply, is it fair that working men and women are \nbeing stripped of the American dream because we refuse to pay them a \nlivable wage? They are working hard. That is why this legislation \nbefore us is so critical.\n  An increase in the minimum wage obviously won't make a millionaire of \nanyone, but it will ensure that each full time working American \nreceives a wage they can live on and that will give them a fighting \nchance to get ahead in the economy. Every hard-working American should \nhave the opportunity to put a roof over their head and that of their \nfamily, and every full-time employee should have a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream.\n  So I invite my Republican colleagues to consider what is fair for \ntheir constituents and to work with us to increase the Federal minimum \nwage, as 75 percent of the American people think we should do. They \nshould join in giving every American a fair shot to provide for their \nfamilies.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Condolences to Tornado Victims\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to offer \ncondolences to those affected by this week's storms. Tornadoes struck a \nterrible blow in several towns, and we are thinking today of all of \nthose who were killed and injured and their friends and families as \nwell.\n\n\n                                  Jobs\n\n  Mr. President, the American people want Congress to focus on one \nthing above all else: Jobs. Jobs. One would think the Democrats who \ncontrol the Senate would want to help us advance bipartisan ideas to \nboost job creation. One would think they would actually work with us to \naddress the concerns and anxieties of our constituents. But, instead, \nSenate Democrats are pushing legislation this week that would actually \ncost--not create but actually cost--up to a million American jobs.\n  This is completely tone deaf. Their bill would cost up to 17,000 jobs \nin Kentucky alone. Apparently, this is what Senate Democrats have made \ntheir top priority. It is not much of a surprise, though. As I have \nsaid many times, Washington Democrats often seem to hurt the very \npeople they claim to be fighting for. When it comes to so many of their \nproposals, Washington Democrats appear to prioritize the desires of the \nfar left over the needs of the middle class. Let's be honest. The \ninterests of the far left and the interests of the middle class seem to \nbe in fierce opposition these days.\n  Take the Keystone Pipeline, for example. The Obama administration \nrecently announced yet another punt on this critical jobs project--one \nthat would lead to the creation of thousands--literally thousands--of \ngood jobs. Why? Because of pressure from the far left. One union leader \ncalled the administration's decision ``a cold, hard slap in the face \nfor hard-working Americans.'' Another labor leader, whose union \nendorsed the President twice, put it this way: ``No one seriously \nbelieves that the administration's nearly-dark-of-night announcement . \n. . was anything but politically motivated. It represented,'' he said, \n``another low blow to the working men and women of our country for whom \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline is a lifeline to good jobs and to energy \nsecurity. . . . ''\n  Here is a project the government has been studying for 5 or 6 years \nnow. For 5 or 6 years they have been studying this project.\n  Americans have learned that building Keystone would produce \nsignificant economic benefit for our country, that it would lower \nenergy prices, and that it would lead to the creation of thousands of \njobs at a time when we need them more than ever. President Obama's own \nadministration has concluded that approving Keystone would not \nsignificantly impact net carbon emissions anyway. Approving the project \nwouldn't have an adverse impact on carbon emissions.\n  So one would think Washington Democrats would join the large majority \nof Americans who say Keystone is a good deal for our country. One would \nthink they would jump at the chance to advance sound policy that has \nalready been thoroughly vetted. But, then, we would be missing the \npoint because Democrats' opposition to Keystone isn't really about \npolicy at all. They basically surrendered the policy argument a long \ntime ago. That is not really what this is about for them. Remember: \nThis is the same party that effectively conceded its agenda for the \nrest of this year was drafted by campaign staffers. The whole agenda \nfor the rest of the year was drafted by campaign staffers. They said \nthat.\n  So for them this is more about politics and symbolism, and the far \nleft has apparently decided that killing Keystone is the symbolic scalp \nthey want. In fact, they are demanding it. Washington Democrats seem \nperfectly willing to go along.\n  Of course, the big loser in all of this is the American middle \nclass--the moms and dads and sisters and brothers whose primary concern \nis paying the bills and putting food on the table. These are the people \nwho have had it worse in the Obama economy--the very people Washington \nDemocrats should be doing literally everything to help.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues today is it is not too late. They \ncan still work with Republicans to create more opportunity and to help \nus rebuild the middle class, but to do so they need to abandon the left \nand start focusing on the middle class for a change. If they are ready \nto get serious about job creation, then there are some easy ways to \ndemonstrate that to the American people. For starters, they can stop \npushing legislation that would cut rather than create jobs, and they \ncan stop blocking projects such as Keystone--a project that almost \neveryone knows will create jobs. Americans want jobs, not symbolism. So \nstart working with us to give the American people the kind of pro-jobs \npolicies they want and deserve.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            LANDMINE SCOURGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken several times in the past few \nweeks--and I have spoken many times in the past 20 years--about the \nscourge of landmines.\n  They are inherently indiscriminate weapons. They are triggered by the \nvictim, and usually the victim is an innocent civilian who is either \nkilled or horribly maimed.\n  The United States has not exported, produced, or used antipersonnel \nmines for more than 20 years. But notwithstanding that--even though 161 \nnations have joined the international treaty banning them--one nation \nstands out for not having joined the treaty. That is the United States, \nand it is a shame on this country.\n  As the world's only superpower with by far the most powerful \nmilitary, one would have thought the United States would set an example \nof moral leadership. Instead, we are among those who are preventing the \nuniversality of the treaty.\n  This is doubly disappointing, considering that it was President \nClinton who, 20 years ago, called for the elimination of antipersonnel \nmines. Two years later, in 1996--back in the last century--he said: \n``Today I am launching an international effort to ban anti-personnel \nlandmines.'' But his administration did not sign the treaty.\n  Then we had the Bush administration. They did nothing on the issue.\n  Now we have the Obama administration. Nothing has changed. The Obama \nadministration is following the Bush administration's policy of doing \nnothing. So we are still waiting.\n  Last week I was in Vietnam, along with Senators Shelby and Crapo and \nRepresentatives Cooper from Tennessee and Welch from Vermont. We had \nconversations with President Sang, with the Minister of Defense, and \nother Vietnamese officials. But we also met with nongovernmental \norganizations--many of them Americans--that work to locate and clear \nlandmines and other unexploded ordnance.\n  It is costly, dangerous work. They have been doing it for decades. At \nthe current rate, when you consider that millions of landmines and \nbombs were dropped in Vietnam during the war, it is estimated that it \nwill take another 100 years before it is safe to walk in that country \nwithout fear of triggering a deadly explosion.\n  I have met countless people in Vietnam who have been crippled and \ndisfigured by landmines. Many of them are children the age of my \ngrandchildren. Here is a photograph of two Vietnamese men I met last \nweek. You can see what landmines do. My wife Marcelle and I were deeply \ntouched when we spoke with them. After all the pain and hardship they \nhave suffered, they were thanking us for helping to get them \nwheelchairs.\n  Their lives have been changed terribly forever, yet they are lucky \nbecause they survived. They lost their legs, their arms, but thankfully \nthey are not among the tens of thousands who died from landmines during \nthat war and in the decades since the war ended.\n  In Vietnam, we have used the Leahy War Victims Fund to provide \nmedical care and rehabilitation to thousands of mine victims.\n  As a Democrat, I want to compliment a Republican President, George \nH.W. Bush, who worked with me and with the inspired founder of the \nVietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Bobby Muller, to start using \nthe Leahy War Victims Fund in Vietnam.\n  We have spent many millions of dollars to help get rid of the mines. \nAs I said earlier, 40 years after the war, there are still vast areas \nof Vietnam littered with unexploded mines and bombs.\n  Yet Vietnam is only one of dozens of countries whose people have been \nterrorized by landmines--some from our country, some from others.\n  When you talk to the Department of Defense about this, they say their \nmines are ``smart'' because they are designed to deactivate after a \nfinite period of time. Of course, that is better than mines that remain \nactive for years. But if a child steps on one before the time they are \ndeactivated, that child does not know whether this is a smart mine or a \ndumb mine because as long as they are active, they are no better at \ndistinguishing between a child and a soldier.\n  I remember the young woman I met in a hospital after the Bosnia war. \nShe was sent away by her parents to be safe during that conflict. But \nwhen the war ended she was running down the road to greet her parents \nand had both legs blown off. The war was over, but it never ended for \nher.\n  I have never argued that mines have no military utility. Every weapon \ndoes. So does poison gas, so do IEDs. But we would not use them, and we \nconsider it immoral for other people to use them. They are the \nantithesis of a precision weapon. They do not belong in the arsenal of \ncivilized countries, least of all in the United States. The United \nStates ought to have courage enough to sign the landmine treaty.\n  You have to wonder, if Pennsylvania or Oklahoma or Utah or Georgia or \nVermont or New Jersey or any of our 50 States were littered with \nlandmines, killing and maiming innocent Americans, would we tolerate \nit? Of course not. We would not make excuses about needing to use these \nweapons. The outcry would be deafening and the United States would join \nthe treaty, as we should have 15 years ago.\n  Some might ask why this matters. The United States has not used mines \nfor two decades, even while we fought two long land wars. That is \nbecause the political price of using them--particularly in Afghanistan \nwhere more innocent civilians have been killed or injured from \nlandmines than perhaps anywhere else--would have been prohibitive.\n  It matters because, like any other issue, even when the United States \nis not part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution. We \nought to set an example on this. We ought to be strong enough to do \nwhat 161 other countries have done and join the treaty.\n  I have spoken to President Obama about this. I know he shares my \nconcern about the toll of innocent lives from landmines. As a Senator, \nhe cosponsored my legislation. So did Secretary Hagel.\n  This is an unfinished job. It began with President Clinton. It is \ntime to put the United States on a path to join the treaty. Only the \nCommander in Chief can do that. The world cries out to him to show that \nkind of moral leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2429-S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, events in Egypt continue to concern people \nof good will in this country and across the globe, who have shared the \nEgyptian people's yearning for greater freedom under the rule of law.\n  I am the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the \nState Department and foreign operations.\n  But even if I were not chairman of that subcommittee, I would have \nbeen watching the situation in Egypt with great interest and growing \ndismay, where hundreds of people are sentenced to death after a sham \ntrial lasting barely an hour. It is appalling to see this flouting of \nhuman rights and abuse of the justice system, which are fundamental to \nany democracy. Nobody--nobody--can justify this. It does not show a \ncommitment to democracy. It shows a dictatorship run amok. It is an \negregious violation of human rights.\n  So I am not prepared to sign off on the delivery of additional aid \nfor the Egyptian military. I am not prepared to do that until we see \nconvincing evidence the government is committed to the rule of law.\n  We cannot stand here and say: We are troubled by hundreds of people \nbeing sentenced to death after a few minutes in a mass trial, but since \nwe have been friends for so long we will go ahead and send you hundreds \nof millions of dollars in aid. No.\n  I do not think the taxpayers of this country would condone that, and \nneither do I.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments on the \nSenate floor. We are working our way through a number of confirmations \nrelating to Federal district judges across the country. One of them is \nthe potential Federal district judge for my State of Kansas. I rise to \nspeak in support of one of those individuals who will be considered by \nthe Senate this week, Daniel Crabtree. He was nominated by the \nPresident to be a U.S. district court judge for the District of Kansas.\n  I want to attest to my colleagues my view that he is a gentleman who \nshould be confirmed by the Senate. He was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee without opposition and is rated unanimously ``well \nqualified'' by the American Bar Association, which, in part, confirms \nmy view that he would make an outstanding Federal judge.\n  I actually have known this individual for more than 30 years, dating \nback to our days at the University of Kansas School of Law, where he \nwas 1 year ahead of me in law school. I have followed his personal and \nprofessional development since that time. We have remained acquainted, \nwe have been friends, and for a short period of time we practiced law \nat the same firm in downtown Kansas City. He is worthy of our support \ntoday, but he is also someone who has my respect and admiration.\n  After graduating from the University of Kansas School of Law, Dan \nCrabtree became an associate and ultimately became a partner at the \ndowntown Kansas City law firm then called Stinson, Mag & Fizzell. He \nbecame a partner in 1988. The firm merged into a firm called Stinson \nMorrison Hecker in 2002.\n  He is a litigator with extensive experience in the Federal and State \ncourts, and he received recognition by the publication ``Best Lawyers'' \nin Kansas City as the Antitrust Lawyer of the Year in 2013. In 2014 he \nwas the Kansas City Banking and Finance Litigation Lawyer of the Year. \nAgain, this is outside confirmation of his qualifications and \ncapabilities.\n  Dan is a lifelong resident of our State. He grew up in Kansas City, \nKS, the suburbs of Kansas City, MO, on the Kansas side of the line. He \nand his wife Maureen and their teenager daughter continue to live in \nKansas City, KS, today.\n  I have often spoken on the Senate floor about the special way of life \nwe have in our State, and Dan Crabtree, in his hometown of Kansas City, \nKS, exemplifies what I so often admire, respect, and speak of on the \nSenate floor about his humility, his devotion to others, his \nrelationship with his community, and how important it is to him to be \nan active member in trying to make life better for other people, those \nwho are his neighbors and those who surround him in Kansas City and \nKansas, our State. He has those characteristics of a Kansan.\n  I have often known people who have been very successful in their \nprofessional lives, who have succeeded, for example, in law school, \ngone on to a large prestigious firm, and in many instances it seems as \nif they forgot where they came from. Dan continues to live in his \nhometown and continues to work to make certain that good things happen \nin that community. He does that with a great sense of humility. While \nhe has the attributes that could cause him to be superior in his \nattitude toward others, Dan is humble, caring, and compassionate. His \npride in where he comes from is evidenced by a devotion to many \ncommunity activities--the Community Foundation of Wyandotte County and \nthe Greater Kansas City Community Foundation. He sits on the board of \ndirectors for the Kansas City Sports Commission, and he is responsible \nin part for bringing 14 NCAA championships to Kansas City over the past \nfew years.\n  All of this encompasses who Dan is. He is a husband, a father, a \nlawyer, and a community leader. He is exemplary in fulfilling each of \nthose roles. Mostly, I want to say that his character, integrity, and \nprofessional achievements are worthy of being a member of the Federal \nbench.

I come to the floor to discuss the proposed minimum wage \nhike and the jobs it will cost Americans.\n  With more than 10 million Americans unemployed, the last thing this \nbody should be doing is considering legislation that would jeopardize \njobs. Yet this week we are back in session with another one of the \nDemocrats' election-year gimmicks: a 40-percent minimum wage hike that \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimates would result in a loss of up \nto 1 million jobs in this country.\n  Minimum wage hikes are a favorite Democratic proposal when economic \ntimes are tough and election-year prospects are dim. Hiking wages \nsounds good, after all, and Democrats figure it is a sure-fire way to \nappeal to Americans. But the truth is that when the consequences of a \nminimum wage hike are explained to them, Americans don't want it. Why \nis that? Because Americans want jobs. A minimum wage hike during such a \nweak economic recovery wouldn't result in job gains; it would result in \njob losses. It is simple: When you make something more expensive, \npeople can afford less of it. When you drive up the cost of hiring \nworkers, employers can't afford to hire as many of them, especially \nwhen you consider that many of those who employ minimum wage workers \nare small business owners.\n  Democrats are proposing a 40-percent hike in an economy in which \nunemployment is already high and job growth is already weak--in other \nwords, a massive minimum wage hike under the worst possible conditions.\n  It should surprise no one that the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated this hike could cost up to 1 million jobs. Who would be hurt \nby most by these lost jobs? Women, for one. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that 57 percent of the roughly half a million jobs \nthat would be lost by the end of 2016 thanks to this bill would be jobs \nthat are held by women. Young people would also be hit particularly \nhard. Our economy's overall unemployment rate is not good, but the \nunemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds is even worse--more than \ntwice the national average. The unemployment rate for African Americans \nbetween 16 and 24 is still worse than that--a staggering 23.6 percent, \nalmost four times the national average.\n  Duquesne University economist Antony Davies estimates that the \nDemocrats' proposed minimum wage increase would hike unemployment for \nthose under 25 years old without a high school diploma by 7 to 10 \npercent. If you are somebody who really needs a job--people under 25 \nyears old without a diploma--the unemployment rate, which is already \nstaggeringly high, could go up by 7 to 10 percent according to a \nDuquesne University economist.\n  Finally, the Democrats' proposed minimum wage hike would harm the \nlowest income and lowest skilled workers--in other words, the very \npeople it is supposed to help. When businesses are faced with the \nreality of higher employment costs from a minimum wage hike, who are \nthey going to let go? Low skilled workers, the same workers who are \nmost likely to be making the minimum wage.\n  In a March 2014 survey of businesses currently employing minimum wage \nworkers, 38 percent reported they would have to let some employees go \nto cover the cost of the minimum wage hike, while 54 percent reported \nthey would reduce their hiring.\n  In South Dakota small business owners told me the same thing at a \nrecent roundtable I held in my State. Multiple Main Street business \nowners told me they would stop hiring younger, less experienced workers \nand/or reduce the hours of their current employees. Others spoke of the \ndevastating impact the\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\ncost increases would have on their businesses. One gentleman who \nemploys 30 workers at a Dairy Queen in South Dakota told me that a $3 \nincrease in the minimum wage would cost his business an additional \n$100,000 per year. That is a huge amount for a small business in a \nrural area of South Dakota. To deal with these costs, this owner, like \nso many other small business owners around the country, is going to be \nforced to hike prices on the products he offers, and that will affect \nindividuals and families in South Dakota and across the country.\n  Middle-class families have already seen their incomes fall by nearly \n$3,500 on this President's watch. The Congressional Budget Office makes \nclear that a minimum wage hike will mean their purchasing power will be \neven further reduced and eroded.\n  The evidence is clear: Minimum wage hikes cost jobs. When informed \nthat they cost jobs, the strong majority of Americans reject these \nhikes, but unfortunately Democrats have a habit of ignoring both the \nevidence and the American people.\n  Take ObamaCare. Democrats jammed the bill through Congress on a \nparty-line vote over the objections of the American people and despite \nplenty of evidence to suggest that ObamaCare wouldn't work. But, \ncommitted to their liberal fantasy of successful government-run health \ncare, they ignored all the evidence to the contrary and forced the bill \nthrough. The American people are suffering as a result--canceled health \ncare plans, lost doctors and hospitals, higher prices, fewer choices, \nand reduced access to medications. The list goes on and on.\n  Last week the fifth annual U.S. Bank Small Business Survey reported \nthat businesses now rank health care as their No. 1 concern. More than \n60 percent of them, quoting from the survey, ``now say the long-term \nimpact of the Affordable Care Act will be negative on their business.''\n  Another article over the weekend reported that ``health insurers are \npreparing to raise rates next year for plans issued under the \nAffordable Care Act.''\n  Still another article from The Hill newspaper on Saturday stated that \nDemocrats in competitive elections generally regard ObamaCare as a \nfour-letter word, with many of their campaign Web sites omitting any \nreference to the law.\n  Democrats know ObamaCare has failed, but instead of trying to replace \nthe law, they are just trying to distract with more bad policies that \nmake it even harder to create jobs in this country.\n  American families are hurting. They need jobs--steady, good-paying \njobs. Yet Democrats are ignoring this priority in favor of liberal pet \nprojects that pander to their political base.\n  There is a clear contrast developing in the Senate: Democrats are \noffering distractions and Republicans are offering proposals that would \nspur job creation, increase opportunity, and help middle-class \nfamilies, proposals such as Senator Hoeven's bill to force approval of \nthe Keystone Pipeline and the 42,000 jobs the President's own State \nDepartment says it would support.\n  There is Senator Collins' proposal to amend the ObamaCare 30-hour \nworkweek provision that is causing employers to cut hours.\n  We have the proposal from Senators Hatch, Toomey, and Coats to repeal \nObamaCare's tax on lifesaving medical devices such as pacemakers and \ninsulin pumps--a tax that has already negatively affected tens of \nthousands of jobs in this industry and stands ready to damage many \nmore.\n  Then there is Senator Portman's bill to require executive branch \nagencies to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of new regulations so that \nfewer burdensome, job-killing regulations emerge from the \nadministration.\n  There are bills from Senator Lee, Senator McConnell, and Senator \nAyotte to give working parents more flexibility in the workplace so \nthat they can make it to more soccer games and more dance recitals \nwhile maintaining steady jobs.\n  Senator Rubio has a bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to \nallow employers to give raises to deserving employees.\n  Then there is my own to help long-term unemployed workers by \nproviding them with a one-time low-interest loan of up to $10,000 to \nstart a new job or to relocate to a State or metropolitan area with \nlower unemployment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. THUNE. Those are the issues on which we should be focused. I hope \nwe will start--and start creating jobs and opportunities for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Lipman, of Tennessee, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Western District of Tennessee.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J. Leahy, Jon Tester, Barbara Boxer, \n           Charles E. Schumer, Benjamin L. Cardin, Richard J. \n           Durbin, Christopher A. Coons, Jack Reed, John D. \n           Rockefeller IV, Carl Levin, Bill Nelson, Sheldon \n           Whitehouse, Christopher Murphy, Patty Murray, Tom \n           Udall, Angus S. King, Jr.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote to end filibusters on \nthe nominations of Sheryl Lipman to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Tennessee, Stanley Bastian to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Washington, Manish Shah to a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof Illinois, Daniel Crabtree to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Kansas, Judge Cynthia Bashant to the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of California, and Judge Jon Levy to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Maine. These are just 6 of the 31 \njudicial nominees currently pending on the Senate Floor.\n  Every single one of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with bipartisan support and every single one of these \nnominees has the support of their home State Senators. Nevertheless, we \nare once again being forced to follow the costly ritual of filing and \nvoting on cloture for non-controversial nominees and wasting valuable \nfloor time repeating this exercise. Meanwhile, it is our Federal \nJudiciary and the American people who suffer from these delays.\n  I recently heard remarks from the Minority Leader claiming that \n``many of these nominees would have been confirmed last December had we \nnot'' instituted the rules change. This statement is simply belied by \nthe facts. Senate Republicans have obstructed and slowed the \nnominations process throughout this President's entire tenure--in both \nhis first and second terms. At the end of each calendar year, Senate \nRepublicans deliberately refuse to vote on several judicial nominees \nwho could and should be confirmed in order to consume additional time \nthe following year confirming these nominees. This has happened at the \nconclusion of every single year of the Obama presidency.\n  At the end of 2009, they left 10 nominations on the Executive \nCalendar without a vote. Two of those nominations were returned to the \nPresident, and it subsequently took 9 months for the Senate to take \naction on the other 8. This resulted in the lowest 1-year confirmation \ntotal in at least 35 years. In 2010 and 2011, Senate Republicans left \n19 nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at the end of each \nyear. It then took nearly half the following year for the Senate to \nconfirm these nominees. In 2012, Senate Republicans left 11 judicial \nnominees without action and another four had hearings but Republicans \nrefused to expedite their consideration. In 2013, Senate Republicans \nleft 9 nominations on the Executive Calendar. Another 15 judicial\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nnominees could have been reported to the full Senate and confirmed by \nthe end of last year, but Senate Republicans blocked the Judiciary \nCommittee's ability to meet to report these nominees to the full \nSenate. So, the idea that the rules change has somehow triggered \nRepublican obstruction is simply not true. This has been a persistent \nand coordinated effort since the very beginning of the Obama \npresidency, and the rules change was an attempt to overcome some of \nthese tactics of delay and obstruction.\n  I have also seen reports lately that President Obama is now outpacing \nPresident George W. Bush in terms of judicial nominees confirmed at the \nsame point in their presidencies. It is true that at this point in \ntheir respective presidencies, President Bush had 232 nominees \nconfirmed while this President has had 235 nominees confirmed. This is \ncertainly welcome news.\n  I would note, however, that this statistic paints a very incomplete \npicture of what needs to be done. Although there have been slightly \nmore nominees confirmed, the vacancies are much higher at this point in \nthis president's tenure than in President Bush's tenure. In April 2006, \nthere were only 54 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. In stark \ncontrast, as of April 2014, there are currently 85 vacancies in the \nFederal judiciary--31 vacancies more than existed at the same point in \nPresident Bush's tenure.\n  The comparison is even more troubling when you consider the 31 \njudicial nominees currently pending on the Executive Calendar. We could \nlower the number of judicial vacancies today to 54 if Senate \nRepublicans would consent to voting on all of the pending nominees. We \nhave not had fewer than 60 vacancies since February 2009, at the \nbeginning of President Obama's first term. And for most of President \nObama's tenure in office, judicial vacancies have continued to hover \naround 80 and 90 because of Senate Republican obstruction. \nNevertheless, Senate Republicans continue to object to votes on these \nnominations.\n  These 6 nominees for whom we are voting to invoke cloture on today \nwere nominated last August and September. It is about time that we held \na vote on their nominations. All 6 nominees are well qualified and we \nshould end these filibusters and confirm them as soon as possible.\n  Sheryl Lipman has served as University Counsel to the University of \nMemphis since 2002, where she has also served as interim chief of staff \nto the president of the university and senior attorney.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe Bastian nomination.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the excellent \nnominee we are considering to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Washington, Stan Bastian.\n  In my home State of Washington we have a bipartisan judicial \nselection process that allows us to recommend nominees who are \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats alike, and while we don't always \nagree on every nominee, that process has served our State well for a \nlong time. As the Senate votes today on the nomination of Mr. Bastian, \nI would like to inform my colleagues that during the bipartisan process \nto select him, his support was unanimous. That means every Republican \nand every Democrat who helps select judicial nominees in our State \nsupports Mr. Bastian on the Federal bench. In today's political \natmosphere, that is the strongest endorsement I can think of.\n  He has nearly 30 years of litigation experience. He is a fellow in \nthe American College of Trial Lawyers. He is the chairman of the Equal \nJustice Coalition, and throughout his career he has served the \nWashington bar, first as a member of the board of governors and \neventually as president. He has practiced in both State and Federal \ncourts, tried hundreds of cases, including civil and criminal cases and \njury and bench trials.\n  Our system of government is at its best when good people step up to \nthe plate and are willing to serve.

Under the previous order, the time until 3:30 \np.m. will be under the control of the majority.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are now debating legislation that \nwill be up for a vote tomorrow. It will be a cloture vote on bringing a \nminimum wage increase bill to the floor.\n  Let's be clear about this. It is a cloture vote. This means it is \ngoing to take 60 votes, and that will happen tomorrow. I assume most of \nthe day we will be discussing that. I hope so. I know others have come \nto the floor previously to discuss this.\n  As the chairman of the committee and as the chief sponsor of this \nbill, I intend to be back on the floor later today to respond to some \nof the allegations made by Senators on the other side of the aisle \nregarding this bill and minimum wage as a concept, but I wish to take a \nfew minutes to sort of set the stage for this legislation and what it \nis going to mean for our economy and for working Americans.\n  What I would say at the outset is that the minimum wage bill is about \na lot of things: It is going to give an economic boost. It will \nincrease the GDP of our country. It will do a lot of good economically \nfor our society, but basically it is about economic fairness. It is \nabout what kind of society we want America to be.\n  Keep in mind, the Fair Labor Standards Act which set the minimum wage \nwas passed at the end of the Depression, 1939, when we were still in \nthe Depression, and it was immediately to give a raise in wages to \nhard-working Americans. That is what it did.\n  Since that time, actually on both sides of the aisle, we have raised \nthe minimum wage a number of times. This is just another step in making \nsure that those at the bottom of the economic ladder in America also \nget a hand up, to get help to make sure they too have a fair shot at \nthe American dream.\n  So that is what this minimum wage bill is truly about. It is about \ncore American values; the value that no one who works full time all \nyear long should live in poverty. That is what this is about.\n  The fact is the value of the minimum wage has eroded so much over the \nlast few years that the minimum wage right now is way below poverty. In \nother words, someone can work full time every day, all year long, and \nthey are still in poverty. But they are working every day. That is not \nfair. The American value system is one that if someone puts in their \nwork and works hard, they ought not to be living in poverty.\n  Right now, tens of millions of Americans are struggling just to keep \na roof over their heads, to pay the heating bill, to find some money \nfor an extra pair of shoes for a growing child, even getting money \ntogether to take the bus to work. Think about this: A minimum wage \nworker's paycheck has stayed the same since 2009. This chart \nillustrates what has happened.\n  If we go back to 2009, the minimum wage has increased zero percent. \nBut\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nlook what has gone up: Electricity has gone up 4.2 percent; rent, 7.3 \npercent; auto repairs, 7.6 percent; food at home, 8.8 percent. This is \nsince 2009. Childcare has gone up 11.7 percent. Mass transit, which is \nhow people who make minimum wage get back and forth to work, has gone \nup 17.8 percent since 2009. Yet their paycheck has not gone up.\n  What does this chart tell us? This tells us that people making \nminimum wage are falling further and further behind because these are \nthings that low-income Americans have to spend money on: lights, rent, \nfixing up their old car, food, childcare, and mass transit. Look how \nmuch they have gone up. Yet the minimum wage has stayed the same. That \nis why this is a value issue.\n  When people who work hard and play by the rules have to rely upon \nfood stamps and food banks to feed their children and the minimum wage \nhas them trapped in poverty, it is unacceptable. It is un-American. It \nis not what our Nation is about.\n  So Americans deserve a raise. That is why this bill raises it from \n$7.25 to $10.10 an hour in three annual steps. It will link the minimum \nwage to the cost of living in the future. In other words, we index it \nfor the future so we don't have this prospect that as other things \nincrease in price, the minimum wage stays the same. It is time to index \nit in the future.\n  Our bill also provides for a raise for tipped workers--the people who \nserve your food, push the wheelchairs at the airports, and park cars. \nEvery time I tell somebody this, they tell me I can't be right; I must \nbe mistaken. I tell them the tipped wage today is $2.13 an hour, and it \nhas been that way since 1991. Not a 1-cent increase since 1991. People \nfind that hard to believe. It is hard to believe, but it is very true.\n  So our bill would increase tipped wages from $2.13 an hour up to 70 \npercent of the minimum wage over a 6-year period of time, the first \nincrease in tipped wages in 23 years.\n  An increase in the minimum wage benefits everyone. Twenty-eight \nmillion workers will get a raise--15 million are women, so over 50 \npercent of the increase--4 million African-American workers; 7 million \nHispanic workers; and 7 million parents will get a raise. And we forget \nabout this. How about our kids? Fourteen million kids will benefit from \na minimum wage increase. That means their families will get an increase \nin the minimum wage. This benefits the kids. So think about the \nchildren in America. They are going to get a raise too.\n  Again, raising the minimum wage helps our families and it helps our \neconomy. This is why we had a press conference this morning with a \ngroup called Business for a Fair Minimum Wage. One thousand businesses \nacross the country representing every State in our Nation have signed \non saying: Yes, we need to increase the minimum wage to at least $10.10 \nan hour. They understand and Main Street businesses understand this.\n  If we increase the minimum wage for people in the community, they are \nnot running off to Paris, France, to spend the money. They are going to \nspend that money on Main Street, and that helps our small businesses. \nThis is why so many small businesses get it. They understand that if we \nraise the minimum wage, that helps them. That helps the local economy \non Main Street.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that our minimum wage bill \nwill put $35 billion in the hands of millions of workers, and that \nmoney will be spent on Main Street. It will pump an additional $22 \nbillion into our GDP, supporting 85,000 new jobs as the raise is phased \nin over 3 years.\n  There is another issue I think we need to address, and that is what \nhappens with low-wage workers and how they do sustain themselves. They \nare in poverty from the minimum wage. So what do they rely on? They \nrely on food stamps, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. They rely upon the earned-income tax credit and the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families Program. That costs taxpayers in America \n$243 billion a year.\n  Again, I am not saying that by increasing the minimum wage we are \ngoing to knock that down to zero. I can't say that, but what I can say \nis that a study was done just on food stamps, and if we raise the \nminimum wage, in the first year we will save $4.6 billion in taxpayers' \nmoney because people will now have enough money to go out and buy their \nown food. They will not rely on food stamps.\n  A lot of these other things will be cut back too, such as TANF and \nMedicaid or CHIP. I can't say how much, but people understand that this \nis what we are paying as taxpayers to support a minimum wage below the \npoverty line.\n  Again, people understand how important this minimum wage is. That is \nwhy it is so broadly supported by such a cross-section of American \npeople.\n  Here is a poll that has been done. A USA Today and Pew Research \nCenter poll this year indicated that 73 percent of all voters support \nraising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour--90 percent Democrats, 71 \npercent Independents, and even 53 percent of Republicans believe we \nought to raise it to at least $10.10 an hour.\n  So the American people get it. There is overwhelming support for \nraising the minimum wage. But I am just mystified by how vehemently my \nRepublican colleagues oppose this modest increase. I just don't \nunderstand it. But what I hear is the same old outdated, disproved \narguments against giving working Americans a raise.\n  There are some on the other side who believe we should do away with \nthe minimum wage. There should be no minimum wage at all. Try that one \non for size. Talk about a race to the bottom. Four dollars an hour \nmaybe? Three dollars an hour? Two dollars an hour? You see, I have \nalways said that without a strong minimum wage and without a good, \nstrong Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor to make sure \npeople adhere to it--if we don't have that, then there is always \nsomeone a little worse off than you who will bid lower than you for \nthat job.\n  So someone says: We will pay $7 an hour. There is always somebody \nthat just needs the job a little more, they are desperate, and they \nsay: I will take it for $6 an hour. Then there are some a little worse \noff than that who say: We will take it for $5 an hour, and we get a \ndownward spiral.\n  That is why I say our American value is to have a strong minimum \nwage, whereby people who work hard--and some of these jobs are hard \nwork. People are on their feet 8 hours a day or they are doing some \nmanual labor or they are doing the kind of jobs a lot of people don't \ndo. Yet they live in poverty. It is not right. Raising the minimum wage \nis common sense that adheres to our American values and gives everyone \na fair shot at the American dream.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the right thing and vote for cloture, \nallow us to get on the bill. We can have some amendments offered, and \nwe can vote to give working Americans a raise after all these years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise to join my \ncolleagues to urge support for increasing the Federal minimum wage.\n  Today's minimum wage of $7.25 falls short and working families are \nfalling behind. It hasn't kept up with the rising cost of everyday \nlife. In fact, it is $2 less than it was in 1968, when adjusted for \ninflation. A full-time worker earning the minimum wage in 2014 makes \nless than someone did in 1968, almost half a century ago.\n  Now, $7.25 may be just a number to some but not for so many families \nin my State struggling to get by. It means working two or three jobs \njust to put food on the table or fill the gas tank or buy clothes for \ntheir children and still not be able to climb out of poverty.\n  Our Nation was founded on a basic premise that no matter who you are, \nif you work hard, you can get ahead. You can make a decent living. We \nhaven't always kept that promise. We have the opportunity to do so this \nweek for millions of hard-working men and women, young and old, who are \npaid the minimum wage.\n  Working Americans are not moving forward. They are falling behind. \nYear after year, paycheck by paycheck, they work just as hard, but they \nearn less and less. This is a disturbing trend, not just for minimum \nwage workers but all across the board. Worker productivity is rising \npretty dramatically--69 percent in the last 25 years--but real hourly \nwages are not keeping pace, up 26.5\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\npercent in the last 25 years. For the top 1 percent it couldn't be \nbetter. Their share of earned income is the highest it has been since \n1929. But the average worker has to run faster and faster just to stay \nin place.\n\n  This is not the promise we made. This is not the way to a better \nAmerica for each generation, but this is the reality for too many \nworkers in New Mexico and across the Nation. They are living it every \nday. They get up, they take care of their kids, and they go to work. \nThey may run faster, they may work harder, but they cannot get ahead.\n  A full-time minimum wage worker makes only $15,000 a year, well below \nthe $23,550 poverty line for a family of four with two children. New \nMexico has too many families in poverty, working hard, doing their best \nbut falling further and further behind. This bill would give them a \nchance to build a better future for themselves and for their children.\n  I have received many letters from my constituents because they know \nhow important raising the minimum wage is. Here is a letter from \nKathryn from Fruitland, NM. She says: ``Morally, raising the minimum \nwage is the right thing to do, because people working full time deserve \nto live decently.''\n  Barbara from Clovis, NM, told me: ``There are so many people who work \nfor minimum wage and have a desperately hard time paying the bills.''\n  Liz from Albuquerque says: ``I hope you will do all in your power to \nassure that every working American will be assured of making a living \nwage, not just a `minimum' wage.''\n  Increasing the minimum wage helps families and helps the economy. It \nis one of the best things we can do to kick-start New Mexico's economy. \nIt means workers in New Mexico would have over $200 million more to \nspend. It means boosting our State's GDP by $127 million, helping local \nbusinesses and generating 500 new jobs. It means moving forward, and it \nmeans that we honor an important idea that folks receive a fair day's \npay for a hard day's work. That is the deal, and it is a big deal. \nLet's consider the alternative: When every year costs rise and the \nminimum wage stays the same, that is like a pay cut for families that \ncan least afford it.\n  The bill before us increases the minimum wage in three steps. Six \nmonths after the bill is signed, it raises the minimum wage by less \nthan $1. A year later it bumps up the minimum wage by 95 cents, and two \nyears after the first increase, it would finally reach $10.10, which is \nabout where it would be if it had kept up with inflation over the past \n40 years. But this bill does more than just give hard workers today the \nchance to earn a decent wage. It also includes an important provision \nto allow the minimum wage to continue to keep up with every-day costs \nso that future generations who are working their way up can have a fair \nshot.\n  Our country has debated raising the minimum wage several times in the \npast. Opponents always paint a very gloomy picture, but we have been \nable to get bipartisan agreement to do it. Afterwards, families and the \neconomy have been better off, and the pessimistic predictions haven't \ncome true. We need to build an economy that works for everyone. Most \nAmericans believe it is time to increase the minimum wage because it is \nthe right thing to do, and it is the smart thing to do. It is time to \nkeep our Nation's promise to reward hard work. It is time for all \nfamilies to have a fair chance at the American dream.\n  I urge my colleagues to support increasing the minimum wage. It is \nlong overdue for millions of working families who continue to struggle, \nwho continue to wait, and who have waited long enough.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I came to the floor to join Senator Harkin, Senator Udall, and \nSenator Boxer in supporting the increase in the minimum wage that would \ngive 28 million American workers a very long overdue raise.\n  I know that the years since the economic collapse in 2008 have really \nbeen hard for families in New Hampshire and across the country. \nAlthough we have seen CEO salaries rise, pay for working families has \nstagnated. While the cost of food, transportation, and childcare all \ncontinue to climb and families struggle to make ends meet, the minimum \nwage for American workers has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. \nAt that rate a single mother working full time in New Hampshire does \nnot earn enough to keep her family out of poverty. So let me just be \nclear: Adults working full time cannot support their families on the \nminimum wage, and that needs to change.\n  The fair minimum wage act would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 \nover 2 years. That would provide a raise to nearly 20 percent of New \nHampshire's workforce and lift 10,000 people in New Hampshire out of \npoverty. Nationwide, nearly one-third of all minimum wage workers are \nwomen over the age of 25. In New Hampshire 70 percent of minimum wage \nworkers are women. This effort is about these women and the 34,000 \nchildren in the Granite State whose parents would have a little more in \ntheir paychecks each week if we increased the minimum pay to $10.10.\n  I know that many critics claim that only teenagers hold those minimum \nwage jobs but, sadly, that is just not true. Teens make up only 12 \npercent of those who would get a raise if we boosted pay to $10.10 an \nhour. Minimum wage workers are also veterans. The fair minimum wage act \nis about giving a raise to the 4,500 New Hampshire veterans who now \nearn $7.25 an hour--the minimum wage--and who are struggling to get by. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in voting to give these veterans a \nraise.\n  Making sure workers in New Hampshire get a fair wage for an honest \nday's work is something that I have focused on since I was Governor. In \n1997 I signed a bill into law that boosted minimum wages for tipped \nworkers in New Hampshire. Nearly 75 percent of those tipped workers are \nwomen. As was the case then, today we must act to raise the minimum \nwage to ensure that hard-working Americans get a fair shot at success. \nI urge my colleagues to join me on both sides of the aisle in \nsupporting the fair minimum wage act. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is my honor to rise today to support \nthis very important bill, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act of 2014. I am \nvery proud of my colleagues who have just spoken, and particularly, I \nwant to say, of Senator Shaheen who, as I understand it, is the only \nwoman here in the Senate who is both a former Governor and a Senator; \nis that correct?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. It is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When Senator Shaheen was a Governor she stood up for the \npeople, and as a Senator she certainly fights for her people.\n  Part of this fight involves making sure that when you work hard and \nyou work full time you don't have to live in poverty. It just isn't \nfair. Remember most of the people on the minimum wage are adults. They \nare not children. They are not teenagers. They are adults. So many of \nthem are trying to raise their children in jobs at the minimum wage \nlevel, and you don't have to be a mathematician to know that the \ncurrent minimum wage leaves you in poverty. So you have a full-time \njob, you work your heart out, and you wind up in poverty.\n  I went back into my little memory books, and I found my son's first \npaycheck when he was working his way through school. He went to a \nsupermarket to work as a checkout clerk. He came into a store called \nLucky Stores. They were a union store, so he joined the union. Do you \nknow what that young man made in those years? In 1986, 28 years ago--it \nis right here--it was $7.41 an hour. Imagine. So he was so proud he \ncould work hard. When he came home, he was able to help pay for his \ntuition and his books.\n  We are talking about a minimum wage that is $10.10 an hour. Here is \nthis young man working as an entry level checkout clerk at a \nsupermarket in 1986 making over $7 an hour. This minimum wage has got \nto be raised.\n  We have the chart. If you put inflation on the minimum wage as it was \nin 1968--just inflation--the minimum wage would be $10.69 an hour. We \nare not even going that far. We are saying $10.10 an hour. So all we \nare suggesting is, make sure inflation is covered. That is all we are \nsaying.\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\n  Increasing the minimum wage will give people a chance, a fair shot. \nRemember, most of the people on minimum wage are adults. If you stop \nsomeone on the street and ask who they think is on the minimum wage, a \nlot of folks guess it is teenagers. No. By the way, most of those \nhappen to be women.\n  I am deeply disappointed and distressed that the Republicans are \nopposing this measure. Why do Republicans want to deny hard-working \nAmericans a raise? The country supports it overwhelmingly. I don't \nunderstand it because in 2007, the last time we raised the minimum \nwage, it was bipartisan. A huge majority of Senators then agreed that a \nfull day's work deserved a fair paycheck. The minimum wage in 2007 was \nduring George W. Bush's Presidency. Let me say that again. For the \nminimum wage in 2007, which was the last time we raised it, the \nincrease passed 94 to 3, and George W. Bush signed it into law. What \nhas changed in the Republicans' hearts? What has changed in the \nRepublicans' minds? Are they turning against the people?\n  If you ask them they will say that it is just not fair to small \nbusinesses. Well, more than 80 percent of small businesses pay their \npeople more than the minimum wage. So come on. A majority of small \nbusinesses support what we are trying to do. So don't come on the floor \nand say you are opposing it because it is too much too soon. Wrong. It \nis even lower than the inflation rate, and secondly, regarding that \nsmall business doesn't want it, in fact, they do.\n  Now before that was 1989. We raised the minimum wage then, and it was \n89 to 8, and at that time it was George H. W. Bush. So wait a minute. \nWhat is going on here? I don't get this. It is not about who is in the \nWhite House; it is about the working people of this country. Where is \nthe bipartisan spirit? It is gone, and America is paying a heavy price \nwith the minimum wage stuck at $7.25 an hour and with inflation eating \naway every day at it.\n  Let me read you just two or three stories about workers. Alicia \nMcCrary, a single mom who testified in March before the Senate HELP \nCommittee, struggles to support her sons with a minimum wage job in \nfast food. She has trouble getting them haircuts, shoes, clothing, and \nother items that kids need. She says: ``My boys ask: Why isn't there \nenough money? You work, and you work really hard, Mom.''\n  She said: ``I don't have a good answer other than I don't get paid \nenough.''\n  She is right. She doesn't get paid a fair minimum wage.\n  NBC News ran a story of a man who works three jobs. Two of them are \novernight--he works three jobs--two of them are overnight jobs for \nminimum wage. He said:\n\n       I have four young children. They need a dad around. That is \n     why I work a day job when they are in school and then go back \n     to work when they go to bed. But it takes 3 jobs to make ends \n     meet because of $7.25 an hour. I am 43 and have over 20 \n     years' experience and make $7.25 an hour.\n\n  That is wrong. These parents work so hard and their kids are growing \nup with so little, and their parents look in their children's eyes and \nthey suffer because they want to do more for their children.\n  Economists project that this bill--which I hope most or almost every \nDemocrat will support--will raise the wages of 28 million people in \nAmerica. All we need is a handful of Republicans to join with us and we \nwill get it done. By the way, if it were a majority rule, we would get \nit done. They are filibustering it. Let's be clear. They not only \noppose it; they are forcing us to get 60 votes.\n  Twenty percent of the children in America are counting on this, 14 \nmillion children who would be lifted out of poverty if we pass the \nHarkin bill.\n  Then we have tipped workers. If I asked anyone on the street how much \ntipped workers make, they would say minimum wage. Most people don't \nknow what the Federal tipped minimum wage is. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has worked on this. It is $2.13 an hour. Can my colleagues \nimagine? Again, $2.13 an hour is the tipped minimum wage.\n  Many tipped workers live in poverty and instability. They don't know \nif they will make enough to cover the bills.\n  We will hear that if we pay the full minimum wage, it will be too \nhard on the restaurant owners. In my State the tipped workers get the \nfull minimum wage, and that wage is $8 an hour, going up to $10, in \nCalifornia. So the tipped workers get the minimum wage amount every \nhour. Guess what. Our restaurants are going gangbusters. And guess what \nelse. When a person does well and has their minimum wage plus their \ntips, they get to go out once in a while to a restaurant. They can go \ndown to the corner store and get something for their children.\n  Sandra Samoa is a bartender in Chicago. She says if the bar is slow, \nshe might take home just $40 after an 8-hour shift. She lives with her \nmom and her young son. This woman sleeps on the floor so her son can \nsleep in a bed. If we don't represent people such as these, who the \nheck do we represent--the Koch brothers? They are worth billions. This \nwoman comes home Sundays with $40 in her pocket, she sleeps on the \nfloor, and she says, ``My whole plan is to have a room for him one \nday.''\n  So, listen, if we are who we are supposed to be--the representatives \nof the people and working families--then we want to make sure we raise \nthe minimum wage. It helps everybody, including those in business. That \nis why most small businesses support this.\n  We know the great story of Henry Ford, who raised the day rate of his \nworkers way back in the olden days, and people said: What are you \ndoing? You are raising wages? You could get away with paying them--\nwhatever it was.\n  He said: I am raising them because I want them to buy my car--the \ncars we make.\n  What we are going to hear on this floor from our colleagues is that \nwe are going too fast, we are raising this too much. I have already \nshown my colleagues that we are raising it less than inflation, so that \nis baloney on its face.\n  No. 2, they say: Oh, it is going to hurt small business.\n  I have already stated that 82 percent of small businesses already pay \nall of their employees more than the Federal minimum wage, and more \nthan half of them support raising it to $10.10 because they know people \nwill spend money on their products and in their stores.\n  Then the next thing they are going to say is it is a job-loser. They \nare going to cite one study, which I call an outlier, from CBO. It said \nthe minimum wage would reduce employment by three-tenths of 1 percent \nover the next 2 years. When I heard that, I thought, what is this \nabout? I looked at some other studies. A study by three prominent labor \neconomists from the University of Massachusetts, the University of \nNorth Carolina, and the University of California-Berkeley found that \nminimum wage increases absolutely do not cause job losses. The Economic \nPolicy Institute found that the Harkin bill would increase employment \nby 84,000 jobs and add $22 billion to our economy over 2\\1/2\\ years. \nLet me repeat that. The Harkin bill would increase employment by 84,000 \njobs and add $22 billion to our economy.\n  But let's look at history. We have to really ask ourselves--these \nguys and gals who are saying don't raise the minimum wage because it \nwill lose jobs--what if they said that going back through time and they \nprevailed? We would never have raised the minimum wage. I worked for \nthe minimum wage a long time ago. At that time it was a dollar an hour, \nand I earned 50 cents an hour because I was a teenager. It was great \nthen. I earned 50 cents an hour. I am looking at the young people here, \nand they are thinking, you must be really old. They would be right.\n  My point is that the minimum wage was a buck an hour and it was \nraised many times. Since 1989 the minimum wage has been raised three \ntimes. It was raised many times before that. There have been 18 \nincreases since 1956. So we can put that in our minds--18 increases in \nthe minimum wage since 1956. Suppose the other side had taken that \nattitude: Don't raise it. Well, it would still be, I guess, a buck an \nhour, 50 cents if you are a kid. Today ``50 Cent'' is a singing group, \nright?\n  We have raised the minimum wage over and over again. What has \nhappened? The economy has added millions of jobs. Since 1956 it has \nadded 80 million. Since 1956, we have raised the\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nminimum wage 18 times and we have created 80 million new jobs. So if \nanybody says this is a job-killer, I just say, read the history books.\n  Americans support raising the minimum wage. I hope my colleagues are \nlistening. The American people know $7.25 an hour is not enough. A Wall \nStreet Journal/NBC poll found that 63 percent of Americans support \nraising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Let me say that again. \nSixty-three percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to \n$10.10 an hour.\n  All we need is a handful of Republicans. If they are listening to me, \nI hope they heard some of my arguments. No. 1, it is good for business \nto raise the minimum wage because people have more to spend. No. 2, \nhistory has shown that we have raised the minimum wage over and over \nagain and we have created 80 million jobs. No. 3, most of the people \nearning minimum wage are adults, and most of those are women, and \npeople are trying to raise their families on the minimum wage.\n  The last point is that we have always had strong bipartisan support. \nWhen George W. signed it into law, there was strong support from the \nRepublicans. When his dad was in office, there was strong support. I \ncan't believe the Republican Party has turned its back on working \npeople, but if they have, we will find out tomorrow. The American \npeople know what this is about.\n  The American dream is within reach, but we have to have fairness out \nthere. People need a fair shot. We shouldn't tell someone who is a dad \nthat he has to work three jobs. That is wrong. We need to lift up these \nworkers and not let them fall behind.\n  When workers do better, families do better. When parents buy their \nkids enough to eat and shoes to wear, when they can go get a haircut at \nthe local barber, when they can put gas in their car and fix up their \nhouse just a little, everybody does better. The community does better. \nBusinesses do better. Families can walk tall when we reward hard work. \nWhen our workers earn a fair wage, our economy is stronger and our \ncountry is better. So let's give American working families a fair shot. \nWe are not asking for the Moon and the Sun and the stars. All we want \nis just a little light at the end of the tunnel.\n  Thank you.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, nearly 7 years ago both parties worked \ntogether to pass bipartisan legislation that raised the minimum wage. \nNineteen of my Republican colleagues, with whom I serve in the Senate \ntoday, voted for that bipartisan legislation, and Republican President \nGeorge W. Bush signed it into law on May 25, 2007.\n  Since that time big banks on Wall Street drove our economy into a \nditch. We faced a financial sector meltdown and were confronted with \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  Hard-working Americans lost jobs. They lost their homes. They lost \ntheir retirement savings. Hard-working families paid a steep price for \nthe reckless actions of others when all they ever asked for was that \ntheir hard work be rewarded.\n  Today people are working as hard as ever. Many are working full time. \nMany are working two jobs just to make ends meet; they deserve to get \nahead. Yet far too many are barely getting by or living in poverty.\n  Middle-class incomes have flat-lined and income inequality in the \nUnited States is at a record high. And, today, a full-time minimum-wage \nworker earns only $15,080 per year.\n  The sad reality is the minimum wage is not high enough to keep full-\ntime workers out of poverty. That is simply wrong, and it is our job to \nwork together to change it because in America no one who works hard \nfull time should have to live in poverty.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to help lift nearly 2 million \npeople--2 million of their fellow Americans--out of poverty.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to support the Minimum Wage \nFairness Act and give 28 million hard-working Americans the raise they \nhave earned.\n  Some opponents of this bill have dismissed this effort as nothing \nmore than raising the wages of teenagers who are simply working in the \nsummer months. Well, that simply is no longer true. In fact, it never \nwas true.\n  Eighty-eight percent of minimum-wage workers are adults age 20 or \nolder, and the average age of a minimum-wage worker in America is 35 \nyears old. More than half of minimum-wage workers are women. These are \nAmericans who are working hard to get ahead, and they deserve to have \nus working together to help give them a fair shot.\n  Raising the minimum wage is not just the right thing to do to reward \nhard work; it can certainly boost our economy because studies show that \nminimum-wage workers spend the extra dollars they earn on basics such \nas food and clothing at businesses right in their home communities.\n  For someone earning $7.25 an hour and working full time, raising the \nminimum wage to $10.10 puts an extra $5,700 into their pockets. That \n$5,700 provides groceries for a year or utilities for a year, money to \nspend on gas and clothing for a year, or 6 months of housing--fueling \nour local economies at a time when our recovery continues to limp \nalong.\n  Raising the minimum wage would lift 2 million hard-working people out \nof poverty. Passing this legislation would mean that more hard-working \nAmericans will be able to provide for their families without the help \nof government programs such as SNAP, otherwise known as food stamps, \nsaving taxpayers $4.6 billion from reduced nutrition assistance \npayments in 1 year alone.\n  I believe we need to build a fairer economy and grow the middle class \nfrom the bottom up. And I believe our economy is strongest when we \nexpand opportunity for everyone, when everyone gets a fair shot.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues here today and tomorrow to deliver a \ncall for action. It is simple. The time is now to give hard-working \nAmericans a raise. We can do that if both parties work together to \nreward hard work so that an honest day's work pays more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nimportance of raising the minimum wage.\n  People truly deserve a fair shot at the American dream, and it is \ntime to come together to raise the minimum wage.\n  Our State just raised the minimum wage. We actually had one of the \nlowest minimum wages in the country--$6.15 per hour--and we are now at \n$9.50 per hour. So that was a major jump up. It was something that was \nneeded, and it had a lot of support in the State of Minnesota, a State \nthat has a very strong economy, with an unemployment rate of only 4.8 \npercent. But even when they have jobs people still have found it very \nhard to afford basic things or to send their kids to college.\n  We should follow Minnesota's example. We should raise the Federal \nminimum wage to $10.10 per hour.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Minimum Wage Fairness Act. I want to thank \nSenator Harkin for his leadership on this issue and his dedication to \nthe working families of America.\n  I also want to thank Senator Merkley and all of my colleagues who \nhave worked tirelessly to raise the minimum wage.\n  As the Senate chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I held a hearing \non income inequality earlier this year with former Secretary of Labor \nRobert Reich. His data showed--and this is a number I will never \nforget--that the top 400 people in this country--the top 400 people--\nhave the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50 percent of Americans. \nThis means that half of Americans--of everyone in this country--have \nthe same amount of wealth as the top 400 people.\n  So how do we address this? We know there are a lot of things we need \nto do: training people who do not have the jobs and do not have the \nskills right now, increasing exports, immigration reform--there are all \nkinds of things we can do. But we know one major thing we can do to \nhelp an individual family have a fair shot is to increase the minimum \nwage.\n  Like many of my colleagues who have spoken today, I worked my fair \nshare of minimum-wage jobs. I started as a carhop at the A Root Beer \nstand in Wayzata, MN. I then graduated to being a waitress, for about 3 \nyears, at Bakers Square pie shop,\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nwhere I once spilled 12 iced teas on 1 customer. That is when I decided \nto go to law school. But I worked those jobs, and it gave me a sense of \nwhat it was like for some of the people I worked with--that this was \ntheir job, this was their job cutting pies, this was their job washing \ndishes. This was how they supported themselves. It gave me a sense of \nhow important it is to look out for those people who are doing the work \nwe depend on every single day.\n  Think of how this affects women. Two-thirds of today's families rely \non the mother's income in some way. Mothers are the primary \nbreadwinners in more than one-third of families. Yet we also know that \nwomen make up nearly two-thirds of all the workers who earn the minimum \nwage or less.\n  An example of this is a waitress named Tiffany from Houston, TX, who \nrecently came to Washington. We did an event together and answered \nquestions. Her story is the story of so many American women across this \ncountry. She is a single mom. She loves her daughter so much. She is \nworking as a waitress, and many times, with the way the laws work down \nin Texas, she does not make many tips in one night. So what does she \ndo? She fills in by working on holidays. She has worked many Christmas \nEves. She has missed every single Halloween with her daughter because \nit was a good night to be working at the bar at the restaurant. She has \nmissed all kinds of other holidays, and she went through them, as we \nstood there.\n  You think to yourself: Sometimes, especially when you first start \noff, that happens. I have had it happen. But it should not keep \nhappening after you have worked years and years at the same place. But \nit is just one example of what our minimum-wage workers have to do to \ntry to make ends meet. They have to work another job. They have to work \na holiday. They have to work another shift. That goes on every single \nday in America.\n  A woman working full time in a minimum-wage job only makes about \n$15,000 per year, which is not enough for her to work her way out of \npoverty. It is not enough for her to send herself or her kids to \ncollege. A full-time job should not mean full-time poverty.\n  Today, more than 15 million women in America are counting on us to \nhelp them get a fairer wage. Many of them, as I noted, are working in \ndemanding retail and hospitality jobs--as waitresses, store clerks, \nhotel maids--where they are on their feet and they are running all day. \nThey may not be able to come here today and sit in the gallery and say: \nHey, I need a raise. So we have to be their voices. We have to talk for \nthem today.\n  Despite their hard work, they have an almost impossible time making \nends met. They struggle to afford the basics--a decent place to live or \nfood for their family, never mind being able to save for a rainy day or \nfor college or for their own retirement.\n  I released a Joint Economic Committee report on Earnings, Income and \nRetirement Security for Women. One striking thing we saw in this report \nis that a woman's lower lifetime earnings means lower retirement \nsecurity. So this is more than about today's wages. This is about an \nentire lifespan. Women live longer. If they are making less, if their \nminimum wage does not allow them to save for retirement, it is even \ntougher for them in their golden years.\n  There is also a strong economic case for raising the minimum wage \ntoday. Low-wage workers would see their earnings increase by $31 \nbillion if we raise the minimum wage. And we know what they are going \nto do with this. They are going to try to save a little of it, but they \nare going to spend it. They are going to spend it in Washington State. \nThey are going to spend it in West Virginia. They are going to spend it \non clothes for their kids, on food for their families, and filling up \ntheir gas tanks. They are going to help keep the economy going.\n  I once saw a documentary that Robert Reich did where he talked to a \nmajor CEO with tons of money. He took him into his room, and he said: \nOK. I only have three pairs of jeans. How can you really have more than \nthree pairs of jeans? Maybe you could have four, but you really don't \nneed more than that.\n  His point was this: If we want to have an economy that works, we \ncannot have all of the profits and money sucked up by the people who \nrun things. We want them to be rewarded for their work, but they can \nonly buy so many jeans.\n  If you have that money go fairly across the spectrum, then everyone \ngets to buy their pair of jeans. What we are doing is literally cutting \ndown our markets by not making sure--in a consumer-driven economy, \nwhere 70 percent of our economy is consumer driven, we are putting \nourselves in a situation where people are not able to buy things.\n  We also know that raising the minimum wage is good for business. We \nknow that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour could help \napproximately 28 million workers, with almost half of the benefits \ngoing to households with incomes below $35,000 per year.\n  We know that more than 15 million women would receive a raise. We \nknow that $31 billion would be added to our economy. We know that seven \nNobel laureates in economics, along with over 600 economists, support \nraising the minimum wage to restore the value that has been lost to \ninflation over the years. The minimum wage is now a third of the value \nof what it was in 1968.\n  It was the beloved late Paul Wellstone of my State who famously said: \n``We all do better when we all do better.'' If he were here today, that \nis what he would be saying. I know it is still true, and so do my \ncolleagues who join me today. We need to be focused on doing better so \nwe all do better.\n  With this in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for \nworking families, and especially the working women of this country, to \ngive them a fair shot and pass a long overdue minimum-wage increase.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher really important statement. I come here today to join her and talk \nabout this one small idea that stands for a huge difference in the \nlives of all of our constituents and, as she pointed out, for women in \nparticular; that is, of course, the idea that if you are putting in 40 \nor 50 or 60 hours of work per week, you are able to put food on the \ntable and pay your bills and you will not be stuck below the poverty \nline.\n  This idea could change the lives of millions of Americans if Congress \nsimply acted and raised the minimum wage. But we have to act now \nbecause right now one in four women in our workforce is making the \nminimum wage. That is 15 million American women who are making the \nequivalent of about two gallons of gas per hour.\n  Are we prepared to tell them that should be enough to support \nthemselves and their kids? In fact, as we have heard several times now \nhere in this Chamber, nearly two-thirds of those who earn the minimum \nwage or less are women. This is coming at a time when more and more \nwomen are depended upon as the sole income earners in American \nfamilies.\n  Right now, in cities and towns across America, there are millions of \nthose women who are getting up at the crack of dawn for work every day \nwho are stuck living in poverty, who cannot save for a car, much less a \nhouse. They cannot pay for school to get new skills and a new job, and \nthey cannot even afford to provide their children with warm winter \nclothes or basic medical care.\n  Unfortunately, this also comes at a time now when we are seeing CEO \nsalaries skyrocketing across the country, all while America's minimum \nwage stays flat. In 2013, the average S CEO earned $11.7 million. \nThat is 21 percent more than they earned in 2009--21 percent--and 630 \npercent more in real value than in 1983--630 percent more.\n  Unbelievably, this means that the average CEO today earns more before \nlunchtime on his first day of work than a minimum-wage worker earns all \nyear. That is not how it is supposed to work in America, the country \nwhere you are told if you work hard and you play by the rules, you can \nget ahead.\n  So when we talk about the minimum wage, let's be clear: Raising the \nminimum wage is about bringing back our middle class. I am proud that \nin my State we are taking the lead. In my\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nhome State of Washington, our workforce enjoys the highest minimum wage \nin the country. I wish to point out to our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, Washington State's economy has not been negatively impacted \nby our high minimum wage. In fact, our economy has benefited from a \nhigh minimum wage. Job growth has continued at a rate above the \nnational average. Payrolls in our restaurants and in our bars have \nexpanded because more people have more money in their pockets to spend \nout at dinner at night or on the weekend. Poverty in Washington State \nhas trailed the national level for at least 7 years.\n  It is not just in Washington State that we are seeing those \nsuccesses. In fact, this week the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch reported that of the 13 States that increased their minimum \nwage in early 2014, 11 of them have seen a gain in employment since \nthen, and half of the 10 fastest growing States by employment were \namong this group of minimum-wage raisers.\n  This is just one of many reasons why I strongly support increasing \nthe national minimum wage to $10.10. It is not going to make anyone \nrich, but for the 400,000 Washington residents who would be directly \nimpacted, it would mean an average annual raise of approximately $375. \nThat is no small amount for the over 48,000 in my State who would be \nlifted out of poverty with an increase in the minimum wage.\n  But we have to do more. In fact, today two-thirds of our families \nrely on income from both parents. Thanks to our outdated Tax Code, a \nwoman who is thinking about reentering the workforce as the second \nearner may face higher tax rates than her husband. That is unfair and \nit has got to change. So last month I introduced the 21st Century \nWorker Tax Cut Act, which would help solve that problem by giving \nstruggling two-earner families with children a tax deduction on the \nsecond earner's income.\n  My hope is that tomorrow here in the Senate we can come together on \nbehalf of the millions of Americans who, like my own mother when I was \ngrowing up, are the sole breadwinner and caregiver in their family. I \nhope our colleagues have gotten a sense of how $7.25 an hour translates \nto a grocery trip for a family of four or to shopping for school \nsupplies or even how it impacts making the daily commute.\n  That is why all of us are here today, this afternoon, to give that \nmom or that dad a fair shot at succeeding in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, if you live along the southeastern coast \nof the United States, you know the sea level is rising. We have a lot \nof people who would question the reason for this rise of the sea level. \nSome people deny there is climate change, that the Earth is warming up.\n  I think as we look at the science, we will clearly understand the \ngreenhouse effect is occurring. The more we put gases into the \natmosphere by human action such as carbon dioxide, the more the Sun's \nrays come in and reflect upon the Earth's surface and would naturally \nradiate out into space. The fact is, as the Earth's surface reflects \nthe Sun's rays back out into space, which is what Mother Nature \nintended, keeping the delicate balance of the temperature of the Earth, \nwhat happens when we put greenhouse gases such as CO2 into \nthe atmosphere, a shield or blanket, the effect of a greenhouse occurs.\n  As they reflect back out, they are trapped--the Sun's rays, the heat \nfrom them--and it continues to warm up the Earth. Thus, we have the \ngreenhouse effect.\n  One of the consequences of the greenhouse effect is that the icecaps \nin Greenland to the north and Antarctica to the south are melting. This \ncauses the sea level to rise.\n  Another effect of the greenhouse effect is that as the Earth's \ntemperature rises, most of the surface of the planet is covered with \nseawater. Therefore, the water absorbs that heat. That causes \nadditional effects such as the intensity, the frequency, the ferocity \nof storms that fuel the storm surge and power from the surface water \nthey consume.\n  Having said all of that, then, what are we seeing as a consequence? \nAs I said in my opening, if you live along the southeastern coast of \nthe United States, you know that seas are rising. The commerce \ncommittee, under the blessing of our chairman, Senator Rockefeller, \njust held a hearing in ground zero. Ground zero is Miami Beach, FL.\n  One of the people to testify was a NASA scientist, a Ph.D., who \nhappens to be a three-time shuttle astronaut. He testified in front of \nthe committee--not predictions, not forecasts, he testified what are \nthe actual measurements of the rise of the sea level over the course of \nthe last half century. That rise is anywhere from 5 to 8 inches along \nthe southeastern coast. The effects of that are being felt in southern \nFlorida. For instance, it is now a normal occurrence at high tide that \nwe are finding parts of Miami Beach are, in fact, flooded. The actual \nbeach itself and the dunes are higher than some of the land as it \nprogresses away from the ocean and the barrier island of Miami Beach \nbecomes lower.\n  There is a major north-south thoroughfare called Alton Road on Miami \nBeach. At high tide, it is frequent that Alton Road floods. What we are \nexpecting in seasonal high tides coming this October, just as they were \nlast October, is we will see maybe up to a foot of water in Alton Road.\n  Why does this occur if it is not flooding over the dunes by the \nbeach? Because Florida sits on a porous substrate of limestone. It is \nlike Swiss cheese. This is why people say: Well, why do you not do what \nthe Dutch did? The Dutch built dikes. They are under sea level; New \nOrleans, the same thing, dikes and canals. Under sea level. You cannot \ndo that in Florida, because with the porous limestone supporting the \nearth, the land, what happens is the rise in tides causes more \npressure, and it causes the saltwater to start to invade this honeycomb \nof limestone that supports the land of Florida and there you get \nsaltwater intrusion.\n  With the rising tides and rising sea levels, that water also starts \ncoming into the drainage systems that keep Florida dry. That is \nhappening now in Miami Beach at high tide. We had it last time in \nOctober in the seasonal high tides. We are going to have it again in \nthe high tides coming this October. So naturally this is going to cause \na considerable extra expense since you cannot build a dike for the \nlocal government, the State government, and the Federal Government to \nkeep people dry. I am happy to say the local governments of South \nFlorida have all banded together and you are seeing them speak with one \nvoice as they have, for example, not competing for a grant from the \nFederal Government but instead they have banded together and supported \nthe grant application for the city of Miami which is the first ground \nzero, in order for Miami to try to attack its problem.\n  There is an economic consequence to this as well, as we had someone \nfrom the Miami-Dade convention bureau come and point out. I can sum it \nup as I did during the hearing: No beach, no bucks. Florida is blessed \nsince we have more coastline than any other State save for Alaska, and \nwe certainly have more beach than any other State. Florida is blessed \nwith these beautiful beaches that people from all over the world want \nto come and enjoy.\n  No beach, no bucks. It is going to have a huge economic consequence, \nnot only in the cost of government to try to hold back the water but \nalso in lost business.\n  I will conclude my remarks by saying not the measurements, 5 to 8 \ninches. That has already been done. That has happened, 5 to 8 inches of \nsea level rise the last 50 years.\n  Now the forecast. The forecast in the scientific community--and we \nhad one of the scientists from one of the State universities testify, \nalong with the NASA scientist, is that it is going to be upwards of a \nfoot within the next 20 to 30 years. By the end of this century, we are \ntalking 2 to 3 feet.\n  Let me tell you what that means for the State of Florida. The State \nof Florida this year will surpass New York in population as the third \nlargest State, moving on toward 20 million people, and 75 percent of \nthat population is on the coast of Florida. The east coast, the west \ncoast, which is the gulf coast, is 75 percent of our population. If we\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\ndon't turn this back 2 to 3 feet by the end of this century, that 75 \npercent of our population will, in fact, be underwater.\n\n  We are trying to get insurance companies interested. We had a major \nreinsurer testify that although insurance policies are set--property \nand casualty policy premiums--in 1- to 3-year increments, over the \ncourse of time that is certainly going to change.\n  I conclude my remarks by complimenting the next Senator who is going \nto speak. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has been our conscience. \nHe and Senator Barbara Boxer have been ringing the bell on this issue \nfor months and for years in trying to get people to pay attention to \nwhat is happening.\n  I want Senator Whitehouse to share what he has done over his Easter \nvacation in trying to bring attention to this subject.\n  At the end of the day, we have to do something about it, and that \nmeans we are going to have to be very sensitive about all the stuff \nthat not only we, the United States of America, are putting into the \nair and creating that shield, that greenhouse effect, but we are going \nto have to get other countries that are polluting even more than we are \nto do the same.\n  Senator Whitehouse, I thank you for what you have done as you share \nyour story with us. You have done a courageous act of patriotism in \nbringing attention to this dramatic issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I understand the time is controlled now by the \nRepublicans. When Senator Hoeven arrives, I will yield the floor to \nhim. But in the meantime, I thank Senator Nelson for his leadership in \nthis area.\n  Let the record reflect that although Rhode Island may call itself the \nOcean State, Florida has its fair share of coastline as well. The \neffects on Florida's coast are really very significant.\n  Because time is short and because I see Senator Hoeven has arrived \nand because Senator Nelson is a modest individual who would not want to \nbrag on himself, let me say one thing and then I will come back later \nand discuss my Easter southern climate tour at greater length.\n  The Miami Herald is a very significant newspaper in Florida, and it \nattended and reacted to the Commerce Committee hearing Senator Nelson \nled in his home State. I want to read from two short sections that \nopened by saying:\n\n       For South Floridians, the topics of climate change and \n     rising sea levels are no longer to be dismissed as tree-\n     hugger mumbo-jumbo.\n       Pause next time you hear that parts of Miami Beach or the \n     intersection of A1A and Las Olas Boulevard have flooded \n     because of . . . high tides?\n       Let the light go off atop your head: It's science, stupid.\n       On Tuesday, Florida Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson \n     brought illumination to Miami Beach--Ground Zero for our \n     unique coastal battle with Mother Nature.\n\n  It concludes with these last few words:\n\n       South Florida owes Senator Nelson its thanks for shining a \n     bright light on this issue. Everyone from local residents to \n     elected officials should follow his lead, turning awareness \n     of this major environmental issue into action. It is critical \n     to saving our region.\n       If we don't, we'll soon have water--not sand--in our shoes.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 4:45 \np.m. today will be under the control of the Republicans.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise to discuss the Keystone XL Pipeline project. I \nwill be joined by a number of my colleagues, whom I will thank at the \nbeginning for joining me. They will come today with the same message \nthat I have; that is, the Keystone XL Pipeline project, the project \nthat has now been under review by this administration for more than 5 \nyears--we are now in year 6. We are on the floor of the Senate asking \nfor, quite simply, a vote to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline project. \nI have put legislation in on a number of occasions. In 2012 we approved \na time limit for the President to make a decision. I believe that bill \ngot on the order of 73 votes--strong bipartisan support. We attached it \nto the payroll tax holiday, and it said that the President had to make \na decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline within 90 days. He did. He \nturned it down, and he turned it down on the basis of the routing in \nNebraska.\n  So not only did the State of Nebraska go through an incredible amount \nof work, but the State Department and others went back to work, did a \nwhole new environmental impact statement after Nebraska had rerouted \nthe pipeline, which was approved by both its legislature and its \nGovernor, and came forward with a new route and a new environmental \nimpact statement. That was right at the beginning of 2012.\n  So we set a timeline for the President to make a decision. He made \nthe decision and he turned down the project, but we addressed the \nconcerns he raised. They were fully addressed.\n  Then later we also offered a resolution of support putting the Senate \non record in support of the project. That was attached to the budget \nresolution at the beginning of 2013. We came back the next year, and on \nthat occasion the Senate, with 62 votes, said: Hey, we support the \nproject. Here is a resolution in support of the project stating that it \nis, in fact, in the national interest and ought to be approved.\n  Since then the President has done nothing. Well, that is not quite \nright. Not only has he not made a decision now--and we are in the sixth \nyear after four environmental impact statements, all of which said \nthere is no significant environmental impact created by the project--\nnot only has the President not made a decision, with Congress on record \nsupporting the project, but, in fact, a little over 1 week ago on Good \nFriday, on the afternoon of Good Friday, when he figured nobody was \npaying any attention, the President came out and basically put out a \nstatement and said that not only has he not made a decision but he is \nnot going to make a decision, that on the basis of litigation he is \ngoing to postpone the decision indefinitely.\n  So we are in year 6, having met all of the requirements on numerous \noccasions on a project that will provide energy and jobs, that will \nhelp with national security by reducing our dependence on oil from the \nMiddle East, a project that his own Department of State, after \nenvironmental impact statement after environmental impact statement, \nhas come back and said will create no significant environmental impact, \nwill create 42,000 jobs, and will help us get energy and not only move \nenergy from States such as North Dakota and Montana in our country to \nthe refineries safely but also bring in oil from Canada to our country \nso we don't have to import it from the Middle East.\n  The President says: Well, we are in year 6, but I am going to \npostpone this decision indefinitely.\n  Here we are. We have a bill I introduced some time ago. We have 27 \ncosponsors on the bill, both parties. What the bill does, it approves \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline project congressionally. Instead of continuing \nto wait after 6 years and now the President's announcement that he is \ngoing to delay the decision indefinitely, passing this bill would \napprove the project congressionally.\n  The way that works is that under the foreign commerce clause in the \nConstitution, Congress has the authority to approve this project. They \nhave that authority under Congress's ability to oversee foreign \ncommerce, commerce with other nations. We know that because we took \ntime to research it. We had the Congressional Research Service do the \nresearch for us, and they say this is a constitutional authority of the \nCongress.\n  We have provided that bill. The bill has been filed. As I said, we \nhave 27 sponsors, and now it is time to vote.\n  We have been holding off on having a vote because the President said: \nYou know, we are going to go through the process--or he is going to go \nthrough the process and he is going to honor the process.\n  The environmental--actually, the fourth and supposedly final \nenvironmental impact statement came out at the end of January. There \nwas a 90-day comment period after that, which was to expire the first \npart of May. The expectation was that now that the process at that \npoint--once the process was exhausted, the President would, in fact, \nrender the long-awaited decision.\n  But, as I say, on Good Friday, a little over 1 week ago, he came out \nand said:\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\nNo, no decision. Furthermore, he is not going to make a decision, and \nthat delay is indefinite. So clearly the administration opposes the \nproject and they are going to defeat it with delay. They are going to \ndefeat it with endless delays. There is no amount of process that will \never be adequate for the administration. They will continue to delay \nthis decision, thinking that at some point it will go away, and so they \ndefeat the project through one delay after another. That is why it is \ntime to vote.\n  In a recent poll that was released last week, 70 percent of the \nAmerican people want this project approved--70 percent. That was a \nRasmussen poll.\n  The President is trying to defeat the project through delays in order \nto appease special interest groups while the American people very much \nwant this project approved. It is Congress's responsibility to take a \nstand. It is long past time to vote.\n  At this point, I am making some revisions to the legislation to \nupdate it for the final environmental impact statement. We are working \nto get every single Republican Member of this body on board, which I \nbelieve we will do, and as many Democratic Members as possible. We are \npushing as hard as we can to get a vote. It is time for the Senate to \nstand, exercise its responsibility, and vote.\n  Now the Senate majority leader is looking at moving to energy \nlegislation, energy efficiency legislation. That is good. Let's go \nthere. Let's have the debate. Let's offer amendments. Let's have votes. \nLet's do the work of the people that this body is elected to do.\n  As part of that, we are going to require a vote on the Keystone XL \nPipeline, a vote to approve it congressionally, and everybody can \ndecide where they stand. But this is a project which is long overdue. \nIt is time to vote, and it is time to vote on congressional approval. \nThat is our message today, and that is going to continue to be our \nmessage as we work on energy legislation.\n  I am very pleased to have other Members who have agreed to come join \nthis discussion. I turn to the good Senator from Kansas, the senior \nSenator from Kansas, somebody who has been in this body for a long \ntime, who has seen these issues, and who understands the responsibility \nwe have to vote on behalf of these issues, to take a stand for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from Kansas, a State through which this \npipeline passes, and ask him does he perceive that this project is in \nthe national interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would be more than happy to respond to my good friend and \ncolleague.\n  Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your bill, and thank you \nfor your statement. There is no question that this is in the national \ninterest--absolutely none.\n  I rise today to join my fellow Republican colleagues and then to \nextend the arm of cooperation to our friends across the aisle.\n  I want to express my deep disappointment in this administration's \nrepeated delay of the final approval of the Keystone Pipeline. I hope \nthat what the Senator has indicated will come true, that if in fact it \nis the wish of the majority leader to at least bring up an energy \nbill--and I hope he would not limit it, I hope he would allow \namendments to it--then with the support we have within the Congress we \ncould get going on something that is truly a jobs act as well as \nproviding for the national security.\n\n  The irony should not be lost on anyone that while those on the other \nside continue messaging and messaging and talking about supposed \ngovernment solutions to our high national unemployment rate--including \nemergency unemployment insurance, income inequality, minimum wage--we \nhave a project right before us waiting for approval that would create \ntens of thousands of jobs and all without using one dime of taxpayer \nmoney. If you want an actual solution to unemployment, here it is: \nProvide eager Americans with full-time jobs making well over the \nnational minimum wage. That is a jobs package.\n  Regarding the pipeline's environmental soundness, the Senator has \nbeen absolutely correct. Just last June the President indicated he \nwould not grant final approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline if it would \nexacerbate carbon emissions. The good news is this, Mr. President: The \nState Department has already indicated that the construction of the \npipeline will have no measurable impact--none--on increasing global \ncarbon emissions. So from an economic standpoint, it is a no-brainer, \nand from the scientific conclusions reached by this administration's \nown State Department regarding the environmental soundness of the \nproject, it is a no-brainer.\n  At the end of the day, the Canadian oil sands are going to be \ndeveloped. That is a fact. The real question is, Will that oil be \nshipped overseas? Will it be transported to the United States by rail \nor will it travel by pipeline? In fact, transporting oil via pipeline \nis the most environmentally sound way to do it.\n  Lastly--and this plays into the larger discussion we are having about \nthe escalating issues with regard to the Middle East, Ukraine, and \nRussia reverting again to a growling bear--why not send a strong \nmessage to the rest of the world--most especially to Russia--that we \nare serious about energy security? At last, at last, energy security; \nthat we will work with our friends in Canada to start challenging \nnationally run oil cartels as to who can supply our friends with needed \nenergy.\n  While the larger energy discussion regarding situations unfolding \naround the world are focused mostly on LNG, Russia's influence goes \nwell beyond natural gas. We should understand that. Just look at our \nown data produced by the Energy Information Administration, which shows \nthat Russia is second only to Saudi Arabia in exports of oil.\n  So this is our opportunity from a national security standpoint to \nsend an important message that the time of despotic governments wishing \nto wield power by controlling the flow of energy is coming to an end. \nLet's allow this project to be the first step in hopefully many more \ntoward showing we are serious as a government about achieving North \nAmerican energy security.\n  Again, this project has been reviewed, as has been noted by my \ndistinguished friend, for over 5 years, with five environmental impact \nstatements concluding it is safe. This project makes sense \neconomically, environmentally, and from a national security \nperspective. What does not make sense is yet another treading-water \nnon-decision, another delay beyond the fall elections. With regard to \nour national energy policy, it is long overdue for the United States to \nlead by leading.\n  Mr. President, approve the pipeline.\n  To the majority leader: Let us have an amendment--if, in fact, we do \ngo on to consider energy legislation this work period--that will be in \nthe best interest of every State in the Union, every American, for our \nnational security, and our overall energy policy.\n  I thank my colleague again for his leadership. I really appreciate \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for \nhis words today and for his support of this important project.\n  I would also like to turn to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nsomebody who truly believes we should have an ``all of the above'' \nenergy approach but one that means actually doing--not only producing \nfrom our traditional sources of fossil fuels but also our renewable \nsources. He is someone who also understands that if we are truly going \nto have an ``all of the above'' energy plan in this country and do it, \nnot just talk about it, we need the infrastructure to make it happen.\n  So I turn to the good Senator from Iowa and ask him: Isn't this the \nvital infrastructure this country needs in order to truly have an ``all \nof the above'' energy plan that works?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is a jobs bill, it is an energy bill, it is a \nnational security issue, and it sends the message around the world that \nwe are not going to be dependent upon the rest of the world for our \nenergy. It is all those things and probably a lot more, and I thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for putting this afternoon together and\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nalso, over a long period of time, being a spokesman for the Keystone XL \nPipeline not only here in the Senate, but I have seen the Senator on \nSunday news shows speaking to the entire Nation about the value of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  I think today we are saying enough is enough. We are saying it is \ntime to end the unjustified and--now we know--the political delay of \nthe construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am glad so many of my \ncolleagues are coming to the floor today to call for the approval of \nthis project.\n  The TransCanada Corporation applied for a Presidential permit from \nthe U.S. Department of State to construct and operate the Keystone XL \nPipeline way back in September of 2008. Yet here we are still talking \nabout it. For nearly 6 years this administration has been sitting on \nthe application. Time and time again the State Department, which has \nthe responsibility to review, reviewed the environmental impacts of the \npipeline, and once again, time and time again, they found that the \npipeline will have no significant impact on the environment.\n  In 2011 Secretary Clinton said a decision would come before the end \nof 2011. In March 2013, when President Obama was invited to come and \ntalk to Senate Republicans in our caucus--and he was told he could talk \nabout anything he wanted to talk about--one of the topics that came up \nwas that a decision would be made on this pipeline before the end of \n2013. He said that 13 months ago, yet still no decision.\n  As has been stated by my colleagues, on Good Friday afternoon of this \nyear, the State Department announced an indefinite delay in the comment \nperiod on the pipeline project. So it appears unlikely that President \nObama will make a decision at any time in the near future, if ever.\n  This indefinite delay is mind-boggling considering all the advantages \nof this pipeline. Granting the permit for the pipeline will create \nthousands of jobs directly and indirectly. It will provide more than \n800,000 barrels of Canadian oil daily from a friendly economic partner.\n  Rejection of the pipeline permit will not affect Canada's decision to \ndevelop these oil resources because they are smarter than we are. They \nhave made a national decision that they are going to harvest their \nenergy resources, whereas we are playing around as to whether we ought \nto do that. As we play around, we tend to be more dependent upon \nforeign sources. So the Keystone Pipeline is clearly in the national \ninterest of the United States. Yet President Obama is unwilling and \nunable--or maybe I should say ``or unable''--to make a decision.\n  Just think of the economy today and what this could do to improve the \neconomy, particularly with regard to the unemployment factor in our \neconomy, currently at 6.7 percent. That means 10 million jobs that are \nnot available for Americans. That number is the unemployed. The labor \nforce participation rate remains near a 35-year low, at 63.2 percent. \nIf the labor force participation rate were the same as when President \nObama took office, the unemployment rate would be 10.3 percent instead \nof 6.7 percent. With these deplorable unemployment numbers, one would \nthink the President would be very anxious to get as many people \nemployed as he could.\n  The President and the Senate majority here, which happens to be 55 \nDemocrats, should be doing everything they can to grow the economy and \ncreate jobs. This would be something that could be bipartisan. In fact, \nwe have already had bipartisan votes on this subject. Yet the Senate \nDemocratic leadership continues to block Senate action to approve the \npermit. Instead, they are proposing ideas that would actually cost jobs \nrather than create jobs at a time of 6.7 percent unemployment. For \nexample, later this week we in the Senate will vote on a proposal to \nincrease the minimum wage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded that this proposal will cost 500,000 jobs and perhaps as many \nas 1 million jobs. That is not the Republican Party making that \nstatement; that is the professional people of the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  It should be noted that while a higher minimum wage will benefit \nthose low-wage workers who remain employed, it will also push the least \nskilled, most disadvantaged, and most vulnerable workers out of \nemployment. We should be doing everything to increase employment, not \nhaving more people laid off.\n  We have the health care reform bill--another great example. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year that the health \ncare reform bill will result in 2\\1/2\\ million fewer workers in our \nworkforce by 2025.\n  President Obama has also proposed another $1.8 trillion in new taxes \nin his latest budget proposal. Higher taxes stifle economic growth and \ncost jobs.\n  The policies being advocated by the majority party and by the \nPresident limit opportunities for working families, reduce economic \ngrowth, and prevent the economy from achieving its full potential.\n  Obviously, getting back to the Keystone Pipeline, the decision to \ngrant the permit for that pipeline is no longer being considered based \non policy but based on politics. That is too bad for America's energy \nconsumers and thousands of job seekers who would benefit.\n  I don't happen to come from the oil patches of Texas, Oklahoma, or \nNorth Dakota. There are no oil or gas producers in my State. But I do \nsupport an energy policy that is truly ``all of the above.'' I \nrepresent farmers and consumers who want access to affordable, reliable \nenergy. I represent Iowans who would rather get their energy from a \nfriend and ally such as Canada rather than Venezuela or unstable parts \nof the Middle East, where they will take our money and probably use it \nto train people who want to kill Americans. I represent Iowans who \nactually know that this oil will be developed regardless of this \npipeline, and they know it is just a question of whether it will come \nto the United States or end up in China.\n  I represent Iowans who understand the economic and national security \nimpact of this pipeline. They want to see the government get out of the \nway of this shovel-ready, private-sector infrastructure project.\n  How many times were we promised in the stimulus bill that we were \ngoing to create X number of jobs that were shovel ready? Most of that \n$800 billion went to public employment, not to shovel-ready jobs. The \nPresident even admitted that.\n  This pipeline is shovel ready. It is time to end the political delay \nand approve this pipeline.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, who has \nmade the case so well, and I look to his experience on energy issues \nand ag issues and his understanding of what it takes to truly have an \nall-of-the-above energy policy. As he said so well, it is not only \nneeded infrastructure but it is jobs.\n  Here we are, talking about getting the economy going and getting \npeople back to work. This doesn't cost one penny of Federal spending, \nand it puts people to work and creates hundreds of millions of dollars \nin revenue to help reduce our deficit and our debt.\n  So we are talking about putting people back to work, we are talking \nabout energy for this country, we are talking about revenues to reduce \nthe debt, and the administration refuses to make a decision. It is \nalmost beyond belief.\n  I turn next to the Senator from Alabama, the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee. He speaks eloquently and often on the need to balance \nour budget, on the need to reduce the deficit and the debt and to get \nour spending under control.\n  So here we have a project that, without spending one penny, will \ngenerate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues to help reduce the \ndeficit and debt while we put people to work.\n  Those statistics are provided by this administration's State \nDepartment. Those aren't our statistics. Those statistics come out of \nthe environmental impact statement put together by the State Department \nof this administration.\n  So I turn to the Senator from Alabama, somebody who has led on the \nneed to get this economy going, to create good, quality jobs and to \nreduce the deficit and debt. I ask the good the Senator from Alabama: \nWon't this project help do all of those things?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Hoeven.\n  The Senator is exactly right; it will do all of those things. It is a \nstep in the right direction in every area.\n  I appreciate my leader on the Judiciary Committee and ranking member, \nSenator Grassley. I would ask a rather simple question of Senator \nGrassley which ought not to be forgotten in this process. If a pipeline \nis built and an additional source of gasoline is brought into the \nMidwest or other areas, if it is not cheaper than the gas that is \nalready being supplied, isn't it true that nobody will buy it?\n  So won't this mean an opportunity for people in the whole country to \nbe able to have another source of fuel which would be less costly and \nhelp bring down costs?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to yield.\n  I think that is very basic economics: Increase supply and reduce \nprice.\n  The other matter is it makes us more energy independent. We spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars every day to import oil. There is no \nsense doing that when we can get it right here in North America.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  I thank Senator Hoeven for his steadfast, consistent, principled \nleadership on this important issue. He has been there consistently. I \ndon't think there is any Senator in this body who understands the \ndetails of this issue more than he does. It is just a positive thing \nfor America. It just is, and I thank the Senator for his efforts.\n  We have been reviewing this for 5 years. Legally, as I see this \nsituation, it is this: There is no Federal law at this time dealing \nwith this issue. Presidents have issued Executive orders that created a \nmechanism to allow the State Department to review a request for a \npipeline like Keystone XL. But clearly there is no doubt that Congress \nhas every right to legislate on this issue. Just because we haven't \nyet, that doesn't mean we never will or never should, and I strongly \nbelieve that with the failed leadership of President Obama on this \nquestion, we are going to have to pass legislation. It is just that \ncritical.\n  The Secretary of State has essentially asserted that under these \nExecutive orders the State Department must evaluate the environmental \nissue. They have dealt with that, and they have satisfied that \nenvironmental process. There is the question left of the national \ninterest.\n  So if we don't have a serious environmental issue--which I don't \nthink we do, and pretty clearly we don't--then the question is: What is \nin the national interest?\n  Senator Hoeven represents a state on the border with Canada, and we \nhave good relations with Canada.\n  First, I don't think there is any nation in the world with which we \nneed to maintain and enhance our relationship more than with our good \npartner, Canada.\n  Second, let me ask the Senator this. The Senator is close to Canada. \nHe knows the situation. If this pipeline is not approved, will it \nweaken and harm our relationship with our good neighbor, Canada, or \nwill it make it better?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, Prime Minister Harper of Canada has said \non a number of occasions how important this project is to Canada. The \nAmbassador of Canada to the United States is Gary Doer, somebody who \nwas formerly the Premier of Manitoba and somebody I worked with when I \nwas Governor of North Dakota. We worked together for about a decade on \nall kinds of issues. As the Senator said, Canada is our closest friend \nand ally, and they are a huge energy producer. And we are producing \nmore energy.\n  So here is a project which is incredibly important to Canada. It is \nan opportunity for us to get more energy, both energy that we are \nproducing and energy from Canada, rather than from the Middle East--\nsomething the American people very much want. If we don't approve it, \nwhat are we saying to our closest friend and ally, when they have said \nvery clearly and repeatedly, this project is very, very important to \nthem?\n  To add irony to that indignity, they will still produce the oil, but \nthey will be forced to send it to China. So we will import oil from the \nMiddle East and force our closest friend and ally to export their oil \nto China, creating more greenhouse gas emissions, not less? That is \nwhat happens if we don't approve the project.\n  If the President refuses to do it, then we have the responsibility to \nstep up and do it. Yes, the Senator is 100 percent right that it is not \nonly a project that our people very much want approved but it is also \nsomething the people of Canada and the Government of Canada very much \nwant approved. So the Senator is right.\n  I would yield the floor back to the good Senator from Alabama and \nencourage him to bring in our esteemed colleagues from South Dakota and \nSouth Carolina as well into this important discussion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is so correct. In my time here in the \nSenate, this is one of the most inexplicable actions by a President I \nhave ever seen. He has persisted in this after months and years have \ngone by and when the facts continue to come forward that justify this \npipeline--for jobs in America, for lower energy costs in America, for \nimporting oil from our ally Canada, where the people buy a great deal \nfrom us. Any wealth that goes to Canada, we can be sure a lot of that \nwill come back to the United States because they purchase a great deal \nfrom us. But does Venezuela or Saudi Arabia or other countries that we \nbuy oil from buy a lot from us? No.\n  So this is a partnership and relationship which benefits both \nparties. I just am astounded that it has not been approved to date.\n  The Washington Post editorial board wrote last week that the \nPresident's decision to delay the Keystone Pipeline was ``absurd.'' \nThis is an independent, liberal-leaning newspaper that cares about the \nenvironment. So it seems the President is clearly acquiescing in favor \nof special interests.\n  Senator Thune is familiar with Mr. Tom Steyer, who a recent \nAssociated Press article characterized as ``a former hedge fund manager \nand environmentalist, who says he will spend $100 million--$50 million \nof his own money and $50 million from other donors''--to defeat \nRepublicans to promote environmental issues. He asked for some things \nif he is going to put up $100 million.\n  I am not happy about it. I believe the interests of the people of \nthis country have been subordinated to either an extreme \nenvironmentalist agenda or to plain money. There is no other rational \nbasis for the position we find ourselves in. It is really tragic.\n  We need jobs in this country. We have the fewest percentage of people \nworking in America today in the working age group since 1975. Median \nincome has dropped over $2,000 to $2,600. We are not doing well. These \nare high-paying jobs. It keeps growth and creativity here in the United \nStates and in North America through our partner, Canada.\n  I am grateful to see others who are so interested in this issue. I \nfeel really strongly we should move forward with this. It is the right \nthing to do. It is not politics. It is the right thing.\n  A lot of Democratic members favor this pipeline. Union groups, who \ntend to be Democrats, favor this pipeline. It is not a Republican-\nDemocratic issue. This is an extremist issue against a commonsense \nissue. Sixty-two Senators voted for a budget amendment last year during \nthe Senate budget debate that was supportive of the Keystone pipeline.\n  My good staffer Jeff Wood found a Charles Dickens quote about the \nfictional ``Circumlocution Office,'' of which Dickens wrote:\n\n       Whatever was required to be done, the Circumlocution Office \n     was beforehand with all the public departments in the art of \n     perceiving--how not to do it. . . . [W]ith projects for the \n     general welfare . . . , which in slow lapse of time and agony \n     had passed safely through other public departments . . . got \n     referred at last to the Circumlocution Office, and never \n     reappeared in the light of day. Boards sat upon them, \n     secretaries minuted upon them, commissioners gabbled about \n     them, clerks registered, entered, checked, and ticked them \n     off, and they melted away. In short, all the business of the \n     country went through the Circumlocution Office, except the \n     business that never came out of it . . .\n       (Chapter 10 of Charles Dickens' ``Little Dorrit,'' 1855).\n\n  In my opinion, this bill would create thousands of good jobs if it is \npassed and this pipeline is built. It would strengthen, not weaken, our \nrelationship with Canada. It would bring a new\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nflow of oil into the United States and the Midwest which will provide \ncompetition and which would reduce costs. It would be a competitive \nsource of energy for America.\n  Canada is a good trading partner. They buy a lot from us. The oil \nwill be sold somewhere else if it is not sold in the United States.\n  By the way, pipelines are everywhere in this country. In my State of \nAlabama, pipelines crisscross the State. We don't have any problems \nwith this. The idea that we can't build another pipeline in this \ncountry is about as ludicrous as one can imagine.\n  So I thank Senator Hoeven for the great leadership he has provided. I \nappreciate the opportunity to join with him. It is the right thing for \nthe people of this country, and we need to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama not only for his outstanding argument but for his passion as \nsomebody who truly cares about getting this economy going.\n  I would turn to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and also \nto the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I would like to ask that \nthey both engage in this discussion, starting with the good Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  In South Dakota they understand how to create a good business \nclimate. They have no income tax. They have a strong economy because \nthey understand what it takes to create a good environment so that \nbusinesses will invest and grow and create jobs. I would like to ask \nthe Senator how this relates to the discussion of the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  To the distinguished senior Senator from Texas--clearly Texas knows \nenergy production--I would ask for his thoughts in terms of how \nimportant this infrastructure is for energy development and production \nin our State.\n  First, I would like to turn to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me just say to my colleague from North Dakota that we \nwould like to have more North Dakota energy in South Dakota, of course, \nand have the direct benefit of that, but we focus in our State on jobs, \nand that is what this is all about--jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  The President's own State Department says that this project would \nsupport 42,000 jobs--16,100 direct jobs including construction, and \nanother 26,000 jobs that would be from indirect spending. That is not \nus. That is not the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Texas, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from Missouri on this side \nsaying it would create jobs. That is the President's own State \nDepartment saying it would create jobs and $2 billion in earnings--a \n$3.4 billion contribution to the U.S. economy. When you think about the \nStates that are impacted--the State of North Dakota directly and my \nState of South Dakota would be traversed by the pipeline--we have a lot \nof local and State governments that would benefit from this.\n  They say in the first year of operations it would generate $55.6 \nmillion of tax revenue, $17.9 million in my State of South Dakota. When \nyou talk about what that can do in terms of infrastructure, what it can \ndo in terms of providing revenue to build schools, public services, \nthose sorts of things, it takes the pressure off the local property tax \nowners, area ranchers, homeowners, and businesses. That is another \nimpact.\n  I would also say to my colleagues on the floor that it would \nstrengthen our energy security. Some 830,000 barrels a day would come \nthrough that pipeline. That is half of what we import from the Middle \nEast and about the total of what we import on a daily basis from \nVenezuela. So if you look at how much we can ship from that pipeline \nand how much that lessens the dependence we have on areas of the world \nthat are much less favorable to the United States than is our neighbor \nof Canada, that is a very real consideration in this debate.\n  Finally, I would say to my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota--\nand I thank him for his leadership on this issue--that the time to act \nis now. This has been studied and scrutinized and reviewed more than \nany project in history--8\\1/2\\ years, 2,048 days as of Tuesday, today, \nApril 29. Five environmental reviews all concluded the pipeline would \nnot have a significant impact on the environment. Just when you thought \nthe process couldn't be dragged out any longer, this administration \nonce again decided to block construction of this project and delay the \nnational interest determination process.\n  Sean McGarvey, President of North America's Building Trades Union, \ncalled this latest move:\n\n     . . . a cold, hard slap in the face for hard working \n     Americans who are literally waiting for President Obama's \n     approval and the tens of thousands of jobs it will generate.\n\n  That comes from a labor union leader in this country. The unions want \nthis, businesses in this country want it, and the American people want \nit by overwhelming margins. The only people who don't want it are some \nof the President's political supporters who, as the Senator from \nAlabama has pointed out, are extending hundreds, hundreds of millions \nof dollars, tens of millions of dollars, $400 million, as the Senator \nfrom Alabama pointed out. That is what is holding this up.\n  It is an offense to the American people to have a project like this \nthat can do so much in terms of job creation and lessening our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy and helping millions of \nAmericans who are looking for work and simply being held up by the \nPresident of the United States. I hope the Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans would come together to pass legislation that supports this \npipeline's being built, whether the President agrees to it or not.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota and turn to our colleague from the State of \nOklahoma, certainly a State that understands energy production and \nunderstands how vital this pipeline infrastructure is. So with the \nindulgence of the Senator from Texas, I would ask to return to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator from Texas yielding at this \ntime.\n  Every time I hear people talking about the jobs at stake here I think \nabout my State of Oklahoma, which probably has more jobs at stake than \nany other state because Cushing, OK, is the crossroads of the pipeline \nnow throughout America.\n  Looking at this chart, just over 2 years ago President Obama came to \nCushing to give a speech on national TV with all the pipeline in the \nbackground. You can see these tubes over there. He talked about how \nthis is a major breakthrough and that we are going to `` . . . cut \nthrough the red tape, break through bureaucratic hurdles and make this \nproject a priority, to go ahead and get it done.''\n  Yet he has done nothing but obstruct this since that time. The \nsouthern leg of the pipeline may be finished, but that was part of the \nproject that the President didn't have any say in. The President could \ndo something when you cross international lines, but he could not do it \nfrom that point south. The portion between Canada and Cushing is \ncompletely stalled because the President has delayed making a decision, \nas has been said, for 5 years now.\n\n  To me the Keystone XL Pipeline is the tip of the iceberg when it \ncomes to the way President Obama thinks about the oil and natural gas \nindustry. Today we heard great speeches from many of my colleagues, and \nthey are highlighting the great impact of the Keystone Pipeline's \nconstruction and what it would mean to the economy. We know that it \nwould directly create 42,000 jobs and 10,000 more would be supported by \nthe overall manufacturing materials and processes that are required to \ncomplete the project, but the real impact on the President's failure to \nact on Keystone can be seen in this chart.\n  This chart shows the potential around this country. These are federal \nlands. If we were able to develop these federal lands, what all would \nbe involved here? You know, it is incredible that we have a President \nwho talks about being friendly to oil and gas and denies the war \nagainst fossil fuels. While we have had an increase in production on \nState and private land of some 40 percent, on the Federal land\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nwe have had a decrease in production of 16 percent. I don't know how \nthat is even possible, but the midstream infrastructure and the \npipelines in particular are one of the most important things we need to \nfully develop in these resources. We need to be able to move oil and \ngas from areas where it has been developed to areas where it is \nrefined, processed, and consumed. The need for infrastructure expansion \nis astounding.\n  ICF International is a consulting firm, and I think their credibility \nhas been established. They released a report last week that says U.S. \ncompanies will need to invest $641 billion over the next 20 years in \ninfrastructure to keep up with the growing oil and gas production. That \nis just what they know about that right now. If you add to that what \nwould happen if they were able to open all of this and end the war on \nfossil fuels, look at the potential we would have in this country.\n  The increase in oil and gas production we have seen in recent years \nhas occurred solely on State and private lands. There are many things \nPresident Obama could do to make the numbers far higher. In fact, we \ncould have total energy independence in a matter of months, not a \nmatter of years, if the President were to lift his ban on federal \nlands.\n  So the President has continued his war on fossil fuels. The \nPresident's efforts have been intently focused on hurting the \nproduction of oil and gas resources--be it through stall tactics or \nefforts to establish complex and confusing regulations on the hydraulic \nfracturing process. Every way we turn we see President Obama trying to \nput the oil and gas industry out of business.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is the bellwether of energy policy today. It \nis a simple decision. I know many of my colleagues have talked about it \nand have had the information, as the leader of our group has here \ntoday, on what we could be doing in this country. Yet there is some \nkind of assumption that if we don't complete the pipeline, they will \nstop the process up in Alberta, Canada. They are going to continue, but \nit is going to be China and other countries that are going to benefit \nfrom it. So I applaud the Senator for the great work he is doing. We \nhave to let the American people know of the potential we have right \nhere in this country and develop that potential. I thank the Senator \nfrom Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his work on this important issue, and I turn to the \nSenator from Texas, a State that produces more oil and gas than any \nother State in the Union, and ask for his thoughts and support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership from the \nSenator from North Dakota. He has been a champion of this important \nprogram that enjoys the support of huge bipartisan majorities all \nacross the country because they understand the importance of energy \nsecurity. They understand the importance of getting this energy from a \nfriendly country such as Canada. They understand the jobs that go along \nwith it. They understand the need for hard-working American families to \nhave affordable energy, whether it is gasoline, heating fuel or the \nlike. So this makes sense on so many different levels, but I have to \nsay that really the biggest obstacle is the Federal Government itself.\n  Not approving this pipeline makes exactly zero sense. I know some \npeople are put off a little bit--I would say to the Senator from North \nDakota--by the idea of a new pipeline as if this is some novel \ncreation. But just as an exercise in my own personal edification, I \nhappened to Google--or maybe it was Bing or some other search engine--\n``oil and gas pipelines'' on the Internet, and I was astonished at the \nhuge complex interplay of oil and gas pipelines all across the United \nStates of America. Most Americans aren't even aware they exist because \nthey safely operate, and they move this oil and gas around the country \nin a way that benefits our economy and creates jobs and helps us put \npeople back to work which is the most important thing we can do.\n  So we know for the last 5 years, since the great recession, we have \nhad an economy characterized by stubbornly slow economic growth and \npersistently high unemployment. We have the smallest percentage of \npeople actually participating in the workforce since World War II. We \nhave seen a decline in median household incomes, so average hard-\nworking families have seen their income go down, and we have seen this \nnagging sense of uncertainty about the future, not just because of the \neconomy but because of the obstacles the Federal Government puts in its \nway.\n  I would ask the Senator from North Dakota--I know that North Dakota \nhas had some experience here--by not building this pipeline, what are \nthe other ways that this oil is being transported, and what is the risk \nand benefit associated with that? People may think this is sort of an \neither/or--you either have the oil flow or not. But the truth is there \nare other alternatives, but they are not necessarily in the public \ninterest or as safe as this pipeline might be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. To respond to the Senator from Texas, of course, by not \nhaving a median pipeline infrastructure we are forced to move oil by \nother means and that means primarily railcars, and it is overburdening \nour rail system. As you have seen, we have had accidents, and it is \njust the overburdening of the current capacity of our rail system.\n  For example, in North Dakota we produce a million barrels of oil a \nday. Over 700,000 now has to move by rail car because we don't have \nadequate pipelines. So this is not just about bringing oil from Canada \nto the United States. It is also about moving oil from States such as \nMontana and North Dakota to refineries in the most efficient and safest \nway possible. For example, the Keystone XL Pipeline on the day it opens \nwill take 500 trucks a day off some of our roads in the western part of \nour State. So it is clearly a safety issue. The State Department says \nif this pipeline isn't built, to move that amount of oil you would have \nto move 1,400 railcars a day. That is 14 unit trains of 100 railcars a \nday. Clearly, we don't have that rail capacity. Clearly we don't have \nthat rail capacity, so we need this vital infrastructure. We can't \ndevelop the energy in this country and work with Canada to truly become \nenergy independent without vital infrastructure, which this project \nrepresents.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know there are other Senators who wish to speak, and I \nwill conclude on this point. It is with some sense of appreciation that \nI note the two lowest unemployment rate cities and regions in the \ncountry are, I believe, Bismarck, ND, and Midland-Odessa, the Permian \nBasin in Texas. Not coincidentally, those are the sites of some of the \nshale gas and the oil and gas production we are seeing that is thanks \nto modern drilling techniques and innovative practices that produce \nthis American renaissance in energy, for which we should be enormously \ngrateful.\n  This is the way to get our economy back on track. This is the way to \nextract ourselves from dangerous parts of the world and unreliable \nsources of energy. And this is the way to get Americans back to work.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership, and I am happy to participate \nin this colloquy. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the esteemed Senator from \nTexas.\n  I wish to turn to the distinguished Senator from Missouri for his \nthoughts on the importance of this project and the need for our country \nto become energy independent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank my friend for leading this \ncolloquy. I think the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Scott, is going \nto speak for a few minutes before I do, and then I will be glad to \nenter into this discussion. It is an important topic. Nobody has been a \ngreater leader on this than my friend from North Dakota, and I thank \nhim for organizing this colloquy, as many of us wish to come to the \nfloor today to speak on this critical issue.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I turn to the Senator from South Carolina \nand I welcome his comments on this important topic.\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his strong \nleadership on that which is obvious to most of us, which is the need to \nmove forward on the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I was a businessman before I arrived here in Congress and I will tell \nmy colleagues that our goal in business was to do the right thing. As a \nSenator, I wish to do the right thing for all of the American people. \nThanks to the strong leadership of Senator Hoeven, we have an \nopportunity to do just that. Yet this administration continues to \nignore policies that would help hard-working, hard-hit American \nfamilies.\n  I think back several years ago when I was growing up in a single-\nparent household, and I think about the very difficult choices my mom \nhad to make between food and gas and energy consumption. What a \nhorrible position to put any American family in. Yet every single day \nwe delay a decision on the pipeline, we say to struggling families: Not \nnow, not here, but maybe later. That is not the right message to send \non the broader topic of this energy economy.\n  The fact is, if we factor in incomes under $30,000, 25 percent of \nthat income goes toward energy consumption. What a difficult position \nto find a single parent in, struggling to make ends meet. Yet we have \nan opportunity not only to address that issue in the broader topic of \nthe energy conversation but to specifically address the issue faced by \nmillions and millions of Americans, and that is the issue of \nunemployment.\n  The pipeline is not an issue of politics, it is an issue of the \nAmerican people. The fact is that over 42,000 jobs would be created and \nwe would pump billions of dollars into the Nation's economy. Yet the \nadministration simply says--after 5\\1/2\\ years, after several studies--\nwe should wait a little longer, as if we have not waited long enough, \nwith those 42,000 American families who could be positively impacted by \ngoing back to work. How long should we wait to see this administration \ndo the right thing?\n  I support this proposal. I support the legislation. I support \ncongressional action to move this administration into a position where \n61 percent of the American people already find themselves. They are \nalready saying, Let's move forward on the pipeline. They are ready to \nsee action on constructing the pipeline because they understand that if \nwe can't solve this simple issue, where there is already bipartisan \nsupport, how do we address the deeper challenges in the energy economy?\n  I don't often find myself in the position to quote from members or \neven presidents of labor unions. I have to gulp when I make my next \nstatement, because it is so rare, so foreign to me. But I will say that \nTerry O'Sullivan, general president of the Laborers' International \nUnion of North America, got it right when he said, ``This is once again \npolitics at its worst.''\n  Here we see an amazing collaboration between labor unions, Democratic \nSenators, Republican Senators, and conservative groups, all coming \ntogether, asking--even begging--the President to do the right thing. I \ndon't know exactly what it will take to get the President to do what he \nsaid during a lunch meeting with all of the Republican Senators when he \nsaid, Do you know what we should do? By the end of 2013, we should find \nourselves with a decision coming out of his office, his administration. \nYet this is 2014. It reminds me a little bit of ObamaCare; they \ncontinue to move the deadlines.\n  We need action for the American people and we need action for the \nAmerican people right now.\n  Let me close, Mr. President by thinking through where we are today on \nsuch a simple decision. I believe 62 Senators in this body during the \nbudget resolution debate supported moving forward on the Keystone \nPipeline; is that correct?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I believe we have had a number of votes over the last 2 \nyears where many Senators have said, have voted, and have written \nletters asking for action on this pipeline. I think that is correct. \nYet if we can't solve a bipartisan issue on the pipeline today, how do \nwe start solving the broader issues regarding energy, including \noffshore energy production? How do we get ourselves into a position, I \nsay to the Senator from Alaska, where we could have a conversation \nabout offshore production? My State could see 7,500 new jobs and $2.2 \nbillion annually added to our economy, and $87.5 million of new revenue \ngenerated for my State. But we can't solve the simple, bipartisan-\nsupported effort of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n  I thank Senator Hoeven for his strong leadership and I hope we will \nfind it possible to move this legislation forward quickly, and let's \nget it done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nputting this issue in very human terms, including what it means for \npeople in this country who want a job. I thank him for his passion on \nthis important issue.\n  I turn now to the Senator from Missouri for his input on this \nimportant issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for pointing out \nthat bad Economic Policies have the most impact on the most vulnerable \namong us, including the number he gave of the percentage of income of \nfamilies who have less than $30,000 of income a year, how much of that \nalready goes to energy.\n  The administration says they are for an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy. That appears to be an all-of-the-above energy policy unless we \nknow it works and unless we know it is available and unless we know we \ncould get it, in this case, from a friendly source. Somehow, they are \nnot for that. They are for ``all of the above'' until we really look at \nwhat is there and what we know works and what makes our current energy \nneeds met in the best way.\n  The pipeline is an example of a solution that would decrease our \ncountry's dependence on nations we can't rely on quite as heavily. It \nincreases our trading relationship with our very best trading partner. \nThat oil is going to be sold to somebody and a pipeline will be built. \nThe question is, Is the pipeline built to connect to the most logical \ncustomer and the best trading partner and come south or does the \npipeline go to the west and the oil goes to Asia? This is not about \nwhether the oil comes out of the ground. It is not about whether a \npipeline gets built. It is about whether we do that which makes the \nmost sense.\n  On April 18, the State Department, by the direction of the President, \nonce again, said we are going to wait a little while longer. How many \ndeadlines do we have to blow by? I think it is interesting that in the \nlast couple of months when people have left the administration--when \nthe Secretary of the Interior leaves and is asked about the pipeline, \nhe says, Oh, of course we should build the pipeline. When the Secretary \nof Energy leaves and is asked about the pipeline, he says, Oh, of \ncourse we should build the pipeline. Everybody knows that the logical, \ncommonsense thing to do is to build this pipeline and let us benefit \nfrom this energy. It has become an example of a commonsense decision \nversus regulators out of control--regulators who don't want us to use \nthe resources we have or the resources that are right next to us.\n  The national security implications of Canadian oil are pretty great \nand pretty obvious for everybody to figure out. The economic security \nimplications of doing business with somebody who does business with \nus--every time we send the Canadians a dollar, for decades, they have \nsent us back at least 90 cents. Every time we involve ourselves in that \ntrade and strengthen their economy, they turn right back around and \nstrengthen our economy. Why wouldn't we want to do that?\n  Just the cost alone of building the pipeline, talk about a shovel-\nready project: 20,000 jobs, not a single taxpayer dollar involved. In \nfact, the company immediately starts paying taxes to State and local \ngovernment as that pipeline is extended through communities and almost \nall of our States. Another 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Roughly 6 \npercent of all of our daily imports come from this one new source. But, \nas others have pointed out, that pipeline then becomes available for \nother objectives as well. A bipartisan determination on this floor has \nshown that we should obviously build this pipeline.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n  We constantly talk about private sector job creation. Believe me, it \nis not just building and producing more American energy that are the \njobs created, it is the jobs created when we have a utility bill we can \nrely on and a delivery system we can count on. People will make things \nin the United States again. The right kind of American energy policy \nbecomes immediately the right kind of American manufacturing policy.\n  The pipeline has almost become the tip of the iceberg that everybody \nhas their eye on, but it is an example of the problem that we refuse to \ndo things that will make our economy stronger, make our families \nstronger, and create jobs in America that have better take-home pay \nthan the jobs that people have seen in the last 5 years. The take-home \npay for American families has gone down and down and down in every one \nof those years when we look at the surveys.\n  This is a fight worth having. Again, nobody has been more dedicated \nto that effort than the Senator from North Dakota who understands what \na difference energy can make in the State. He saw that happen as \nGovernor. We have seen that happen in the State he lives in. The right \nkind of American energy policy can provide so many of those exact same \nbenefits for the United States of America. This is one of the easy \nexamples to talk about, out of a volume of examples of the \nadministration clearly headed on a path that makes no sense when we \nreally look at the national security impact, the economic impact, or, \nmost importantly, the impact on American families.\n  I again thank the Senator for leading this fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Missouri and turn to our ranking \nmember on the Energy Committee, the Senator from Alaska, who deals with \nenergy issues every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I wish to thank my colleague from North Dakota. I have \nhad an opportunity to go to North Dakota and see firsthand how, in \nSenator Hoeven's State, they are embracing this energy renaissance we \nare seeing in this country--a renaissance that is truly allowing us to \nmove forward with jobs and economic opportunity not only for the good \nof this country but really for the good of so many others.\n  When we are talking about our neighbors to the north in Canada--or if \none is from Alaska our neighbors to the east--there is a recognition \nthat the United States and Canada are really joined at the well, if you \nwill. That is a term I have used quite frequently.\n  But when it comes to energy issues, there are 17 operating oil \npipelines between the United States and Canada. There are another 30 \nelectric transmission lines. There are 29 natural gas pipelines. This \nis all energy infrastructure that crosses the border with Canada--\nwhether it is into Montana, Washington, North Dakota, Michigan, \nMinnesota, New York, Vermont, Idaho, Maine.\n  You have to wonder--you have to wonder--are not these all in the \nnational interest? What is so unique, what is so compelling about this \nKeystone XL Pipeline that it is not only taking the 5 years of study \nthat has already been done but is now on indefinite hold for yet \nfurther study?\n  So it causes one to kind of go back in time. Let's look at some of \nthe pipelines that have been already determined as being in the \nnational interest.\n  Back in August of 2009, the Department of State signed off on \nEnbridge Energy's Alberta Clipper Pipeline. When you look at what they \ndid in signing off on that, it is exactly what we are talking about \nhere with the Keystone XL. It said--and this is coming from the \nnational interest determination on the Alberta Clipper. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that application printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  7.0 Decision and Basis for Decision\n\n       The Deputy Secretary of State has determined that a \n     Presidential Permit will be issued to Enbridge Energy, \n     Limited Partnership to construct, connect, operate, and \n     maintain facilities at the border for the transport of crude \n     oil between the United States and Canada across the \n     international boundary, as described in the Application for a \n     Presidential Permit dated May 15, 2007 and as further amended \n     by the subsequent filings of Enbridge with the DOS and by \n     information incorporated into the Final EIS issued June 5, \n     2009. The Deputy Secretary also finds that:\n       Construction and Operation of the Alberta Clipper Project \n     Serves the National Interest--The addition of crude oil \n     pipeline capacity between the Western Canada Sedimentary \n     Basin (WCSB) and the United States serves the strategic \n     interests of the United States for the following reasons:\n       It increases the diversity of available supplies among the \n     United States' worldwide crude oil sources in a time of \n     considerable political tension in other major oil producing \n     countries and regions. Increased output from the WCSB can be \n     utilized by a growing number of refineries in the United \n     States that have access and means of transport for these \n     increased supplies.\n       It shortens the transportation pathway for a sizeable \n     portion of United States crude oil imports. Crude oil \n     supplies in Western Canada represent the largest and closest \n     foreign supply source to domestic refineries that do not \n     require, in contrast to other suppliers, many days or weeks \n     of marine transportation.\n       It increases crude oil supplies from a major non-\n     Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries producer which \n     is a stable and reliable ally and trading partner of the \n     United States, with which we have free trade agreements which \n     augment the security of this energy supply.\n       Moreover, the United States and Canada, through bilateral \n     diplomacy and a Clean Energy Dialogue process that is now \n     underway, are working across our respective energy sectors to \n     cooperate on best practices and technology, including carbon \n     sequestration and storage, so as to lower the overall \n     environmental footprint of our energy sectors. The Government \n     of Canada and the Province of Alberta have also set \n     greenhouse gas reduction targets and implementation programs \n     to help them achieve them.\n       Approval of this permit will also send a positive economic \n     signal, in a difficult economic period, about the future \n     reliability and availability of a portion of United State's \n     energy imports, and in the immediate term, will provide \n     construction jobs.\n       It provides additional supplies of crude oil to make up for \n     the continued decline in imports from several other major \n     U.S. suppliers.\n       Construction and Operation of the Alberta Clipper Project \n     Meets Environmental Protection Policies--The DOS concludes \n     that the proposed Alberta Clipper Project, if designed, \n     constructed, and operated in accordance with the Project \n     Description in Section 2.0 of the FEIS, as amended by \n     additional approaches and mitigation measures agreed to by \n     Enbridge as a result of the DOS environmental analyses and as \n     further amended by specific permit conditions contained in \n     the permit and those to be assigned by the state and federal \n     agencies with jurisdiction over aspects of the project along \n     the pipeline corridor, would result in limited adverse \n     environmental impacts.\n       Concerns have been raised about higher-than-average levels \n     of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with oil sands \n     crude. The Department has considered these concerns, and \n     considers that they are best addressed in the context of the \n     overall set of domestic policies that Canada and the United \n     States will take to address their respective greenhouse gas \n     emissions. The United States will continue to reduce reliance \n     on oil through conservation and energy efficiency measures, \n     such as recently increased Corporate Average Fuel Economy \n     (CAFE) standards, as well as through the pursuit of \n     comprehensive climate legislation and an ambitious global \n     agreement on climate change that includes substantial \n     emission reductions for both the United States and Canada. \n     The Department, on behalf of the Administration, will urge \n     ambitious action by Canada, and will cooperate with the \n     Canadian government through the U.S.-Canada Clean Energy \n     Dialogue and other processes to promote the deployment of \n     technologies that reduce our respective GHG emissions.\n       The Scope of the Permit Issued to Enbridge shall extend \n     only up to and including the first mainline shut-off valve or \n     pumping station in the United States. Executive Order 11423, \n     initially delegating the President's authority to the DOS, \n     specifically notes that ``the proper conduct of the foreign \n     relations of the United States requires that Executive \n     permission be obtained for the construction and maintenance \n     at the borders of the United States of facilities connecting \n     the United States with a foreign country.'' Similarly, \n     Section I of Executive Order 13337, further delegating the \n     President's authority, states that DOS has authority for \n     issuance of Presidential permits for the ``construction, \n     connection, operation, and maintenance at the borders of the \n     United States of facilities . . . to or from a foreign \n     country.'' Hence, in reviewing an application for a \n     Presidential permit, the DOS, takes into account the impact \n     the proposed cross-border facility (i.e., pipeline, bridge, \n     road, etc.) will have upon U.S. relations with the country in \n     question, whether Canada or Mexico, and also on the impact it \n     will have on U.S. foreign relations generally. While the DOS \n     also takes into account the various environmental and other \n     domestic issues\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n     mentioned above, DOS does not have, and has never had, \n     authority over facilities, including pipeline, bridges, \n     roads, etc., located entirely within the United States that \n     do not cross the international border with either Canada or \n     Mexico. For these reasons, the Department does not believe \n     that the scope of the permit it issues in this case should \n     extend any further than necessary to protect that foreign \n     relations interest. The permits the DOS issues under \n     Executive Orders 11423 and 13337 routinely include provisions \n     permitting DOS to take possession of the facilities at the \n     border for national security reasons or to direct the \n     permittee to remove the facilities in the immediate vicinity \n     of the international border if so directed by the DOS. Since \n     that is the case, the DOS has concluded that a limitation of \n     the scope of the permit in this case to those pipeline \n     facilities within the United States up to and including the \n     first mainline shut-off valve or pumping station would \n     adequately protect the DOS' foreign relations interest in \n     implementing Executive Orders 11423 and 13337.\n\n                  8.0 National Interest Determination\n\n       Pursuant to the authority vested in me under Executive \n     Order 13337 of April 30, 2004, as amended, Department of \n     State Delegation of Authority No. 118-2 of January 23, 2006, \n     and Department of State Delegation No. 245-1 of February 13, \n     2009, and subject to satisfaction of the requirements of \n     sections 1(g) and 1(i) of Executive Order 13337, I hereby \n     determine that issuance of a permit to Enbridge Energy, \n     Limited Partnership, a limited partnership organized under \n     the laws of the State of Delaware, which is a wholly owned \n     subsidiary of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (``Enbridge \n     Partners'') which is a Delaware master limited partnership \n     headquartered at 1100 Louisiana, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas \n     77002, to construct, connect, operate and maintain facilities \n     at the border of the United States and Canada for the \n     transport of crude oil between the United States and Canada \n     across the international boundary at Cavalier County, North \n     Dakota, would serve the national interest.\n       The Presidential Permit issued to Enbridge shall include \n     authorization to construct, connect, operate, and maintain at \n     the border of the United States facilities for the transport \n     of crude oil between the United States and Canada across the \n     international boundary as described in the Presidential \n     Permit application received from Enbridge by DOS on May 15, \n     2007, as amended, and in accordance with the mitigation \n     measures described in the Environmental Mitigation Plan (and \n     other similar mitigation plans) contained in the FEIS, as \n     amended. No construction or other actions shall be taken by \n     Enbridge prior to Enbridge's acquisition of all other \n     necessary federal, state, and local permits and approvals \n     from agencies of competent jurisdiction. Enbridge shall \n     provide written notice to the Department at such time as the \n     construction authorized by this permit is begun, and again at \n     such time as construction is completed, interrupted or \n     discontinued.\n       This determination shall become final fifteen days after \n     the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Commerce, Energy, \n     Homeland Security and Transportation, the Attorney General, \n     and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     have been notified of this determination, unless the matter \n     must be referred to the President for consideration and final \n     decision pursuant to section 1(i) of said Executive Order.\n       Date: 03 August 2009.\n                                               James B. Steinberg,\n                                        Deputy Secretary of State.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Some of the things the Alberta Clipper line provided \nwere increasing the diversity of available supplies. It shortens the \ntransportation pathway for a sizable portion of our crude imports. It \nincreases crude oil supplies from major non-OPEC countries. It allows \nour country to cooperate on best practices in technology. And then, \nfinally, approval of the permit would send a positive economic signal, \nin a difficult economic period, about the future reliability and \navailabilty of a portion of U.S. energy imports.\n  These are not from the Keystone XL Pipeline. This is coming from the \nAlberta Clipper Pipeline, approved back in 2009, for exactly the same \nreasons that President Obama should sign off on the Keystone XL \nPipeline and sign off now. It is in the country's best interests. It is \nclearly in the best interests of our friend and ally and neighbor to \nthe north, Canada.\n  I think we recognize there is so much opportunity for us. But we need \nto get out of the way of the stops and the hurdles that have been \nplaced by this administration--limiting our jobs, limiting our economic \nopportunities, and truly working to restrict our energy independence.\n  With that, I yield the floor, as I know several other colleagues wish \nto speak in the time remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to again express my great \ndisappointment about a matter of importance to our Nation--the \nadministration's decision to put off a decision to start building the \nKeystone Pipeline so they can do a little more study and review--again. \nIt is getting to be like watching a rerun of the same show--over and \nover and over again.\n  How many times have we been through this? I have lost count. Time \nafter time momentum seems to build to finally approve this project so \nwe can reap the benefits that will come from the pipeline--namely, the \njobs that will be available to people who need them and the boost to \nour Nation's energy supplies that will help to bring some certainty to \nour energy policy.\n  Well, we can forget about those benefits in the near term. The \nadministration has once again spoken with certainty that they aren't \ncertain about what they want to do--they just know they don't want to \ndo it now. If one is supportive of the pipeline one can still hope it \nmay happen someday. If one is opposed to it, one can be assured that \n``someday'' won't happen anytime soon.\n  I think there is more of a political reason than a practical reason \nfor this delay. After all, there have already been 5 years of studies \nthat have reaffirmed the benefits of building the pipeline now.\n  That isn't all. The State Department reviewed the proposal and found \nthat it was the safest way to transport the oil. Most pipelines require \na presidential permit that is issued after an 18-to 24-month review \nprocess. We did that. In fact, the first leg of the Keystone XL \npipeline took 21 months to obtain approval. Most times that would be a \ncause for optimism. Not this time. We are 5 years down the road and we \nare still awaiting the start of construction.\n  Instead of spending this week on misguided legislation that will \nactually discourage new hiring and harm the job prospects of long-term \nunemployed individuals, we should be doing everything we can to \nencourage the creation of new jobs and the growth of new business \nopportunities. According to the State Department, the Keystone XL has \nthe potential to create 42,000 jobs with good wages that will help to \nget the economy going again, strengthen our energy supplies, and put \nthose 42,000 individuals further along the road of living the American \ndream and supporting their families. What is not to like about that? \nPlus, it will accomplish all that without raising taxes or increasing \nour crushing national debt. In fact, this would increase revenues--jobs \nincrease revenues, sales increase revenues. More people driving to work \nalso creates more money for highways.\n  Getting this massive private sector job creator moving into high gear \nis a win-win for all Americans. Unfortunately, it hasn't happened yet \nand the White House has decided to step in again and once again delay \nthe project for political reasons. Instead of supporting a job creator, \nthe administration is putting up a job barrier. We deserve better. We \ndeserve an administration that is willing to work overtime to lead us \nout of this dismal time of long-term unemployment--a slump that shows \nno signs of ending soon.\n  That isn't the only reason why we need to take action on this \nimmediately. Haven't we all spoken time and time again about the need \nto do something to reduce our dependence on sources of energy from \nunstable countries? This pipeline will help us to do that.\n  The administration's own Department of Energy stated in a June 2011 \nmemo that Keystone XL would lower gas prices in all the markets in the \nUnited States. Flipping the XL switch from ``standby'' to ``on'' should \nhave been done years ago. It is a no-brainer that calls for action--not \nmore thought, reflection, meditation, consideration, review, and \nplanning--and who knows what else.\n  The record is clear. We have been told time and time again that a \ndecision on the pipeline was ``in the pipeline'' and would be coming \nour way shortly. In March of last year the President told us that the \nfinal decision as to whether or not he would approve the pipeline would \nreach us by year's end. We never heard from him.\n  Before that, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a promise that \nwe would have a decision on the status of the pipeline by the end of \n2011. We never heard from her, either.\n  That is unacceptable for so many different reasons. We need the jobs. \nWe\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nneed the energy. We need the certainty that comes from knowing whether \nthis project will be completed or not.\n  The resources this pipeline is intended to carry will be developed \nwhether the administration approves it or not. Doesn't it make sense by \nhaving the United States of America receive the benefit of all that \nenergy instead of our competitors?\n  We have an alternative before us. The senior Senator from North \nDakota has a new bill that I am cosponsoring that would recognize the \nfinal supplemental environmental impact statement and give approval to \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. It will put the Senate on record and \nrecognize the need for the pipeline and all the benefits it will \nprovide. It has strong bipartisan support and should move forward with \nall deliberate speed.\n  There is an old saying that reminds us that he who hesitates is lost. \nWe have been hesitating for years and have nothing to show for it but \nlost time. We have a chance to change things and put ourselves on the \nright side of this equation. It is time to do it--now! Let's leave \nyesterday behind and move forward to tomorrow by taking action instead \nof putting it off again for another round of thoughtful gazing and \nreflection while our problems grow more serious and our options start \nto diminish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I have conferred with the good Senator \nfrom Illinois and beg his indulgence. He has offered 3 minutes for each \nof our remaining speakers. I thank him for that and ask for the Chair's \nindulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Illinois and turn to \nthe Senator from South Carolina for his thoughts on this important \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I have been to the Canadian oil sands that I would recommend every \nperson in this body go visit. The Canadians are being very \nenvironmentally responsible when it comes to extracting the oil sands \nproduct. This is an equivalent to a Saudi Arabian oil find from our \nCanadian friends.\n  Here is the choice and here is the debate: They are going to sell the \noil to China or they are going to sell it to us. How many people in \nAmerica really have a hard time figuring out what we should do? It is \nnot as though the oil is not going to be sold and extracted from the \nground. It is going to be sold to us or the Chinese. If we buy oil from \nCanada, it is like buying oil from your cousin. We trade with the \nCanadians. They are very reliable partners. It is less oil to buy from \nRussia and Venezuela, and you can go down the list.\n  What is at stake here is that the people who object to this \npipeline--I do not doubt their sincerity--would not allow us to buy oil \nfrom anybody or explore for oil here at home. The people objecting to \nthis pipeline do not have an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to \nAmerican energy. If you left it up to them, we would be doing \nwindmills, solar, no nuclear power.\n  So the President of the United States has turned this issue over to \nthe most extreme people in the country when it comes to politics. They \nare trumping the unions. They are trumping the former Presiding \nOfficer. They are locking down developing an energy source that we need \nas a nation. I really regret that the President has let them take over \nthis issue at a time when we need more oil from friendly people and \nless oil from people who hate our guts.\n  Dirty oil to me is buying oil from people who will take the proceeds \nand share it with terrorists. This oil content from Canada is slightly \ngreater in carbon content than Mideast sweet crude, the same level as \noil we find off the coast of California, and has less sulfur. So the \nenvironmental argument does not bear scrutiny.\n  At the end of the day, we are not going to get this oil from our \nfriends in Canada because of the upcoming elections. President Obama is \nafraid of turning off environmental support so he has turned off the \npipeline--very bad for America.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nand turn to the esteemed Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, \nand I acknowledge and thank the distinguished majority whip for \nallowing us extra time to talk about a subject he would probably prefer \nus not to talk about, but I appreciate it very much. So I will be very \nbrief and succinct.\n  For this administration and our country not to build the Keystone \nPipeline or delay it is at best professional malpractice. There are \nthree reasons for that.\n  We are a country that 40 years ago was held hostage by OPEC. We had \nour parents waiting in line to fill up their cars. Businesses closed \nbecause there was no oil supply, and prices went through the roof.\n  With the Keystone Pipeline and its capacity added to the Marcellus \nand the Haynesville shale, America will truly be independent in its \nenergy and never be held hostage again by someone like OPEC. That is \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, it is important for our diplomacy around the world. Soft power \nis always preferable to hard power. And one of the best soft powers you \ncan possibly have is having energy. Think about it for a second.\n  If Russia were not a factor in Ukraine because America could supplant \ntheir natural gas, think what that would do to what is happening right \nnow in that part of the world. We need it for our soft power and for \nour diplomatic power.\n  Lastly, it is environmentally the thing to do. That oil is going to \nbe refined somewhere in the world, and it is going to be delivered in \nsome way. The safest and most environmentally sound way to deliver it \nis in a pipeline, No. 1. The best country in the world to refine it is \nthe United States of America, No. 2. And, No. 3, and most importantly, \nit is environmentally sound because you keep trucks off the road, \ntrains off the track. The oil goes underground. It does not generate \nany carbon and go into the global warming or any other part of our \nenvironmental threat.\n  It is the right thing to do, and it is professional malpractice for \nus not to be doing it for our people, for our country, for our \ndiplomacy, and for peace around the world.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Georgia, who \nis putting forward common sense.\n  I would like to turn, in closing, to the Senator from Wyoming, who is \na senior member of the energy committee and truly understands energy \nissues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it seems the President's decision is \nabsurd, to delay the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is not just me saying \nthat. That is the Washington Post, Thursday morning, April 24: \n``Keystone XL's absurd delay. President Obama should approve the \npipeline project now.'' They say:\n\n       If foot-dragging were a competitive sport, President Obama \n     and his administration would be world champions for their \n     performance in delaying the approval of the Keystone XL \n     pipeline.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The administration's latest decision is not responsible; it \n     is embarrassing. The United States continues to insult its \n     Canadian allies by holding up what should have been a routine \n     permitting decision amid a funhouse-mirror environmental \n     debate that got way out of hand.\n\n  They conclude by saying:\n\n       The president should end this national psychodrama now, bow \n     to reason--\n\n  Think about that: ``bow to reason''--\n\n     approve the pipeline and go do something more productive for \n     the climate.\n\n  That is not just the Washington Post. We see also the Wall Street \nJournal, on Wednesday: ``Keystone Uncensored.'' They talk about a labor \nleader calling the administration ``gutless,'' ``dirty,'' and more.\n  So why would a union leader--who endorsed President Obama in 2008 as \na candidate, endorsed him again in 2012--why would he say this? He \nactually went on to say: ``It's not the oil that's dirty, it's the \npolitics.''\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n  To get an answer to that, you have to look at an article that \nPolitico ran last Thursday called ``The left's secret club.'' It said:\n\n       Some of the country's biggest Democratic donors--including \n     Tom Steyer . . .--are huddling behind closed doors next week \n     in Chicago to plan how to pull their party--and the country--\n     to the left.\n\n  The meeting will be held in the ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton. \nPolitico describes the group as ``a secretive club of wealthy \nliberals.''\n  So who is Tom Steyer? Well, he is a hedge fund billionaire who has \nsaid he is hoping to spend at least $100 million to defeat candidates \nwho support the Keystone XL Pipeline and who oppose his extreme \nenvironmental agenda.\n  I want to be absolutely clear. There is nothing wrong with legal \nparticipation in elections. If a hedge fund billionaire like Mr. Steyer \nwants to spend his money talking about his views, he is free to do it. \nI disagree with his views, but I would never come to the floor of the \nSenate and denounce him as un-American. But that is exactly what the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, has done, repeatedly coming to the floor \nto criticize and demonize people who do not share his views. I have not \nheard Senator Reid demonizing Tom Steyer or any other wealthy liberal \ndonors.\n  According to Politico, the majority leader was actually scheduled to \nattend a fundraising dinner at Mr. Steyer's home a few months ago.\n  So the coincidence, to me, of the administration's announcement right \nbefore this big liberal political event remains suspicious. The silence \nof the majority leader about one person's spending when he has been so \noutspoken about the spending of other people is certainly suspicious as \nwell.\n  Maybe that is what the union head meant when he said: ``It's not the \noil that's dirty, it's the politics.'' Whatever the reason, the \nimportant thing is that President Obama continues to turn his back on \nthousands of middle-class families in desperate need of jobs.\n  That is what needs to change. The administration and this body, \ncontrolled by Senator Reid and the Democrats, can no longer put \npolitics ahead of policy substance. It is time for the administration \nto do the right thing and to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline no matter \nwhat the Democrats' secretive billionaires say.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will close.\n  It is time for the Senate to vote on this important issue.\n  With that, I will turn to the Senator from Illinois and again thank \nhim for the additional time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have listened, as my friends--and they \nare my friends--and colleagues have come to the floor to talk about the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  It turns out that what America needs more than anything else--more \nthan an increase in the minimum wage, more than paycheck fairness so \nthat men and women are paid fairly in the workplace--more than anything \nelse, we need one more pipeline coming in from Canada.\n  If you listen to the other side, you would think the jobs that will \nbe created by the Keystone XL Pipeline will finally turn this economy \naround.\n  How many jobs are we talking about? Madam President, 2,000--2,000 \nconstruction jobs? That is at the high end of estimates I have heard. \nHow many jobs at the refineries in Texas to process this oil and ship \nit overseas? It is not for sale in the United States. I am not sure. \nBut it really is amazing to me that they continue to focus on Keystone \nXL as if it is the only issue when it comes to the American economy.\n  Here is what I find particularly curious. For the record--and I am \nglad my friend, the Senator from North Dakota, is still in the \nChamber--the Keystone XL Pipeline is not the first Keystone Pipeline. \nThe first Keystone Pipeline, from Alberta, came into the United States \nand ended up in Wood River, IL, at the Conoco refinery. It is shipping \nCanadian tar sands down to be refined at the Conoco refinery. And then, \nafter it is refined, in a pipeline it is distributed all across the \nUnited States.\n  If no Keystone XL Pipeline is ever built--and I do not know whether \nit will or will not be--there will still be a steady flow of Canadian \ntar sands into America for refining.\n  Just this week, Senator Kirk and I met with the North American \npresident of BP. They have a huge refinery in Whiting, IN, at the south \nend of Lake Michigan. They are refining Canadian tar sands into oil \nthat can be sold in different products.\n  I asked the head of the North American operations for BP what is \ngoing to happen to that refinery when it comes to Canadian tar sands? \nHe said: We are going to triple--triple--our capacity to deal with \nCanadian tar sands. He did not say contingent on the Keystone XL. \nBecause, you see, there is a vast network of pipelines moving Canadian \ntar sands to the United States already, and they are already going \nthrough a refinery--many of them--even the BP refinery in northern \nIndiana.\n  So this notion that we are somehow turning off the Canadian tar sands \ncoming into the United States--if someone is suggesting that, I would \nask them to bring proof to the floor. We are not.\n  What the President is doing is trying to make a decision on what is \nbest for this country and our economy. He is trying to weigh it in a \nthoughtful manner. There is an element that needs to be part of this \nrecord. The President is trying to take into consideration the \nenvironment. I think he should. I think it is his responsibility.\n  We had a debate several weeks ago on the floor of the Senate. It was \nabout global warming and climate change. It went on through the night. \nMany of my Democratic colleagues stayed up all night to talk about it. \nBrian Schatz of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island spoke at \ngreat length with their colleagues about the issue.\n  I came up early in the debate and simply made one point. I believe \nthe Republican Party of the United States is the only major political \nparty in the world--in the world--that denies climate change and global \nwarming. I have asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \ngive me an example. Tell me where I am wrong. Somebody said there may \nbe a party in Australia. That is where they have to reach to find any \nother political party in the world that agrees with their position on \nglobal warming and climate change. So it is no wonder when we discuss \nenergy and the future they do not want to talk about what is happening \nto our environment, the extreme weather situation we are even seeing \nthis week, the devastation from storms in a magnitude we have never \nregistered since we kept records.\n  What the President is trying to do is to take into consideration not \njust energy but also our environment, so ultimately we leave a world to \nour children and grandchildren which is safer and cleaner than the one \nwe have today. My friend the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, came \nto the floor and talked about what he called a highly secretive, high-\nlevel meeting in Chicago, and then he proceeded to say at what hotel it \nwas being held. It is not much of a secret if he knows where it is \nbeing held.\n  It is true there are meetings of people who oppose the Keystone \nPipeline and support candidates who oppose it, as there are meetings of \nthose who support the pipeline and support the candidates who join in \ntheir position. That happens to be the nature of the political scene. \nHe even suggested that the person opposed to the pipeline was going to \nput $100 million into this campaign.\n  I, for one, would like to see an end to big money in our political \ncampaigns. I would certainly like to see transparency and where it is \ncoming from and how it is being spent, but the reality is, the Citizens \nUnited decision from the Supreme Court across the street changed the \nrules and people can play with big money now, a lot of their own.\n  What he did not mention were the Koch brothers. I would like to \nmention them for a moment because they are relevant to this discussion \nabout Canadian tar sands and the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Koch \nbrothers are very wealthy, billionaires. They come to play when it \ncomes to the American political scene. In the last cycle, we were able \nto identify over $248 million these two brothers spent on political \ncauses and campaigns around the\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nUnited States, and we are told they are going to spend considerably \nmore than that this time around.\n  Do the Koch brothers have an agenda when it comes to this issue? Let \nme give an illustration. It was about 3 months ago that I went into the \nsoutheast corner of the city of Chicago, an old steel mill \nneighborhood, which happens to be in the neighborhood where Barrack \nObama, fresh out of college, was a community organizer. They are modest \nhomes, frame homes, primarily Hispanic and African-American \npopulations.\n  They called me down to this section, the southeastern section of the \ncity of Chicago, to show me something. What they wanted to show me were \npiles of black soot. It is called petcoke. Petcoke is what is left \nafter you take the Canadian tar sands, ship them through the pipeline \nto a refinery, making diesel fuel, aviation fuel and gasoline. What is \nleft over, this black gunk substance called petcoke.\n  It turns out that the BP refinery was selling the petcoke to a \ncompany owned by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers were shipping \nthis petcoke into the neighborhoods of Chicago. The mothers with their \nkids were calling me to their homes and schools to show me what \nhappened when the wind blew. When the wind blew, this nasty black stuff \nflew through the air. It was all over windowsills and buildings, nasty \nas can be.\n  The city of Chicago is doing something about it. They are kind of \nchanging the equation in terms of petcoke and what you have to do to \nstore it. But if the other side is coming to the floor and saying our \npeople are pure of heart, they just want to see the Keystone XL \nPipeline, the fact is, the largest benefactors to the Republican Party \nin the United States today, the Koch brothers, have a financial and \ncommercial interest in these Canadian tar sands, at least in the \ndisposal of this petcoke. The way they were doing it in the city of \nChicago was the height of corporate irresponsibility--just pile it and \nlet the wind blow it across the neighborhood. It is going to be \ncriminal when it is all over after the city of Chicago changes its laws \nto prohibit this kind of conduct.\n  But those are the things that are at stake in this conversation. I \nhope at the end of the day the President makes the right, thoughtful \ndecision, not just in terms of energy but in terms of our environment, \ndoes the best thing for America. I hope we also understand that if we \ndo nothing with the Keystone XL Pipeline, we are still going to face \nthe challenges with Canadian tar sands, coming down through the United \nStates, being refined and sold in our country and around the world. It \nis a challenge we have to face honestly.\n  I may disagree with some of my colleagues on the other side. I \nbelieve that if we want to leave a world for future generations--our \nkids, our grandchildren--that is a cleaner and safer world, we have to \naccept some responsibility in our generation, in our time, to clean up \nthe mess of this environment. It may call for some sacrifice as \nindividuals, as families, as businesses, but I do not think it is too \nmuch to ask.\n  God gave us this great world and asked us to keep an eye on it for \nthe next generation. Are we going to do it or will we ignore it and \nsay: If there is money to be made, we can start bringing in any source \nyou wish. That to me is irresponsible.\n\n\n        Tribute to Dr. Jerry Umanos, John Gabel, and Gary Gabel\n\n  Madam President, Robert Kennedy once said, ``The purpose of life is \nto contribute in some way to make things better.'' Around the world and \nhere at home, dedicated American citizens are living by this principle, \ntrying to improve the lives of those in greatest need. Sadly, on April \n24, we lost three Americans from my home State of Illinois who were \nkilled at the Cure International Hospital which focuses on maternity \nand pediatric care in Afghanistan: Dr. Jerry Umanos, John Gabel, and \nhis father Gary Gabel.\n  Both John Gabel and Dr. Jerry Umanos were working to help the Afghan \npeople receive health care. In a country still coping with the legacy \nof decades of terrible conflict that devastated the medical \ninfrastructure of Afghanistan, they were helping by volunteering to \naddress the real needs of the Afghan people and improving the lives of \nthose whom they assisted.\n  This is Dr. Jerry Umanos. His picture is an indication of this young, \ndedicated, idealistic man who lost his life. He was dedicating to \nhelping kids. After he finished his residency at the Children's \nHospital of Michigan, he could have made some money with his training, \nbut instead he decided to help those who needed a helping hand.\n\n  He worked for years at an amazing place that I have visited, the \nLawndale Christian Health Center in the city of Chicago. It is one of \nthose neighborhood health centers which makes you feel good about the \nworld, where great professionals, such as Dr. Umanos, give of their \ntime, make very little money, and help the poorest of the poor.\n  He was an important part of that community. They loved him, not only \nhis patients but his colleagues as well. He worked to help so many in \nChicago who otherwise did not have a chance for quality health care. He \nfollowed this calling to Afghanistan where the needs of people were \neven greater. He was dedicated to making a difference there by helping \nthe Afghan people, by teaching, by making certain that the next \ngeneration of Afghans had a better life. The breadth and depth of his \nwork is a testimony to his love for and commitment not only to the \npeople of Afghanistan but to the needy. What a loss that his life was \ntaken from us.\n  John Gabel was a man who cared for others and made a real difference \nin the lives of those he touched. He used his skills to run a health \nclinic in Afghanistan and to help address the glaring needs of health \ncare with the Afghan people. John was working in other ways to help \nbuild a better tomorrow for the people of Afghanistan. He used to teach \nat Kabul University, where he was remembered as a great teacher and a \ngreat friend.\n  He used his expertise in computer science, not to enrich himself but \nto teach others. Perhaps it is not surprising that John was so focused \non helping those in need when we consider the example of his parents \nGary and Betty Gabel, who also dedicated their lives to others. \nTragically, Gary Gabel, who was visiting his son and his family in \nAfghanistan, was lost as well in the senseless shooting.\n  Gary Gabel helped his community in and around Arlington Heights, IL. \nHe was an active member of his church. He had a commitment to helping \nthose most innocent and vulnerable members of society, our children. He \nworked with church youth groups. He provided a strong model to his \ncommunity and his family of a man committed to helping others. I am \nsure my colleagues join me in expressing our heartfelt condolences to \nthe families and loved ones of those lost and injured in this tragic \nattack, as well as the countless people whom they helped, all of whom \njoin us in mourning their loss. They represent the best of who we are \nas a people and make this world a better place.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Tomorrow, we are going to have an important vote. It is a vote that \nis going to be watched carefully by over 1 million workers in the State \nof Illinois and millions across our Nation. The question is whether the \nUnited States of America and its government will increase the minimum \nwage for workers all across the country.\n  It is an important vote. It would raise the Federal minimum wage from \n$7.25 to $10.10 in three steps of 95 cents each. If we pass it this \nyear, the final increase would occur in the year 2016. This is a 39-\npercent increase in the minimum wage, roughly the same percentagewise \nas the last minimum wage bill we enacted over the same period of time. \nIt provides for automatic future increases in the minimum wage based on \nthe cost of living so we do not have those lurches from one level to $2 \nor $3 above it.\n  It raises the minimum wage for tipped workers for the first time in \nmore than 20 years. People find it hard to believe that under Federal \nstandards, tipped workers receive $2.13 an hour as their base wage. \nThey are expected to make up the difference with their tips. We raise \nit to 70 percent of the minimum wage, phased in over 6 years. We extend \nsome business expensing rules to help businesses invest in their \nequipment and what they need to grow the business. We do this in a \nfashion to incentivize small businesses to grow.\n  This increase in the minimum wage brings us down to a very \nfundamental\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nquestion as Americans. The fundamental question is this: If someone is \nwilling to get up and go to work and work hard every single day, should \nthey receive a compensation that lets them get by so they do not have \nto survive from paycheck to paycheck or should they be put in a \nposition where the only way they can survive is with government \nassistance--food stamps, SNAP program, child care subsidies--things \nthat we provide as a government to people in low-income categories?\n  Keep in mind, we are talking about workers. You see them in Chicago \nearly in the morning. They are the blurry-eyed travelers on those buses \nheading off to the workplace. They are the ones we see on the trains, \nquietly moving from their homes to where they work and repeating the \nreverse journey every single day as they head back home at night.\n  Can you imagine the frustration of going through that day after weary \nday and never, ever catching up, living paycheck to paycheck, falling \nfurther and further behind? That is what is happening to too many of \nthem. It is amazing to me when we hear the critics of minimum wages \nstep forward. In our State of Illinois there are two prominent \npoliticians, both of them happen to be multimillionaires. Their views \non minimum wage are amazing to me. One of them, who made $53 million \nlast year, said he adamantly opposes raising the minimum wage. He made \n$53 million last year. He adamantly opposes raising the minimum wage.\n  Another one of them who is worth millions of dollars himself has \nsaid: I will agree to raise the minimum wage but only for people over \nthe age of 26.\n  He just eliminated half of the people earning the minimum wage in \nAmerica today who happen to be under the age of 26.\n  Let's think about the people whom he wants to keep on a subminimum \nwage. It would include all college students under the age of 26 trying \nto work their way through school. He would want to give them a \nsubminimum wage. It would include single moms raising their kids--the \nmoms being under the age of 26, they would get a subminimum wage--and \nit would also include veterans coming back, struggling to find a job. \nIf they haven't reached the age of 26, he would give them a subminimum \nwage.\n  I have one basic question: What are these politicians thinking? Have \nthey ever left where they live and where they work and met up with some \npeople who are struggling paycheck to paycheck to get by?\n  Tomorrow we have a chance on the floor of the Senate to raise the \nminimum wage, but we cannot do it with Democratic votes alone. If there \nwill not be five, six or seven Republicans who cross the aisle and join \nus in this debate, it will fail--and that will be a sad day--because \nfor a lot of these workers this is their only hope that they will get a \ndecent increase in the minimum wage through the law.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will take into consideration \nthat so many of these workers are women and so many of them are even \nover the age of 35 and still rely on minimum wage jobs. These are not \nlazy people. These are hard-working people, people who are working hard \nevery single day for a paycheck that they know is not going to cover \ntheir expenses every single week.\n  It is time we give them a chance and give them a break. It used to \nbe--and I can remember it very well--a bipartisan issue to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  President Ronald Reagan, when he was President, raised the minimum \nwage. He understood it. If you value work and you value working people, \nyou should give them a wage which respects the integrity and decency of \nwork. That is what this is about. That is what this minimum wage is \nabout tomorrow.\n  Without the help of Republicans, it will fail. If it isn't done on a \nbipartisan basis, it will not go forward.\n  I might add one other item. A minimum wage is injecting into the \neconomy literally millions of dollars of purchasing power. People who \nare living paycheck to paycheck spend those checks as fast as they can \nfor food, clothing or shoes, paying the utility bills, paying for a \ncell phone, putting gas in a car. That money goes right back into the \neconomy.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, tomorrow break \nwith some of the extreme people in your party, join us in a bipartisan \nfashion and raise the minimum wage. It is only fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Before the Senator leaves I would like to ask him a quick \nquestion if I could. I know he talked toward the end of his comments--\nand I am going to speak on minimum wage also--but he mentioned \nPresident Reagan. I think the last time minimum wage passed was under \nPresident Bush, again a bipartisan approach; is that correct? I wasn't \nhere during those times, but I know the Senator has served in Congress \na long time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I respond through the Chair to the Senator from Alaska.\n  There was a time when there wasn't that much controversy associated \nwith this. We knew that we waited too long. People had fallen behind in \ntheir earning potential. We had to pick the right number. We came up \nwith it and moved forward on a bipartisan basis. But now things are so \npartisan and so poisonous in the Senate that even something as basic as \nraising the minimum wage for hard-working families turns out to be a \npolitical lift.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The $10.10 wage is just getting to the poverty level. \nThat is what I understand and why I cosponsored this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It basically does for some, but what I found though is if \nyou are a family with two kids, for example, you have to make almost \n$15 an hour to get beyond the poverty level. We are talking about \n$10.10 phased in, and many of those people will still qualify for a \nhelping hand from the government because they are still in very low-\nincome categories.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Thank you for giving me a moment to ask those questions.\n  I rise to address an important issue--just as we were asking some \nquestions back and forth--that would help 49,000 Alaskans, raising the \nminimum wage. The bill before us would increase the minimum wage to \n$10.10 an hour.\n  The minimum wage, as mentioned by my colleagues a little earlier, has \nlost its purchasing power by one-third over my lifetime. The increase \nwill lift millions of Americans out of poverty, reduce their reliance \non the safety net, and literally pump billions more into the economy.\n  I know I look at this a little differently. I come from the business \nworld. I come from the small business world. My first business was at \nthe age of 14. I have been in it ever since in some form or another. \nYou can probably name the business--retail, real estate. I have been a \npublisher. I have owned different companies, and I have even owned a \nsmall, very small, percentage of a restaurant. I felt like I was a 100-\npercent owner at one point because it is a tough business. I was in \nthere moving the slop buckets and doing a remodel to the kitchen on a \nSaturday night. I am there like everyone else working double time and \ntrying to make sure we get the job done.\n  My wife is a small retailer. Her business is selling smoked salmon on \na counter or a cart--no bigger than two of these desks--and building \nher business now to 5 retail stores, 30-some employees. I might note \nnone of our employees are paid minimum wage. They are paid above \nminimum wage.\n  I know some people are concerned minimum wage will cut into their \nbusiness. There is no question in my mind what it does; that is, when \nwe increase the minimum wage, it is actually good for business because \nwe help consumers have more resources to put into the economy that then \nchurn back into the business world.\n  Along with this bill another provision a lot of people don't realize \nis the minimum wage is one piece, a pretty significant piece but also a \nprovision that I requested be put in this bill, what they call a 179. \nIt is a business tax deduction, something that is important for \nbusinesses that are growing, expanding, building new business, small \nbusinesses mostly.\n  This is the No. 1 priority of the business community that I talk to, \nnot the politically driven business communities but the ones that \nactually do business and actually work with small businesses, the ones \nthat look at their local communities and try to figure out what is \nimportant in legislation. One is to make sure they can write off\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nsome of their improvements in an expedited way which, in turn, puts \nmore money into the business for reinvestment. That is another piece of \nthis bill.\n  So it not only has an important part for the hard-working folks who \nare making minimum wage to raise that amount, but it also helps the \nhard-working small businesses ensure that they can continue to put \nmoney back in their business, grow their business, expand their \nbusiness, and then receive some benefit from that.\n  As we know, we look at the whole issue in Alaska a little \ndifferently. Our minimum wage is 50 cents higher than the Federal \nlevel, $7.75. There is a reason: Because it is very expensive, similar \nto the Presiding Officer's State. It is not cheap in our two States, \nHawaii and Alaska. The cost of living is much greater. In order for \nfolks to have a decent living, we pay a little bit more, and we play it \noff of the Federal legislation, but still it is a problem in keeping \nthe wage competitive to the cost of living.\n  When we look at Alaska and we look at the cost of living in Alaska--\nAnchorage specifically is 30 percent higher than the average cost of \nliving in this country and Fairbanks is 40 percent higher. Again, \nhaving this higher ratio for us is very important.\n  It doesn't mean all the time that a dollar still goes far. When we \nlook at the whole country, in terms of buying power, what you can buy \nfor the dollar you earn, Alaska has 3 of the cities in the bottom 11. \nWhen you look at the whole list, there are 11 at the bottom. Alaska has \nthree of them: Juneau, Kodiak, and Fairbanks, because their dollar \ncan't go far enough. That is why raising the minimum wage will help \nthem be able to purchase more and enjoy a better quality of life.\n  I will say Alaskans, similar to Hawaiians, know challenges, and we \nhave tough jobs because we are kind of isolated lots of times and \nsometimes forgotten that we actually exist in the Union. And we have to \nmake that point more than once. But it doesn't matter if we are doing \nthe drilling in the Arctic, which is a great challenge, or fishing for \ncrab in the Bering Sea, which is an unbelievable test of someone's \ncapacity and ability, but we know how to overcome challenges. We just \ndon't want more challenges.\n  A minimum wage increase will help reduce some of those challenges. \nThe minimum wage is truly, at the rate it is today, an obstacle to try \nto get people moved forward because we don't have it at the rate it \nshould be. The $10.10, in a lot of minds, is an easy step over a 2- to \n3-year period, and it is honestly one we can fix. We can fix it \ntomorrow. We just need a bipartisan approach as it happened under the \nReagan administration, it happened under the Bush administration. \nAgain, to remind folks who may not be familiar with those two \nPresidents, they were Republicans. We did it, and I wasn't here, but \nDemocrats and Republicans sat down and said: Let's figure this out \nbecause it is important for the working people of this country who are \nworking hard every day.\n\n  Another group it impacts in my State of 49,000 Alaskans is 1,700 \nveterans--veterans in our country, veterans in my State who will get a \nboost.\n  What does that mean? When you calculate by family members, it is \nabout 3,000 families of veterans will benefit from raising the minimum \nwage. As I said earlier, it is 49,000 Alaskans, and this is one subset. \nMore than half of the Alaskans are women. About 5,000 Alaskans will be \nboosted right out of poverty with this change, and it means they will \nbe on less government programs such as food stamps.\n  I would think we are all here to try to make government run more \nefficiently, improve the economy, and create jobs. That is what we do \nevery day, we attempt to do every day, and we do every day. If we can \nget people above poverty, that means fewer government programs, which \nmeans fewer government tax dollars, which means they are living on \ntheir own and they have their own capacity to make it in this world.\n  One would think this is a unique opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans to be joined together. Why wouldn't we want fewer people on \nfood stamps because they are making a living now and able to take care \nof themselves? That is what we all work toward, to have the American \ndream to buy that home or live that quality of life, have that great \neducation, all the pieces to the equation.\n  Again, I cannot believe we are having a struggle trying to get just a \nfew votes. We don't want them all. We get there are some who are \nopposed to anything about the Federal Government, but why not support \nthis effort to raise people up as President Reagan thought about and \nPresident Bush thought about.\n  It is this moment, giving these people a fair shot, a fair shot to \nhave their American dream come true; $10.10 doesn't seem like a big \nstretch, but it seems today it is by some politicians.\n  In fact, when we look at this--and I know the complaint on the other \nside is this will hurt business. Again, as I said earlier, this is \ngood. You are talking to someone who is a small businessperson, who \npays above minimum wage. I understand the value of making sure my \nemployees, my wife's employees, have a good, decent wage, because when \nthey leave the workplace, when they get their paycheck, they will spend \nit in the economy. That will help grow the economy.\n  I know some will talk about the CBO report and all of these \ngovernment reports, but let me put it this way. The last two times the \nminimum wage has been raised, the economy didn't collapse, people \nweren't fired--actually, the economy grew. So I don't understand that \ncomment and debate.\n  I know they will whip out these reports, and I am appreciative of \nthose and the work CBO does, but I can only go by history and what has \nhappened. If we raise the minimum wage, jobs are great, economy grows, \nand the next issue is businesses are reinvesting because they have more \ncustomers, which means more customers more profit. More profit means \nmore investment. This is not only a fair shot for the people working, \nit gives an opportunity for small businesses and businesses across this \ncountry.\n  To put it in perspective for my colleagues who have never been in \nsmall business or have not run a business, the reason you hire people \nis because you have demand. Demand is created by expenditures, \nexpenditures by consumers.\n  The reason you lay off people is because demand has gone down because \nthere are not expenditures by consumers. Raising the minimum wage gives \nmore opportunity, more investment, more people making money, and more \nreturn.\n  Let me give some national statistics. Again, this is about making \nsure we give every American, especially those making a minimum wage \ntoday--a raise in their minimum wage, to give them a fair shot to be \npart of the American dream.\n  The bill will help 30 million Americans earning an additional $51 \nbillion to put back into the economy over the next 3 years by this \nraise--huge. The family who today can't afford the new car can now \nmaybe look at a new car or maybe they are choosing between groceries \nand paying their heating bill. Now because you are raising the minimum \nwage they have an opportunity to pay these bills and enjoy life a \nlittle bit more.\n  The higher minimum wage will also help 12 million people in our \ncountry to get out of poverty. It could lift 4.6 million out of poverty \nimmediately.\n  This is about empowering families, giving them a fair shot, a chance \nagain to achieve the American dream, helping parents to make ends meet \nand to raise children in a healthy home and an opportunity for them. \nMore than a one-fifth of all children in our country have a parent on \nminimum wage; 56 percent on a national level are women making the \nminimum wage.\n  Right now, thousands of Alaskans work full time--maybe extra work on \nthe side--but still struggle to put food on the table. It is wrong. \nThat is why raising the minimum wage will be helpful to those families. \nIt saves the government money by helping people get off food stamps. \nAlso, higher wages would cut, as I said, food stamps, they estimate by \n$4.6 billion a year. We have been very good at moving the deficit \ndown--a $1.4 trillion deficit annually, down a little over $500 billion \nand continuing to go down. I think we all want to see that deficit go \nto zero.\n  The way we do that is with programs such as this that engage the \nprivate sector and their responsibility, at the same time lowering \ncosts for the government. Also, an interesting statistic\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nis that it also increases the wages, obviously, by the minimum wage \ngoing up. So it increases and strengthens Social Security because now \nthey are paying into Social Security. Social Security contributions \nfrom an extra $51 billion in wages would go right to the trust fund. \nSince benefits are tied to lifetime earnings, workers will earn larger \nchecks when they retire. Right now an average minimum wage worker with \n40 years of paying into the system receives only 900 bucks, give or \ntake a few bucks, at the age of 65. That is well below the poverty \nline.\n\n  So why wouldn't we want to raise the minimum wage, move people out of \npoverty, get more people off of food stamps, save the government some \nmoney, and, by the way, help strengthen Social Security and give \nfamilies and individuals a fair shot to meet and reach the American \ndream? Why wouldn't we want to do that? Again, under the Reagan \nadministration and the Bush administration, they seemed to think it was \na good idea.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois who was on the floor a little \nwhile ago. If we weren't in this toxic political environment where \neverything has to be politicized until the last man is standing, we \nwould probably do this. We would be down here together talking about \nhow it would help our folks in our different States and in our \ncommunities and in the country overall. Instead, everyone wants to just \nkind of even the scorecard. This is not about a scorecard; this is \nabout giving a fair shot to Americans, to Alaskans, so they have a \nchance to make a living and meet and reach the American dream.\n  This is a simple thing for us to do, and we could do it tomorrow. I \ndon't know what the House will do, but maybe if we act in a bipartisan \nway here, the House will see that. Maybe they will wake up and see this \nis a good thing to do because if we want to build the economy, if we \nwant to make a difference, as I said--and I am talking as a small \nbusinessperson--if we grow the amount of money consumers spend by \nmaking sure they make a good living, the net result will be that every \nbusinessperson benefits because they have more consumers, more people \nbuying products. In turn, everything from manufacturing, to shipping to \nthe retailer, to the large business, the small business--all benefit.\n  Again, it is amazing to me that we debate this issue. Actually, I was \nnot planning to come to the floor until last week because I thought \nthis should be easy. Why are we not doing this? Republican Presidents \nsaw it as a good idea. Now that it has been a long time coming, it is \ntime.\n  I know some don't like the current President. I have my issues with \nhim, I can tell you that. The list is long. But we should not get \ncaught up in the personalities. I tell my staff all the time--when I \nget a piece of legislation a Member is proposing, I say: Don't look at \nwho is sponsoring; look at the content of the bill. If we like the \nbill, we sign on. We participate. Too much time is spent here worrying \nabout who is sponsoring what, who is on the list, who made the comment. \nWho cares? If it is a good piece of legislation, then we should do it.\n  In my State we will have raising the minimum wage on the November \nballot because Alaskans signed an initiative--35,000 or 40,000 people--\nsaying this is the right thing to do for Alaska. I think it is the \nright thing to do not only for Alaska but for this country. It is \nimportant that we do this because it is our obligation to make sure for \nAlaskans and for all Americans that we don't create obstacles in their \nability to reach the American dream, that we make sure they have a fair \nshot at anything they want to do.\n  I hope tomorrow we will have a different outcome than the pundits are \npredicting. They think it will fail tomorrow. I hope not. But if we \nfail tomorrow and don't get enough votes from the other side, it is not \nthat we lose the battle today but that the American people lose. \nAlaskans lose. The 49,000 Alaskans I mentioned will lose. The 1,700 \nveterans in my State will lose. Let's try to do something to make them \nwinners and give them a shot.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I think many of my colleagues feel \nvery at home with this image, which is a reminder of a household name--\nRamona and her father. It is a great story written by Beverly Cleary. \nIn fact, it is a prize-winning story, part of a series, and my favorite \nof the series, Ramona the Pest, was written in 1968.\n  In 1968 and in this story Ramona's dad is struggling, along with his \nwife Dorothy--his name is Robert--to get by and keep the family \ntogether on a minimum wage job, which in 1968 paid $1.60 an hour. Today \nthe minimum wage, if it had kept pace with inflation, would be $10.71 \nan hour.\n  We know, many of us--and probably many of my colleagues who have read \nthis story--that Robert and Dorothy Quimby are engaged in a quiet \nstruggle to make ends meet. Even as Ramona is engaged in all kinds of \nantics and play, he is working as a grocery bagger at a local store. \nRamona's mother is working too--an early example of a two-family \nhousehold and two-income family. They are able to keep their family \nafloat on that minimum wage in 1968--$1.60 an hour in 1968.\n  For millions of Americans who read Ramona's story today, the idea of \na minimum wage enabling a family to stay afloat, keep a roof over their \nheads, and food on the table is a storybook fiction. It is very \ndifficult today to believe that Robert Quimby, as a bagger in a grocery \nstore, could enable his daughters, Ramona and her sister, to have the \nlife they did then. In fact, it would be impossible because today the \nminimum wage has failed to keep pace with inflation. The minimum wage \ntoday is $7.25--nowhere near what it would need to be to keep pace with \nthe rise in the cost of living.\n  That is why we are here today--to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, \nwhich is still below the $10.71 it would have been for Robert Quimby, \nmaking minimum wage in a grocery store, if it had kept pace with \ninflation. In fact, it is well below what is necessary to enable \nfamilies to continue a normal life. That is why they are living in \npoverty--working men and women living in poverty--despite being paid \nthe minimum wage. That is a travesty and a mockery. It is a moral \noutrage. It is bad for our economy, it is bad for our families, it is \nbad for the fabric of our society, and it is bad for America.\n  I am proud to support an increase in the minimum wage. I am proud \nConnecticut has decided it will raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an \nhour--still below that $10.71 that is needed to get by today.\n  We know the impact on families. We know the impact on children. We \nsee them in our schools--millions of children, 14 million children--in \nfamilies who are paid less than a minimum wage. We know the impact on \nour veterans. Half a million or more are paid less than the new minimum \nwage our bill would establish. That is itself an outrage. Men and women \nwho have served and sacrificed for our country come back to civilian \nlife to be paid less than what they need to stay out of poverty. They \nare working and working hard but still making less than a minimum wage. \nThese are veterans who have served our country, who have put their \nlives on the line, have put themselves at risk, coming back to a \nsociety that rewards them--rewards them--with less than what they need \nto survive.\n  I have talked to a lot of businesspeople. Some of them are \napprehensive, no question about it, but a lot of them say: Our workers \nare more productive because we pay well above the minimum wage.\n  Many who will be impacted by this law if it is passed say it is the \nright thing to do, and they support it. I am talking about, for \nexample, Max Kothari. For 25 years he, along with his wife Parul, has \nowned and operated Star Hardware in Hartford--one of the oldest \nhardware stores in the State of Connecticut. He supports this measure \nto raise the minimum wage to $10.10.\n  So does Doug Wade, who operates one of the oldest dairy companies in \nthe State, started by Doug's great-grandfather in 1893--Wade's Dairy in \nBridgeport. He supports raising the minimum wage.\n  A thousand businesspeople have signed a statement and petition--we \nmentioned it this morning--that supports raising the minimum wage. They \nsay it is a fairness issue. It is simply a\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nway to give folks a fair shot at the American dream, a fair shot at a \nquality of life that is good for their families and children, good for \nour society, and, by the way, also good for our economy.\n  We know that $35 billion would be added to consumer demand because \nfolks who make minimum wage, if it is raised to $10.10, are not going \nto put the difference under their mattresses. They are going to spend \nit. They are going to buy more food, clothing, and gas for their cars. \nThey are going to buy things that drive the economy. They are going to \npurchase stuff that creates demand and more jobs and business for Max \nKothari at his hardware store and for Dough Wade at his dairy.\n  This kind of reasoning is not advanced economic theory; it is basic \ncommon sense. Americans understand it. That is why Americans support \nraising the minimum wage as a matter of fairness and enlightened self-\ninterest economically. It is the right thing to do.\n  The arguments made against it are without basis rationally and \neconomically. The ones who suffer from the minimum wage as it exists \nright now are not teenagers. I know there is a myth that they are part-\ntime workers or teenagers. That is just not true. Nearly ninety percent \nof minimum wage workers are adults. They are disproportionately women \nand people of color and workers with disabilities, and they will be \nhelped disproportionately by raising the minimum wage. But they are not \nteenagers or part-time workers. They are deserving, for the hard work \nthey do, of fair pay and a fair shot. That is all the minimum wage \nwould really do, is give them a fair shot at economic opportunity.\n  And those veterans, they deserve more than a fair shot. They deserve \na hand up, not a handout. There is nothing about the minimum wage that \nis an entitlement. It is simply fair pay and a fair shot. We have \ntrapped half a million of those veterans in poverty--3,800 veterans in \nConnecticut alone who will benefit from the $10.10 minimum wage.\n  But we should guarantee that in this great land--the greatest in the \nhistory of the world--people such as Ramona's dad, Robert Quimby, and \nDorothy Quimby and her sister are being paid at least what they were \ngetting back in 1968 in today's dollars. That is the way to keep \nfamilies together. That is the way to keep faith with the dream all \nAmericans have that they will have a fair shot.\n  No one who works full time should live in poverty. No one who works \nshould be so poor that they can't put food on the table or provide \nclothes for their children, or give them the erasers that Robert Quimby \ngave his daughters as a gift.\n  To enable 14 million children in America to have a better life, let's \npass this measure. And let's make sure that if it fails this week--and \nit shouldn't, but if it does, we bring it back, and we continue to \nbring it back as long as necessary to ensure a fair shot for all \nAmericans who work hard and play by the rules.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized for up to 2 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Bill Cathcart\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, this Friday, May 2, a gentleman from \nGeorgia will retire after 29 years of service.\n  William--Bill--Cathcart, with WTOC for 29 years as general manager \nand 2 years with the firm, will be saying goodbye to his leadership \nwith WTOC, one of the leading media stations of the coast of Georgia \nand one of the leading media stations around our State--a station I \nhave dealt with often, and a station I have found to be professional, \nfair, and thorough.\n  In fact, even as I speak on the floor of the Senate today, my State \nof Georgia has already had a bad shooting incident this morning, \nterrible tornadoes this afternoon, and bad weather coming in this \nevening. It makes me appreciate the broadcast network and the people \nwho come together to let our citizens know about things happening, \ngiving them early warnings about bad weather and reporting the news \nfairly and straight.\n  Bill Cathcart is a great Georgian and a great American. He has done a \ntremendous job for our State and for WTOC. I wish him the best upon his \nretirement. I hope he will always call on me if I can ever be of help, \nand I thank him for all he has done for me.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, tomorrow about noon we will be voting on \nsomething in the Senate that I daresay a lot of Americans will be \npaying close attention to. The reason they are going to be paying close \nattention is because that vote will affect them and their families in \nthe future in a very big way. That vote will be on whether we will \nactually bring debate to a close and vote on increasing the minimum \nwage in America.\n  If we were to bring that to a vote, we could pass it, the President \nwould sign something like that into law, and in 6 months the minimum \nwage would go up by 95 cents an hour; then next year it would go up by \nanother 95 cents; and the year after another 95 cents from where it is \nnow at $7.25 an hour.\n  What we are going to vote on tomorrow will have a drastic effect on \nmillions of American families--and it is going to have a big effect on \nour economy, because it will boost our economy and get the wheels going \nagain, because people will have more money to spend. They will spend it \non Main Street. And that is what is lacking right now--consumer \ndemand--consumers with enough money to spend on Main Street. All the \neconomists will basically tell you it is the lack of aggregate demand \nthat is keeping our economy from moving ahead. Tomorrow at noon we will \nhave a vote on that.\n  Tens of millions of American families are struggling, trying to make \nends meet to give their kids a little bit better life. And, quite \nfrankly, a lot of them on low wages are on public assistance which is \ncosting American taxpayers nearly $250 billion every year--in food \nstamps, earned income tax credits, Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies, and Medicaid. Add all those up and it is about $243 billion a \nyear.\n  Taxpayers are subsidizing a lot of these companies that are paying \nvery low wages. Many of the companies that pay such low wages are \nlarge, multibillion dollar companies raking in big profits and \nshowering their CEOs with wealth. The average CEO pay of a Standard & \nPoors 500 company was 21 percent more last year than in 2009. In other \nwords, from 2009 until the end of last year, CEO pay at these 500 \ncompanies went up an average of 21 percent. However, since 2009, the \nminimum wage has not increased 1 penny. The CEO pay averages now about \n$11.7 million a year, while a minimum-wage worker today makes $15,000 a \nyear. That is working full time, all year, no time off.\n  It was pointed out to me that a CEO earns that $15,000 by about 11:30 \na.m. on the first day of work of the year. Imagine that. By 11:30 a.m. \non January 2--assuming they don't work on January 1--they make $15,000. \nThe minimum-wage earner has to work the rest of the year to make that \n$15,000. And many of these companies are paying the minimum wage.\n  It is the families who are getting hurt. This is wrong. This is not \nwhat America is about. We want people who get up and go to work every \nday to be able to rely on that work to support themselves. Working \nfamilies want that, too. They want a paycheck which supports them, \ngives them a fair shot at being a member of the middle class, and a \nfair shot of achieving the American dream.\n  So now we can do something about it. We know that raising the minimum \nwage will help tens of millions of workers. When we raise it to $10.10, \nas our bill does, the bottom fifth of the workforce--nearly 30 million \nworkers--will get a raise.\n  By the time this fully phases in at $10.10 in 3 years, nearly 7 \nmillion people will be lifted out of poverty. If we want an antipoverty \nprogram, we have it tomorrow when we vote on raising the minimum wage. \nSeven million people will be lifted out of poverty, and it won't cost \nthe American taxpayers one single dime, and taxpayers basically\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nwill save money because we won't be putting as much money out for \npublic assistance such as food stamps.\n  I thought it was kind of interesting that the Ryan budget the House \npassed cuts more than 3.8 million people off of food stamps. In raising \nthe minimum wage, our bill would save billions of dollars--about $4.6 \nbillion a year--not by cutting people off of food stamps, but by \ngetting their income up so that over 3 million people don't have to \nrely on food stamps. So under the Ryan budget, people are kicked off of \nfood stamps and they still get minimum wage. Under ours, you get a \nraise in the minimum wage and you don't have to rely on food stamps, \nand you save about the same amount of money.\n  Again, I am mystified by how vehemently my Republican colleagues \noppose raising the minimum wage. Certainly they must know the polling \ndata, that the vast majority of Americans support raising the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour. But it seems my friends on the Republican side \nare sort of locked into some philosophy or ideology that says there \nshouldn't be a minimum wage. In fact, some of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side actually believe there should be no minimum wage. None. \nNothing. Well, we got over that 70 years or more ago, in 1938, when we \nfirst passed a minimum-wage law in America.\n  Again, we hear from the other side that by raising the minimum wage \nthere will be this massive loss of jobs. That is simply not true. It is \na myth. But it is brought up every time.\n  I have been in Congress now 40 years. We have raised the minimum wage \nseveral times during that period of time both under Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents. Every time it has come up, we hear that same old \nsong: It is going to cost jobs. Guess what. Every time we raise the \nminimum wage, there has been no big loss of jobs. So there are no \nhistoric facts my Republican colleagues can point to to show that \nraising the minimum wage costs jobs.\n  They do refer to the Congressional Budget Office study. Actually, \nthat is wrong. It was not a Congressional Budget Office study. They \ndidn't do a study themselves. What they did is looked at the literature \nout there going back many years on potential job losses. Some of the \nold studies showed there would be a job loss; under a new study they \nsaid there wouldn't be. What CBO did is they averaged them all and \nsaid: Here is the average. They didn't say specifically 500,000 jobs \nwould be lost. They said somewhere between zero and 1 million jobs will \nbe lost, so we will pick the midpoint at 500,000. But, again, there is \nno historical evidence for this in terms of looking back.\n  We can go back and look at what happened to our economy every time we \nraised the minimum wage, and there has not been a massive job loss. \nThere has been shifting of jobs. People have been raised out of \npoverty. Working families do better. But there has been no massive job \nloss. So this is another myth.\n  As I said, the historical evidence is there has not been any job loss \ngenerally--not among teenagers, not among restaurant workers. In fact, \nthis year there has been more job growth in the 13 States that raised \ntheir State minimum wages at the start of this year than in the States \nthat didn't raise their minimum wage. Let me repeat that. There has \nbeen more job growth in States that raised their minimum wage beginning \nin January of this year than in the States that didn't raise their \nminimum wage. A lot of businesses are now understanding this. They \nunderstand that, as economists will tell you, it is the lack of \naggregate demand: not enough customers. People don't have enough money.\n  My Republican friends want to give more money to the top, more tax \ncuts for the wealthy. They get more money--millions more--a year. They \ndon't necessarily spend that on Main Street. They may go to Paris, they \nmay buy a new jet, a new big yacht. They do things like that, but it \ndoesn't really put money right on Main Street.\n  What small businesses and most economists know is that when you raise \nthe minimum wage, those people who get that raise aren't going off to \nParis. They aren't buying a private jet. They are spending it on Main \nStreet in their local stores and local businesses, and that gives a \ngreat economic boost to our whole economy.\n  So when we focus on the best research, the latest research that has \nbeen done, it unequivocally shows that raising the minimum wage does \nnot cause a job loss. Again, 600 economists, including 7 Nobel prize \nwinners, have endorsed a minimum wage hike of $10.10 an hour. Six \nhundred economists, including 7 Nobel prize winners, signed a letter \nsupporting $10.10.\n\n       We urge you to act now and enact a three-step raise of 95 \n     cents a year for three years--which would mean a minimum wage \n     of $10.10 by 2016--and then index it to protect against \n     inflation . . . these proposals will also usefully raise the \n     tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the regular minimum.\n       The evidence now shows that increases in the minimum wage \n     have had little or no negative effect on the employment of \n     minimum-wage workers. Even during times of weakness in the \n     labor market research suggests that a minimum-wage increase \n     could have a small stimulative effect on the economy, as low-\n     wage workers spend their additional earnings raising demand \n     and job growth and providing some help on the job front.\n\n  So, again, forget about the job loss. That is not going to take \nplace. What will take place is we will lift 7 million people out of \npoverty and 14 million children in America will be in families who will \nget a raise. That will be good for our kids.\n  We also hear from Republicans that some of the people who are going \nto benefit from a raise in the minimum wage aren't the poorest of the \npoor. It is not just people below the poverty line, but a lot of other \npeople will make more money, so therefore it must not be a good policy.\n  First of all, I want to dispel the myth that raising the minimum wage \ndoes not affect poverty. It does. Whether you use the CBO estimate of \nclose to 1 million workers lifted out of poverty or the results of more \nsophisticated economic research showing that up to 7 million workers \nwill be lifted out of poverty by the time the bill is fully \nimplemented, the evidence unequivocally shows that raising the minimum \nwage is an effective poverty-reduction tool.\n  But I will be the first to admit--and gladly, proudly--that this bill \ndoesn't just help people in poverty. It also helps low-income families \nwho are above the poverty line, and that is a good thing. That is a \ngood thing. A lot of low-income working families will get a raise. Here \nis basically the breakdown: 52 percent of those who will get a raise \nhave family incomes under $40,000; 31 percent, $60,000; and 17 percent, \n$40 to $60,000. So, again, it is for the people. Families making \n$40,000 a year will actually get a boost. How could that be? One person \nmay be making $20,000 and the other person may be making $15,000 or \n$18,000. They get a boost in the minimum wage, and they benefit. Is \nthat wrong? I don't think that is wrong at all. These are still \nstruggling families, struggling to make sure they get enough for their \nkids, make sure they put a little away for a rainy day, help their kids \nget a good education.\n  Evidently, our friends the Republicans are saying: Look, we should \nonly have something that benefits those who are in extreme poverty. \nThen they turn around in the Ryan budget and cut food stamps. What are \nthey saying? You know what they are really saying: Tough luck. You are \non your own. If you are a minimum wage worker, tough luck, and we don't \nwant to raise your minimum wage.\n  Well, 69 percent of the workers who would get a raise under this bill \nhave incomes that are under $60,000. So, yes, not everybody who is \ngoing to get a benefit from this is in poverty, but it will raise \nnearly 7 million people out of poverty and will also help some of our \nlower and middle-income families in America. I say that is a good \nthing, and I am proud that it does.\n  Consider an example. Jane and Joe--those are not their real names--\nare from Buchanan County in Iowa. They have two young boys. She is a \nwaitress and earns a few dollars an hour plus tips. He works at a gas \nstation for $7.25 an hour. They rely on food stamps and Medicaid. They \nhave applied for assistance through the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. They work opposite shifts, so they don't have to \npay for childcare--and it is difficult to find adequate care for their \nyounger son's medical needs--but this means they hardly ever see each \nother. A minimum wage increase would allow them to be together more as \na family.\n  David is a pizza cook in Iowa. He is getting married soon and has a \nchild on\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nthe way. He earns $9 an hour at his pizza job. So what did he do? He \ntook on another job framing houses. He is working about 65 hours a \nweek, no overtime. He has two jobs, so he is working 65 hours a week. \nThat is still not enough. If he worked an entire year at 65 hours a \nweek, he would only earn $30,400 a year. He is working 65 hours a week. \nThat is technically above the poverty line, but no one would say he is \nmaking plenty of money and he couldn't use a raise. He is starting a \nfamily.\n  When we raise the minimum wage, David will get a raise at both of his \njobs. At one job he is making $9 an hour, and at the other job he is \nmaking $9 an hour. He gets a raise at both. He told the Quad City Times \nthat a minimum wage raise would mean quite a bit to improve his life \nand help his growing family. So, yes, he is making 30,400 bucks a year \nworking 65 hours a week--two jobs.\n  You say: No, he shouldn't get this minimum wage increase.\n  That is what I hear from my Republican colleagues. But these are the \ntypes of families who are struggling. They need a boost, and we want to \ngive them a boost. We want to help them earn more money--not get more \nin food stamps or government programs but earn more money to provide \nfor their families and build a better life and have a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream.\n  My Republican friends are not only opposing a raise, they are \nproposing drastic cuts to programs that low-wage workers must rely on \nto survive. As I said earlier, the Ryan budget cuts more than 3.8 \nmillion people off of food stamps, leaving them without any lifeline to \nput food on the table. By contrast, raising the minimum wage would \nreduce the food stamp rolls by almost the same amount--as many as 3.6 \nmillion people--because it would allow them to earn enough money to buy \nfood for themselves. Both proposals save the taxpayer money, but under \nour proposal people get to eat. They get to put food on the table.\n  I have a hard time giving a lot of credence to people who say the \nincrease of the minimum wage doesn't really help people who are in \npoverty. It is untrue. The professed concern about the poorest of the \npoor stands in stark contrast with a Republican agenda that would \nincrease poverty and sacrifice a program that helps low-wage working \nfamilies survive.\n  Now I want to dispel another myth--that it would hurt small business. \nWe hear about this all the time, but every small business I have talked \nto says their biggest problem is not payroll costs; it is lack of \ndemand, lack of customers. They don't have customers with money to \nspend. So raising the minimum wage would help their bottom line.\n  A lot of small businesses I talk to also tell me they are frustrated, \ninfuriated by the fact that their competitors--the Walmarts and \nMcDonalds and other big businesses--pay rock-bottom wages that force \ntheir workers into public assistance. Well, this places responsible \nsmall businesses at a competitive disadvantage. It forces them to \nsubsidize their competitors' low wages through their tax dollars. That \nis not fair. It is bad for workers, small business, and our economy. \nSmall business owners understand this, and that is why the majority of \nthem support this bill. Again, opinion polls--small businesses support \nthe minimum wage 57 percent to 43 percent because they understand that \na raise in the minimum wage means their customers are going to have \nmore money to spend on Main Street.\n  That is why today I received a letter from Business for a Fair \nMinimum Wage, and 1,000 businesses, large and small, across the country \nsupport raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour--1,000 all across \nAmerica. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  So this letter and the polls show that most small businesses get it. \nThey know that increases in the minimum wage will increase consumer \ndemand. They also know they will have loyal, productive workers who \nwill stay longer and save businesses from having to constantly hire and \ntrain new people. Experienced workers who have been on the job longer \nare more efficient and deliver great customer service that keeps \ncustomers coming back.\n  Finally, some of my Republican colleagues have suggested that we \nshouldn't raise the minimum wage because they are better served by the \nearned-income tax credit. I support the earned-income tax credit, and, \nunlike many of my colleagues on the other side, I actually want to see \nit expanded so it better serves young and childless workers. Right now, \nif you are under the age of 25 and you are making the minimum wage of \n$7.25 an hour, you are making too much money to qualify for the earned-\nincome tax credit. If you are over age 25 and you make the minimum \nwage, $7.25 an hour, and you have one child, you get $3,250 in earned-\nincome tax credit, plus your childcare tax credit. That gets you up to \n19,300 bucks a year. What a deal. But if you are childless, you get no \nearned-income tax credit.\n  The veterans who were mentioned earlier--let's say a vet went into \nthe military when he or she was age 18. They got out after 3 years, 21 \nor 22, and they went out and got a job, a minimum wage job. They do not \nget the earned-income tax credit.\n  I am for expanding it. Let's expand the earned-income tax credit to \ncover childless workers under the age of 25. My Republican colleagues \nwon't support that. They won't support that.\n  The earned-income tax credit does provide some good support, but \nthink about this: It only does it once a year. The only time you get \nthe earned-income tax credit is after you file your taxes--then you get \na refund. That is once a year. Families don't live like that, \nespecially low-income families. They have a budget month after month \nfor heating, for electricity, for fuel, for car repairs, for clothes \nfor the kids. They cannot count on what is going to happen next year. \nTheir income tax credit is good, but it only happens once a year. That \nis not very good for budgeting purposes for any family. After all, the \ngas company will turn your gas off in the winter even if you are going \nto get an earned-income tax credit next April or May. They don't take \nthat into account. They take into account the fact that you cannot pay \nyour bill then. So the best way to help low-income families--minimum \nwage-earning families plus low-income families--the best way to help \nthem throughout the year is to increase the minimum wage.\n  Again, all the arguments we hear from the other side of the aisle \ndon't hold water. Today, while what I heard from the other side of the \naisle is more talk about the Keystone Pipeline--as if that is going to \nsolve all our problems--all we have to do is build the Keystone \nPipeline, and that solves all of our problems. It does? The restaurant \nworker in Maine, the hospital orderly in South Carolina, the parking \nlot attendant in Mississippi--they are all going to benefit from the \nKeystone Pipeline? I don't think so. Somehow that is going to take the \nplace of raising the minimum wage.\n  So they are trying a little diversion on this Keystone Pipeline. We \nwill provide some jobs, yes, for a couple of years, and when that is \nover, then what are you left with? And those kinds of jobs are not the \nkinds of jobs low-income workers would get, which would be pretty high-\nskilled, high-paying jobs for the Keystone Pipeline. So it doesn't \nreally hold water that the Keystone Pipeline is going to be the end-all \nand be-all for the economy. It just won't.\n  Raising the minimum wage is the most commonsense, practical thing we \ncan do right now to help low-income families, give a boost to our \neconomy, and save the taxpayers money. So I hope all my colleagues will \ndo the right thing.\n  So I hope all of my colleagues will do the right thing tomorrow, \nallow us to proceed to debate, and vote on increasing the minimum wage. \nMillions of American families will be watching this vote tomorrow. If \nthey are working hard during the day, they won't be tuning in to C-\nSPAN, but they will read about it, and they will know what this Senate \ndid about their paychecks and what we did about their desire to have a \nbetter life for their families, for their kids, and for their future.\n  I will also say this. If my Republican colleagues will join with us--\nat least five or six of them because we need 60 votes to get over the \nfilibuster--if we get five or six, then we can move to the bill. I hope \nwe will get 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 Republicans who will join us. If not, we\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nwill be back. This issue is not going away. I can guarantee we will be \nback. We will be back again and again and again.\n  The American people need a raise. CEOs are getting their raises: a \n21-percent increase since 2009--a 21-percent increase, an average CEO \nis paid; zero increase for minimum wage workers. It is now time to play \na little catchup ball and provide fairness for low-income workers in \nAmerica. So that is the vote tomorrow--a values vote, American values, \nfamily values, sound economic values. That is what the vote is about \ntomorrow. I hope and I trust that some of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side will join with us so we can move ahead to give working \nAmericans a raise and a fair shot at the American dream.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Business for a Fair Minimum Wage Federal Sign on Statement\n\n       As business owners and executives, we support raising the \n     federal minimum wage to strengthen our economy. The minimum \n     wage of $7.25 an hour amounts to just $15,080 a year for \n     health aides, childcare workers, cashiers, security guards \n     and other minimum wage workers. With less buying power than \n     it had in the 1960s, today's minimum wage impoverishes \n     working families and weakens the consumer demand at the heart \n     of our economy.\n       Raising the minimum wage makes good business sense. Workers \n     are also customers. Minimum wage increases boost sales at \n     local businesses as workers buy needed goods and services \n     they could not afford before. And nothing drives job creation \n     more than consumer demand. Businesses also see cost savings \n     from lower employee turnover and benefit from increased \n     productivity, product quality and customer satisfaction. \n     Increasing the minimum wage will also reduce the strain on \n     our social safety net caused by inadequate wages.\n       A recent national poll shows that 67 percent of small \n     business owners support increasing the federal minimum wage \n     and adjusting it yearly to keep pace with the cost of living. \n     The most rigorous studies of the impact of actual minimum \n     wage increases show they do not cause job loss--whether \n     during periods of economic growth or during recessions. The \n     minimum wage would be over $10 if it had kept up with the \n     rising cost of living since the 1960s instead of falling \n     behind.\n       We support gradually raising the federal minimum wage over \n     three years to at least $10.10 an hour, and then adjusting it \n     annually for inflation to keep up with the cost of living. A \n     fair minimum wage makes good sense for our businesses, our \n     workforce, our communities and our nation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise today to address the idea of \nraising the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. \nBut first I wish to spend a few moments talking about the state of the \nSenate and why the latest push for a higher Federal minimum wage isn't \nan issue that appears to be driven by solving the underlying economic \nproblems our Nation faces.\n  Over the past few weeks, the Senate majority leader has relished in \nmaking personal attacks on two private citizens, David and Charles \nKoch, on this Senate floor. He has used the Senate floor for the \npurpose of attempting to assassinate their character. They have \ncommitted no crimes, although the majority leader appears to treat it \nas a crime that they don't support him politically. Many political \nobservers can see this for exactly what it is: a desperate political \nstrategy designed to distract from the economic misery that is being \nvisited on the American people by a failed economic agenda. The Senate \nmajority leader is using the Senate floor to run a political campaign \nagainst entrepreneurs and philanthropists who have dared to stand and \nspeak out against the failed Obama economic agenda. The reason he is \ndoing so should not surprise anyone. On substance, the record of this \nadministration cannot be defended. They can't talk about how great \nObamaCare is working because millions of Americans have lost their \nhealth insurance plans and lost the doctors they like, despite the \nPresident's repeated promises to the contrary. Health insurance plans \nhave skyrocketed in States all across this country, especially for \nyoung people in the individual market who are seeing their rates \nsometimes double or triple. And they certainly can't talk about the \nstate of the economy.\n  Today, we have the lowest labor force participation since 1978. The \nofficial unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, but that doesn't capture the \nmillions who are underemployed. When we include them, the number rises \nto 12.7 percent. The rates of poverty in the United States are right \nnow at historic highs--15 percent. As CNN recently noted, this is ``the \nfirst time the poverty rate has remained at or above 15 percent 3 years \nrunning since 1965.''\n  Among full-time workers, there are more than 3.8 million fewer \nemployed today than there were before the recession. The number of \npeople not in the labor force today is at its highest level since 1978. \nOver 91 million people are not in the American workforce. Roughly three \nof five working-age Americans have jobs today. This is a travesty. It \nis a denial of the American dream to millions of people across this \ncountry.\n  Long-term unemployment persists. Nearly 36 percent of the unemployed \nare long-term unemployed. When President Obama took office, the average \nnumber of weeks that an individual was unemployed was 19.8. Today, the \naverage duration is 35.6 weeks.\n  It is also a good thing the President has begun to talk about income \ninequality. It is a good thing because income inequality has increased \ndramatically under President Obama. Today, the top 1 percent in our \neconomy earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928, and \nthose who are being hurt the most in the Obama economy are the most \nvulnerable among us--the people who are struggling. The working class \nHispanics, African Americans, and single moms are the ones paying the \nprice for the great stagnation in which we find ourselves.\n  According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans who describe \nthemselves as middle or upper class fell 8 points between 2008 and \n2012. President Obama's terrible economy doesn't discriminate. It hurts \nAmericans from every demographic. On the President's watch, women have \nlower incomes today. The median income for women has dropped by $733 \nsince President Obama took office, and, indeed, poverty among women has \ngone up markedly under President Obama. The poverty rate for women has \nincreased from 14.4 percent when the President took office to 16.3 \npercent. In real terms, that means 3.7 million more American women are \nin poverty today than when the President took office.\n  The President is not responding to any of this. Instead, we see the \nPresident, we see the Senate majority leader shifting to the topic of a \nmandated Federal minimum wage in an effort to change the subject. But \nthe undeniable reality, the undeniable truth is that if the President \nsucceeded in raising the minimum wage, it would cost jobs for the most \nvulnerable. The people who have been hurt by this Obama economy would \nbe hurt worse by the minimum wage proposal before this body.\n  In 2013, the President, in his State of the Union address, proposed \nraising the minimum wage to $9. A year later, the request has magically \nchanged to $10.10. There is no economic justification. The only reason \nis politics. I suppose if the approval ratings of Democratic Members of \nthis body continue to fall, in another month we will see a proposal for \n$15 an hour and then maybe $20 or $25 an hour.\n  But I think the American people are tired of empty political show \nvotes.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that raising the \nminimum wage could cause the loss of 500,000 to 1 million jobs. I want \nthe American people to realize, and every Member of this Senate, that \nvotes for the minimum wage is voting to tell up to 1 million Americans: \nYour jobs don't matter to me because I am voting to take away your job.\n  By the way, this view is not only the view of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. On March 12, 2014, over 500 economists, \nincluding three Nobel Laureates, sent a letter to Congress that said \nthe minimum wage is a poorly targeted anti-poverty measure. I will give \none example from my home State. GO-Burgers, which is a Texas company \nwith six Burger King restaurants, analyzed the effect of the minimum \nwage increase on their employees and their businesses. The last minimum \nwage increase we have seen was from $5.85 an hour in 2007 to $7.25 an \nhour in July of 2009, and 2010 was the first complete calendar year \nthat GO-Burgers had to analyze the impact\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\non their workers. GO-Burgers discovered that raising the minimum wage \nby 23.93 percent caused these Burger King restaurants to reduce the \navailable hours worked by 24.98 percent, for a net sum loss in hours \nand wages for the typical employee.\n  Let me repeat that. The experience in these Burger King restaurants \nwas the employees were worse off after the minimum wage was raised \nbecause their hours got cut in direct response to the increase. These \nsix restaurants eliminated over 40 jobs and reduced the average number \nof hours worked per employee. In total, these six Burger King \nrestaurants reduced the man-hours allocated by over 60,000 hours in \n2010. Sadly, the people that bear the brunt of that are not the rich \nand powerful. They are not those who walk the corridors of power in \nWashington, DC, and have gotten fat and happy under the Obama \nadministration. The people who would bear the brunt if this bill were \npassed would be, to a substantial degree, young African American \nteenagers and young Hispanic teenagers. Right now, young minorities, if \nwe look at unemployment rates by race--just looking at the official \nunemployment rates, Anglos have an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent; \nHispanics, 7.9 percent; African Americans, 12.4 percent--nearly double \nthat in the white community. It is even more heartbreaking among \nteenagers. White teens currently have an unemployment rate of 18.3 \npercent, but African American teenagers have an unemployment rate of \n36.1 percent--36.1 percent. Every Senator who votes yes is voting with \nan absolute certainty that hundreds of thousands of workers, including \na great many African American teenagers and a great many Hispanic \nteenagers, will be laid off as a consequence of their vote. I would \nchallenge any of the Senators in this Chamber to look in the eyes of \nthose African American teenagers, those Hispanic teenagers who are \nlooking for a better opportunity.\n  If my colleagues detect a note of passion in my voice as I discuss \nthis, it is because in my family this is not an abstract, hypothetical \nsituation. Fifty-seven years ago, when my father fled Cuba and came to \nTexas at the age of 18, penniless, not speaking English, his first job \nwas working in the restaurant industry as a dishwasher making 50 cents \nan hour. The restaurant industry had been such a terrific avenue for \nclimbing the economic ladder, for achieving the American dream. My dad \nwashed dishes at 50 cents an hour to pay his way through college to go \non and start a small business to work toward the American dream. If the \nmajority leader had his way, if the minimum wage were jacked up, if \nback in 1957 the restaurant where my father worked were forced to pay \nevery worker $2 an hour, the odds are very high that restaurant would \nhave fired my dad and bought a dishwasher instead. It was that entry-\nlevel job that gave him the grip on the first rung of the economic \nladder that led him to pull to the second and the third and the fourth. \nThis bill, if it were to pass, would hammer those on the bottom of the \neconomic ladder and would take away jobs from the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  So what should we do instead? We can talk about the problems we have \nin this country, but we need to talk proactively about better \nsolutions. Fortunately, we are on the cusp of a great American energy \nrenaissance.\n  I have introduced legislation to remove the barriers to developing \nthe abundant energy resources we have in this country--barriers that, \nif removed, would allow the creation of millions of high-paying jobs.\n  The discussion before this Chamber is whether to raise the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour. But even if it passed, that is not the Obama \nminimum wage. Rather, the real Obama minimum wage is $0.00 an hour. We \nhave right now the lowest labor participation rate since 1978.\n  To the millions of Americans who have lost their job because of $1.7 \ntrillion in new taxes, because of crushing regulations, this is the \nObama minimum wage: $0.00--not the political window dressing of $10.10; \nthe reality, the hard, brutal reality.\n  Last week, I was in Nebraska at a rally. A woman named Barb came up \nto me. She hugged my neck. She said: Ted, I am a single mom. I have six \nlittle kids at home. My husband left me, and he is not paying child \nsupport. I am working five jobs, trying to keep my kids fed, trying to \nkeep them with clothes on their backs. Barb had tears in her eyes.\n  One of the most brutal consequences of ObamaCare is it has forced \nmillions of Americans like Barb into part-time work because the \nthreshold for ObamaCare is 30 hours a week.\n  So instead of having one or two jobs, Barb and millions of other \nsingle moms are going from one job to another, to another, to another, \nand they are not spending the time with their kids. This is the brutal \nreality of the Obama minimum wage.\n  But, Madam President, I am happy to tell you, there is a better \nalternative. The better alternative, I would note--far better than \nzero, far better than the promise of $10.10 an hour--is $46.98. Madam \nPresident, $46.98--that is the average hourly wage in the oil and gas \nindustry in the State of North Dakota.\n  Every one of us should want to see millions more jobs at $46.98 an \nhour, and we should want millions rescued from the Obama minimum wage \nof $0.00 an hour. That is the choice before this body--of expanding \nthis American energy renaissance, creating opportunity.\n  Let me tell you, in the State of Texas--Texas is an incredible \nexample--there is a reason why 1,400 people a day are moving to Texas, \nmoving from high-tax, high-regulation States, represented by many of \nour friends on the Democratic side of the aisle. They are coming to \nTexas because Texas is where the jobs are and Texas is where the \nsalaries are.\n  Oil and gas industry jobs in Texas paid, on average, 150 percent more \nthan other private sector jobs in Texas--$128,000 a year compared to \n$51,000 a year--in 2012.\n  In the 23 counties atop the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas, average \nwages for all citizens have grown by 14.6 percent annually since 2005.\n  The top five counties in the Eagle Ford shale region have experienced \nan average 63-percent annual rate of wage growth.\n  How many millions of Americans would love to see 63 percent annual \nwage growth?\n  In Texas, the average pay for an entry-level truckdriver ranges from \n$36,000 to $45,000, but it rises to $50,000 to $70,000 in the oilfield. \nThese are kids straight out of high school making $70,000 a year.\n  As reported in an AP story from March 28, 2014: ``James LeBas, \neconomist for the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said the industry \ndirectly employed 416,000 employees in 2013 and they averaged $120,000 \na year in wages.''\n  As a separate nation, Texas right now would rank as the ninth largest \noil-producing country in the world.\n  Not only can energy development bring good-paying jobs, it can also \nhelp our children and schools. Cotulla, TX, was once one of the poorest \ndistricts in Texas, but now--because of the Eagle Ford shale energy \ndevelopment--it is one of the richest. The taxes that are coming from \nthe energy development mean money for fixing schools, for hiring \nteachers, for paying them more, and for purchasing technology in the \nclassrooms.\n  One thing that is striking is what has happened across the country. \nIf you look, this is a map I have in the Chamber of changes in median \nhousehold income by county from 2007 to 2012. Madam President, 2007 to \n2012 is a long time.\n  On this map, green indicates that the median household income has \ngone up; yellow indicates no statistically significant change; and red \nindicates it has gone down.\n  Overlaid on this map is an overlay of the geological shale formations \nin this country. What is striking about looking at median incomes in \nthe United States is where median incomes have gone up. This is almost \nexactly a geological shale map of the United States.\n  You can see median incomes have gone up up here in the Bakken shale \nin and around North Dakota. You can see the Permian Basin shale, the \nEagle Ford shale, the Barnett shale. You can see the Marcellus shale. \nGreen, green, green, green--median income going up--for everyone in the \ncounty median income going up where energy production is occurring.\n  Now, strikingly, the Marcellus shale extends north to New York, and \nyet for\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nthe entire State of New York, you can see there is not a county in the \nState of New York where median income has gone up. Why? Well, one of \nthe main reasons is the Democratic politicians in New York have \nprohibited developing those natural resources because they ban \nfracking.\n  So in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvanians apparently would like jobs, would \nlike higher median incomes. They are seeing the benefits. But in New \nYork, New Yorkers are not because Democratic politicians in New York \nhave prohibited developing those resources.\n  I would note that one of the most promising areas is the Monterey \nshale in California--abundant resources--and you would note, in the \nentire State of California there is not one green county. That is \nbecause California, likewise--even though they have those resources, \nthe Democratic politicians there have concluded Californians do not \nwant jobs, they do not want higher incomes, and they are going to \nprohibit developing their natural resources rather than providing for \nthe very real suffering that is being caused.\n  I would note, there is one striking exception from this pattern being \nlargely a geological shale formation of this country, and that is the \nbright green on the map that is located right here where we are \nstanding--the District of Columbia and the surrounding areas.\n  Let me tell you, it is a good time to be in and around government. \nThe lobbyists, the consultants, those who make money on the growing and \ngrowing and growing Federal Government spending and debt, are getting \nfatter and happier every day. You look at the rest of the country, and \nyou see stagnation, you see median income falling.\n\n  Rather than engaging in political games--driven by polling done by \nthe Democratic Senatorial Committee on this minimum wage bill that, if \npassed, would only hurt low-income African-American and Hispanic \nteenagers--instead, we ought to come together with bipartisan unanimity \nto say: We will stand with the American people to bring millions of \njobs. We will stand with the American people to raise median income. We \nwill stand with the American people to make it easier for people who \nare struggling to achieve the American dream.\n  Therefore, I have proposed an amendment to replace the text of S. \n2223, the minimum wage act, with the text of the American Energy \nRenaissance Act that I have introduced, S. 2170.\n  We should all come together and vote on removing the government \nbarriers, opening new Federal lands and resources, developing high-\npaying, promising jobs that expand opportunity.\n  In conclusion, let me say this debate comes down to two numbers. It \nis not a complicated debate. This debate comes down to two numbers. On \nmy left, the real Obama minimum wage: $0.00 an hour. I am sorry to say, \nin this Democratic Senate, this Chamber is largely empty. There is no \ndiscussion of fundamental tax reform or regulatory reform, of removing \nthe barriers that have caused the lowest labor force participation \nsince 1978.\n  Instead, we are debating a bill to increase unemployment. This \nminimum-wage bill--the nonpartisan CBO has told us more people would be \npaid $0.00 an hour under the bill before this Chamber. No wonder \nCongress's approval rating is 8, 10, 12 percent, when you take the \ngreatest challenge facing Americans right now--the need for economic \ngrowth and jobs--and the U.S. Senate in Democratic control will not \neven talk about providing real relief there. No wonder people are \ndisgusted with the U.S. Congress.\n  You want to know what this debate is about? Compare $0.00 an hour to \n$46.98 an hour. I want to see millions of Americans making $40, $50, \n$60 an hour, providing for their kids, having a better future.\n  As I travel this country, over and over again, men and women come up \nto me. They look me in the eyes and say: Ted, I am scared. I am scared \nthat we are bankrupting this country. I am scared that my kids and \ngrandkids are not going to have the future, the opportunity, the \nfreedom we have been blessed to have.\n  This U.S. Senate has an opportunity to address that. We should pass \nthe American Energy Renaissance Act. We should stop making it harder \nfor working Americans, but, instead, we should come together for jobs \nand economic growth.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HERSMAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to commend the departing \nChairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Deborah A.P. \nHersman, as she prepares to launch a new career as president and CEO of \nthe century-old National Safety Council.\n  A 12-year veteran staffer of Capitol Hill, Debbie is no stranger to \nmany Senators on both sides of the aisle. After graduating with a \ndegree in political science from Virginia Tech and receiving a master's \nin conflict resolution from George Mason University, she worked as a \nstaffer for my former colleague, Congressman Bob Wise, where she rose \nfrom intern to staff director and then to senior legislative aide. He \nused to say, ``She has a backbone. Don't ever think that you are ever \ngoing to push her over.'' I can see why.\n  Debbie came to the Senate in 1999 to work for the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation under the leadership of Senator \nJay Rockefeller. Her efforts during that time contributed to the \npassage of some of the benchmark legislation underpinning the \ntransportation safety framework she vigorously upheld as NTSB Chairman, \nsuch as the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, Pipeline \nSafety Improvement Act of 2002, Transportation Equity Act of the 21st \nCentury, and Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act.\n  Debbie's outstanding leadership at the NTSB has helped make traveling \nsafer for all Americans. She was the NTSB member on scene for the \nterrible Metro train collision in 2009 in this city where nine people \nlost their lives and dozens were injured. I was glad to see that she \nand the agency took charge of the investigation, and I admire her \ncommitment to ensuring such a horrific incident will not occur again.\n  Debbie oversaw the timely completion of several high-profile accident \ninvestigations during her tenure as Chairman, including the deadly 2011 \ncrash at the Reno National Championship Air Races. During the third lap \nof a six-lap race, 11 people lost their lives and many suffered \ninjuries when a show plane plummeted into the spectator stands. As many \nof you know, these are enormously popular events. I have attended them \nmany times. Our late colleague Senator Ted Stevens was a big fan. My \nown grandchildren attended those races the very week of the crash.\n  I commend Debbie and her team for the work they did in the aftermath \nof the tragedy, and to issue timely and effective recommendations to \nhelp save lives and prevent injuries in the future. Her efficient work \nprior to the first anniversary of the crash enabled the annual air show \ntradition--so important to northern Nevada for nearly 50 years--to \ncontinue even more safely than before. The recommendations provided by \nthe NTSB will ensure that tens of thousands of spectators can safety \nenjoy these races.\n  Debbie is acknowledged as a visionary, passionate, and bipartisan \nsafety leader who advocates for safety across all modes of \ntransportation. At the NTSB, she has been on scene for more than 20 \nmajor transportation incidents; chaired scores of NTSB hearings, \nforums, and events; and regularly testifies before Congress. She was \nfirst appointed as an NTSB board member by President George W. Bush in \n2004. In 2009, President Obama reappointed her to a second 5-year term \nand appointed her to a 2-year term as Chairman, making her, at age 39, \nthe youngest person ever to fill that position. President Obama \nreappointed her as Chairman in 2011, and in August 2013, he nominated \nher for a third term as Chairman and for a third term as a Board \nmember, all with unanimous Senate confirmation.\n  Among her many initiatives, Debbie has focused attention and actions \non distracted driving, child passenger safety, and helping accident \nvictims and their families. Her leadership has created a more \ntransparent and accountable organization by significantly increasing \nthe quantity and quality of NTSB information available on the agency's \nWeb site, holding more public meetings to highlight safety issues, and \nembracing social media to communicate with the broadest possible \naudience of the traveling public.\n  Debbie always emphasizes the NTSB's role as ``the conscience and the \ncompass of the transportation industry.'' The Nation has benefitted \nfrom nearly a decade of her stewardship in the agency's leadership. \nWhile we are saying goodbye to this passionate standard bearer of \npublic safety in the Federal realm, I am very pleased that we are not \nlosing her energy on these issues altogether. Her move to lead the \nNational Safety Council will open up new doors to her, that \norganization, and to safety initiatives benefitting the entire county. \nIt is yet another step forward in an illustrious career of heartfelt \npublic service dedicated to protecting the well-being of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2463-6", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2463-S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WRIGLEY FIELD'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to recognize the 100th birthday \nof an American icon: Wrigley Field. As the second oldest Major League \nball park and oldest in the National League, Wrigley Field has hosted \nmillions of fans and easily earned its nickname, The Friendly Confines.\n  On April 23rd, 1914, it opened its doors not to the Chicago Cubs, and \nit wasn't even called Wrigley Field. It was called Weeghman Park, and \nthe Chicago Chifeds of the short-lived Federal League played there. The \nChicago Cubs moved into their home in 1916.\n  From the ivy-covered outfield walls, to its hand-turned score board, \nto the bleachers and the marquee, you always know you are at Wrigley \nField. It was\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nthe last baseball stadium to have lights installed in 1988. It was the \nfirst stadium to have an organ playing music, and that music remains to \nthis day, the first to build permanent concession stands, the first to \nhave live broadcast of games. While there is some dispute whether \nWrigley was the first place to allow fans to keep the balls hit into \nthe stands, it certainly is where the custom began of throwing back the \nopponent's homerun balls.\n  Wrigley hasn't always been home to the Cubs exclusively. The Decatur \nStaleys moved to play football there in 1921. You know them today as \nthe Chicago Bears, and from 1921 to 1970, Wrigley was their home too. \nAnd the reason they are called the Bears is because the Cubs were \nalready playing there. Wrigley has hosted soccer matches, concerts, and \neven a National Hockey League game. The first All-American Girls \nProfessional Baseball League's first All Star Game during the 1943 \nmidseason was played at Wrigley Field. They brought in temporary lights \nfor that game.\n  The Wrigley experience means people come to have fun at the game and \nbe involved in the game. It was as true in 1920 as it is today. \nGenerations of kids have come to Wrigley to watch their first ballgame \nin the same seat their parents and grandparents watched theirs. For \nCubs fans, the ball park is a community as much as a place where \nbaseball is played. Wrigley Field is surrounded by small businesses \nthat depend on the community. Fans go every day by foot, by bicycle, by \ntrain, or by car into the neighborhood known as Wrigleyville to see the \nChicago Cubs play at their treasure of a stadium.\n  And they have seen legends. On June 26, 1920, a 17-year-old high \nschool player hit a game-winning grand slam completely out of the park \nwhen his New York School of Commerce team played Chicago's Lane Tech \nHigh School. That was Lou Gehrig. Babe Ruth's called shot? It was at \nWrigley Field in 1932 in the World Series. It is still debated. My \nboyhood hero, St. Louis Cardinal Stan Musial, recorded his 3000th hit \nin Wrigley. In fact, it has been said that the visiting clubhouse has \nhad more Hall of Famers in one room than any other facility that exists \nin sports.\n  It is not just those visiting Wrigley that made the memories but \nthose we claim as our own. Harry Caray was an announcer for decades, \nbut it was at Wrigley Field where he became a legend with his dark-\nframed glasses, joviality, and his singing ``Take Me Out To The Ball \nGame'' with the crowd. It is a tradition still carried today. Ernie \nBanks' boundless energy and joy for the game, ``Let's play two!'' Ron \nSanto, Billy Williams, Fergie Jenkins, Ryne Sandberg, Hack Wilson, \nAndre Dawson, Kerry Wood, and so many others are beloved for their time \nplaying for the Cubs in The Friendly Confines.\n  ``There is always next year,'' a phrase too often uttered by Cubs \nfans, could just as easily be a promise that our field, Wrigley Field, \nis as much a part of the future as it is our past.\n  Madam President, it is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in celebrating the 100th anniversary of one of America's \ngreatest landmarks, Wrigley Field. Holy cow, what a ride it has been \nfor such a wonderful place at 1060 W. Addison in Chicago, IL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2464-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING THE COLUMBINE TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, fifteen years ago, Colorado \ncommunities were shaken by a horrific act of violence at Columbine High \nSchool where 12 students and a teacher tragically lost their lives and \nmany others were injured. In the wake of this violence, Coloradans came \ntogether to be there for their friends and neighbors and stood united \nas one community.\n  The strength of this community is embodied no more clearly than by \nColumbine High School principal Frank DeAngelis. Principal DeAngelis is \nretiring at the end of the school year, capping 34 years of dedication \nto education, community service, resilience, and leadership.\n  Principal DeAngelis has spent the past 18 years leading the school, \nfulfilling the promise he made after the attack that he would remain as \nprincipal until all the students in Columbine feeder schools at the \ntime had graduated.\n  It is this enduring spirit and the strength of so many in the \ncommunity that have allowed us to heal and reflect. On this somber \nanniversary, let's remember the victims, honor the resilience of the \nsurvivors, and collaborate to find ways to reduce these types of \nsenseless tragedies.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, April 20 marked the 15th anniversary of \nthe tragic shooting at Columbine High School. I come to the floor to \nhonor the memories of the 12 young, innocent students, and beloved \nteacher we lost, and to recognize the bravery that so many educators \nand first responders showed on that horrific day.\n  On the day of the anniversary, Coloradans gathered at Clement Park in \nLittleton to remember the victims and recommit to preventing these acts \nof senseless violence from ever happening again. Coni Sanders, the \ndaughter of Coach Dave Sanders who was killed that day, spoke at the \ngathering. If I could just share a few of her words, I think they ring \nvery true.\n  She said,\n\n       Fifteen years ago, Columbine was a massacre. Columbine was \n     a tragedy. Columbine was synonymous with death. Today, we \n     recognize that Columbine is a community and that even the \n     most violent of hate could not shake us.\n\n  Coni's words express the pain we have all been left with in the wake \nof too many similar tragedies in Colorado and across the country. But \nher words also remind us of the enduring strength of our communities \nand the need to do more to combat gun violence in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2464-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2464-S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Madam President, I wish to recognize Special \nOlympics Alaska for their outstanding job in improving the lives of \nthose with intellectual disabilities.\n  Special Olympics was founded by the late Eunice Mary Kennedy Shriver \nin 1962. Mrs. Shriver saw how unfairly people with intellectual \ndisabilities were treated and founded Camp Shriver, which eventually \nevolved to Special Olympics in 1968. Special Olympics Alaska also \ntraces its beginnings back to 1968, when they held their first State \ngames in 1969 in Fairbanks. Since then, the Special Olympics Alaska \nprograms have grown to include over 500 athletes and 1,000 volunteers \naround the State.\n  Through sports, the athletes are able to see what they are capable of \nachieving and quickly gain confidence. I have seen firsthand how \nSpecial Olympics Alaska uses the power of sports to help athletes learn \nabout friendly competition and sportsmanship, as well as provide them \nwith an opportunity to make friendships that will last a lifetime.\n  In 2001, Anchorage hosted the Special Olympics World Winter Games. \nMore than 1,800 athletes representing 70 countries competed in 7 \nOlympic-type winter sports--making this the largest sporting event ever \nheld in the history of Alaska. This year, Special Olympics Alaska will \nopen its first Athlete Training Center and Campus in Anchorage on May \n8. This facility will give the athletes a dedicated facility to \npractice and prepare for future games in which they will represent \nAlaska.\n  I would like to recognize Special Olympics Alaska and all the work \nthey do to improve the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. \nI wish the absolute best to the athletes, families and supporters as \nthey transition into their new training center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2465-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING BUD PURDY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to honor a true Idaho \noriginal, a man who set the bar high for ranching and conservation in \nmy State and established a world-class trout fishery.\n  Every so often, a generation produces remarkable characters--\nindividuals who set their sights high and leave the bar higher for us. \nBud Purdy of Picabo, ID, was one of those people. While he could not \nclaim Idaho by birth, he more than proved to be an Idahoan through his \nexperiences, work ethic, and inclinations. He began working on a family \nsheep ranch in Blaine County at Picabo, near Sun Valley, during summers \nin 1928. Not long after, a young Bud Purdy climbed nearby Hyndman Peak \nat over 12,000 feet. He graduated from college by the time he was 20, \nand despite an offer to go into banking, he chose to manage that family \nranch. He was a hunting partner for writer Ernest Hemingway. There \nwasn't much Bud Purdy could not do. He was still flying his own \nairplane at the age of 94. He was--and is--considered an Idaho legend.\n  Bud made his mark in Picabo, Sun Valley, and Idaho. Near his ranch \nthere is a creek that is world-renown--Silver Creek. It was along that \ncreek that Bud joined a young Hemingway, actor Gary Cooper, and many \nothers to fish and hunt birds. When Hemingway moved to Idaho in 1959, \nhe had already been hunting with Bud for many years. The Purdy ranch \nconsisted of 6,000 acres along Silver Creek. The waters of that creek \nare so crystal clear that you can see the trout. I have been one of \nthose lucky enough to fish there. Bud and his family were visionaries. \nThey donated a 3,500 acre easement to the Nature Conservancy that meant \nthe land could never be subdivided, and the world-class fishery remains \nthere today, just like it was when Bud arrived 86 years ago.\n  Bud felt all ranchers should have a strong conservation ethic, and he \nwas one of the first to employ rest-rotation grazing to protect the \nland and water. Bud got that message out as a founder of the Idaho \nRangeland Resource Commission. He was recently inducted into the Idaho \nHall of Fame, joining the likes of Hemingway, poet Ezra Pound, skier \nPicabo Street, former U.S. Senator William Borah, and agri-businessman \nJ.R. Simplot.\n  It was important to Bud to pass along the message to care about the \nland, and he has succeeded admirably. As he told writer Steven Stuebner \nin an article for the Rangeland Commission about the ranching \nprofession:\n\n       Once you get started in it, you're hooked. Every morning, \n     you get up and do something different. You turn out on the \n     range and ride a horse every day. Even now, I go out and make \n     sure the water is OK, check the fences and make sure the \n     gates are closed. It's just a constant going out there and \n     doing it. I was never a cowboy, but I've ridden a million \n     miles.\n\n  That description of the ranch life in Central Idaho sounds a long way \nfrom Capitol Hill, but the hard work ethic and the dedication to \nprinciple is what made Bud Purdy an Idaho, and American, hero. His life \nof service is something we can all aspire to, or as Idaho Governor \nButch Otter said, ``someone whose life was a lesson in cowboy ethics, \ncommon sense, stewardship and the value of hard work and \nperseverance''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2465-4", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2465-S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING RICKY DEL FIORENTINO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Sheriff's Deputy Ricky Del Fiorentino, an \nexceptional law enforcement officer, a devoted and loyal friend, and \nmost of all a dedicated family man, who was tragically killed in the \nline of duty on March 19, 2014.\n  Ricky Del Fiorentino was born and raised in Napa, CA, where he \nexcelled in both football and wrestling at Napa High School. His high \nschool football coach called him the best lineman he had ever trained. \nRicky also placed second in the heavyweight division of the State \nwrestling championship in 1982 and later earned a scholarship to \nwrestle at the University of Oklahoma. In 1998, he was inducted into \nthe Napa High Athletic Hall of Fame.\n  After graduating from the Napa Valley Police Academy, Ricky joined \nthe Mendocino County Sheriff's Office. His distinguished 26-year law \nenforcement career in Mendocino County included 10 years with the Fort \nBragg Police before he returned to the sheriff's department in 2000. \nResidents of the Mendocino coast remember Deputy Del Fiorentino as a \ncalm, towering presence and a guardian of the community. At a \ncandlelight vigil in his honor, many community members described him as \ngentle, helpful, trusting, loving, and caring, relating personal \ninteractions that had stayed with them for years.\n  Deputy Del Fiorentino was a respected and experienced leader, \npassionate about his work and never hesitant to help someone in need. \nIn 1992, he dove into the Noyo River to rescue a young man who had \njumped off the\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nNoyo Bridge. In 1998, he again showed his courage by rescuing four \npeople who had been swept into the water at Pudding Creek by a sneaker \nwave. These heroic acts were second nature to Deputy Del Fiorentino, \nwho received many official commendations from the community he served.\n  Deputy Del Fiorentino's friends say he had a ready smile, was quick \nto laugh, was an avid outdoorsman and a devoted husband, father, and \nbrother. When he was not on duty he spent as much time as he could with \nhis friends and family.\n  Ricky Del Fiorentino devoted his life to his family, his community, \nand his country. His dedicated and courageous service will not be \nforgotten. On behalf of the people of California, whom he served so \nbravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his family, \nfriends, and colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2466-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS\n\n Mr. DONNELLY.

He brought his passion for trains to his \nwork as chief estimator of track at the Railroad Construction Company, \nwhere he worked for the past 14 years. Matthew worked on major \ninfrastructure projects that New Jersey's citizens see and use every \nday, including the Secaucus Road separation project, the U.S. Route 46 \ninterchange improvements in Wayne, Route 46 over Overpeck Creek in \nBergen County, and the Lackawanna Avenue improvement and bridge \nreplacement in West Paterson.\n  He taught concurrently as a professor at Stevens Institute of \nTechnology in Hoboken, where he earned his bachelors and masters \ndegrees.

The \nColorado Press Association wisely named Mr. Silbernagel the 2013 \n``Newspaper Person of the Year,'' and the Colorado Associated Press \nEditors and Reporters Association awarded him the first place award for \neditorial writing in 2012. Over his years in journalism, Mr. \nSilbernagel received dozens of other awards for editorial writing, \ncolumn writing, news reporting, and online content from the Colorado \nPress Association, the Colorado Associated Press Editors and Reporters, \nCox Newspapers, and the National Associated Press Editors.\n  Born in Madison, WI, Mr. Silbernagel received his journalism degree \nfrom the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973, after which he worked \nas a political reporter, environmental writer, business writer, city \neditor, and bureau reporter. He authored three books, most recently \n``Troubled Trails: The Meeker Affair and the Expulsion of Utes from \nColorado'' in 2011; ``Dinosaur Stalkers, Tracking Dinosaur Discoveries \nof Western Colorado and Eastern Utah'' in 1996, and ``Parks & Trails, A \nGuide and History for the Colorado Riverfront Project in Mesa County'' \nin 2004.\n  Upon his retirement from the Daily Sentinel, Jay Seaton, publisher of \nthe newspaper, aptly described Mr. Silbernagel as ``not a purveyor of \nsound bites or catchy gotchas'' but as ``a careful journalist whose \nlogic and dispassionate presentation of undisputed facts [made] his \neditorials not just compelling but illuminating.''

Madam President, I wish to commemorate \nthe 100th anniversary of the Ludlow Massacre. On April 20, 1914, 20 \nsouthern Coloradan men, women and children tragically lost their lives \nin one of the most dramatic confrontations for workers' rights in the \nUnited States. As we reflect on this tragedy, let us remember these \nbrave Coloradans whose courageousness prompted lasting changes in \nnational labor relations.\n  The families of Ludlow 100 years ago aren't that different from \nColoradans today. They, too, came to Colorado in search of opportunity \nand a better life. But unlike today's Coloradans, these miners worked \nprolonged days in unsafe working conditions, had few protections or \navenues for airing grievances, and spent much of their income to pay \nmine operators for inflated rent\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nand supplies. Ludlow miners, representing a cross-section of early 20th \ncentury America, stood together as one to fight for fair wages, safer \nworking conditions, the right to live and shop where they wanted, an 8-\nhour workday, and dignity in the workplace. In doing so, some of these \nmen, women, and children paid dearly with their lives.\n  After major coal companies rejected the demands of the miners and \nevicted Ludlow residents from their company homes for striking, a tent \ncommunity arose outside of Ludlow. This camp is where months of \nescalation would reach its dramatic and tragic conclusion. On April 20, \n1914, a gun battle erupted between miners and National Guardsmen acting \nalongside the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company security personnel. Over \n20 individuals lost their lives in this fight, including 11 children \nand 2 women trapped beneath a burning tent in a pit meant to serve as \nrefuge. The public outrage over the Ludlow Massacre, as it came to be \nknown, was intense and deep.\n  A century after this historic event, we remember those who lost their \nlives and honor the courage of the Coloradans who stood up for their \nrights. Because of their bravery, mining towns began to enact reforms \nthat banned child labor, improved worker safety, and protected \nunionized workers from discrimination. Legislation in 1933 enabled \nunionization throughout Colorado's coalfields, protecting mine workers \nwho continue contributing to our State's economy. The Ludlow Massacre \nwas also a watershed moment that ushered in a national shift in labor \nrelations, including the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, \nwhich protects workers' most basic rights.\n  During the 100th anniversary of the Ludlow Massacre, we recognize our \nappreciation for the progress of American labor relations in exchange \nfor the ultimate sacrifices of these Coloradans and many other American \nworkers.\n  Thank you for joining me in remembrance and reflection of this \nimportant day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2467-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 298.

A bill to clarify the application of certain leverage and \nrisk-based requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Mike Johanns and Sherrod Brown, in introducing the \nInsurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014. We are pleased \nto be joined by Senators Kirk and Tester as cosponsors. This \nlegislation clarifies the Federal Reserve's authority to recognize\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nthe distinctions between banking and insurance when implementing \nsection 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the \n``Collins Amendment'' since I wrote this provision of the law.\n  Before I describe our bill in detail, I would like to provide some \nbackground on section 171 and why it is so important that nothing be \ndone to diminish or weaken it.\n  We all recall the circumstances we faced 4 years ago, as our Nation \nwas emerging from the most serious financial crisis since the Great \nDepression. That crisis had many causes, but among the most important \nwas the fact that some of our nation's largest financial institutions \nwere dangerously undercapitalized, while at the same time, they held \ninterconnected assets and liabilities that could not be disentangled in \nthe midst of a crisis.\n  The failure of these over-leveraged financial institutions threatened \nto bring the American economy to its knees. As a consequence, the \nfederal government was forced to step in to prop-up financial \ninstitutions that were considered ``too big to fail.'' Little has \nangered the American public more than these taxpayer-funded bailouts.\n  That is the context in which I offered my capital standards \namendment, which became section 171 of Dodd-Frank. Section 171 is aimed \nat addressing the ``too big to fail'' problem at the root of the 2008-\n2009 crisis by requiring large financial holding companies to maintain \na level of capital at least as high as that required for our nation's \ncommunity banks, equalizing their minimum capital requirements, and \neliminating the incentive for banks to become ``too big to fail.''\n  Incredibly, prior to the passage of Section 171, the capital and risk \nstandards for our Nation's largest financial institutions were more lax \nthan those that applied to smaller depository banks, even though the \nfailure of larger institutions was much more likely to trigger the kind \nof cascade of economic harm that we experienced during the crisis. \nSection 171 gave the regulators the tools, and the direction, to fix \nthis problem.\n  It is important to recognize that Section 171 allows the federal \nregulators to take into account the significant distinctions between \nbanking and insurance, and the implications of those distinctions for \ncapital adequacy. I have written to the financial regulators on more \nthan one occasion to underscore this point. For example, in a November \n26, 2012, letter I stressed that it was not Congress's intent to \nreplace State-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital \nregime. For that reason, I called upon the federal regulators to \nacknowledge the distinctions between banking and insurance, and to take \nthose distinctions into account in the final rules implementing Section \n171.\n  While the Federal Reserve has acknowledged the important distinctions \nbetween insurance and banking, it has repeatedly suggested that it \nlacks authority to take those distinctions into account when \nimplementing the consolidated capital standards required by Section \n171. As I have already said, I do not agree that the Fed lacks this \nauthority and find its disregard of my clear intent as the author of \nsection 171 to be frustrating, to say the least. Experts testifying \nbefore the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection subcommittee \nof the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Senator Brown, concur that \nthe Federal Reserve has ample authority to draw these distinctions.\n  Nevertheless, the bill we are introducing today clarifies the Federal \nReserve's authority to recognize the distinctions between insurance and \nbanking.\n  Specifically, our legislation would add language to section 171 to \nclarify that, in establishing minimum capital requirements for holding \ncompanies on a consolidated basis, the Federal Reserve is not required \nto include insurance activities so long as those activities are \nregulated as insurance at the State level. Our legislation also \nprovides a mechanism for the Federal Reserve, acting in consultation \nwith the appropriate State insurance authority, to provide similar \ntreatment for foreign insurance entities within a U.S. holding company \nwhere that entity does not itself do business in the United States. In \naddition, our legislation directs the Fed not to require insurers which \nfile holding company financial statements using Statutory Accounting \nPrinciples to instead prepare their financial statements using \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n  I should point out that our legislation does not, in any way, modify \nor supersede any other provision of law upon which the Federal Reserve \nmay rely to set appropriate holding company capital requirements.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Brown and \nJohanns, for working so hard with me over many months to help craft the \nlanguage we are introducing today. I believe our language removes any \ndoubt about the Federal Reserve's authority to address the legitimate \nconcerns raised by insurers that they not have a bank-centric capital \nregime for their insurance activities imposed upon them. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To achieve \n     this, Section 171 requires that large bank holding companies \n     be subject, at a minimum, to the same capital requirements \n     that small community banks have traditionally faced.\n       During consideration of the Dodd-Frank Act, I supported \n     modifications to the final language to Section 171 to ensure \n     a smooth transition to increased capital standards. Among \n     these modifications were provisions to delay, for five years, \n     the application of new capital requirements for savings and \n     loan holding companies (``SLHCs''), and for certain foreign-\n     owned bank holding companies. See subsections (b)(4)(D) and \n     (E) of Section 171. These modifications were intended to \n     allow these entities the time they need to adjust their \n     balance sheets and capital levels in order to come into \n     compliance with the new capital standards. The proposed rules \n     implement the five year delay provided to foreign-owned bank \n     holding companies by Section 171 (b)(4)(E), but neglect to \n     implement the nearly identical delay for SLHCs provided by \n     Section 171 (b)(4)(E). I do not understand why the proposed \n     rules fail to implement this provision, as required by \n     Congressional intent and the clear language of the statute.\n       I am hopeful, too, that in crafting final rules, you will \n     give further consideration to the distinctions between \n     banking and insurance, and the implications of those \n     distinctions for capital adequacy. It is, of course, \n     essential that insurers with depository institution holding \n     companies in their corporate structure be adequately \n     capitalized on a consolidated basis. Even so, it was not \n     Congress's intent that federal regulators supplant prudential \n     state-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital \n     regime. Instead, consideration should be given to the \n     distinctions between banks and insurance companies, a point \n     which Chairman Bernanke rightly acknowledged in testimony \n     before the House Banking Committee this summer. For example, \n     banks and insurers typically have a different composition of \n     assets and liabilities, since it is fundamental to insurance \n     companies to match assets to liabilities, but this is not \n     characteristic of most banks. I believe it is consistent with \n     my amendment that these distinctions be recognized in the \n     final rules.\n       I am hopeful you will keep these concerns in mind as you \n     continue to implement the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposed \n     rules referenced above implementing the Basel III regulatory \n     capital framework.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Susan M. Collins,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2473-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 425--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n                     ``NATIONAL DONATE LIFE MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CASEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 425\n\n       Whereas in March 2014, over 118,800 individuals were on the \n     official waiting list for organ donation managed by the Organ \n     Procurement and Transplantation Network;\n       Whereas in 2013, 31,422 organs from 14,257 donors \n     (including both living and deceased donors) were transplanted \n     into 28,952 patients, yet 6,123 candidates for \n     transplantation died while waiting for an organ transplant;\n       Whereas on average, 18 people die every day of every year \n     while waiting for an organ donation;\n       Whereas over 100,000,000 people in the United States are \n     registered to be organ and tissue donors, yet the demand for \n     donated organs still outweighs the supply of organs made \n     available each day;\n       Whereas many people do not know about their options for \n     organ and tissue donation, or have not made their wishes \n     clear to their families;\n       Whereas organ and tissue donation can give meaning to the \n     tragic loss of a loved one by enabling up to 8 people to \n     receive the gift of life from a single deceased donor;\n       Whereas living donors can donate a kidney or a portion of a \n     lung or liver to save the life of another individual; and\n       Whereas April is traditionally recognized as ``National \n     Donate Life Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Donate Life \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports promoting awareness of organ donation;\n       (3) encourages States, localities, and the territories and \n     possessions of the United States to support the goals and \n     ideals of National Donate Life Month by issuing proclamations \n     designating April 2014 as National Donate Life Month;\n       (4) commends the generous gift of life provided by \n     individuals who indicate their wish to become organ donors;\n       (5) acknowledges the grief of families facing the loss of a \n     loved one and commends those families who, in their grief, \n     choose to donate the organs of their deceased family member;\n       (6) recognizes the generous contribution made by each \n     living individual who has donated an organ to save a life;\n       (7) acknowledges the advances in medical technology that \n     have enabled organ transplantation with organs donated by \n     living individuals to become a viable treatment option for an \n     increasing number of patients;\n       (8) commends the medical professionals and organ \n     transplantation experts who have worked to improve the \n     process of living organ donation and increase the number of \n     living donors; and\n       (9) salutes all individuals who have helped to give the \n     gift of life by supporting, promoting, and encouraging organ \n     donation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2473-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2473-S2474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 426--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD MALARIA \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Kirk) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 426\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being preventable and \n     treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national security \n     interest of the United States, as reducing the risk of \n     malaria protects members of the United States Armed Forces \n     serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and reducing \n     malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability in less \n     developed countries;\n       Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the \n     diplomatic and moral interests of the United States, as that \n     support generates goodwill toward the United States and \n     highlights the values of the people of the United States \n     through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith-\n     based organizations of the United States;\n       Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term \n     economic interest of the United States because those efforts \n     help developing countries identify at-risk populations, \n     provide better health services, produce healthier and more \n     productive workforces, advance economic development, and \n     promote stronger trading partners;\n       Whereas 90 percent of all malaria deaths in the world are \n     in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, as children \n     under the age of 5 accounted for an estimated 77 percent of \n     malaria deaths in 2012;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal \n     health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and \n     low\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     birth weights, with estimates that malaria causes \n     approximately 10,000 cases maternal deaths and over 200,000 \n     infant deaths annually in Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have \n     made significant progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2013 by the World Health \n     Organization states that in 2012, approximately 54 percent of \n     households in sub-Saharan Africa owned at least one \n     insecticide-treated mosquito net, and household surveys \n     indicated that 86 percent of people used an insecticide-\n     treated mosquito net if one was available in the household;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2013 further states that \n     between 2000 and 2012, malaria mortality rates decreased by \n     45 percent around the world and by 45 percent in the African \n     Region of the World Health Organization, and an estimated \n     3,300,000 lives were spared from malaria globally, 90 percent \n     of which were children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2013 further states that \n     out of 97 countries with ongoing transmission of malaria in \n     2013, 12 countries are classified as being in the pre-\n     elimination phase of malaria control, 7 countries are \n     classified as being in the elimination phase, and 7 countries \n     are classified as being in the prevention of introduction \n     phase;\n       Whereas, according to the World Malaria Report 2013, there \n     were 207,000,000 cases of malaria globally in 2012, resulting \n     in an estimated 627,000 deaths;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and \n     advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to \n     continue to reduce malaria deaths, prevent backsliding in \n     areas where progress has been made, and equip the United \n     States and the global community with the tools necessary to \n     eliminate malaria and other global health threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the contribution of the United \n     States to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria;\n       Whereas, in May 2011, an independent, external evaluation, \n     prepared through the Global Health Technical Assistance \n     Project, examining 6 objectives of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative, found the President's Malaria Initiative to be a \n     successful, well-led component of the Global Health \n     Initiative that has ``earned and deserves the task of \n     sustaining and expanding the United States Government's \n     response to global malaria control efforts'';\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the \n     President's Malaria Initiative, which is led by the United \n     States Agency for International Development and implemented \n     with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the Department of State, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the \n     Department of Defense, and private sector entities;\n       Whereas, in 2014, the President's Malaria Initiative Report \n     found that, in 2013, the PMI alone had protected more than \n     21,000,000 residents by spraying over 5,000,000 houses with \n     insecticides, procured more than 40,000,000 long-lasting \n     ITNs, procured more than 10,000,000 sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine \n     treatments for intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) in \n     pregnant women, trained more than 16,000 health workers in \n     IPTp, procured more than 48,000,000 treatments of \n     artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and over \n     51,000,000 malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and trained \n     more than 61,000 health workers in treatment of malaria with \n     ACTs and more than 26,000 health workers in laboratory \n     diagnosis of malaria;\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative focuses on \n     helping partner countries achieve major improvements in \n     overall health outcomes through improved access to, and \n     quality of, healthcare services in locations with limited \n     resources; and\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative, recognizing the \n     burden of malaria on many partner countries, has set a target \n     of reducing the burden of malaria by 50 percent for \n     450,000,000 people, representing 70 percent of the at-risk \n     population in Africa, by 2015: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the target of ending malaria deaths by 2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, \n     particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       (4) supports ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to \n     combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     memorandum directing the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to issue regulations relating to power \n     sector carbon pollution standards for existing coal fired \n     power plants;\n       (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents Congress \n     and the will of the people of the United States;\n       (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from existing coal fired power plants in the United States by \n     mandating a national energy tax would devastate major sectors \n     of the economy, cost thousands of jobs, and increase energy \n     costs for low-income households, small businesses, and \n     seniors on fixed income;\n       (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of hospital \n     visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;\n       (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate by \n     Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University, ``The \n     unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor for \n     elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s. In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                            PART II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 131.

I rise in this Chamber to address an issue that is \ncritical to working families across our Nation; that is, the Federal \nminimum wage.\n  First, I thank Senator Tom Harkin for his leadership on this issue. \nHe has advocated year after year, decade after decade that we need to \nensure that we have an economy where workers fully participate in the \nfruits of their labor.\n  We should not have a society in which all of those fruits go simply \nto the very few at the expense of a fair wage for those who create that \nsuccess. I thank Senator Harkin for leading this fight over this \nextended period of time on behalf of working families.\n  He believes, as I believe, that we should measure the success of our \nNation not by the growth of the GDP, not by having one eye on the Dow \nJones and one eye on the S 500, we should measure the success by the \nsuccess of our families. That is what this debate on the minimum wage \nis all about.\n  This issue matters a great deal to me because I come from a blue-\ncollar family. My father was a mechanic. He employed those skills in a \nsawmill. He was the millwright, the person who keeps the machinery \ngoing so the plant can keep operating. When it is operating, there is \nwork for the workers, and there is certainly success for the company. \nHe went on to work as a mechanic in many other ways.\n  On that mechanic's wage, he was able to raise a family and \nparticipate fully in the American dream. He and my mother were able to \nbuy a home. They could afford to take us camping. They could afford to \nsave a little bit to help us be able to go to college. That is what \nhappens when workers get to participate in the success of our economy.\n  A minimum wage is part of this story because it is the foundation and \nthe benchmark that helps set wages throughout the economy.\n  In the time period after World War II, our economy grew quickly, our \nwages\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\ngrew quickly, and workers took those wages and they bought products, \nand that demand fueled further production, which put more people to \nwork. It was an upward cycle.\n  But more recently we have had a philosophy imposed, advocated, and \nput forward by the top 1 percent that if all the growth in revenue \ncomes to them, they will be the job makers. They will be the job \ncreators and everyone else will thrive.\n  If there was ever a moment in U.S. history when the complete \nfalseness of this philosophy was evident, it is right now, because from \n2008 until now, 95 percent of the newly created wages have gone to the \n1 percent, to the very top. So we should have more jobs than we know \nwhat to do with on the philosophy that has been advocated so recently \non the floor of this Senate, that we should minimize the wages at the \nbottom to maximize the profits at the top.\n  That is a downward spiral for a very clear reason, and it is this: \nPeople don't make things in society if the middle class doesn't have \nthe money in their pockets to buy them. If they don't have the money, \nthey don't go to the restaurant, the restaurant doesn't hire the \nwaiter, and the restaurant doesn't hire the dishwasher. It doesn't open \na new outlet and employ more people.\n  There are certainly many factors that have contributed to shrinking \npaychecks for working Americans, but the declining purchasing power of \nthe Federal minimum wage is a major factor.\n  The Federal minimum wage sets an important standard for how the \ncontributions of working families are valued. The minimum wage sets a \nfloor on wages. It is a benchmark not only for minimum wage workers but \nfor our entire wage scale. When the minimum wage goes up, the value \nplaced on working Americans all across the economy goes up.\n  In 1968, when I was 12 years old, the Federal minimum wage was \nequivalent in today's dollars to about $10.50, unlike the wage we have \nnow which is $7.25. So the purchasing power has roughly dropped by one-\nthird, and that is not to the benefit of the workers, that is not to \nthe benefit of all of the small businesses that provide retail services \nthat benefit when a worker can afford to buy those services.\n  Putting money into the pockets of minimum wage workers lifts millions \nof working families directly. It lifts millions more because of the \nindirect effect of providing more demand for products in the economy.\n  Today a worker who works 40 hours per week at the Federal minimum \nwage makes barely $15,000 per year. That puts a family of two below the \npoverty line. That is poverty despite the fact the mother is working \nfull time 52 weeks a year. A family of three puts them further below \nthe poverty line because of the additional expenses of taking care of a \nsecond child. That is wrong.\n  The more we look at the numbers, the more it becomes clear that the \ncurrent minimum wage is insufficient to provide a foundation for a \nfamily. We need to raise the minimum wage because there is no way to \nsupport a family on $7.25 per hour, less than $15,000 per year.\n  A recent study estimated that a worker paid the Federal minimum wage \nin States as diverse as Minnesota, Texas, and Pennsylvania would have \nto work more than 90 hours per week to afford rent on a market-rate \ntwo-bedroom apartment--90 hours per week, more than two full-time jobs, \n13 hours of work per day, Monday through Sunday. Imagine working from 9 \na.m. to 10 p.m. on your feet, getting up, doing it day after day, week \nafter week, and still you can't afford rent on a two-bedroom \napartment--no breaks, no vacations, no sick days, no benefits, and you \ncan't afford rent on a two-bedroom apartment.\n  Without a minimum wage that comes closer to families' real costs of \nliving, our economy will continue to leave behind too many hard-working \nAmericans. The legislation we are debating this week would raise the \nFederal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and index it to inflation to \nsustain the purchasing power. That doesn't get us back to the \npurchasing power of 1968, but at least it comes a lot closer.\n\n  Let us understand what we are talking about. We are not talking about \nan entry wage for teenagers. The vast majority of folks who earn the \nminimum wage are adults--far more than 80 percent. More than four out \nof five are adults, more than half of whom are women. The earnings of \nthese families contribute to the support of nearly one in four American \nchildren.\n  Contrary to the arguments made for the superwealthy and couched in \nsympathy for the poor we heard a few minutes ago on this floor, this \nminimum wage would lift 4.6 million Americans out of poverty. It would \ngive America's low-wage workers paychecks that better reflect their \ncontribution, their work, and their value in our economy.\n  Some in this Chamber, as we heard not so many minutes ago, would try \nto convince us that this is bad for business. Nothing could be farther \nfrom the truth. For proof, just look to the Northwest. In Oregon, we \nknow this model works because Oregon has road-tested the model. We \ndon't need to have theoretical debates about it; we have a real-life \nexample in the State of Oregon. Our minimum wage has been indexed since \n2002. It sits at $9.10 per hour. Indexing enables businesses to plan \nfor small and steady increases rather than to speculate about potential \ndramatic leaps.\n  Oregon's restaurant industry, one of the largest employers of workers \nat Oregon's higher minimum wage, is projected to grow faster than the \nnational average--faster. In fact, a higher minimum wage may well \ncreate jobs. The reason is simple: When workers have more in wages in \ntheir pockets, they spend more in our retail stores, which then hire \nmore workers to meet the demand. When the retail stores sell more to \nthe workers who have more money in their pocket, they order more from \nthe factory and the factory employs more workers. A study by the \nEconomic Policy Institute found the higher minimum wage we are debating \nwould create 85,000 jobs.\n  Strengthening our Federal minimum wage is, at its core, about basic \nrespect and basic fairness. It is about recognizing there is dignity in \nwork and that when we allow working families to fall farther and \nfarther down the wage chain we all pay the price. Consider the many \naspects that take away from our society. A mother who has to pursue \nfour minimum wage jobs to try to fill in when the earnings from one or \nmore jobs are too low to support a family means she is not at home \nhelping to guide her child. That is not helping to build a strong and \nproductive future for that child or for our society in general.\n  It doesn't matter whether you are a CEO or a janitor, if you work \nfull time in America, you should not be living in poverty. If we pay \nthe janitor a little more, it helps a lot more people than just that \none worker. Those wages go straight back into the broader economy that \nthe CEO and his or her company depend upon.\n  So let's do what is right for our workers. Let's do what is right for \nour economy. Let's pass this bill and restore the power of the minimum \nwage for America's working families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Minimum Wage \nFairness Act because it is time to give everyone a fair shot. More and \nmore States are voting to raise the minimum wage. Last week, the Hawaii \nState legislature passed a bill to raise the minimum wage in my home \nState. Hawaii's bill would increase the wage from $7.25 to $10.10, and \nincrease the tip wage to at least $9.35.\n  Hawaii will become the tenth State enacting a wage increase since \nPresident Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address. In 2014 alone, \nConnecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, West Virginia, and \nWashington, DC have enacted wage increases. Hawaii will become the 26th \nState with the higher minimum wage than the current Federal minimum \nwage. It is time for Congress to join with the States that are leading \nthe charge to give hard-working families a raise.\n  I am going to share a few reasons why the Senate should vote to raise \nthe minimum wage. First, today's Federal minimum wage is a poverty \nwage. If the minimum wage had kept up with inflation since 1968, the \nminimum wage today would be about $10.68. This\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\nmeans that minimum-wage workers today earn less than $15,000 per year \nworking full time. If someone is supporting a child or an elderly \nparent, that would put their family income below the Federal poverty \nline.\n  The bill we are considering today would raise the Federal minimum \nwage from $7.25 to $10.10 by 2016 and index it to inflation afterward. \nIncreasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would help lift nearly a million \nworkers and their families out of poverty.\n  In Hawaii, raising the minimum wage will bring more than 12,000 \npeople above the Federal poverty level.\n  Second, the minimum wage is a woman's issue. Growing up, my mother \nwas a single parent. We were an immigrant family. She raised three \nchildren by herself on very low wages. I know what it is like to run \nout of money at the end of the month and what it is like for every dime \nto matter. Nationwide, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers are \nwomen. In Hawaii, increasing the minimum wage will give 54,000 women a \nraise. One out of five Hawaii women workers will get that raise. That \nis important to the women in my State, where the cost of living is \nhigh.\n  During the legislative debate on this issue in Hawaii, numerous \nadvocacy groups came forward to provide testimony on why the minimum \nwage should be increased in Hawaii. These included representatives from \nchurches, unions, individual parents, students, and others. For \nexample, Dr. Lori Kamemoto is an ob-gyn who came forward to testify. \nShe told of her work in health clinics where many of her patients are \nminimum-wage workers. She testified:\n\n       The majority of patients I saw at the free clinic worked \n     multiple minimum wage jobs, and each job made sure that they \n     did not give my patient enough work hours to qualify for \n     health insurance or benefits. Oftentimes, a patient would not \n     be able to afford the medication needed for her health \n     condition. She had a choice to either pay for her children's \n     food or the recommended medication.\n\n  Another testifier, Laura Finlayson, is a student at Hawaii Pacific \nUniversity. She testified:\n\n       As someone who has worked several minimum wage jobs, I have \n     experienced firsthand how the low wages perpetuate the cycle \n     of poverty. . . . Many must also rely on government aid in \n     order to make ends meet.\n\n  These stories and countless others show why we must raise the minimum \nwage.\n  Many workers in Hawaii are tipped workers. The tipped minimum wage is \nespecially far behind. I have met restaurant workers who can't afford \nto eat in the very restaurants in which they work. Take the example of \nNyah Potts, whom I met recently. She is a tipped worker. She works in a \nrestaurant in the Reagan Building in Washington, DC. Due to her low \nwages, she has had to choose between buying diapers for her child or \neating lunch that day. She decided to do something about her situation. \nJoining with her fellow workers and advocacy groups, she pushed the \nadministration to raise the minimum wage for Federal contract workers. \nNyah and her coworkers will now get a raise. It is time to give \neveryone in America a raise.\n\n  There is a common myth that tipped workers are teenagers just \nstarting out. That is false. Eighty-eight percent of workers in tipped \noccupations are age 20 and over, and 45 percent are 30 or older.\n  Back in 2007, the last time Congress raised the minimum wage, the \nrestaurant industry with its many tipped workers said it would cost \ntheir industry jobs. This did not happen. In fact, in 2013 the \nrestaurant industry forecast said ``restaurants remain among the \nleaders in job creation.'' The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that \nbetween 2007 and 2013, restaurants added 724,000 jobs.\n  There is a misconception that all tipped workers are servers at fancy \nrestaurants. This is also not true. Many people who work at the \nairport, who help you get your bags, who help you make it to your gate \non time, are also tipped workers. Tipped workers include bar-backs, \nbellhops, parking attendants, car washers, airport wheelchair workers, \nand many people don't even realize that these workers need tips to \nsurvive.\n  On average, hourly wages for tipped workers are almost 40 percent \nlower than overall hourly wages. The fact is, raising the minimum wage \nis not just good for workers, it is also good for the economy. That is \nwhy a survey of small business owners found that three out of five \nsmall business owners supported raising the minimum wage. They \nunderstand a higher minimum wage would increase consumer spending on \ntheir goods and services. That is because minimum-wage workers spend \nnew money from higher wages right away at local businesses in their \ncommunities.\n  In addition to the restaurant industry I referred to earlier, there \nare other persistent critics who claim raising the minimum wage will \ncost jobs. Some cite a Congressional Budget Office report that only \nlooked at old studies and not the latest research. The fact is, the \nlatest academic studies say a higher minimum wage increases consumer \nspending and does not cost jobs.\n  A March Goldman Sachs report said that States which raised their \nminimum wage in 2014 actually created more jobs than other States that \ndidn't raise the minimum wage. Six hundred economists, including 7 \nNobel prize winners, have endorsed a minimum wage of $10.10.\n  Raising the minimum wage also saves taxpayers money on social \nservices, as many of my colleagues have already noted. The current \nminimum wage leaves many below the poverty line and eligible for \nassistance such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, \nor food stamps. If we raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10, we \nreduce taxpayer costs for SNAP benefits by $4.6 billion a year. In \nHawaii, over 15,000 workers would no longer need SNAP benefits. This \nwould save nearly $40 million in Hawaii alone.\n  In America, we believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, \nyou can get ahead. It is time for Congress to follow the example of \nHawaii and other States that have raised their minimum wages. They are \ndoing the right thing. It is time for Congress to do what is right. \nLet's give America a raise so all Americans can have a fair shot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/29/senate-section/article/S2526-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
