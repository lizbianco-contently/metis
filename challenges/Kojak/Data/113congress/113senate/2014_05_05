Mr. President, just moments ago we passed a resolution \nappointing Drew Willison as the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. The \nimportance of this appointment cannot be overstated. While Senators and \ntheir staffs come and go, the office of the Sergeant at Arms provides \nmuch needed stability to support this great institution.\n  To put things in perspective, Drew Willison is only the 39th Sergeant \nat Arms in the entire history of the Senate. That is 230 plus years. By \ncontrast, there have been 1,950 Senators who have served in this body \nsince its inception.\n  As the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Drew's duties include the security \nand safety of the 6,500 Senate employees, as well as the millions of \nvisitors who come to the Capitol each year. Drew's predecessor, Terry \nGainer, did a phenomenal job as Sergeant at Arms, and Drew is left with \nhis big shoes to fill. Terry Gainer was not a partisan, nor is Drew \nWillison. That is how this office should function. I know he is up to \nthe task.\n  As Booker T. Washington said, ``Nothing ever comes to one, that is \nworth having, except as a result of hard work.''\n  Even though Drew did not seek this position, it has come to him \nbecause of his hard work. He will thrive in the Sergeant at Arms office \nbecause of his work ethic. I know because I have witnessed his work \nover the years. He first came to my office a long time ago, in 1997. He \nwas a fellow for the Environmental Protection Agency. His talents were \nseen very quickly by me and my staff. So then, rather than going back \nto the EPA, he became a member of my personal staff. Again, his talents \nwere recognized immediately. I decided it would be important that he \nmove to the Appropriations Committee. He became the chief clerk on our \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development and did a remarkably good \njob.\n  I mention his nonpartisan approach to what he did. During those years \nof his working for me--I can't speak for when he was there after I \nbecame inactive on that Appropriations Committee--but while I was there \nthose many years--I was either the chairman or the ranking member of \nthat committee for years. The person opposite me was Pete Domenici from \nNew Mexico. It didn't matter who the chairman was, quite frankly. We \nworked so well together in those days when we worked together. We would \nfinish the energy and water bill on the floor in one day. We would \nbring it out of committee and finish it in one day. We worked together. \nDrew Willison was the chief clerk, and when he wasn't the chief clerk, \nhe was the second in command--whatever that is. We just breezed through \nthat subcommittee--billions and billions of dollars, the safety and \nsecurity of the nuclear arsenal we have, and so many different issues \nin that subcommittee that were important to the country, as they are \ntoday. But now we can't even--we have such difficulty at getting a bill \npassed. We did it then in one day--in just a few hours many times.\n  So Drew is really a talented man. He is a very quick learner. \nEveryone who has worked with him over the years came to the realization \nvery quickly: Tell him what you want him to do; he did it with a smile, \nhe did it well, and he did it right.\n  During my tenure with this good man, now the Sergeant at Arms, his \ntalents were invaluable to the success of my office. For 5 years he has \nbeen the Deputy Sergeant at Arms. He has been Chief Gainer's right-hand \nman, and that is an understatement. He has done such a remarkably good \njob because of his hard work and his diligence. In the process, he has \nhelped make this Capitol a better and safer place to work and to visit.\n  Now, as the mantel of leading the Sergeant at Arms office falls to \nhim, I have no doubt that he will, once again, prove himself.\n  The Senate and the many people who visit and work in the Capitol are \nin good hands with Drew Willison at the helm. I wish him the very best. \nAll I say to Drew Willison is to continue to be the person he has been \nand he will be a success as the Sergeant at Arms.\n\n\n                    National Travel and Tourism Week\n\n  Mr. President, this week is National Travel and Tourism Week. As a \nSenator from Nevada, I know how important the travel and tourism \nindustry is to this Nation. Las Vegas alone attracts more than 40 \nmillion visitors each year, and 8 million come from across the globe. \nAll told, travel and tourism generates $45 billion in revenue for the \nLas Vegas economy while employing 400,000 Nevadans.\n  This industry's impact is not unique in Nevada. People go to the \nPresiding Officer's State of Maine year-round. It slows down a little \nin the wintertime, but people go there year-round because of the beauty \nof the State of Maine. I have only been to Maine on one occasion, but I \nwent as a tourist. I wanted to see that beautiful State, and I was able \nto do that. It is the same in virtually every State in America. Tourism \nis the No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3 driving economic influence of every State.\n  So recognizing Travel and Tourism Week is more than just simple talk; \nit is important to do that. Annually, travel and tourism contribute \nmore than $2 trillion to the national economy. It supplies 15 million \njobs to Americans, and these are jobs that don't ship overseas. In \nfact, tourism is the Nation's No. 1 export.\n  While it is important to recognize National Travel and Tourism Week, \njust mentioning the industry's strength is not enough. As with any \nprofitable business, investment helps. It will do the same in tourism, \nand we have proven that over the last few years.\n  A small investment in travel and business does great things for \nAmerica. As I recall, there were about five filibusters we had to \novercome on this legislation, but we did overcome them, and we finally \npassed it in 2010. President Obama signed this into law. It is called \nthe Travel Promotion Act.\n  After we passed the law, this entity was led by a man named Stephen \nCloobeck. Stephen Cloobeck is a businessman, and he has been a \nsuccessful businessman. He is now extremely successful in the time-\nsharing business and in other areas. But he was really a good leader of \nthat entity when it was first created, and that wasn't easy. There were \na lot of bumps in the road. But being the exceptionally good \nbusinessman that he was and is, it worked out well. His leadership was \nphenomenal.\n  In countries all over the world, Brand USA--that is what it is \ncalled, Brand USA--advertisements come at no cost to the American \ntaxpayers, and these entice foreign travelers to visit America.\n  By any measure, the Travel Promotion Act has been an incredible \nsuccess. But don't take my word for it. An independent analysis found \nthat Brand USA helped to generate more than 1 million new visitors to \nthe United States, and it is only going to get better. Those \ninternational visitors spent $3.4 billion last year. Increasing \ninternational tourism and visitation to the United States creates jobs. \nOn average, our international visitors stay longer in our Nation's \nhotels and they spend more money in our stores and restaurants than \ndomestic travelers. One out of every four visitors who come to Las \nVegas comes from outside the United States. Nearly 20 percent of all \nvisitors, which is obvious from those numbers I just gave, come to Las \nVegas from abroad.\n  So it is clear that Brand USA is helping our Nation's tourism \nindustry, and it is helping our Nation capitalize on this growing \nmarket of tourism. That is why the Senate passed an immigration bill \nthat is currently stuck in the House of Representatives. This \nlegislation includes a permanent reauthorization for the Travel \nPromotion Act and Brand USA.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has so far refused to \ntake up an immigration reform bill. We did our work, and it was led by \nfour Democrats and four Republicans. The four Democrats: Senators \nSchumer, Durbin, Menendez, and Bennet; the four Republicans: Senators \nRubio, Flake, McCain, and Graham. They did good work. It could not have \nbeen done without them.\n  Our Nation's travel industry, though, needs us to do more. \nRecognizing the importance of tourism, it is so important we proceed \nand help the tourism industry by passing the immigration reform bill.\n  I mentioned the good work done by these eight Senators. The current\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\npresident of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and former \nchairman of the U.S. Association--his name is Rossi Ralenkotter--has \nstressed the need for investment in our Nation's infrastructure.\n  As we invest in airports, rail, and roads--we certainly do not do \nenough, but when we do, we are effectively opening this Nation's doors \nto our visitors. By providing safe, efficient travel for tourists, we \ncan also ensure that the American travel industry has a reliable flow \nof business.\n  Our commitment to bolstering tourism must amount to more than just \nconcrete and metal. We must ensure that not only do we invite people \nhere--and they come from across the world--but that we are also \nfacilitating their arrival and their departure.\n  In the Senate immigration bill we make it easier for tourists to come \nto America by increasing the number of Customs and Border Patrol agents \nwho process international visitors. We hope as tourists from foreign \nnations become more comfortable with traveling to the United States \nthey will do so more frequently.\n  We are fast approaching the anniversary of the immigration bill's \npassage in the Senate. Yet this bipartisan bill sits idling in the \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives, and the Republicans \nseem to be content to continue to ``idle,'' a code word for doing \nnothing.\n  There are many urgent reasons we must pass the immigration bill and \ntravel promotion is one of them. We cannot be content to do nothing in \npromoting the United States to the world because ultimately travel \npromotion is job promotion. It is about creating jobs. It is about \ngrowing our economy. It is about keeping the United States competitive \nin the world travel business.\n  So this week as we consider the incredible impact of travel and \ntourism on our Nation's economy, I invite my colleagues in Congress to \ncontinue to invest in this vital industry. If we are successful, we \nwill make sure America remains the ultimate tourist destination for \ndecades to come.\n  I see on the floor the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota. \nHer work on getting this Travel Promotion Act passed was superb. Her \nefforts continue to make sure it is working well in the immigration \nbill. No one has helped more than the senior Senator from Minnesota. \nShe is a good legislator, and she has proven that to me many times. Her \nwork on this legislation reminds me how tenacious she is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to thank the leader for \nhis superb leadership on tourism. Anyone who represents the State of \nNevada understands how important tourism is to our States and to our \ncountry. The leader knows it is not just about Las Vegas, it is also \nabout places such as the Mall of America in Minnesota or all of those \ngreat bed and breakfast and fishing operations in the States of Maine \nor Arkansas or Missouri.\n  Senator Blunt is the lead Republican head of this bill, along with \nmyself, and we now have 26 authors on the reauthorization of the Travel \nPromotion Act, Brand USA; in addition, of course, to the immigration \nbill, which would allow us to not just reauthorize the Travel Promotion \nAct but also the JOLT Act, which creates all kinds of new ways to add \nmore jobs to America by speeding up the visa process, by creating some \nmore visa waiver countries and other things.\n  We will be talking more about that later.\n\n\n                     Nigerian Schoolgirls Abduction\n\n  Today I am here on a very important matter. I rise to discuss the \noutrageous abduction of 276 schoolgirls by the terrorist group Boko \nHaram in northeastern Nigeria. Now we have reports that these \nschoolgirls, some as young as 15 years old, are being sold into forced \nmarriages with militants.\n  I know this sounds like something that might be in some kind of a \nlate-night movie or in a strange book, but in fact this happened. This \nhappened this last month, that these 276 schoolgirls were abducted from \ntheir school by a terrorist group in Nigeria.\n  With Boko Haram's leader now appearing on video vowing to ``sell them \nin the market,'' let's call this what it is: one of the most brazen and \nshocking single incidents of human trafficking we have seen in recent \nmemory. As Secretary of State John Kerry said this weekend, it is ``not \njust an act of terrorism. It's a massive human trafficking moment and \n[it is] grotesque.''\n  This heinous crime demands that we take action immediately to help \nbring these girls home to their families and bring their kidnappers to \njustice. This is a test of our own country's commitment to fight human \ntrafficking and modern-day slavery, and we must step up and help \nNigeria with this challenge.\n  On the night of April 14, a gang of heavily armed militants attacked \nthe dormitory of the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, a \ntown in Nigeria's Borno state. They shot the guards, loaded 276 girls \ninto trucks, and drove them away into the forest.\n  That was 3 weeks ago today, and since then there has been \ndisturbingly little action to find these girls and to get their \ncaptors. Local police say around 53 of the girls have escaped, but that \nstill leaves at least 223 held hostage in the hands of Boko Haram. That \nis almost as many people as were aboard Malaysian Airlines Flight 370. \nThat was 239 passengers and crew, which we all know about and is a \nhorrible tragedy and the subject of intense media coverage and a \nmassive international search, costing tens of millions of dollars. But \nI have a feeling many people who are watching this right now or who are \nin this Chamber probably have not even heard about these girls in \nNigeria.\n  In Nigeria no one seems to know where these girls are, and until this \npast weekend no one seemed inclined to do much about it. The most \ndetermined pursuit of the kidnappers had come not from the Nigerian \nmilitary but from the families of the abducted girls. Some of the \nfamily members, armed only with bows and arrows to fight terrorists \narmed with assault rifles, rode into the forest on motorcycles to try \nto find their girls. That is the best the world could do so far and \nthat is shameful.\n  Now the situation is more desperate than ever. The girls are \nreportedly being married off or even sold for as little as $12 to be \nwives to Boko Haram militants. Just this morning a video surfaced \nfeaturing a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader, taunting Nigeria \nand the world with this shameful statement claiming responsibility for \nthe attack. He said this:\n\n       I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by \n     Allah. There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I \n     should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I \n     sell women.\n\n  That Boko Haram would target these girls is actually not a surprise. \nThe group's very name means ``Western education is sinful,'' and it \nsystematically targets schools and kidnaps and kills children, \nespecially girls, who are guilty of nothing more than seeking a better \nlife for themselves through schooling.\n  The Nigerian Government estimates the group has destroyed over 200 \nschools. In February, 59 students were shot and hacked to death at the \nFederal Government College in the nearby town of Buni Yadi. The \ngovernment had actually closed the schools in the region in the face of \nthese ruthless attacks.\n  But these girls wanted to go to school. They wanted to get an \neducation. Their school, which had been closed for 1 month, was \nreopened so they could just take their final exams--something my \ndaughter is doing right now at college, something high school kids the \nage of these girls are doing all over the United States right now. They \nwere just trying to take their exams.\n  These are girls who should be the next generation of leaders in their \ncommunity and their nation--not sold off to a band of thugs.\n  Fortunately, after this weekend the world is finally paying \nattention, and I hope this Chamber pays attention. With the families \nreaching out through social media, using the Twitter hashtag \n#BringBackOurGirls, protests have spread across the world, calling for \nthe Nigerian Government to take stronger action and for the \ninternational community to help.\n  The United States should help lead that international effort. I was \nencouraged that Secretary Kerry said this weekend that ``we will do \neverything\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\npossible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women \nto their homes and hold the perpetrators to justice.'' But we need \nactions to back up those words, and I would like to suggest three \nactions we should take to help marshal a global response to this \nheinous crime.\n  First, the United States should seek a resolution from the U.N. \nSecurity Council condemning this attack and calling for member \ncountries to extend all appropriate assistance to Nigeria and \nneighboring countries to help locate the victims of Boko Haram's \nabductions and bring them home.\n  Second, we should move as quickly as we can to provide intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance assets to contribute to the search for \nthe missing girls. The countries of the region have limited resources, \nand American support with aerial and satellite surveillance, similar to \nwhat we have provided to the hunt for Joseph Kony and his so-called \nLord's Resistance Army in Central Africa, could make a significant \ndifference in their ability to liberate Boko Haram's hostages.\n  Finally, we should work to strengthen the capabilities of local \nauthorities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and other countries in the \nregion to counter Boko Haram, protect children, particularly girls, in \ntheir education systems, and combat human trafficking.\n  I led a delegation last month to Mexico focused on fighting human \ntrafficking, and one of the lessons I took away from that was the \ncritical importance of training local law enforcement, prosecutors, and \njudges to recognize trafficking when they see it. A sharp-eyed police \nofficer in one of these countries can make all the difference in \nfinding these girls.\n  Make no mistake. How we respond to the abduction of the schoolgirls \nof Nigeria will send a message about our Nation's commitment to human \nrights and the fight against modern-day slavery.\n  Human trafficking is a stain on the conscience of the world. It is \none of the reasons I became involved in this issue, having been a \nprosecutor and seeing the devastation that prostitution and trafficking \nand sex trafficking wreaks on these girls.\n  In the United States we have our own problems; 83 percent of our \nvictims in the United States are from the United States. We have had \nseveral prosecutions in my own State. We have had prosecutions in North \nDakota. It is one of the reasons I introduced a bill with Senator \nCornyn. We have multiple authors who go after this crime to look at a \nsmarter way to handle these cases, which is modeled after the safe \nharbor law, which Minnesota uses, as well as 12 other States.\n  The idea is to treat these girls as victims. Their average age is 13 \nyears old--not old enough to drive, not old enough to go to their high \nschool prom. It takes that concept, puts it into a comprehensive sex-\ntrafficking strategy, and goes after this in our own country.\n  It is now the world's third largest criminal enterprise--human \ntrafficking--right behind drugs and guns. So do not think this is just \nsomething that people are talking about. It is not. It is happening \nright now.\n  Nicholas Kristof and his wife Sheryl WuDunn wrote a book called \n``Half the Sky,'' named for the Chinese proverb ``women hold up half \nthe sky.'' It is about human trafficking. It uses examples from all \nover the world. In it they argue that ``it is not hyperbole to say that \nmillions of women and girls are actually enslaved today.'' They \nestimate that 2 million disappear each year. In fact, this book was \nwritten long before this happened in Nigeria, and one of the examples \nthey use is a girl being abducted in Nigeria. One of the examples they \nuse is girls being abducted in Moldova, one of the poorest countries in \nthat region. Senator McCain just went to Moldova and came back. When he \nwas there he asked: Where are all the young girls and women? The \nofficials there told him: Many of them have been trafficked to other \ncountries--trafficked to Russia.\n  This is happening right now, and these girls in Nigeria need our \nhelp. The girls abducted and apparently sold into forced marriages in \nNigeria are as young as 15 years old. They are being forced to endure \nwhat no one, let alone a young girl, should ever have to experience.\n  Simply put, this is a barbaric practice that must be extinguished \nfrom the world. In the book Kristof and his wife wrote they liken the \nimperative of abolishing human trafficking today to what the British \nbravely did in the early 1800s when Britain abolished slavery.\n  They note that what mattered most in turning the tide against slavery \nwas the British public. It was not the abolitionists' passion and moral \nconviction, as important as that was, but instead what turned the tide \nwas what they called the ``meticulously amassed evidence of \nbarbarity''--the human beings packed into the hold of slave ships, the \nstink, the diseases, the corpses, the bloody manacles.\n  We cannot close our eyes to the clear ``evidence of barbarity'' \nunfolding before us in Nigeria.

Madam President, it is no secret that our Nation faces a \nnumber of critical problems. We have a national debt that currently \nstands at $17.4 trillion. We are in the midst of an entitlement crisis \nthat threatens to balloon our debt and swallow funding for the rest of \nour government. We have a still-struggling economy, which was once \nagain confirmed last week with the announcement of lackluster growth \nnumbers. These are just some of the problems we are facing. There are \nnumerous others.\n  With all the challenges in front of us, you would think the Senate \nmajority and the President of the United States would be focused on \nsolving at least one or two of these problems. Sadly, that is not the \ncase. In this heightened partisan climate, my friends in the majority \nare far more often than not focused on two things: shoring up their \npolitical base and marginalizing their political critics. In other \nwords, it is all politics all the time.\n  It is pretty easy to find examples of the Democrats' efforts to \nsolidify their progressive base. Indeed, we have seen it in just the \nlast few weeks. Why else do you think we have had show votes on bills \nsuch as the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act and minimum wage, \nespecially since we already have laws that say women should be paid \nfairly? Why else did we have to endure the all-night speech fest on \nclimate change a few weeks back? None of these efforts were rooted in \nany kind of policy justification. They certainly weren't aimed at \nbenefiting our economy or creating jobs. If anything, they would do \nexactly the opposite. In fact, the CBO confirmed that the Democrats' \nlatest gambit here on the floor--the minimum wage--would actually cost \nour economy somewhere upward of at least half a million jobs.\n  All of these endeavors were aimed at driving turnout for the \nDemocratic base in November, but that is just half of the Democrats' \nequation. The other half is silencing their critics. Indeed, over the \npast few years we have seen a\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\npattern coming from the other side--both in the Senate and in the White \nHouse--of using whatever tools are available to intimidate critics and \nmarginalize opposition.\n  It started, of course, with the IRS targeting scandal. I know a \nlittle bit about it, being the ranking member on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. The IRS has admitted that in the runup to the 2010 and 2012 \nelections it was improperly targeting conservative groups applying for \ntax-exempt status by harassment and intimidation. Now, for obvious \nreasons, President Obama has tried to sweep this scandal under the rug, \nbut the record is pretty clear on the matter. The IRS singled out \nconservative groups--groups that were critical of the President and his \npolicies--for extra scrutiny. These conservative groups were subjected \nto delays in their applications. Some still haven't gotten their \napproval after years of trying. In several cases they were asked a \nnumber of intrusive and harassing questions about their activities and \ngoals. There is no getting around this; that is exactly what happened. \nThis turn of events has left a black cloud over the IRS as an agency \nand seriously damaged the public's trust in government.\n  Let's be clear. The IRS did not engage in these activities in a \nvacuum. On the contrary, they were cheered on by some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who, rather than simply dealing with \ncriticism they didn't agree with, urged the IRS to apply more scrutiny \nto these conservative organizations.\n  Unfortunately, after the political targeting scandal, the IRS wasn't \nfinished. The pattern continued. Late last year the agency unveiled a \nregulatory proposal designed to limit the ``political activities'' of \n501(c)(4) organizations. If finalized, these regulations would \neffectively silence grassroots organizations across the country. They \nwould no longer be able to engage in activities as innocuous as voter \nregistration drives or candidate forums without those activities being \nlabeled ``political.''\n  The purpose of these regulations is very clear. The administration \ndoes not want grassroots organizations educating the public on the \nissues of the day. They certainly don't want them informing people \nabout candidates' positions on matters of public policy. This \nregulation is designed specifically to put a stop to all of that.\n  It is no surprise that this proposal has been condemned by groups \nacross the political spectrum. Indeed, any objective observer would \ncall this what it is: an affront to free speech and fair debate.\n  But, as I said, there is a pattern here. It is an ongoing effort on \nthe other side to undermine free speech and impose limits on Americans' \nparticipation in the political process, and it has not stopped with the \nIRS regulations. Just last week it was announced that the Senate \nmajority plans to hold a vote on a constitutional amendment that would \nlimit the scope of the first amendment and allow Congress to impose \nlimits on political speech--just last week. It is difficult to imagine \nthat we have come to that, but here we are.\n  Political speech is critical to our democracy. Indeed, this principle \nis at the very foundation of our Republic. It is one the Supreme Court \nhas upheld time and time again, including very recently. Yet, when \nconfronted with speech they don't like, my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are willing to use every tool at their disposal to even \nchange the text of the Constitution itself in order to silence it.\n  In a marketplace of ideas like the one the Founders intended, \ndisagreeable speech can easily be met with additional speech, and in \nthe end the truth will almost certainly prevail. But, alas, my friends \ndon't appear to be interested in the truth or a marketplace of ideas. \nThey only want one store that will only sell ideas with which they \nhappen to agree. It is truly mind-boggling, but that is where we are.\n  This isn't the end of the pattern. In fact, the pattern of hostility \ntoward free speech and the effort to intimidate and silence critics \ncontinues virtually every day here on the Senate floor. Almost every \nday Democratic Senators, including members of the Senate Democratic \nleadership, come to the floor to call out American citizens by name and \ndemonize them for having the audacity to participate in the political \nprocess. They use the Senate's time and resources to single out \nindividuals whose only crime is that they happen to have different \nviews on public policy. I suppose their other crime is that they are \nsuccessful, which is more often than not enough to draw the ire of my \nfriends on the other side. When you couple success in the economy with \ncriticism of Democrats and their policies, it is apparently too much \nfor my colleagues to bear. Day after day Democratic leaders come to the \nfloor to call out these Americans by name in order to attack them. They \nspread falsehoods about these Americans and their intentions, and they \nmalign the entire conservative movement and Republican Party as guilty \nby association.\n  Even if this type of demagoguery weren't unbecoming of the Senate--\nwhich it is--these attacks would be shameful in their own right. After \nall, how are these unjustified attacks on American citizens going to \nhelp our struggling economy? How are these attacks going to create jobs \nfor the middle class?\n  And, how are these attacks on American citizens going to rein in our \nalready out-of-control national debt? They are not, and they are not \nintended to.\n  As I said, these days Democrats have two missions: No. 1, to solidify \ntheir base and, No. 2, marginalize their opposition, and when they come \nto the floor every day to make bogeymen out of individual Americans, \nthey are doing both. They are not, as they claim to be, trying to take \nmoney out of the political equation. If they were, they would be just \nas concerned with those on their side who spend millions bankrolling \nliberal causes and Democratic candidates. I am talking, of course, \nabout the labor unions, trial lawyers, and billionaire \nenvironmentalists who have pledged to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars in this campaign cycle alone. Instead, they are trying to scare \nup votes.\n  Apparently they believe if they can make scapegoats out of those who \nchoose to participate in the political process, they can cover up the \nfact their policies have failed to get our economy moving and that they \ndon't have any real answers to the real problems plaguing our country. \nPerhaps more importantly, they think if they can attack certain \nindividuals for their political activities, others will be afraid to \nget similarly involved. Once again, this is a pattern of hostility \nagainst both free speech and against any Americans who speak out \nagainst the policies of the Democrats. Quite frankly, it is simply \nshameful that it has gone this far.\n  We need to have a different conversation. We need to talk about ideas \nand proposals that will actually help the American people. I hope in \nthe coming months my friends on the other side of the aisle will be \nwilling to have this conversation rather than simply relying on \nunderhanded tactics that, in the view of many, demean our government \nand the Senate in particular. That is the type of debate the American \npeople want to see, and I think they are smart enough to see through \nanything the other side wants to offer in its place.\n  I have never seen it this bad in the Senate. I have never seen this \nbody so ineffectual in my 38 years in the Senate. I have never seen \nsuch politics played in this awful manner. I have never seen people's \nfree speech rights being criticized and demeaned as is going on right \nnow. That is not to say we have not had some faults on our side too, \nbut I do have to say what is going on here is unbelievable.\n  Since they broke the rules to change the rules, the Senate has not \nfunctioned as a great legislative body at all. It won't be functioning \nuntil we get those rules back. I believe when some of our colleagues on \nthe other side, many of whom have never been in the minority, finally \nget in the minority--and I believe that is going to happen sooner \nrather than later--they are going to realize these rights are very \nimportant. They are going to realize we should be doing more in the \nSenate than trying to protect our side from any possible repercussions \nthat could occur, which seems to be the major aim of our colleagues--or \nat least the leadership--on the other side at this time.\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\n  This is a great body. We have great people whom I deeply admire on \nboth sides of the floor. There were Senators, who are now gone, on the \nother side of the floor whom I deeply admired. Never have we had, as \nfar as I can remember in my 38 years, this type of stultification of \nfree and fair and open debates. It is a disgrace. I think they know it \nis a disgrace, but they don't care; they are more interested in power \nthan they are in doing what is right.\n  The way they have singled out various conservative individuals by \nname on the floor is deeply troubling to anybody who is fair. The fact \nis the Democrats have never liked money. They try to blame Wall Street \nfor everything, but Wall Street is run primarily by Democrats. We do \nhave an occasional Republican up there, but an awful lot of them are \nDemocrats who are giving big dollars to the Democratic side. They have \na right to do it if they want to without being demeaned on the Senate \nfloor. I hope we will have not only free and open debate, but that we \nwill have better and more honest debate in the future.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2015 proceeds in earnest, and with \nthe recent release and annual assessments of the Department of Defense \nmajor procurement programs by the Government Accountability Office and \nthe Pentagon's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation, we are, \nonce again, reminded of the DOD's chronic inability to rein in costs \nassociated with its largest and most expensive weapon and information \ntechnology systems.\n  This is, of course, a problem the DOD--the Department of Defense--has \nstruggled with for years. During every one of these years, I brought \nthis problem to the attention of the American people, both in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and here on the floor of the Senate.\n  So I need not go over again the frustrating litany of costly \nprocurement failures at the Department of Defense. At this point we are \nall aware of the future combat system, the Army's ``transformational'' \nvehicle and communications modernization program, in which the military \nand the U.S. Army wasted almost $20 billion developing 18 vehicles and \ndrones, only one of which actually went into production. In other \nwords, they blew $19 billion. As had been done on other programs, on \nthe Future Combat Systems, the Army held a ``paper competition'' to \nselect contractors far in advance of fielding any actual prototypes. \nBut it awarded control to two separate companies and let them, not the \ngovernment, hold their own internal competitions to determine who would \ntest and build the vehicles and systems--encumbering the program with a \ndizzying array of conflicts of interest and preferred-supplier \npreferences that chipped away at the program from the inside out.\n  As for the Air Force, its Expeditionary Combat Support System--the \nECSS program--wasted over 1 billion taxpayer dollars attempting to \nprocure and integrate a ``commercial off-the-shelf'' logistics IT \nsystem. That effort resulted in no usable capability for the Air Force, \nand taxpayers were forced to pay an additional $8 million in severance \ncosts to the company that failed in its mission. The Marine Corps, in \nturn, spent 15 years and $3 billion on its Expeditionary Fighting \nVehicle before canceling the program in 2012--another $3 billion down \nthe drain.\n  While there are so many other failures, we shouldn't forget the VH-71 \nprogram--the presidential helicopter program--with which the Navy \nattempted to procure a new presidential helicopter. Before that \nprogram's cancellation in 2009, taxpayers were forced to pay $3.2 \nbillion and got exactly zero helicopters.\n  Our ``joint service'' programs have also faced profound difficulties. \nEven though the Department of Defense has not completed development \ntesting on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, that program is already well \ninto production, exposing it to the risk of costly retrofits late in \nproduction.\n  While today the Joint Strike Fighter Program is on a more stable path \nto succeed, during a recent Airland Subcommittee hearing on tactical \naircraft programs, I asked the head of the program, Lt. Gen. Chris \nBogdan, what lessons the DOD learned from that program's costly \nfailures. By the way, it is the most expensive weapons system ever--a \n$1 trillion weapons system. He identified three lessons: the danger of \noverly optimistic initial cost estimates, the importance of reliable \ntechnological risk estimates, and the complexity and costs of building \nnext-generation planes while still testing them.\n  That is, of course, a post mortem that we are all very familiar with, \nincluding on some of the failed acquisition programs to which I just \nalluded. For that reason, Congress enacted the Weapon Systems \nAcquisition Reform Act of 2009. That law instituted reforms to make \nsure that new major weapons procurement programs start off right, with \naccurate initial cost estimates, reliable technological risk \nassessments, and only reasonable ``concurrency,'' and stable \noperational requirements.\n  While the Government Accountability Office found this law had a \n``significant influence'' on requirements, cost, schedule, testing, and \nreliability for the acquisition of new major weapons systems, there is \nstill much to do, especially on the so-called ``legacy'' systems \nalready well into the development pipeline. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, the cost of the Pentagon's major weapons \nsystems--that is 80 systems in total--have swollen to nearly one-half \ntrillion dollars over their initial price tags and have average \nschedule delays of more than 2 years.\n  I will repeat that for the benefit of the Pentagon, my colleagues \nhere in the Senate, and the American people. The Government \nAccountability Office says the cost of the Pentagon's major weapons \nsystems, of which there are 80 in total, have swollen to nearly one-\nhalf trillion dollars--that is T, trillion dollars--over their initial \nprice tags--their initial cost estimates--and have average schedule \ndelays of more than 2 years. That is not acceptable. That is not \nacceptable to the American people, it should not be acceptable to \nMembers of Congress, and it sure as heck shouldn't be acceptable to the \npeople who are responsible for these cost overruns. That is the \nPentagon and that is these manufacturers.\n  Against this backdrop, I will briefly discuss two critical aspects of \nhow the Department of Defense procures major systems--real competition \nand accountability. In my view, it is no coincidence that the period of \nremarkably poor performance among our largest weapons procurement \nprograms has coincided with a dramatic contraction in the industrial \nbase, due, in large part, to consolidation among the Nation's top-tier \ncontractors. For this reason the Department of Defense must structure \ninto its strategies to acquire major systems true competition--not like \nfake competition--as we saw in the Future Combat System or as \nproponents for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter once \nadvocated. According to the Government Accountability Office, in fiscal \nyear 2013, only 57 percent--I repeat, 57 percent--of the $300 billion \nthe Department of Defense obligated for contracts and orders was \nactually competed. In other words, only in a little over half of the \n$300 billion--roughly $150 billion--in contracts and orders was there \nactually any competition. Unacceptable. Competition should be driven \nthrough the subsystems level, and it should be reflected in approaches \nthat foster innovation and small business participation throughout a \nsystem's entire lifecycle.\n\n  Especially within the Navy's ``shipbuilding and conversion'' account \nand the Air Force's ``missile procurement'' account, costs associated \nwith the Ohio-class replacement submarine and the Evolved Expendable \nLaunch Vehicle--that is our space effort--those programs respectively, \nwill severely pressurize other procurement priorities within these same \naspects of Pentagon spending.\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\n  So within these particular areas, harnessing competitive forces to \ndrive down costs and keep them down will be enormously important. There \ncan, however, be no doubt that during a year of declining budgets and, \ntherefore, fewer opportunities to support an already diminished \nindustrial base, this will be extraordinarily difficult. So we should \nbe embracing competition--even the prospect of it--wherever and however \nwe find it.\n  In the Littoral Combat Ship Program, the Navy's strategy to bring \ncompetition into the construction of the follow-on ships' seaframes \nsuccessfully drove down those costs after the cost to complete \nconstruction of the lead ships' seaframes exploded--the costs exploded. \nWhile doing so resulted in a dual-award block-buy contract, which I \nthought, and continue to think, was ill-advised, and serious problems \npersist with the Littoral Combat Ship's mission modules--in other \nwords, the ship's ability to carry out its assigned missions--there can \nbe no doubt that competition was just what the program needed.\n  After having found in 2012 that competition for the Evolved \nExpendable Launch Vehicle, i.e., our space program, could lower costs \nfor the government, the Government Accountability Office reiterated the \nimportance of competition generally in a report released today, stating \nthat, ``[c]ompetition is the cornerstone of a sound acquisition \nprocess.''\n  Remember those words by the Government Accountability Office, as I go \non: Competition is the cornerstone of a sound acquisition process.\n  It is exactly for this reason I have been concerned with what I have \nseen in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, a critical national \nsecurity space launch program. In the absence of competition and amidst \na highly suspect effort to minimize internal Pentagon and congressional \noversight of the program, which I corrected just a couple of years ago, \nthe costs of this program have exploded. There are higher inflation \ncosts for this program than any other program in the entire program. \nOnly after that program critically breached cost thresholds under \nFederal law--the so-called Nunn-McCurdy--in other words, after the \ninflation of the costs were so high Federal law threatened its \nexistence--did the Department of Defense finally recognize the value--\nindeed, the need--for competition.\n  Yet despite a directive by the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics to the Air Force to \n``aggressively'' introduce competition into the program, and just weeks \nbefore the Air Force knew--the Air Force knew--that a prospective new \nentrant to the program would qualify as a bidder, the Air Force awarded \na 3-year sole-source block-buy contract to the incumbent contractor. \nJust weeks before they knew there would be competition, they allowed \nand awarded a program to the one bidder, sole source, at a huge cost. \nThe Air Force did so in a way that exposed only those launches \ndesignated for competition to the greatest risk of delay or \ncancellation. Then, just a few weeks ago, in connection with its budget \nrequest for fiscal year 2015, the Air Force proposed to cut the number \nof launches designated for competition in half. They gut the number of \nlaunches designated for competition to half, in part to satisfy the Air \nForce's existing obligation to the incumbent contractor under the sole-\nsource block-buy contract.\n  Why the Air Force made all those decisions in that program, which so \ndesperately needs competition, is unclear. But the evidence of \nincumbency favoritism I have seen to date was strong enough for me to \nrefer the matter to the Department of Defense Inspector General for \ninvestigation. That favoritism apparently extended to the DOD's failure \nto ensure that the incumbent contractor's efforts to import rocket \nengines from Russia--we are importing rocket engines for our space \nlaunch program from Russia in a noncompetitive contract--did not run \nafoul of the President's Executive order sanctioning certain Russian \npersons in connection with Russia's activities in eastern Ukraine. It \ntook a prospective bidder--not the Pentagon, but a prospective bidder; \nthat is, a possible competitor--to file a lawsuit in Federal court to \nensure compliance with the President's Executive order. We all look \nforward to the inspector general's findings.\n\n  In addition to the EELV, I will also be monitoring the Army's \nmodernization program to build nearly 3,000 armored personnel carriers. \nThis program too appears to lack any meaningful competition, having \nobtained a waiver to skip over building working prototypes and thereby \nignoring the acquisition best practice of fly before you buy.\n  Way back many years ago when Ronald Reagan became President of the \nUnited States, our then-Secretary of Defense Cap Weinberger said: Fly \nbefore you buy. Fly before you buy.\n  It is clear. I do not think anybody builds anything in America today \nif they do not test it out before they purchase it en bloc or produce \nit en bloc. Yet the Pentagon continues to ignore the fundamental \nprinciple of fly before you buy.\n  There is also clearly more that needs to be done to ensure \naccountability in how the Department of Defense procures major weapons \nand information technology systems. Ensuring accountability means \nhaving in place the right acquisition managers when large procurement \nprograms start instead of bringing them in years after those programs \nhave foundered. Those managers must see and be willing to enforce \naffordability as an operational requirement and know how to effectively \nincentivize their industry partners to control costs.\n  Also, within a system that better aligns their tenure with key \nmanagement decisions on their programs, those managers--trained to be \nas competent and skillful a buyer as their industry counterparts are \nsellers--need to be empowered to make those decisions in their best \nprofessional judgment, and they need to do so within an overall system \nthat holds them accountable if they are wrong and rewards them if they \nare successful.\n  Regrettably, that is not our defense acquisition system. In our \nsystem, instead of accountability, a systemic misalignment of \nincentives reigns--incentives that assign a premium to overly \noptimistic initial cost estimates and technological risk assessments. \nIn our system, what is all-important is getting activity ``under \ncontract,'' ``keeping the money flowing,'' and maintaining budgets. Our \nsystem allows the Department of Defense to start programs that are \npoorly conceived or inherently unexecutable with the aim of getting \nthem ``on rails''--into the development pipeline--and, if possible, \nsimultaneously into production.\n  At that point, given the extent to which they have been engineered so \nthat their economic benefits are distributed among key States and \ncongressional districts, those programs become notoriously difficult to \nterminate or meaningfully change. Why? Because our system keeps them \nalive, often at an exorbitant cost and, in the worst cases, without \never providing meaningful combat capability.\n  My friends, it is called the military-industrial-congressional \ncomplex. Dwight David Eisenhower, in his last major speech, warned us \nof the military-industrial complex. It is now the military-industrial-\ncongressional complex. It is a politically engineered, ill-defined, \nmassive ``transformational'' procurement program, with an unlimited \ntolerance for excessive concurrency, largely funded on a cost-\nreimbursable basis, with the prime contractor allowed to maximize \nprofit without necessarily delivering needed capability to our service \nmen and women on budget or on time.\n  To say that such a system is unsustainable is charitable. It is a \nsystem that, if allowed to continue unabated, will have us bestow on \nour children and theirs de facto unilateral disarmament for which they \nwill have no say and from which our Nation will have no recourse.\n  Rather than wallow in discouragement, however, we must let that \nodious proposition motivate us to reform the current system with \nmeaningful change, in particular to the Pentagon's culture of \ninefficiency that has eluded us for a generation.\n  One thing is clear: Today we have a choice. Tomorrow we will not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Madam President, we have had a severe act of Mother \nNature in Florida and a number of other Southeastern States, where \nskies of Biblical proportions in dumping rain have occurred. In \nPensacola, FL, there was close to 25 inches of rain that fell within a \n24-hour period. The counties of Escambia and Santa Rosa in Florida were \nparticularly hard hit, and just today the Governor of Florida requested \na major disaster declaration from the President and sought assistance \nfor that part of Florida. I passed along the Governor's request to the \nWhite House and asked that it be approved as soon as possible.\n  Right now the State of Florida government and local governments as \nwell are assisting people in need, and they are surveying the damage to \nassess the extent of the storm's impact. We are going to do everything \nwe can to make sure the people have the assistance and the help they \nneed during this very difficult time. Of course, it was not just in \nFlorida that these storms hit; it was a number of States--Mississippi, \nAlabama, Georgia. As the storm proceeded on upwards, it occurred in a \nlot of the Southeastern United States. But particularly those States \nplus ours, in northwest Florida, is where it really hit the hardest.\n  Many people have worked around the clock to save lives and to provide \nsupport in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Thank goodness there \nis a Florida National Guard that is as experienced as it is, and it is \nexperienced because we are accustomed to storms, particularly \nhurricanes. But we are not accustomed to 25 inches in 24 hours, and all \nemergency personnel are down there helping.\n  According to Florida's request for Federal assistance, in addition to \nthe spinoff tornadoes, some parts of the panhandle received this \nenormous amount of rain, and another indication is that in just 1 hour, \n5.68 inches of rain fell--in 1 hour--in the city of Pensacola.\n  It brought floods. It destroyed homes, roads. It destroyed essential \ninfrastructure. If you have seen any of the views on television, then \nyou have seen the devastation, you have seen people being pulled out of \nthe water, cars completely submerged, portions of roads taken out. It \nhas occurred in multiple States.\n  Responding to a disaster such as this is a critical responsibility \nfor not only government in general but for the Federal Government and \nthe unique things and people and services the Federal Government can \nprovide. It is one of those things government is supposed to do for \npeople. It is supposed to help in times of emergency. The President has \nalready declared a disaster in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama, \nmaking Federal resources available there. I hope the President is going \nto do the same for Florida. Sometimes challenges are just too great for \nany one local community or State to take on alone. The unique position \nof the Federal Government in a time such as this is to coordinate \nresources and people across the Nation to solve our biggest challenges. \nA lot of that is done through FEMA, and who better to have the help \nready than the head of FEMA, who is a Floridian and who was the head of \nFlorida's emergency department before President Obama tapped him to be \nthe head of FEMA.\n  With this terrible toll on people's lives, I hope this will serve as \nan example of how we can all come together when people are in need. \nClearly, our hopes and prayers and thoughts are with the people who are \naffected by these storms.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, while I had the opportunity on the \nfloor, I wanted to call to the attention of the Senate that the Special \nCommittee on Aging, which I have the privilege of chairing, held a \nhearing last week on scams particularly affecting senior citizens--but \nnot limited to senior citizens--in the selling of precious metals, in \nparticular gold.\n  Basically, the bottom-line takeaway from the hearing is if you are an \nAmerican getting a cold call suggesting to you that you should invest \nin a precious metal such as gold, more than likely it is a scam and you \nare about to be robbed of your money if you play along and start \ninvesting in this fictitious investment in gold. The testimony showed \nthat most of the time the scammers do not even purchase the gold and \ncertainly are not storing it--even though they are charging the poor \nvictim, often a senior citizen, storage fees for this fictitious gold.\n  I was astounded. We are accustomed to getting telemarketer calls--\nunless you are on the Do Not Call list--but telemarketers still call \nthrough the Do Not Call list. That is another giveaway. If you are on \nthe Do Not Call list and you are getting one of these calls to invest, \nthey can make it sound so good.\n  We had a man who was about to be sentenced and was one of the \ntelemarketers. Why do these scams often end up being from South \nFlorida? But it is true--not only these kinds of scams, but also \nMedicare and Medicaid fraud. It is concentrated in South Florida. This \nman was a part of this scam calling unsuspecting Americans to get them \nto invest in something that sounds too good to be true, only it is the \ngold standard. People fell for it, and then they sent him money. He \nshowed us. They have four different stages: someone who first gets you \ninterested, someone who comes in and closes the deal, another person \nwho comes along and then gets up the deal, and then others who keep you \nhooked into the scam until you find out that you don't have any gold \nthat is being held in trust for you in storage but, in fact, it is all \na sham.\n  I wanted to share with folks what the Senate Special Committee on \nAging found out. If you get a cold call and they want you to invest in \ngold, chances are it is a scam and it is not real. It is a word to the \nwise: Beware. Don't fall for it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, all 100 of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nare concerned about our fellow citizens who are unemployed, struggling \nto pay their bills, and desperate to find meaningful work. We are \nconcerned about the lack of opportunities in many of America's \ncommunities and the urgent need for more good-paying jobs across the \nUnited States.\n  There are Hoosiers and citizens across this country hurting in this \neconomy, and it seems as though a new negative economic headline comes \nout every day. Consider some of the recent discouraging reports we have \nheard. According to a new USA Today/Pew research poll, Americans by a \n2-to-1 margin rate the Nation's economic conditions as poor, and just \n27 percent say there are enough jobs available where they live.\n  A few days ago, the Commerce Department estimated that between \nJanuary and March of this year, the U.S. economy grew a shocking 0.1 \npercent. That is .1 percent from no growth whatsoever and just .2 \npercent from racking up a first quarter of recession.\n  It takes two quarters back to back to qualify for recession, but we \nare in the recovery period from one of the deepest recessions since \nWorld War II. Now we are into the fifth year, close to the sixth year, \nof a stagnant economy growing at half the rate it normally does after a \nrecession, and Americans are still out of work.\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\n  In addition, the U.S. labor force participation rate is at its lowest \npoint in 36 years. Not since the days of Jimmy Carter has such a low \npercentage of Americans been in the workforce.\n  In fact, another shocking headline: Over 800,000 Americans dropped \nout of the labor force last month alone. Let me say that again. Over \n800,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force in just 1 month--\n800,000. That is enough people to fill Lucas Oil Stadium in \nIndianapolis, home of Super Bowl XLVI and the Indianapolis Colts, one \ndozen times.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics calls many of these 800,000 \n``discouraged workers,'' and they join over one-third of all working-\nage Americans no longer seeking work. It is not only those who are \nearnestly out there every day trying to find a job, any job, this is a \nstaggering number of people who have simply given up, saying: It is not \nworth the effort; I can't find a job; the jobs simply are not there.\n  Even those young Americans starting their careers, just entering the \nworkforce, are not entering at the traditional level, the level which \nthey are qualified for, have trained for or have been educated for. \nThey are being forced to accept positions that they are overqualified \nfor at wages way below what they expected to make after all their \nefforts preparing themselves through education and skills training to \njoin the labor force in America.\n  Given years of growth at half the expected level and high \nunemployment, it is not surprising but it is very disheartening to hear \nthis news continue well into the fifth year after the recession. But \nrather than point fingers or assign blame, I am here today to seek, \nhopefully, a consensus that the Senate needs to propose, needs to \ndebate, and needs to support measures that will increase economic \ngrowth and provide economic opportunity for those who are seeking to \njoin the labor force.\n  It is time for us to start talking about maximizing opportunity. \nWebster's dictionary defines opportunity as ``a good chance for \nadvancement or progress.'' That is what American workers at all levels \nof skill and income deserve, but many of us have introduced our own \nideas about job creation and economic growth.\n  Earlier this year I put forward a detailed 10-point plan that I call \nThe Indiana Way. Based on stories and suggestions from Hoosiers, these \nare commonsense solutions to some of our Nation's biggest problems. \nMany of my proposals incorporate ideas that have gained bipartisan \nsupport.\n  We are not in the Senate arguing against each other, we are trying to \nfind solutions, proposals, to debate together, to support together, and \nto move this country forward.\n  The Indiana Way includes commonsense proposals to reform our broken \nTax Code, reduce regulations that are crippling industries and \nbusiness, unlock American energy sources, and support community banks, \ncredit unions, and those who are providing the tools for investment and \nthe tools for growth.\n  I welcome the chance to discuss how these ideas will help Hoosiers \nand Americans who are struggling in this economy, and I know many of my \ncolleagues are also eager for the opportunity to discuss and debate \nreal solutions to help our workforce. There are a number of proposals \nthat have been brought to this floor by my colleagues.\n  Senator Portman, who sits at a desk next to me, and others have put \nforward meaningful proposals we ought to be debating. We shouldn't be \ntalking about: Well, nothing is going to get done because it is an \nelection year.\n  We ought to set that aside and say for the sake of the future of this \ncountry and for all of those seeking work and don't have it, let's \ndebate the real issues. Let's work together to pass something that will \nmake our country stronger and our economy better.\n  It was one of my former colleagues and friend Jack Kemp who once \nsaid:\n\n       Our goals for this nation must be nothing less than to \n     double the size of our economy and bring prosperity and jobs, \n     ownership and equality of opportunity to all Americans, \n     especially those living in our nation's pockets of poverty--\n\n  And especially those who are earnestly seeking work and simply can't \nfind it. Today that goal remains worthy of our time and efforts. Let's \njoin together and have a conversation about real solutions that will \nmake our country stronger, improve the lives of all American citizens, \nand build a better future for the next generation. This should be our \ngoal. This is the goal that should unite us, and it is long past time \nfor us to get serious about it and take action.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, all year I have been coming to the \nfloor to urge Senate Democrats to work with us to help the middle \nclass. So far they haven't seemed too serious about it. We saw that \nlast week when they insisted on pushing legislation that could cost--\nnot create but cost--up to 1 million jobs. Seventeen thousand of those \njobs would be lost in Kentucky alone.\n  I am hoping Senate Democrats are finally willing to turn the page. I \nam hoping they are finally willing to get serious about helping the \nmiddle class, because if they are, here is the energy debate we should \nbe having right here this week: We should be having a debate about how \nto develop policies that can actually lead to lower utility bills for \nsqueezed families, policies that can put people back to work in \nAmerica's coal country, policies that can help the kind of well-paying \njobs our constituents want and deserve, and policies that can lead to a \nmore effective use of North American energy supplies, that can help \nstabilize the world at a time when energy has become a weapon of states \nthat do not hold our interests at heart.\n  Middle-class Americans struggle every day just to make ends meet. For \nmany, the rising cost of energy is a big part of that. The price of \nelectricity has been rising over the last decade, jumping by double \ndigits in many States, and that is even after adjusting for inflation.\n  So it is unacceptable that it has been 7 years since we have had a \nreal debate about energy jobs, energy independence, and energy security \nin the Democratically led Senate.\n  Republicans have a lot of good ideas about ways to help alleviate \npressure on the middle class, and we have good ideas about how to \ncreate new opportunities through the use of our country's abundant \nenergy supplies. I am sure our Democratic friends have some good ideas, \ntoo, and we would all love to hear them because these days we haven't \nheard a lot of serious energy talk from our friends on the other side.\n  We haven't heard many concrete Democratic proposals that would \neffectively alleviate the real concerns and anxieties and stresses that \nmy constituents and theirs deal with on an everyday basis. That is what \nwe would like to hear from them this week, and that is what the \nAmerican people deserve to hear.\n  We know Washington Democrats tried and failed to push a national \nenergy tax--cap and trade--through Congress back when they had complete \ncontrol of Washington. We know President Obama hasn't given up on that \nidea, even after the people's representatives refused to go along with \nit--in a Congress that was controlled entirely by his party.\n  That is why we see the Obama administration trying to do an end run \naround Congress to get what it wants: to impose through the bureaucracy \nmassive new regulations that would make things even harder for already \nsqueezed middle-class families.\n  So what Republicans are saying is this: Our constituents deserve a \nvoice in what Washington Democrats are planning to do up because they \nare the ones whose lives and livelihoods will be most affected by these \ndecisions, and through legislation this very week our constituents \nshould be able to weigh in on these kinds of Democratic plans.\n  For instance, my constituents in Kentucky should be able to weigh in \non\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nan EPA rule that would negatively impact existing and future coal \nplants. Kentuckians deserve a say on ongoing regulatory efforts to tie \nup mining permits and the redtape that is stifling the creation of good \njobs in the coal industry and coal country.\n  The American people deserve a debate on how we can best tap our own \nextraordinary natural resources to achieve energy independence here at \nhome and how we can help our allies overseas through increased exports \nof American energy too.\n  These are what we should be voting on this very week--serious energy \npolicy proposals that can jolt our economy, boost middle-class incomes \nand jobs, and improve America's energy security in the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Dinyal New was sitting in her church in \nOakland, CA, and she was asked a question which she repeated back \nknowing there was no way to answer it. She said: What is it like to \nbury both of my kids?\n  Ms. New lost her two sons in episodes of gun violence not more than 3 \nweeks apart in January of this year.\n  Her youngest son was an eighth grader. He was walking down the street \none day. The description says that surveillance cameras actually show \nhim almost skipping down the street. He was walking home from the bus \nstop. He usually called his mom to pick him up, but his cell phone \nbattery had died that day. On the video we can see a gunman approach \ncarrying a semi-automatic rifle and shoot little Lee, an eighth grader, \n28 times.\n  He wasn't in a gang. Frankly, it shouldn't matter whether he was in a \ngang, but he wasn't in a gang. He loved to play drums. His neighbors \nsaid he was a great kid. He stayed home a lot playing video games or he \nhung out often at the Boys and Girls Club while his single mom worked \nas a social worker. Nobody knows why Lee was targeted.\n  After Lee died, his mom begged his older brother Lamar to leave town, \nthat it was just too dangerous. Not knowing exactly what went on, she \ndidn't want Lamar to get caught in the crossfire. Lamar had had a \nlittle more difficult life, but he had straightened out his life after \nsome occasional run-ins with the law. He was taking classes at a local \ncommunity college, and he had dreams of becoming a musician or starting \nhis own business, but 3 days after his little brother's funeral, on \nJanuary 19 his mom asked Lamar to run an errand for him. So being a \ndutiful son, just days after the family was grieving at his brother's \nfuneral, he went 2 blocks from home to do an errand. He was in his car \nand a suspect got up on top of the car and started shooting into it, \nkilling Lamar. Within 3 weeks she had gone from having two sons to \nhaving no sons. Those two homicides are among the 31,672 that happen \nannually through gunfire and gun violence all across the Nation, part \nof 2,639 gun deaths every month, part of the 86 a day that happen all \nacross the country. My State is no exception. In March of this year on \nthe same night, March 24, two half-brothers were shot, leaving one dead \nand the other in the hospital. The surviving brother was a student at \nHamden High School and the principal there talked about the fact that \nthis is now the eighth shooting victim at Hamden High School in the \nprincipal's short tenure there. Hamden is not a town that is known in \nConnecticut for high rates of violence, but in just that one high \nschool alone this one principal has seen eight shooting victims.\n\n  They had the funeral which was attended by hundreds for Taijhon. \nTaijhon was a great kid. All kids have troubles, but Taijhon was trying \nto get his life straight. He had just enrolled in the New Haven Job \nCorps Program. Anyone who knows about Job Corps program knows it is an \navenue to get kids' lives turned around, gives them real skills that \nthey can go out and succeed. Taijhon was enthusiastic about having \nstarted this Job Corps Program, but now we will have no idea what \nTaijhon's life was going to be like because he is not with us any \nlonger, and his half-brother--who was initially in critical condition--\nhis life will be changed forever.\n  The funeral for Taijhon was especially poignant because for the \nfamily this was just the latest tragedy. Two of Taijhon's cousins, \nDallas and TJ, were also shot to death in New Haven. So in cities such \nas New Haven and Oakland, the misery is cascading because it is not \njust one death with family members of that immediate family affected, \nit is multiple brothers, it is brothers and cousins, it is entire \nfamilies being targeted and sometimes wiped out by this epidemic of gun \nviolence--an epidemic of gun violence that this body refuses to do \nanything about.\n  As you know, I try to come down to the floor every week, if I can, to \ngive some voices to the victims of gun violence, because if these \nstatistics will not move this place to action, maybe the stories of \nthose young men and women--but mainly young men who are dying all \nacross this country due to gun violence--maybe it is their stories that \nwill move us to take some action. I know we couldn't get the 60 votes \nrequired to pass an expansion of background checks in this Senate, but \nmaybe there is something else we can do.\n  Maybe we can lend more mental health resources to these cities that \nare struggling to keep up with these high rates of gun violence. Maybe \nwe can fix the existing background check system to ensure that the \nright records get loaded in and there is actual enforcement of gun \ndealers who aren't actually asking their customers to go through \nbackground checks. Maybe there is something we can do on a bipartisan \nbasis, but the reality is a lot of States are moving in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Recently there was a lot of attention on a piece of legislation that \npassed in Georgia. This bill was dubbed the most extreme gun bill in \nAmerica. It allowed people to carry weapons in bars, in government \nbuildings, in places of worship, in school safety zones, at school \nfunctions, on school-provided transportation, all apparently under the \ntheory that if we make enough guns available out in the public to both \ngood guys and bad guys, hopefully, through a process of gun control \nDarwinism, the good guys will eventually shoot the bad guys.\n  The problem is that is not how it works. All of the data and evidence \ntells us that exactly the opposite occurs when you flood a community \nwith guns and that more people die, not less. We don't know all of the \nreasons why a 19-year-old FedEx package handler walked into a facility \nin Kennesaw, GA, and injured six people before killing himself, but \nwhat we do know is that town has a law on the books that requires every \nsingle head of household to own a firearm. Kennesaw, GA, has a law on \nthe books requiring every head of household to own a firearm. That \ndidn't stop the episode of mass violence from happening inside of that \nFedEx facility. More guns does not equal safer communities in the end.\n  In my community of Newtown, Adam Lanza's mother had guns in the house \nbecause she thought it would help protect herself and her son who lived \nalone in the house. In the end it didn't help. It got her killed and it \ngot 20 people killed as well.\n  Think about what it would be like to be a 7-year-old girl waking in \nthe middle of the night, with your 2- and 4- and 5-year-old siblings \nstill sleeping in the house, and walking into the living room and \nfinding your mother and father dead. That is what happened just about 2 \nweeks ago in Memphis, TN, when a 7-year-old girl awoke to find that \nboth of her parents had been shot and killed in the living room. Three \nother kids were home at the time. The 7-year-old then called the police \nwho responded and identified the victims.\n  James Alexander, her father, was described as a landscaper and a \ngreat father. Her mother was described as athletic and very protective \nof her children. Her parents were junior high school sweethearts and \nthey had just married in February. One hundred people packed the corner \nFriday evening\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nin front of James and Danielle Alexander's home to remember the couple \n1 day after they were murdered.\n  A friend of the deceased said: ``It still doesn't feel real, I still \nfeel like they are just sitting in their house.''\n  Another family friend said:\n\n       I don't wish this on my worst enemy, but it has happened. \n     Now we have to look out for the kids.\n\n  That is the reality: parents gone in an instant, a brother and half \nbrother in 1 night in New Haven, CT, two sons of a mother in Oakland \ndying because of gunfire within 19 days. These are the voices of the \nvictims we are losing all across this country.\n  Maybe we don't have the votes to put together the big package that \nwill provide some comprehensive approach to gun violence, but maybe \nbetween now and the end of the year we can show these families, we can \nshow these communities that we can at least move forward a couple \ninches, a couple feet, to send a message that silence will no longer be \ninterpreted in these communities as complicity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2635-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Tonight we will be voting on the nomination of Justice \nMoritz, a nominee for the Tenth Circuit. During her legal career, \nJustice Moritz handled a wide variety of cases both in the private \nsector and while serving as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District \nof Kansas for over 9 years. She also served on the Kansas City Court of \nAppeals and is currently a Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. Justice \nMoritz has significant appellate experience, and I expect she will be \nconfirmed tonight.\n  Before we vote on that nominee, I wanted to update my colleagues on \nwhere the Senate stands in regard to judicial nominations. After \ntonight's vote we will have confirmed 243 of President Obama's district \ncourt and circuit court nominees. To put that in perspective, at this \npoint in President Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed 235 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees, 8 less than we have approved for \nPresident Obama.\n  During President Obama's second term and including tonight's \nnominees, we will have confirmed 72 of President Obama's district and \ncircuit court nominees. By comparison at this point in President Bush's \nsecond term, the Senate had confirmed only 32 district and circuit \ncourt nominees. So you can see a difference between 72 approvals for \nPresident Obama versus 32 approvals for President Bush in the second \nterm. Despite this record, it seems to me that no matter how many \njudges we confirm, the other side, along with some confused \ncommentators outside of the Senate, cannot help but complain about our \nprogress.\n  Last week one member from the Judiciary Committee accused Republicans \nof obstructing and slowing the nomination process through the \nPresident's entire term, but as I just pointed out, the Senate has \nconfirmed more of President Obama's judges than we had at this point \nduring President Bush's term. Another way to put it is all but two of \nPresident Obama's nominees have been approved, so that is a 99-plus \npercent approval. These complaints just do not ring true.\n  Even the Washington Post, which was never a friend of George W. Bush, \nnow recognizes how well President Obama is doing on judges. A recent \narticle entitled, ``Obama overtakes George W. Bush on judges \nconfirmed,'' noted that ``the Senate has confirmed more Obama nominees \nto the federal branch than were confirmed at this point in Bush's \nsecond term.''\n  The Washington Post has also conceded that President Obama's \nconfirmation rate essentially matches that of President Bush and \nPresident Clinton.\n  I also heard one of my colleagues complain about the President's \nvacancy rate, but the reason the vacancy rate is marginally higher than \nduring President Bush's term is because President Obama has simply had \nmore vacancies and more work to do in filling these vacancies during \nhis Presidency. There have been more judges retiring now than during \nthe last administration, which obviously creates more vacancies.\n  As you have heard me say many times on the floor of the Senate, we \ncannot deal with nominees until they come to the Senate. In other \nwords, the President has to do his work before we can do our work.\n  The bottom line is that we are confirming judges at the same rate. It \ntakes time to process and review each nominee who comes before us. This \nis simply the way the Senate works in its role to advise and consent on \njudicial nominees.\n  It isn't just lately that the Senate has worked its will in making \nsure these nominees are good ones to approve. That is the way it has \nbeen done for a long period of time. In other words, we simply don't \nhave the President submit somebody and bring it before the Senate. It \ntakes a lot of homework to make sure that not just their qualifications \nbut all the other evidence that comes from the White House is reviewed \nadequately.\n  So there is simply no basis to say Republicans are not giving this \nPresident fair treatment. In fact, just last week the Senate confirmed \nnine judges. That is the most judges confirmed in 1 week this entire \nCongress. In fact, we haven't confirmed nine judges in 1 week since \nDecember 2010, when we needed to vote on a Sunday to get nine judges \nconfirmed during 1 week.\n  So I take this time just to remind my colleagues of the excellent \nwork the Senate is doing on confirmations, and of course I do it to set \nthe record straight.\n  I congratulate tonight's nominee on her anticipated confirmation, a \nconfirmation for which I will vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2635-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Selfridge, of Minnesota, to be Chief of Protocol, \nand to have the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service.\n\n\n                       Vote on Moritz Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the Moritz nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote to confirm Nancy Moritz \nto fill a vacancy in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. \nNancy Moritz is currently a justice on the Kansas Supreme Court, where \nshe has been serving since 2011. She has the qualifications and has the \nsupport of her two Republican home State Senators, Mr. Pat Roberts and \nMr. Jerry Moran. She was also reported from the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously by voice vote this past January.\n  The Republicans continue to object to votes on all judicial \nnominations, even for completely noncontroversial nominees such as \nJustice Moritz. Cloture was finally invoked on Justice Moritz's \nnomination last week. There is no reason her nomination should have \nbeen filibustered given the bipartisan support that she has.\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\n  In fact, Justice Moritz should and could have been confirmed last \nyear. She was first nominated last August, but her hearing was delayed \nuntil mid-November because of the Republican shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. Senate Republicans then refused to vote on her nomination \nin committee at the end of last year and her nomination was returned to \nthe President. As a result, the President had to renominate Justice \nMoritz and the Judiciary Committee had to reprocess her nomination this \nyear. When we finally confirm Justice Moritz today, her nomination will \nhave taken more than 9 months. It should not take this long to process \nnoncontroversial nominees.\n  Justice Moritz has now served on the Kansas Supreme Court for nearly \n4 years. Prior to joining the Kansas Supreme Court, she was an \nappellate judge on the Kansas Court of Appeals from 2004 to 2011. \nBefore becoming a judge, she spent nearly 10 years as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Kansas City and Topeka offices. From 1989 until 1995, \nshe was an associate at Spencer, Fane Britt & Browne, LLP in Kansas \nCity and Overland Park. From 1987 to 1989, she served as a law clerk to \nthe Honorable Patrick F. Kelly, U.S. District Court for the District of \nKansas. Her breadth and depth of experience as both a practitioner and \na jurist will make her well suited to serve on the Tenth Circuit.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm this excellent \nnominee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time for debate is \nyielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Nancy L. Moritz, of Kansas, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Tenth District?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume legislation session.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 149\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass the \nStopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013.\n  Before we have another year--yet another year--of criminals stealing \nthe tax returns of millions of hardworking Americans, we need to pass \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Let me tell you from the start this is a bill that I introduced with \nSenator Sessions of Alabama. This is a bill that made it through the \nJudiciary Committee 18 to 0. After a number of amendments were \nconsidered and rejected, this bill made it through the Judiciary \nCommittee--in which there are many different people of ideological \nviews--18 to 0.\n  So what is this about? We have a problem in this country, and it is a \nproblem I think people would be very surprised about if they knew how \nmuch money it involved. Criminals are increasingly filing false tax \nreturns using stolen identity information in order to claim victims' \nrefunds.\n  What does this mean? How much money are we talking about?\n  In 2012 alone, identity thieves filed 1.8 million fraudulent tax \nreturns, almost double the number confirmed in 2011. The numbers in the \ndocuments in these cases may be forged, but the dollars behind them are \nreal.\n  In 2012, there were another 1.1 million fraudulent tax returns that \nslipped through the cracks, and our U.S. Treasury paid out--are you \nready for this--$3.6 billion in fraudulent returns, $3.6 billion at a \ntime when we have a debt. At a time when we are cutting programs and \ndoing everything we can to make the government more accountable, we \npaid out $3.6 billion in fraudulent returns. That is taxpayers' dollars \ngoing down the drain.\n  But when the criminals file these fake tax returns, it is not only \nthe Treasury that loses out. Everyday people are the real victims, \nforced to wait months--sometimes even years--before receiving the \nrefunds that are owed to them, and it can take years to fix the \nproblems when you have your identity stolen.\n  In 2012, Alan Stender, a retired businessman from the 5,000-person \ntown of Circle Pines, MN, was working to file his taxes on time, just \nas so many Americans did this past month. After completing all the \nforms and sending in his tax returns, Alan heard from the IRS that \nthere was a major problem. Someone had stolen his identity and used his \npersonal information to fraudulently file his return and steal his tax \nrefund.\n  Last month, 25 people were arrested in Florida for using thousands of \nstolen identities to claim $36 million in fraudulent tax refunds. This \nincluded the arrest of a middle-school food service worker who stole \nthe identities of more than 400 students. Those victims are just kids. \nYet criminals are stealing their identities to get fake tax returns.\n  Attorney General of the United States of America Eric Holder had his \ntax ID stolen. Two young adults used his name, date of birth, and \nSocial Security number to file a fraudulent tax return. They got caught \nand they got prosecuted. But when our own Attorney General of the \nUnited States is a victim of tax fraud--people stealing his identity--I \nthink it is time to admit we have a problem. From a retired man in \nMinnesota, to middle-school students\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nin Florida, to the Attorney General of the United States, it is clear \nidentity theft can happen to anyone.\n  We also know this crime can victimize our most vulnerable citizens--\nseniors living on fixed incomes or people with disabilities depending \non tax returns to make ends meet. These people cannot financially \nmanage having their tax returns stolen. There is a lot at stake here, \nand bipartisan action is needed. That is why I put forward this \nbipartisan piece of legislation along with Republican Senator Jeff \nSessions to take on this problem and crack down on the criminals who \nare committing this crime.\n  The critical legislation--which, by the way, has a similar version \nthat passed in the House last year--will take important steps to \nstreamline law enforcement resources and strengthen penalties for tax \nidentity theft. The STOP Identity Theft Act will direct the Justice \nDepartment to dedicate resources to address tax identity theft. It \ndirects the Department to focus on parts of the country with especially \nhigh rates of tax return identity theft and boosts protections for \nvulnerable citizens such as seniors and veterans. We also urge the \nJustice Department to cooperate fully and coordinate in investigations \nwith State and local law enforcement agencies.\n  Identity thieves have become more creative and have expanded from \nstealing the identities of individuals to stealing that of businesses \nand organizations. My bill recognizes this change and broadens the \ndefinition of tax identity theft to include businesses, nonprofits, and \nother similar organizations. This is something that came to us from law \nenforcement. This is a bill that passed through the Judiciary Committee \nof the Senate--not an easy journey--18 to 0.\n  Finally, we need to crack down on the criminals committing this \ncrime. The bill would strengthen penalties from tax identity theft by \nraising the jail sentence. I believe this bill would go a long way in \nhelping law enforcement use their resources to more efficiently and \neffectively go after these crimes. It is time to pass it through the \nSenate. As I said, it passed through the House of Representatives.\n  In recent weeks, we have made significant progress by passing this \nbill out of, as I said, the Senate Judiciary Committee. I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. We had votes on amendments in \nthe Judiciary Committee, which some may hear about soon, that were \nrejected but were heard out. We had very good discussions and \narguments, and I believe that is why I got the support of the people \nwho were putting those amendments forward. Senator Hatch himself said \none of those amendments belonged in the Finance Committee. In any case, \nwe came together in the Judiciary Committee, voted for this bill 18 to \n0, and it is now time to get it through the Senate.\n  With an 18-to-0 vote, I should have been able to bring this bill to \nthe full Senate, but I know my colleague from Texas has some concerns, \neven though he is on the record supporting this bill in committee. The \ntime is now to pass this bipartisan piece of legislation to crack down \non identity thieves and protect the hard-earned tax dollars of innocent \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 316, S. 149, the STOP Identity Theft Act, \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2066 and S. 2067\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I commend my \nfriend from Minnesota for her very good bill. This bill is good policy. \nIt is supported by both Democrats and Republicans, as she noted. It \npassed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. I was proud to vote \nfor this piece of legislation.\n  However, at the time the Judiciary Committee took up the bill it also \nconsidered amendments--in particular, two amendments I introduced that \nare both relevant and germane to this bill. This bill is addressing the \nIRS. We have seen in the past year abuses from the IRS that sadly this \nbody--the Senate--has been unwilling to address.\n  It has been the practice under the current majority leader to prevent \nthe minority from introducing amendments, preventing the minority from \nhaving a voice, and so the only avenue for the minority to have a voice \nis to use tools such as denying consent to try to raise issues that are \nrelevant to the American people.\n  When it comes to the IRS targeting of individual citizens, it was \nroughly 10 months ago the Inspector General at the Department of the \nTreasury concluded the IRS had wrongfully targeted conservative groups, \ntea party groups, pro-Israel groups, and pro-life groups. The day that \nnews broke, the President of the United States said he was outraged. He \nsaid he was angry, and he said the American people have a right to be \nangry. That same day Attorney General of the United States Eric Holder \nsaid he too was outraged and, indeed, the President pledged to work \nhand in hand with Congress.\n  Ten months have passed, and in the 10 months that have passed we have \ndiscovered not a single person has been indicted. In the 10 months that \nhave passed, many of the victims of this illegal targeting have not \neven been interviewed by the Department of Justice. In the 10 months \nthat have passed, we have discovered that one of the lead lawyers \nleading the investigation at the Department of Justice is a major Obama \ndonor who gave over $6,000 personally to support President Obama and \nthe Democrats. In the 10 months that have transpired, Attorney General \nEric Holder has turned down my request that he demonstrate the same \nimpartiality, the same fidelity to the law that has been a bipartisan \ntradition for Attorneys General under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n\n  Indeed, as I pointed out to the Attorney General, when credible \nallegations of wrongdoing against Richard Nixon arose, his Attorney \nGeneral Elliott Richardson, a Republican, appointed Archibald Cox to \ninvestigate those allegations, free of political pressure. Likewise, \nwhen credible allegations of wrongdoing against Bill Clinton arose, his \nAttorney General, a Democrat, Janet Reno, appointed Robert Fiske as an \nIndependent Counsel to get to the bottom of it.\n  Sadly, when I asked Eric Holder if he was willing to follow that same \ntradition of impartiality, of independence, of fidelity to law, of \ninsulating the Department of Justice from political pressure, the \nAttorney General gave a flat-out answer of no. He was perfectly \ncontent; he saw no reason why anyone should doubt the integrity of an \ninvestigation led by a major Obama donor.\n  As I asked the Attorney General, Would you trust John Mitchell to \ninvestigate Richard Nixon? Of course you wouldn't. So it is in the \ncontext of this abuse of power--this abuse of power of the \nadministration--that rather than working hand in hand as the President \nhas pledged, they have stonewalled it--that I introduced two \namendments.\n  The first amendment was simply to make it a criminal offense for an \nIRS employee to target people based on their political beliefs. I will \nnote the text of the language I introduced made it a criminal offense \nto willfully act with the intent to injure, oppress, threaten, \nintimidate, or single out for the purpose of harassment any person \nbased solely on the political, economic, or social positions held or \nexpressed by that person or organization.\n  When the IRS targeting was revealed, it was condemned in bipartisan \nlanguage. If that language was real, this provision should pass this \nbody unanimously. To make the law reflect that it is criminal for the \nIRS to willfully target someone based solely on their political beliefs \nought to be a proposition that passes this body 100 to 0. Yet I am \nsorry to say that when I introduced this amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee it was voted down on a straight party-line vote. Every \nDemocrat who had given speeches against the IRS targeting, when given \nthe opportunity to actually codify a prohibition against it in \ncommittee, voted against it.\n  Likewise, the second amendment I introduced was an amendment to stop \nthe IRS from its attempt at codification of this persecution of \npolitical views. The IRS promulgated new rules that would have put in \nplace its targeting of political views. The response\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nfrom the citizenry was record-setting. Indeed, I would note what the \nACLU said about the IRS's proposed rules. The ACLU--not exactly a \nbastion of rightwing thought--said:\n\n       The proposed rule threatens to discourage or sterilize an \n     enormous amount of political discourse in America.\n\n  The ACLU went on to say:\n\n       Most social welfare organizations--on both the left and \n     right--serve exactly that function as they see it--the \n     promotion of social welfare and community good. Based on \n     their respective visions, they advocate for the powerless and \n     the voiceless. They promote fiscal responsibility and good \n     government. They serve as a check on government overreach, or \n     as a cheerleader for sound public policy.\n\n  I can say in this respect that I agree emphatically and \nwholeheartedly with the ACLU. So I while I am perfectly happy to assent \nto the bill of my friend from Minnesota, if only the same reciprocal \ncourtesy will be so and the remainder of the body will assent to these \ncommonsense bills that make it a criminal offense to willfully target \npeople based on their political views, and that keep the IRS out of the \nbusiness of persecuting people for their political views.\n  I ask this body to stand with the ACLU. I ask this body to stand with \nthe words of President Obama, if not the actions. I ask this body to \nstand with the American people to protect them from being wrongfully \nsingled out by the abuse of power in the IRS.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 311, S. 2066, \nand Calendar No. 312, S. 2067 en bloc; I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the bills be read a third time and passed, and that the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the bill I put out on the floor is a \nbipartisan bill. It is a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee 18 to 0. It is a bill that last Congress passed \nunder suspension in the House with the support of Republican \nRepresentative Lamar Smith and got through the House of \nRepresentatives. The House of Representatives, which tends to sometimes \nbe a rather partisan place, was able to pass that bill. We cannot let \nthis bill, when we are bleeding $3.6 billion in fraudulent tax return \npayments, die on the floor because my friend from Texas is trying again \nto put on these amendments.\n  I have no problem in having this amendment come up through the \nFinance Committee. By the way, Senator Hatch, the ranking Republican on \nthe Finance Committee, said on the record during the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing that S. 2067 should be considered first by the \nFinance Committee; that it was in the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. \nYes, he voted for it in the end, but that is what he said. That is why \nthis was problematic, and that amendment failed. We had a full \ndiscussion about this amendment.\n  In addition, there is a rulemaking on this issue, with 76,000 \ncomments before the IRS. That is the issue.\n\n  As for the other amendment that my friend from Texas has put out \nthere as 2066, also considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, also \ndebated in the Judiciary Committee--we didn't close off the amendment. \nWe had an amendment, we had a discussion, and that amendment failed by \n10 to 8.\n  There are several laws, as we know, that are already on the books \nthat could be useful in this case, and there may be further discussion \nof this in the future. But this bill has nothing to do with that. Just \nbecause it has the word ``tax'' in it doesn't mean it has anything to \ndo with the IRS employees and the amendments that my friend from Texas \nput forward.\n  What is this bill about? This bill is about how, in 2012, identity \nthieves filed 1.8 million fraudulent tax returns, almost double the \nnumber confirmed in 2011. That is 1.8 million Americans having their \ntax ID stolen in 2012. There were another 1.1 million that slipped \nthrough the cracks, and our own U.S. Treasury is paying out $3.6 \nbillion from fraudulent returns.\n  Our own Attorney General of the United States of America had his tax \nID number stolen. If Eric Holder can have his tax ID number stolen--and \nthey were able to catch the guy and prosecute him--what happens to the \npoor guy in Minnesota. That guy wasn't caught. What happens to the \npeople that have their tax ID stolen and then they take years to be \nable to get back their identity.\n  This is why this bill went through the House of Representatives \nwithout messing around with these amendments. This is why this bill \nwent through the Judiciary Committee, where we had the discussion and \nthe votes on amendments.\n  All I am trying to do is take this 18-to-0 Judiciary vote--which I \nwas very pleased that the Senator from Texas supported in the Judiciary \nCommittee and said good words about this bill--all I am trying to do is \nto get this bill passed, instead of having a debate about an amendment \nthat clearly should have gone through the Finance Committee, as stated \nby the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee.\n  It is time to get this bill passed. That is why I object to the \namendments raised by the Senator from Texas and ask that this bill be \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Minnesota?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nnote very briefly to my friend from Minnesota that her bill is good \npolicy. It is policy on which I hope this body can come together.\n  I will note a path forward. If my friend from Minnesota can prevail \non the majority leader simply to allow a vote on the Senate floor on \nthe two amendments I have introduced, then I will withdraw my \nobjection. The reason I have to make this request is, under this \nmajority leader, the minority of this Chamber is shut out of the \nability even to have votes. I would note this request is less than what \nI asked in my unanimous consent. It is not a request to pass. It is \nsimply a request that there be a vote, and if there is a vote, that \ngives an opportunity for every Member of this Chamber--Republican and \nDemocrat--to go on record and to see if every Democrat in this Chamber \nis willing to do what every Democrat in the Judiciary Committee did, \nwhich is vote affirmatively against making it an offense for IRS \nemployees to willfully target Americans based on their political views.\n  Any Democrat who votes that way can no longer stand and say they are \nupset about the IRS's abuse of power because once you voted against \nprohibiting, you have made clear that you are unwilling to do anything \nto protect the American people.\n  The requests from the Republican side to the majority leader to have \nvotes scheduled fall on deaf ears. Perhaps my friend from Minnesota \nwill have more sway with her party's leaders than we will. But in the \ninterim, we are obliged to use whatever tools we can to press for the \nAmerican people, to stop the abuse of power that is stifling their \nFirst Amendment rights. For that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to urge my colleagues \nto support the energy legislation we hope to bring to the floor this \nweek. We are still working through some of the possible amendments on \nthat, as well.\n  This is good legislation that has been on the floor before. Actually, \nabout 6 months ago we took this up on the Senate floor. Since that time \nwe have actually added about 10 bipartisan amendments to the bill, \nmaking it even stronger.\n  But it is a bill that is good for jobs. It is good for American \nenergy security and therefore good for our national security. It is \ngood because it is going to save taxpayers a lot of money, and it is \nalso good because it is a bill that actually helps to grow the economy \nwhile improving the environment.\n  I have been working on this bill for about 3 years now with Senator \nShaheen from New Hampshire. We also have other cosponsors on both sides \nof\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nthe aisle--6 Republicans and 6 Democrats--who have been part of this \nprocess. We hope to be able to get this legislation on the floor this \nweek because it is a good bill and it deserves to be passed.\n  When we have come to the floor before and we have talked about it, we \nhave talked about the fact that it helps manufacturers in Ohio and \naround the country to take advantage of energy savings techniques and \nthe best technology, allowing them to save more money so they can \ninvest more in plants and equipment and in people, adding more jobs. \nThat is why, by the way, over 270 businesses and business \norganizations--from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers--and a lot of other trade groups on both \nsides of the political spectrum--have endorsed this legislation.\n  We have also come to the floor and talked about how provisions in \nthis legislation will save the equivalent of taking 80 million homes \noff the grid by the year 2030--a cumulative energy savings, by the way, \nof up to $100 billion. It is called the Energy Security and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. Again, it makes a lot of sense.\n  We talk about how taxpayer dollars will be saved because we require \nthe Federal Government to practice what it preaches; in other words, to \nmake the Federal Government, the largest energy user in the United \nStates, much more efficient in its own energy practices.\n  The time for talking about this legislation, however, has gone. It is \nnow time to pass it. When we do, we can then work with the other body--\nthe House of Representatives--because they have already passed \nsignificant parts of our legislation earlier this year. We can bring \ntogether the legislation we would pass here on the floor with the House \nlegislation and send it to the President for signature.\n  At a time when people are understandably concerned about the partisan \ngridlock here in the Senate, and in Washington in general, this is an \nexample of something we can actually get done. Again, it has been \nbipartisan from the start. It came out of the committee with a big \nvote--18 to 3. It is one to which we have added more bipartisan support \nover the last 6 months by adding more amendments.\n  Let's do something that will actually surprise the American people. \nLet's do something that will help move our country forward, create more \njobs, help the environment be cleaner, also helping our energy security \nand therefore our national security, and saving taxpayers a lot of \nmoney.\n  Some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are skeptical of any \nenergy legislation they have seen in the past, that this Senate and the \nCongress have passed some proposals that are top-down proposals that \nimpose mandates on the American people. They have also seen costly \nlegislation that funnels subsidies to preferred industries, companies, \ntechnologies, distorting the market and ending up in what have \nsometimes been some very expensive failures. That is not this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation on energy efficiency contains no mandates. The bill \nis about giving people access to information they can use, not about \nmaking the American people or businesses do something.\n  Not only does it have no mandates, but it does not add to our \ndeficits. Every authorization contained in this bill is fully offset by \nsavings elsewhere in the budget. In fact, the reforms made in this \nlegislation will save taxpayers a lot of money.\n  Some of it can be scored. There is a $10 million savings, for \ninstance, on the mandatory side by some of the legislative changes we \nare making. A lot of it won't get a score because it is additional \nsavings we will see by having the Federal Government be much more \nenergy efficient, which saves money for us all as taxpayers.\n  Unlike some of these previous energy initiatives which were costly \nand I think inappropriate, this legislation relies on the market and on \nthe States--not the Federal Government--to drive efficiency \nimprovements.\n  There is a reason this legislation received this strong vote out of \nthe energy committee, 19 to 3. It has been improved since then with the \naddition of these 10 bipartisan amendments. It is going to create new \njobs, it is going to save money for the taxpayers, and it is going to \nhelp with regard to the environment.\n  By the way, our economy is going to be helped because we rely on \naffordable and reliable energy in this country. It is our \nresponsibility to do everything in our power to secure more affordable \nand more reliable energy by adopting what a lot of people talk about is \nan all-of-the-above energy strategy.\n  To me, that means producing more energy--yes, including oil and \nnatural gas. In my own State of Ohio, we have a great opportunity \nthere. It also includes being sure that we are using the coal resources \nwe have, nuclear power, and renewables. We should be making it easier \nto take advantage of these resources and to bring more of these \nresources to market at lower costs.\n  But at the same time, we should be taking steps to reduce waste. This \nis complementary. This is not something that should be either you are \nfor producing more energy or you are for more energy efficiency. We \nshould be for both. We should be producing more and using less. That \nhelps grow the economy, create jobs, and makes us more competitive in \nthe global economy in which we find ourselves.\n  Energy efficiency, by the way, of all those energy sources, is the \nlowest-hanging fruit. Think about it. It is the least expensive form of \nenergy--the energy we don't end up having to use.\n  I think this is a commonsense approach which should be able to be \ndebated on the floor in an honest way, with other energy-related \namendments; and then, after that process, to pass it here in the \nSenate, get it over to the House, work on a compromise with the House \nwith their legislation and our legislation, get it to the President for \nsignature, and actually move on with an opportunity to truly begin the \nprocess of putting in place a national strategy that has this all-of-\nthe-above approach--producing more and using less.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues this week on engaging in \nthis debate, passing this legislation, and helping the constituents \nwhom we represent on issues that are important to them--jobs, saving \ntaxpayer money, making the environment cleaner, ensuring that America \nhas a secure energy future, which is important to our national \nsecurity.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Terry Gainer, the Senate's skilled and \nenergetic Sergeant At Arms, is leaving the Senate family, after 8 years \nof devoted service to the Senate and the Nation in this vital role.\n  Overseeing the Senate's largest administrative office, Terry Gainer \nhas led during a difficult time of change, as the Senate has continued \nto adjust to a wide range of challenges, from burgeoning technology, to \nbudget squeezes, to the shadowy threat of terrorism. I have watched the \nway he has handled these duties, and I have admired not only his talent \nand ability but also the style of his leadership. He has been a credit \nto this body.\n  Terry Gainer is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war. He was a \ncaptain in the U.S. Navy Reserve, and he went on to serve as an \naccomplished law enforcement officer.\n  Appointed to the post of Sergeant At Arms in 2006, Mr. Gainer came to \nthe Senate with an admirable record of public service. He cut his teeth \nas a homicide detective on the streets of Chicago, and while working on \nthe Chicago force he earned both a master's and a law degree. From \nthere, he rose\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nthrough the ranks to be appointed as director of the Illinois State \nPolice.\n  In 2002, he assumed the role of chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. It \nwas just a few, short years later, when the Senate was attacked with \nricin poison, that Terry Gainer's calm disposition, professionalism, \nand experience guided the Senate through a malicious act of terrorism.\n  Chief Gainer then carried over this experience as he took on his new \nrole as the 38th U.S. Senate Sergeant At Arms. Frequently described as \na jack-of-all-trades, he fit right in. From overseeing security, to \nescorting foreign dignitaries, and leading the largest administrative \noffice in the Senate, Terry Gainer was a valued leader and a trusted \npresence within the Senate family.\n  As he returns to the private sector, Marcelle and I offer Terry, his \nwife Irene, and the Gainer family our thanks and all best wishes in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2640-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WASHINGTON ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention \nto the work of the Washington Electric Cooperative, which provides \npower and electricity to thousands of Vermonters, including to Marcelle \nand me at our home in Middlesex. This year the co-op, as it is better \nknown to Vermonters, celebrates its 75th anniversary. The co-op formed \nin the midst of the rural electrification movement of the 1930s. On \nDecember 2, 1939, my predecessor in the Senate, then-Vermont Governor \nGeorge Aiken, flipped the switch that brought electricity to 150 farms. \nI doubt that anyone could have imagined back then that the co-op would \ngrow to serve the 11,000 members it serves today, covering about 2800 \nsquare miles in parts of 41 towns in north-central Vermont.\n  The Washington Electric Co-Op has indeed grown, from the setting of \nthe first poles on the McKnight Farm in East Montpelier, to operating \n1200 miles of distribution lines with eight substations today. I am \nproud of the Washington Electric Co-Op, both as a customer and as a \nVermonter.\n  In honor of this important occasion, I ask that the article ``How the \nWashington Electric Co-op Began'' from the 1964 Washington Electric Co-\nop annual meeting be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                How the Washington Electric Co-Op Began\n\n\n (Reminiscence by a Co-op member printed in the 1964 WEC Annual Report)\n\n       One July day Harmon Kelly called on Lorie and Elizabeth \n     Tarshis to suggest their writing to Washington to ask about \n     rural electricity. Raymond Ebbett and Lyle Young met with \n     them. They decided to try to form an REA Co-op. Meetings \n     followed in people's living rooms. On July 14th the first \n     public meeting, conducted by Harmon Kelly, was held in the \n     Grange Hall, Maple Corner. It had been hard to get people to \n     come. Meetings had been held before about getting Green \n     Mountain Power and had always ended in disappointment. As Mr. \n     Kelly talked, people became optimistic and began to suggest \n     sources of water power. We even considered the radical idea \n     of a diesel engine. Several strangers sat listening in the \n     dark shadows at the back of the lamp lit hall. One made a \n     long rambling speech against socialistic schemes ending: \n     ``And you'll have to admit I told you.''\n       We found out who our visitors were when they went to the \n     owners of the best farms and promised them Green Mountain \n     Power within three weeks if they would ``give up this \n     nonsense.'' Harmon Kelly was told to give it up or lose his \n     job. Neither bribes nor threats worked. On July 29th the REA \n     Co-op was formed with Harmon Kelly, Lyle Young, and Elizabeth \n     Kent Tarshis as incorporators.\n       My diary for October 7th 1939 reads: ``Autumn color \n     splendid. Electricity booming. Stakes set to mark where poles \n     will be.'' On October 12th, the first pole was set on the \n     McKnight farm in East Montpelier. I remember it, well braced, \n     standing black against a cold sky with bright leaves whirling \n     in the wind and a man from Washington saying: ``You folks \n     don't know what you've started. I wouldn't be surprised if \n     you had a thousand members some day.'' The first hundred \n     looked at each other in disbelief. No one imagined there \n     would be more than three thousand in 1964.\n       On a May night in 1940, for the first time since the power \n     was turned on, I drove along the County Road. In houses, dark \n     last year or with lamps dimly burning, every window was a \n     blaze of light. There was music everywhere--cows listening to \n     records, housewives to radios. I stopped, found one friend \n     happily running a new vacuum cleaner over an already \n     immaculate rug. I hurried on to my own dark house and turned \n     on every one of our new 100 watt bulbs. The miracle had come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2640-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2640-S2643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUDGET COMMITTEE SUBMISSIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 passed \nin December not only provided relief to families and the economy from \nthe harmful effects of sequestration but also put an end to the recent \nfiscal crises and uncertainty by establishing a bipartisan \ncongressional budget for 2 years. Specifically, the act authorizes the \nchairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees to file allocations, \naggregates, levels, and other enforcement mechanisms in the Senate and \nthe House for budget years 2014 and 2015.\n  On January 15, I filed the first of the two budgets in the Senate for \nfiscal year 2014. Today, pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2013, I am filing the budget in the Senate for fiscal \nyear 2015. Specifically, for the purpose of enforcing the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, section 116 directs the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to file: allocations for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for the \nCommittee on Appropriations; allocations for fiscal years 2014, 2015, \n2015 through 2019, and 2015 through 2024 for committees other than the \nCommittee on Appropriations; aggregate spending levels for fiscal year \n2014 and 2015; aggregate revenue levels for fiscal years 2014, 2015, \n2015 through 2019, and 2015 through 2024; and aggregate levels of \noutlays and revenue for fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2015 through 2019, and \n2015 through 2024 for Social Security. That authority to file \nallocations, aggregates, levels, and other enforcement tools exists \nfrom April 15 through May 15.\n  In the case of the Committee on Appropriations for 2014 and 2015, the \nallocation shall be set consistent with the discretionary spending \nlimits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which imposes limits \nonly on the amount of budget authority and divides those limits on \nbudget authority between the revised security category and the revised \nnonsecurity category.\n  In the case of allocations for committees other than the Committee on \nAppropriations and for the revenue and Social Security aggregates, the \nlevels shall be set consistent with the most recent baseline of the \nCongressional Budget Office. The CBO last updated its baseline on April \n14, 2014.\n  In the case of the spending aggregates for 2014 and 2015, the levels \nshall be set in accordance with the allocation for the Committee on \nAppropriations and the allocations for committees other than the \nCommittee on Appropriations, as described previously.\n  Pursuant to section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \nthe allocations to the Committee on Appropriations and the spending \naggregates can be revised for certain adjustments specifically \nauthorized by section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985. The authorized changes include adjustments for \noverseas contingency operations and the global war on terrorism, \ndisaster funding, emergency appropriations, and program integrity \ninitiatives in the areas of continuing disability reviews and \nredeterminations and health care fraud and abuse control. These \nadjustments will be made after the reporting of a bill or joint \nresolution or the offering of an amendment thereto or the submission of \na conference report thereon that includes language that qualifies for \none or more of the authorized adjustments.\n  In addition, section 116(c) of the Bipartisan Budget Act authorizes \nthe filing for fiscal year 2015 of deficit-neutral reserve funds \nincluded in sections 114(c) and (d) of the act, updated by 1 year to \nmatch the new enforcement windows. Accordingly, I am hereby filing and \nupdating by 1 year each of the reserve funds included in sections \n114(c) and (d) of the Bipartisan Budget Act. The reserve funds are \nupdated to cover the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through \n2024 in the case of the reserve fund authorized in section 114(c) and \nthe period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2019 and the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2024 in the case of \nthe reserve funds authorized in section 114(d). In the case of section \n114(d), the reserve funds filed and updated here include sections 302,\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\n303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, \n317, 318, 319, 320, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, \n332, 333, 334, 335, 338, 339, 340, 341, 344, 348, 349, 350, 353, 354, \n356, 361, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 371, 376, 378, 379, and \n383 of S. Con. Res. 8 (113th Congress), as passed by the Senate.\n  Section 114(a) directs the chairman of the Budget Committee also to \nreset the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. \nPursuant to section 114(a), I am notifying the Senate and including the \nrevised scorecard as part of the submission on revised enforcement for \nbudget year 2015.\n  Finally, section 112 of the Bipartisan Budget Act establishes a point \nof order in the Senate against appropriations bills that provide \nadvance appropriations. That act includes limited exceptions to this \nprohibition including up to $28.852 billion in advance appropriations \nfor programs, projects, activities, or accounts included in a statement \nsubmitted by the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Congressional \nRecord.

LEVIN. Mr. President, listening to your doctor is just common \nsense. That is why it is important for Congress to take note that this \nApril, the American College of Physicians, ACP, our Nation's largest \nmedical-specialty organization and second largest physician group, \nreleased an important diagnosis: that our Nation is trapped in an \nepidemic of gun violence. Fortunately, it also includes a treatment: a \nset of policy positions and recommendations to reduce gun violence in \nour country.\n  The ACP report begins with recognition that ``firearm violence is not \nonly a criminal justice issue but also a public health threat.'' The \nstatistics are undeniable: Guns kill over 32,000 individuals in our \nNation every year--about 88 lives stolen, every day. But those are only \nthe fatal shootings; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nhave estimated that more than 73,000 nonfatal firearm injuries occur in \nthe United States every year. And what is a ``nonfatal'' injury? \nAnything from a bullet grazing someone's shoulder, to a domestic abuser \ntaking aim at a spouse's heart and striking the arm, to a child \naccidentally shooting him or herself in the stomach and barely \nsurviving. ``Nonfatal'' gun injuries may evade the first sad statistic, \nbut they can be devastating all the same. These statistics also belie \nthe collateral damage the families, friends and communities shattered \nby a pull of the trigger.\n  The ACP report surveyed the highly trained and clinically minded \ninternists whom we entrust with our health and well-being, along with \nthat of our families, children and communities. Direct experience with \nthe problem was widespread, with 63 percent of surveyed internists \nreporting having had patients who were injured or given fatal wounds by \na gun. Other results showed overwhelming consensus: that 85 percent of \nsurveyed internists believe firearm injuries are a public health issue; \n95 percent support mandatory background checks on all firearm \npurchases; 86 percent support a ban on military-style assault weapons; \n85 percent support a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines; and 86 \npercent support the creation of requirements that all firearms include \nchild-proof safety features. 76 percent of respondents agreed that gun \nsafety legislation would ``help to reduce the risk for gun related \ninjuries or deaths.''\n  Responding to this consensus, the ACP report includes several \nrecommendations to reduce gun violence in our society. It argues that \nall gun sales should be ``subject to satisfactory completion of a \ncriminal background check,'' and supports enactment of ``a universal \nbackground check system to keep guns out of the hands'' of dangerous \nindividuals. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in this Congress \nthat would do just that.\n  It also supports the ``enactment of legislation to ban the sale and \nmanufacture for civilian use of firearms that have features designed to \nincrease their rapid killing capacity (often called assault \nweapons.')'' Legislation pending in this Congress would also accomplish \nthat goal.\n  In addition, the report argues for ``strong penalties and criminal \nprosecution for those who sell firearms illegally and those who legally \npurchase firearms for those who are banned from possession of them''--\nso called ``straw'' purchases. And yes, there is legislation pending in \nthis Congress to do that too.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's medical community agrees with our law \nenforcement community, and the 90 percent of Americans who support \nsensible gun safety reforms. I urge my colleagues to listen to these \nimportant voices and to pass the commonsense pieces of legislation \nalready pending before this body. The cost of inaction is just too \nhigh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2643-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2643-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                DATA ACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues in \nthe Senate and House for coming together last month to pass the Digital \nAccountability and Transparency Act of 2014, which is known as the DATA \nAct. The measure enjoyed near unanimous support in both bodies, and I \nexpect President Obama to sign the DATA Act into law shortly.\n  This legislation seeks to ensure that Federal agencies have a \nframework in place to standardize their financial data, and will better \nensure that expenditure data for all of our agencies is accessible to \ntaxpayers and Congress. This will represent an important step toward a \nmore transparent and responsive government.\n  Passage of the DATA Act, though, is merely the first step towards \nimproving transparency into how the Federal Government spends taxpayer \ndollars. Now comes the hard part--implementation. I know that Federal \nagencies and the Office of Management and Budget will face challenges \nin implementing the bill. To that effect, I have received a letter from \nBeth Cobert, the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of \nManagement and Budget, expressing concern about implementing the bill \nwithout additional resources.\n  As with any legislation, our job does not end when the President \nsigns the bill. I believe that those of us here in Congress have the \nresponsibility to work with the administration to ensure that laws--\nsuch as the DATA Act--that we enact have the support they need to be \nimplemented. That is why I will work with my colleagues on the \nAppropriations committees to help make sure Federal agencies have the \nresources they need to meet the requirements of the bill. I invite my \ncolleagues who worked so hard to pass this legislation to join me in \nthis continuing effort.\n  With that being said, I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Cobert's \nletter be printed in the Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC., May 1, 2014.\n     Hon. Thomas R. Carper,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Carper: The Administration recognizes and \n     appreciates your commitment to Government transparency and \n     accountability, and appreciates the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Government Affairs' leadership on these issues.\n       The Administration supports the objectives of the Digital \n     Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) which \n     would establish Government-wide data\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n     standards for financial data and assist in making Government-\n     wide spending more accessible. The Administration appreciates \n     the bill's support for establishing data standards and we \n     additionally appreciate the bill's statement of confidence in \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department \n     of Treasury (Treasury). The Administration is currently \n     working to improve Federal spending transparency. For \n     example, we will soon roll-out a refreshed USAspending.gov \n     with better search capabilities and functionality to \n     manipulate the data and issue guidance to improve \n     USAspending.gov's data quality. Additionally, we completed \n     the transition of USAspending.gov to the Department of \n     Treasury to take advantage of its core functions on agency \n     financial reporting and ongoing work with other initiatives \n     related to transparency in Federal spending.\n       To implement the legislation, Executive branch agencies \n     will need to work to redesign the structure of existing \n     financial systems, adopt new data standards, and review \n     future budgetary requests to ensure compliance with the new \n     definitions. However, the legislation does not provide funds \n     to OMB, Treasury, or any agency to develop and implement new \n     data standards under the timeframes prescribed. Without \n     specific appropriations, this bill's requirements would \n     require that agencies either divert agency resources from \n     other mission critical activities, or implement requirements \n     based on current funding and the timeframes that permits.\n       Also, the bill requires agencies to report information by \n     ``program activities.'' The FY 2015 President's Budget \n     includes 1,275 executive budget accounts that track Federal \n     agencies' spending. Currently, Executive Branch agencies' \n     Federal financial systems are not designed to report by \n     ``program activity'' as defined by the legislation. ``Program \n     activities'' can and do change from year to year as a result \n     of Congressional or other action. To avoid public reporting \n     of information that is incomplete or potentially inaccurate, \n     Executive Branch agencies will implement these requirements \n     initially through reporting at the budget account level. We \n     commit to implement the statute by working on efforts to \n     report below the budget account level in a manner that \n     clearly links to the spending data in agency financial \n     systems. We share a common goal with data transparency, \n     however, OMB needs to ensure that our approach considers the \n     realities of the funding environment and reflects how funds \n     are currently tracked through the budget process and in \n     agency financial systems.\n       We look forward to working with you to pursue our shared \n     goal of improving Federal spending transparency.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Beth Cobert,\n\n                                   Deputy Director for Management,\n     Office of Management and Budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2644-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SCRIPPS FLORIDA INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize an important meeting \ntaking place this week at the Scripps Research Institute in my home \nState of Florida that coincides with Older Americans Month. Leaders in \nthe field of aging and medical research are gathering at this \ninternationally renowned research facility to discuss their latest \nresearch at a symposium, the first of its kind, entitled, ``Therapeutic \nApproaches for Extending Healthspan: The Next 10 Years.''\n  Headquartered in California, the Scripps Institute has long been \nrecognized as a leader in biomedical sciences. Establishing an \nadditional Scripps research facility in Florida in 2009 represents an \nextension of this tradition of world-class research excellence to our \nState. Scripps Florida is working on finding answers to some of the \nmost critical biomedical questions that confront us today through six \nacademic departments targeting the areas of cancer biology, chemistry, \ninfectious diseases, molecular therapeutics, neuroscience, and the \nrelationship between metabolism and aging. Hopefully, this symposium \nwill lead to a series of gatherings where experts can forge \ncollaborative partnerships and work toward improving the quality of \nlife for aging adults.\n  Over the past decade, Scripps has advanced existing knowledge on \naging-related diseases such as blindness, atherosclerosis, deafness, \nand amyloid diseases that cause Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and \nHuntington's Diseases, among others. This forum will focus on novel \nresearch in the field of aging and establish a path for research into \nthe next decade. Though the field shows enormous promise for the \nfuture, barriers still exist in translating research into clinical \napplications. Experts participating in this symposium will discuss how \nto overcome these challenges to provide meaningful medical solutions \nfor our aging Nation.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am aware of \nthe daily challenges faced by many older Americans. Like the roundtable \nhosted by the Aging Committee last October to discuss the state of \naging research, I believe these opportunities to bring our Nation's \nbest scientists, physicians, and researchers together are essential if \nwe are going to conquer aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and \ndementia. As such, we must continue to support research that drives \ninnovation, advances current knowledge, and encourages collaboration \namong our Nation's greatest thinkers.\n  As the number of older Americans continues to grow, we must support \nresearch efforts that provide paths to treatment or prevention so our \nNation's seniors can enjoy living out their golden years with dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2644-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2644-S2645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ISAAC GREGGS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to ask my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the distinguished former Southern University Director of \nBands who passed on April 28, 2014, at the age of 85 in Baton Rouge, \nLA. Dr. Greggs was the third child born in Shreveport, LA on January \n22, 1929 to Sarah and Isaac Greggs. Dr. Greggs was baptized in the \nBethel Baptist Church in Frierson, LA and later joined the Mount \nPilgrim Baptist Church in Baton Rouge. He was a visionary, who created \nand led the Southern University Marching Band, affectionately known as \nthe Human Jukebox for 36 years.\n  Dr. Greggs graduated from Central Colored High School in Shreveport, \nLA and at 15 years of age enrolled in Southern University and A & M \nCollege in Baton Rouge, LA. where he received a B.S. in music \neducation. He received a M.S. in music education from Vander Cook \nCollege in Chicago, IL. Later, he entered the University of Peru to \ncomplete his doctorate degree in music. He was then drafted into the \nU.S. Army. His service in the Army was honored with and dedicated to \nplaying in the Army band, 4th Division, 4th Infantry, APO 39, and to \nplaying early morning reverie. While in Germany, he received the \nOccupational Medal.\n  After his return from service in the U.S. Army, he began teaching at \nJ. S. Clark Junior High School and Notre Dame High School in \nShreveport, LA. He and his family later moved to Baton Rouge, LA where \nhe taught and directed the band at the Southern University Laboratory \nSchool. During his tenure at Southern University, Dr. Greggs directed \ncountless future band directors, musicians, and myriad of industry \nleaders outside of music. He attracted thousands of students to \nSouthern, who were drawn as a result of his unmatched leadership and \nlyrical genius. Under his leadership, the Human Jukebox performed at \nsix Super Bowls, four Sugar Bowls and three Presidential inaugurations. \nHis grueling practices were well known throughout Louisiana and the \ndiscipline that Dr. Greggs instilled in his musicians produced \nexceptional results year end and year out. Dr. Greggs retired in 2005.\n  With pride, the State of Louisiana honored Dr. Greggs in 2013 by \ninducting the legendary band leader into the Louisiana Black History \nHall of Fame for his commitment to serving African American students \nfor nearly four decades. He was also the recipient of the Key of Life \nAward at the 31st NAACP Image Awards; an award created in honor of \nStevie Wonder and presented each year to a musician who embodies \nWonder's ``inner vision.''\n  Dr. Isaac Greggs was a true inspiration to all that had the great \nprivilege of knowing him. I am grateful and honored to have known him. \nHe will be greatly missed. My deepest condolences go out to his wife of \n58 years, Rose Audrey Metoyer Greggs; his children: Audree Greggs \nVaughn (Percy), Colette Greggs, Dedrick Jon Greggs (Carla), and Mark \nEric Greggs (Tricia); grandchildren: Kirsten Vaughn Watson (Benjamin), \nKory Greggs Vaughn MD, Jamal Greggs Russell, Kyle Greggs Russell, \nDaniel Isaac Greggs and Casey Daniel Greggs; great-grandchildren Grace \nMakayla Watson, Naomi Love Watson, Isaiah Benjamin Watson and Judah \nSeth Watson, and a host of other relatives, family and friends. He was \npreceded in death by his parents: Sarah and Isaac Greggs, brother \nEdmond and sister Ellen Greggs.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\n  His legacy could not end without, ``It's gonna be alright; just make \nit right.''\n  It is with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me along with Dr. Isaac Gregg's family in \nrecognizing the life and many accomplishments of this incredible \nmusician, leader, and mentor, as well as his lasting impact throughout \nthe Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2645-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           SIOUX COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Sioux County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Sioux County worth over $1.2 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $21.6 \nmillion to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be working on \nthe community health center. The Promise Center in Sioux County has \nopened doors and created opportunities for accessible care for so many \nIowans in this region. I am encouraged by the progress in Northwest \nIowa, and I look forward to learning how this center has transformed \nthe community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northwest Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nSioux County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Sioux \nCounty, I have fought for funding for Northwestern College for nursing \ntraining and arts projects worth $490,000, helping to create jobs and \nexpand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Sioux County has received $720,933 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Sioux County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $20,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Sioux County has received more than $11 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Sioux County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing more than $800,000 for \nthe Community Health Center.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nSioux County, both those with and without disabilities, and they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Sioux County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Sioux \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2645-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2645-S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BUENA VISTA COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

But I take a very special pride in projects that \nhave made a big difference in local communities across my State.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Buena Vista County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Buena Vista County worth over $4.9 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $23.6 \nmillion to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be working \nwith Buena Vista University to secure more than $5.5 million since 1995 \nfor renovations and investments to the campus, including course \ndevelopment needs, modernizing technology and equipment, and support \nfor distance learning programs.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northwest Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nBuena Vista County.

For example, working with \nmayors, city council members, and local economic development officials \nin Buena Vista County, I have fought for funding for more than $2.5 \nmillion to dredge Storm Lake, helping to create jobs and expand \neconomic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

Over the \nyears, Buena Vista County has received $424,090 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Buena Vista County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $175,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nBuena Vista County has received over $12 million to remediate and \nprevent widespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Buena Vista County has received more than $5.9 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Buena Vista \nCounty's fire departments have received over $596,000 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Lt. Col. \nChristopher Robert Eden on his retirement from the United States Air \nForce. Lieutenant Colonel Eden is retiring after nearly 21 years of \nservice to our country. He was born at Williams AFB, Arizona, in 1970 \nand grew up in the shadows of one of our Nation's finest service \nacademies, the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. \nInspired by his grandfather who flew B-29s in World War II and his \nfather and uncle who both graduated from the Academy and were Air Force \npilots, Chris dreamed of someday following in their footsteps. In 1989, \nhe was recruited to play baseball at the Air Force Academy Preparatory \nSchool and later accepted an appointment to the Academy. He graduated \nin the class of 1994, having been selected as a Rugby All-American \nduring his senior year. Upon graduation, Chris received one of several \ncoveted pilot training slots available at Reece AFB, Texas, and \ngraduated in 1995 as the top T-1 Graduate.\n  During his first assignment flying C-21As at Yokota Air Base, Japan, \nChris transported high-level dignitaries traveling throughout Asia and \nthe Pacific, including diplomatic missions to North Korea. While \nfulfilling this assignment, he was upgraded to Instructor Pilot and was \nassigned to fly the C-17A at Charleston AFB, South Carolina. Here, \nChris commanded emergency nuclear airlift, aeromedical evacuation, \nhumanitarian relief, Presidential support,\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nand combat missions to support Operations Allied Force, Southern Watch, \nNorthern Watch, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom.\n  In his next assignment as Chief of Flight Operations and Acceptance/\nTest Pilot at the Boeing C-17A Plant in Long Beach, CA, Chris tested \nand accepted new C-17A aircraft, developed and flew the first \ncommercial C-17 FAA noise certification tests, developed crew training \nand aircraft delivery procedures, and authored and implemented new fuel \ntank leak check procedures. While serving in Long Beach, he upgraded to \nEvaluator Pilot, and his unit was honored with the Department of \nDefense Flight Operations of the Year Award.\n  As Chief of C-17A Requirements at Headquarters Air Mobility Command \nat Scott AFB, Illinois, Chris helped continue to grow the C-17A fleet \nwhile receiving a Masters in Management and Leadership from Webster \nUniversity. In his final year at Scott AFB, he was selected to fly in \nthe 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.\n  As chief of training and chief pilot at Andrews, Chris transported \nour Nation's leaders in two administrations, including the Vice \nPresident, the First Lady, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, \nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. During this assignment, he was \nupgraded to Evaluator Pilot and trained the squadron's newest pilots to \nadhere to the highest SAMFOX standards of the 1st Airlift Squadron's \nno-fail missions.\n  During his Air Force career, Chris flew more than 5,100 hours and \nreceived many awards, including the Joint Service Achievement Medal, \nthe Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, and the Aerial \nAchievement Medal. Throughout his accomplishments, Chris proved to be \nan effective and humble leader, displaying dedication, loyalty, and \nrespect to the mission and the Air Force. His exceptional character \nshould make us all proud that we have men and women like Chris serving \nin our Armed Forces.\n  I congratulate Lt. Col. Christopher Robert Eden for his many \nachievements and honors, but most of all, I thank him for his for \nexemplary service to our country.

Mr. President, last week, somewhere in Montana or \nNorth Dakota, the Bakken formation released its billionth barrel of \ncrude oil. I applaud the hardworking Montanans and other workers who \nare part of this extraordinary development.\n  As debate over the Keystone XL Pipeline drags on and the President \ninexcusably continues to delay that project, it is important to \nappreciate how much has changed in less than a decade in the American \nenergy sector. As the commander in 2004 and 2005 of the largest \ndeployment of Montanans to war since World War II, I understand \nfirsthand the costs of dependence on oil from hostile places.\n  That same dependence costs our pocketbooks. Since multistage \nhorizontal hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized oil and gas \nproduction in this country, we have been able to fill our tanks and \ntractors with more American oil. Yet last year we still spent $384 \nbillion on 3.5 billion barrels of foreign oil.\n  When that comes from close allies like Canada, whose industry is \nclosely integrated with the American economy, we all prosper. But we \nremain unacceptably reliant on countries who sell us oil and then work \nto undermine our national security.\n  What does 1 billion barrels from the Bakken mean? That is 1 billion \nbarrels of oil that did not come from places like Iran, Venezuela, \nAlgeria or Russia.\n  It is 1 billion barrels of oil whose exploration, development, \nproduction, transportation, and refining occurred in the United States, \ninjecting cash and strengthening our economy at home. While the Bakken \nboom, like any surge in a single sector, has brought its share of \ngrowing pains, overall it has strengthened Montana's economy, creating \nthousands of jobs in towns from Sidney and Fairview to Miles City and \nBillings, long-term investments in infrastructure and a skilled \nworkforce.\n  Montana's role in the Bakken is a story of entrepreneurs. The Bakken \nitself was first cracked over a decade ago by a Billings geologist, \nRichard Findley, and his team, in the Elm Coulee Field. Montanans have \ncontinued to start new small businesses focused on the Bakken.\n  As we celebrate the success of the Bakken, we can also point to other \nenergy projects around Montana that are also helping increase our \nenergy security, from enhanced oil recovery to carbon sequestration for \ncoal. Montana's rich renewable resources: wind, solar, geothermal, and \nbiomass are also creating good-paying jobs and producing energy.\n  I salute these innovators for their continued success to make America \nmore energy secure and create jobs in Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2647-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2647-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2647-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4487.

A bill to facilitate the development and commercial \ndeployment of carbon capture and sequestration technologies, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills, S. \n2287 and S. 2288, to help advance commercial deployment of clean coal \ntechnologies. The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Deployment Act of \n2014 and the Expanding Carbon Capture through Enhanced Oil Recovery Act \nof 2014. These pieces of legislation would invest in carbon capture and \nsequestration, CCS, research and development; expand tax credits for \ncompanies investing in CCS technologies; and create loan guarantees for \nconstruction of new CCS facilities and retrofits of existing \nfacilities.\n  As I have said many times before, the reality remains for West \nVirginia and our Nation--we need coal and we simply cannot meet our \nenergy demands without coal.\n  That being said, it is unrealistic to think that coal is as clean as \nit could be, or that it will be around forever. Yet to think that we \ncan stop burning coal and shift to cleaner sources of energy \nimmediately is simply not viable. We must place our focus on a feasible \nalternative, and carbon capture and sequestration technologies can \nprovide just that.\n  The legislation I am introducing today combines several of my \nproposals in past years with new ideas for improving CCS deployment, \nincluding an expansion of tax credits for companies utilizing and \nimproving upon CCS technology.\n  The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Deployment Act of 2014 would \nauthorize $1 billion over 15 years for an industry-government research \nprogram through the Department of Energy and authorize $20 billion in \nloan guarantees to be used for the construction or retrofitting of \nfacilities utilizing CCS technology, and for the construction of \nCO2 transmission pipelines. Moreover, it modifies the \nexisting Carbon Dioxide Sequestration Tax Credit, 45Q, currently capped \nand available on a first come-first served basis, by allowing projects \nto apply for an allocation of credits to use in the future, and \nensuring that multiple projects will have the opportunity to take \nadvantage of these important credits. Finally, it creates a new \ninvestment tax credit. Carbon capture and sequestration facilities that \noperate with at least a 65 percent capture rate would receive an \ninvestment tax credit of 15 percent of their costs. Those operating \nwith a higher capture rate, up to 100 percent of CO2 \nemissions, would receive a maximum credit of 30 percent of their costs.\n  The second piece of legislation, the Expanding Carbon Capture through \nEnhanced Oil Recovery Act of 2014, expands the Carbon Dioxide \nSequestration Tax Credit, 45Q, tax credit to help advance capture \ntechnology through the greater use of carbon dioxide enhanced oil \nrecovery, CO2- EOR, in the United States.\n  A decades-old and proven practice, CO2-EOR involves \ninjecting CO2 into already-developed oil fields to coax \nadditional production. According to the National Energy Technology \nLaboratory, increasing the supply of CO2 captured from man-\nmade sources has the potential to increase American oil production by \ntens of billions of barrels, while safely storing billions of tons of \nCO2 underground.\n  The existing 45Q tax credit remains insufficient to take advantage of \nCO2-EOR's potential. New, additional 45Q credits would be \nawarded via competitive bidding in a way that will make certain that \nthe government is incentivizing carbon capture to be used in EOR \nwithout overpaying, and that credits are available and sufficient for \nthe range of potential man-made sources of CO2.\n  According to the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative's \nanalysis, new 45Q credits allocated over ten years would generate more \nthan 8 billion barrels of oil, while storing 4 billion tons of \nCO2 over 40 years.\n  I remain committed to meeting the challenges facing the coal industry \nwhile also protecting our environment for current and future \ngenerations. I hope that others with a stake in meeting coal's \nchallenges will join me in this effort as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) (by request):\n  S. 2289. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2015 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense and for military \nconstruction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I are introducing, by \nrequest, the administration's proposed National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2015.

Res. 437\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of great importance by the \n     Mexican and Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which Mexicans who were struggling for \n     independence and freedom fought the Battle of Puebla;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become widely celebrated annually \n     by nearly all Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, north and south \n     of the United States-Mexico border;\n       Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many \n     battles that the courageous Mexican people won in their long \n     and brave struggle for independence and freedom;\n       Whereas the French army, confident that its battle-seasoned \n     troops were far superior to the less-seasoned Mexican troops, \n     expected little or no opposition from the Mexican army;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half \n     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an \n     outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and \n     courageous, Mexican army;\n       Whereas, after 3 bloody assaults on Puebla in which more \n     than 1,000 French soldiers lost their lives, the French \n     troops were finally defeated and driven back by the \n     outnumbered Mexican troops;\n       Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio \n     Zaragoza and his men\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n     displayed during that historic battle can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for \n     the causes of justice and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on \n     Cinco de Mayo;\n       Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was \n     instrumental in keeping Mexico from falling under European \n     domination while, in the United States, the Union Army \n     battled Confederate forces in the Civil War;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the \n     foundation of the United States was built by people from many \n     countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and \n     die for freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the \n     close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, \n     once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'' \n     (``Respect for the rights of others is peace''); and\n       Whereas many people celebrate Cinco de Mayo during the \n     entire week in which the date falls: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of \n     Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo \n     commemorates; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2650-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2974.

ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency has systematically \n     distorted the true impact of regulations promulgated by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) on job creation by using incomplete \n     analyses to assess effects on employment, primarily as a \n     result of the Environmental Protection Agency failing to take \n     into account the cascading effects of a regulatory change \n     across interconnected industries and markets nationwide;\n       (2) despite the Environmental Protection Agency finding \n     that the impact of certain air pollution regulations will \n     result in net job creation, implementation of the air \n     pollution regulations will actually require billions of \n     dollars in compliance costs, resulting in reduced business \n     profits and millions of actual job losses;\n       (3)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-\n     Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards \n     of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, \n     Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-\n     Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units'' (77 Fed. \n     Reg. 9304 (Feb. 16, 2012)) estimated that implementation of \n     the final rule would result in the creation of 46,000 \n     temporary construction jobs and 8,000 net new permanent jobs; \n     but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, \n     using a ``whole economy'' model, estimated that \n     implementation of the final rule described in subparagraph \n     (A) would result in a negative impact on the income of \n     workers in an amount equivalent to 180,000 to 215,000 lost \n     jobs in 2015 and 50,000 to 85,000 lost jobs each year \n     thereafter;\n       (4)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``Federal \n     Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine \n     Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP \n     Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (Aug. 8, 2011)) estimated \n     that implementation of the final rule would result in the \n     creation of 700 jobs per year; but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting \n     estimated that implementation of the final rule described in \n     subparagraph (A) would result in the elimination of a total \n     of 34,000 jobs during the period beginning in calendar year \n     2013 and ending in calendar year 2037;\n       (5)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rules of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: \n     Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process \n     Heaters'' (76 Fed. Reg. 1.5608 (March 21, 2011)) and \n     ``National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air. Pollutants \n     for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional \n     Boilers'' (76 Fed. Reg. 15554 (March 21, 2011)) estimated \n     that implementation of the final rules would result in the \n     creation of 2,200 jobs per year; but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting \n     estimated that implementation of the final rules described in \n     subparagraph (A) would result in the elimination of 28,000 \n     jobs per year during. the period beginning in calendar year \n     2013 and ending in calendar year 2037;\n       (6) implementation of certain air pollution rules of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency that have not been reviewed, \n     updated, or finalized as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act, such as regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and the \n     update or review of national ambient air quality standards, \n     are predicted to result in significant and negative \n     employment impacts, but the Agency has not yet fully studied \n     or disclosed the full impacts of existing Agency regulations;\n       (7) in reviewing, developing, or updating any regulations \n     promulgated under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency must be required to accurately disclose the \n     adverse impact the existing regulations of the Agency will \n     have on jobs and employment levels across the economy in the \n     United States and disclose those impacts to the American \n     people before issuing a final rule; and\n       (8) although since 1977, section 321(a) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7621(a)) has required the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to ``conduct continuing \n     evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment which \n     may result from the administration or enforcement of the \n     provision of [the Clean Air Act] and applicable \n     implementation plans, including where appropriate, \n     investigating threatened plant closures or reductions in \n     employment allegedly resulting from such administration or \n     enforcement'', the Environmental Protection Agency has failed \n     to undertake that analysis or conduct a comprehensive study \n     that considers the impact of programs carried out under the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7491. et seq.) on jobs and changes \n     in employment.\n       (b) Prohibition.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall not propose or finalize any major \n     rule (as defined in section 804 of title 5, United States \n     Code) under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) until \n     after the date on which the Administrator--\n       (1) completes an economy-wide analysis capturing the costs \n     and cascading effects across industry sectors and markets in \n     the United States of the implementation of major rules \n     promulgated under the Clean Air Act (42 7401 et seq.); and\n       (2) establishes a process to update that analysis not less \n     frequently than semiannually, so as to provide for the \n     continuing evaluation of potential loss or shifts in \n     employment, pursuant to section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7621(a)), that may result from the implementation \n     of major rules under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \n     seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2980.

Mr. President, today I wish everyone, especially Mexican \nAmericans across the country and in Nevada, a happy Cinco de Mayo. All \nAmericans, regardless of background, join with the Mexican-American \ncommunity in commemorating the causes of freedom, liberty, and Hispanic \nheritage represented by this holiday.\n  There are celebrations all over America today. Driving to work this \nmorning, I saw a couple of people with great big sombreros wanting to \ncome to one of the celebrations in and around\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nWashington. So this is a wonderful holiday we all celebrate.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I support this resolution, with \nSenator Cornyn and others, commemorating Cinco de Mayo.\n  We all love Cinco de Mayo for the food and festivities that we have \ngrown so accustomed to across our country. However, we commemorate \nCinco de Mayo in order to celebrate the joint-history and values that \nare shared by both Mexicans and Americans. Cinco de Mayo is a day that \nreminds us that the citizens of Mexico possess the same courage that \nwe, as Americans, value in ourselves. For that reason, the \ncommemoration of Cinco de Mayo has transcended from being a celebration \nof the victorious Battle of Puebla that Mexico won over France, to a \ncelebration of courage and a recognition of all contributions that the \nMexican-American community has had both in Colorado and in our great \nNation. Celebrating Cinco de Mayo brings pride to both the Mexican-\nAmerican community and all Americans.\n  The courage displayed by Mexican forces on May 5, 1862 parallels the \ncourage that we as Americans have used to overcome adversity and thrive \nsince our founding. The victory of the beleaguered force of Mexican \ntroops at the Battle of Puebla weakened France's immense resources and \nlimited its ability to meddle in America's Civil War. As Mexico sought \nto defend itself from European aggression, the Battle of Puebla reminds \nus that the foundation of the United States was also built through \nbattles in which the United States often found itself as the underdog. \nThrough courage, perseverance, and the willingness to fight and die for \nfreedom, our Nation has become stronger. These contributions that the \nMexican-American community has had in our Nation should be celebrated \nas part of our country's history.\n  While Cinco de Mayo remains a Mexican national holiday, the \ncommemoration of this holiday has become imbedded in American culture. \nBoth in Colorado and throughout our Nation, the contributions of the \nmillions of Mexican-American families are seen throughout our \ncommunities. As in years past, I continue to encourage my fellow \nColoradans to celebrate Cinco de Mayo by remembering and educating but \nalso by coming together with friends and neighbors to enjoy food, \nmusic, and dancing.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/05/senate-section/article/S2677-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING ST.
