Madam President, to me it is rather astonishing the \nextent to which we are discussing this historic immigration bill and \nhow little our focus has been on the real impact of it, what \nimmigration means, how to make it better, how to serve the national \ninterests to do the kinds of things the American people want us to do. \nWe really talked about a lot of hot-button issues, but we have not \nfocused on the substance of what we are doing, how many people the \ncountry can absorb legally every year. We do 1 million legally every \nyear. How many more can we assimilate effectively and have reasonable \nexpectations that they would find good work in America, to be able to \nhave them find work but not put Americans out of work, and what kinds \nof skill sets do we need most? Will our system of enforcement work? And \nthere are many other questions like that.\n  So I would say that to some degree we have missed that discussion. We \nare told that today--now we are going on 11 o'clock--we will see a \nmagic amendment, the amendment that fixes everything, that we can just \nrelax and go home and take a good nap because we have an amendment that \nis going to fix all of the problems in the legislation. Well, that is \nodd because we were told when the bill was announced that it was the \ntoughest legislation ever, that it fixed everything, it did not need \nany improvement, we are all OK with it, you all just pass it, and if \nyou raise questions about it--as I did--then you are not a good fellow, \nyou are not being nice if you point out problems.\n  Apparently, now the sponsors of the bill have realized that they have \na lot of problems, that as the bill has been examined and actually \nread--the thousand pages of it here, it has been read and studied--more \nand more and more problems have been found with it.\n  We have had a great deal of discussion about the border. The border \nsecurity issue is a very important issue, but it is one of the issues \nin establishing a good lawful immigration system that serve the \nnational interests. It's just one of the issues. It was nothing like \nthe bill's sponsors promised. It would not have accomplished the job.\n  Those of us who were asking the tough questions--people tried to \ndismiss the concerns. They finally had to deal with the issue that it \ndid not do what they promised. It was a big problem. So now they have \naccepted an amendment, it appears, that would change the legislation \nquite a bit--at least with regard to the border. That was talked about \na lot because it always symbolizes whether we are serious about \nenforcement.\n  It was so weak in the legislation. When the bill first started, they \nproposed spending $6.5 billion on border security. Then, as it went \nthrough committee and complaints arose, they went up to $8.3 billion--\nabout a 30-percent increase. Then the bill hit the floor and the \nAmerican people began to find out how weak it was, and our phones \nstarted ringing--almost in a panic, it seems.\n  A group has met in secret. They have announced the Corker-Hoeven \nagreement to spend $38 billion, to add 20,000 agents. It is all fixed. \nVote for the bill. Now you have no excuse. You have to vote for the \nbill. But if you are holding a bucket of water and it has a bunch of \nholes in it and you close one of the holes, all of the water is still \ngoing to run out of the bucket.\n  There are other problems with the legislation. There was just one \nproblem that was so dramatic and so plainly contrary to the promises \nthe sponsors had made for their bill that it was really devastating. \nNow, in total retreat and capitulation, they have talked about adding \n20,000 agents and spending $38 billion on the border.\n  We do not want to hear you guys complain anymore. Now you just hush \nand pass our bill. Do not talk about what else is in it. Do not talk \nabout the policy issues that are raised by the legal flow of \nimmigration we have. You just pass the bill now because we answered the \nborder security problem.\n  Well, this is not the way it is going to be. We should be able to do \ndramatic things and effective things at the border with $38 billion, \nbut, as I will point out in a little bit, we are not sure at all that \nis going to happen in an effective, smart way, especially when it has \ncome up in this fashion and especially since we have passed laws \nrepeatedly that mainly require certain things to happen and then they \nnever happen, such as fencing.\n\n  We said the last time we passed a bill that we had to build 700 miles \nof double-layer fencing. Well, that was in 2008, I believe. Today we \nhave 36 miles of double-layer fencing and about 300 miles of pedestrian \nfencing. So now they say they have their 700 miles. Well, it remains to \nbe seen if that will ever happen, No. 1, but, No. 2, it is not double-\nlayer, as we passed in law previously. That never happened. It is just \na single-layered fence, which is much easier to penetrate. A double-\nlayered fencing system with a vehicular ability to move between the \nfences is very, very effective. It has proven effective before. That is \nwhy it was put in the bill--not because someone wanted to sound tough \nbut because it will work.\n  Things that really work tend to be blocked in the Senate. Things that \nwould actually make the system transform from illegality to legality \nhave always been blocked, in my experience, since I have been in the \nSenate. It is amazing to me in that regard.\n  We have not seen the amendment. We were told we would have it last \nnight at 6 o'clock. We were on track to have a series of amendment \nvotes, some important amendments to be voted on. We were getting ready \nto do that. All of a sudden, it was announced that an agreement had \nbeen reached and a new amendment had been offered. This amendment was \ngoing to fix the border. It was going to spend more money than ever. \nNobody now had a right to complain about the immigration bill before \nus, S. 744. We had it fixed. The series of amendments we thought we \nhad--no votes were cast on them.\n  Actually, the night before, a tentative agreement had been reached to \nvote on as many as 16 amendments. That would have been a nice start to \nbegin the discussion, allow people to point out that there is a \nweakness in the bill and propose a solution to fix it. That is the way \nlegislation is supposed to go. You bring forth an amendment and you \nsay: This bill lacks this. This provision in the bill is wrong. I have \na fix for it. This is my offer. This is my amendment.\n  That is the way good legislation should be processed in the Senate. \nThat was all stopped.\n  So we waited--6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock. \nI think it was 10:30 when we departed and still there appeared no magic \namendment that is going to fix every problem with the legislation. No \nmagic amendment. Here we are at 11 o'clock and we still have not seen \nit. Frankly, I would like to read it. I am going to read it. We read \nthis one. It did not do what the sponsors said. They had good talking \npoints. I could have voted for the talking points. I liked what they \nsaid, basically, in the talking points, but it was not in the bill. \nThat is the problem.\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n  I have been a Federal prosecutor for many years. It is the law that \ngets enforced, not some Senator's talking point. That is worthless. It \nis what is in the bill. It requires and directs agents to do this and \nthat. It requires judges to do this and that. It requires law \nenforcement officers to do this and that. So what counts is what is in \nthat bill.\n  With regard to this new amendment, I would like to ask a couple of \nthings to Senators Hoeven and Corker. Does your amendment put \nenforcement before the legality? Does it put enforcement before \namnesty?\n  Is this before the first legalization is allowed to occur, or is the \namnesty still first? They told us initially they were going to have \nenforcement first. By a 4-to-1 margin the American people have said \nthey are prepared to treat with compassion the people who have entered \nthe country illegally, have been here for a long time and done, \notherwise, the right things. We are prepared to be compassionate and \ndeal with them--but we don't trust Washington. We want to see you do \nthe enforcement before you give this legal status.\n  This is common sense. There is nothing wrong with that. The American \npeople aren't mean spirited when they say that. They have seen this \ngame before. They have seen how it has been played before. They don't \nhave confidence in us. I can cite example after example after example \nof laws, rules, promises made, and never carried out.\n  That is why we have such a massive, illegal flow into America and how \nwe have accumulated 11 million people, many of them wonderful people. \nThis isn't the way we want the system to work. I think that is the \nquestion, why do we have amnesty first again.\n  Senator Grassley, our ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, has \nrepeatedly said: I was here in 1986, and I voted for the amnesty in \n1986. I thought it was going to work, and it was a mistake. We should \nhave seen it was not going to work. We had the amnesty first. We had \npromised to do all kinds of enforcement in the future, and that never \nhappened. This is why we are at this spot again today. That is the \nhistory of it.\n  What about the fencing that is promised in the bill? Does the \namendment require any fence to be built before the amnesty is granted? \nI want to know that when we see your amendment. Do we have any \nconfidence that we will ever see the fence built any more than we saw \nit when we passed laws previously to build fences that never occurred?\n  Does your amendment require a biometric exit system as required by \ncurrent law? Under current law the Congress of the United States has \nrequired that the executive branch create an entry-exit visa system \nthat is biometric. It basically means you use your fingerprints. Your \nfingerprints are read so you can't bring in a document and say I am \nJohn Doe and not be John Doe. When you come into the country, your \nfingerprints are recorded. When you go out of the country, your \nfingerprints are recorded. You clock out like many companies do in the \nworkplace. You put your card in and your time is accounted for. We know \nwhen you came, when you left, did you overstay, or did you depart as \nrequired by law.\n  Current law says we will do that. You will be fingerprinted when you \nenter, and that is done. You are fingerprinted when you enter the \ncountry, but what has never been done is the exit system when you \ndepart the country. Every kind of excuse has been made for that, but \nthe truth is there is no excuse for not doing that.\n  Does this amendment fix that problem? The experts tell us, and the \nCongressional Budget Office reported a few days ago, that we are going \nto see an increase in visa overstays under this bill and the trends we \nare facing. There are several reasons for this. One big one is the \nlegal flow of workers into our country; guest workers who come to take \njobs, work for certain periods of time, will double. CBO predicts you \nare going to have an increase of the number of people who overstay \ntheir visas.\n  Since we have no ability to clock people when they depart, it becomes \nunenforceable. I think they are exactly right about that. Right now the \nentry visa system is responsible for 40 percent of illegal entries into \nthe United States. Visa overstays account for approximately 40 percent \nof the current illegal population.\n  I think we can expect, with the large increase in guest worker \nprograms--well over 50 percent in the future responsible for illegal \nentries into the country.\n  Does this amendment fix that, Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker? This \nis half of the problem, more than half of the problem, frankly, if this \nbill passes. I don't believe it is likely to do so.\n  Current law says there shall be a biometric entry-exit at all air, \nsea, and land ports. What does this bill say? The toughest bill ever, \nthey say. Does that make it stronger? Does it fix the weakness in the \ncurrent system? No. It says you have to have an electronic system--much \nweaker than biometric. It says you have to have it only at air and sea \nports but not at land ports.\n  This bill is plainly weaker than current law.\n  I will ask this to the amendment sponsors: Does it actually have a \nmechanism to require those who receive the amnesty to pay back Federal, \nState, and local taxes? Is that part of the deal? That is what has been \ntouted, we have been told repeatedly. They are going to pay back taxes. \nLet me say, it is not going to happen under this legislation. There is \nno way this is even going to create an attempt by the IRS to go back \nand try to investigate persons to see who owes more taxes.\n  That is a talking point. Talking points aren't law. Talking points \naren't reality. They are political weapons used to advance the agenda \nof those who have special interests.\n  I would ask this question: Does your amendment require those who \nreceive amnesty to learn English? They say our bill requires people to \nlearn English, but it doesn't, as you can plainly tell if you read the \nlegislation. Illegal immigrants will immediately receive legal status \nunder this bill. After they have been here for ten years or, for some, \nonly five years, they can adjust to legal permanent resident status. At \nthe end of 10 years in RPI status, if you speak English, then you can \nadjust to LPR status. If you are not speaking English and you are in a \ncourse, then they have to give you permanent legal status. You don't \nhave to pass the course. All you have to do in your 9th year, the 10th \nmonth, is sign up for an English course somewhere, and get your legal \nstatus under the bill. Would that loophole be fixed?\n  Does the amendment, my colleagues, prohibit people with multiple DUIs \nfrom receiving amnesty? Do you do anything about that loophole?\n  Does your amendment require that anyone applying for amnesty actually \nbe interviewed? This is one of the big shocking weaknesses in the \nlegislation.\n  When a person is transformed from a person in illegal status to an \nRPI status, the legal status, which happens in a few months, what do we \ndo to make sure that person isn't a known criminal? That person could \nbe a terrorist. What do we do about that? Normally, one of the most \nvaluable things that can be done in these processes is to interview the \nperson.\n  It appears quite plainly this bill--the bill certainly does not \nrequire interviews. It is almost certain that DHS will not undertake \nthem voluntarily either, having seen how Homeland Security is handling \nthe DACA program. There are reports that USCIS is not interviewing \nthose applicants face to face. This is a big weakness in the system. It \nis almost guaranteed that nobody is going to be interviewed face to \nface and actually examined to see if the paperwork they are submitting \nhas any validity at all. Many times that meeting can identify a \nweakness in the paperwork and lead to further investigation. If you \ndon't have interviews and you otherwise aren't smart about how you \nadminister it, large numbers of people can get status they don't \ndeserve through utilizing fake documents. We can expect that to happen, \nand it should not happen.\n\n  We are being generous under this bill with regard to the people who \nwould be given legal status, but only those who qualify should get it. \nPeople who don't qualify should not get it, or we are perpetuating \nillegality again indefinitely into the future.\n  Does the amendment prohibit those who have domestic violence \nconvictions from receiving the legal status? Not so in the bill today.\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\n  Does the amendment ensure those who do not receive amnesty would \nactually be deported in the future? A lot of people will not qualify. \nThey should not have amnesty. We come to find out they have been \nconvicted of a felony, drug dealing, assault with intent to murder, \nrobbery. Should they be given amnesty? No, we say, they shouldn't be \ngiven amnesty. Well, do they get to stay here if they are identified, \nfound, and arrested for some other crime? Shouldn't they be deported? \nWe need to be sure the persons who do not qualify are going to be \ndeported.\n  I have an amendment that is a serious amendment that would help move \nus from this present failed system, to one that could actually work, to \ndeal with interior enforcement and deportation in a proper manner.\n  I have a letter that came in from June 19, 2013, addressed to \nSenators Corker and Hoeven from the National Immigration Customs \nEnforcement Council of the American Federation of Government Employees, \nsigned by Mr. Chris Crane, their very able, competent president. This \nis what Mr. Crane said, writing on behalf of the 7,600 agents and \nofficers:\n\n       According to the National Journal, you are working on an \n     amendment with members of the Gang of Eight to ``help pass a \n     bill.'' I am concerned that your amendment as outlined in the \n     article not only provides immediate legalization before \n     enforcement, but also appears to completely neglect interior \n     enforcement. S. 744 drastically reduces the ability of ICE \n     officers to do their jobs while providing legal status to \n     convicted criminals, including gang members, drunk drivers, \n     and sex offenders.\n\n  I can assure you these are not the types of ``reforms'' sought by the \nAmerican public, in fact, these are not reforms at all but, instead \nprovisions written by special interest groups concerned only with their \nown political agendas and future financial gains.\n  This is a man who heads the law officers association, who has had his \nofficers blocked from enforcing the law by political directives from \nthe supervisor. It is a plain fact. They have negated the ability of \nthe law of America to be enforced.\n  He continues:\n\n       Any plan is doomed to fail that does not empower ICE agents \n     to enforce the laws enacted by Congress--and that does not \n     put an end to the unlawful abuse of prosecutorial discretion \n     by political appointees.\n\n  There is some history to this. The ICE officers are in an uproar. The \nmorale of the ICE officers was ranked near the absolute bottom of 170-\nsomething government agencies. They are out there risking their lives \ndealing with criminals and people in violation of the law. What did \nthey hear from their political supervisors? Don't enforce the law. \nDon't follow through on what you are required to do by congressional \naction. They have actually filed a lawsuit against their supervisors \nbecause they are being told by the supervisors not to do what they took \nan oath to do, which is to enforce the law.\n  Mr. Crane states:\n\n       Yet, instead of cracking down on the Administration's abuse \n     of power, S. 744 places unprecedented new restrictions on \n     interior enforcement--making the current situation much worse \n     and much more hazardous. It is as if S. 744 were explicitly \n     written to handcuff law enforcement officers--binding their \n     hands while giving virtually unchecked authority to executive \n     branch officials to prevent future removals, including \n     removals of criminal aliens. These are the people doing the \njob every day. They were never talked to. They asked to meet with the \nGang of 8. No, they didn't want to hear from them. The Gang of 8 wanted \nto hear from their special friends. They wanted to hear from the \nspecial business groups who wanted cheap labor. They wanted to hear \nfrom big labor. They wanted to hear from La Raza. They wanted to hear \nfrom special interest groups, and they heard from them--the chamber of \ncommerce and ag industrial groups. That is who met with them. That is \nwho wrote the bill--those special interests along with the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association. I assure you they have put into this \nbill, in place after place after place, where now they can file cases, \nappeals, and create disorder within the normal operating system of \nimmigration.\n\n  Mr. Crane goes on to say:\n\n       Absent drastic improvements to the interior enforcement \n     provisions, there is no doubt that S. 744 will undermine the \n     constitutional rule of law, guarantee future illegal \n     immigration, and place the public at risk.\n\n  That is a dramatic statement, and I am not seeing it anywhere close \nto being refuted. As to the question, does it guarantee future illegal \nimmigration, look, the Congressional Budget Office did the report for \nus. They are nonpartisan. They serve all of us. We have a Democratic \nSenate majority and Mr. Elmendorf was picked by them, but he is a fair \nman. He said we would only see a 25-percent reduction in the number of \nillegal entries into America if this bill is passed.\n  Our colleagues promised it was going to end the illegality; that it \nwas going to be the toughest bill ever. The Congressional Budget Office \nthis week said this legislation will reduce illegality only by 25 \npercent. That is just not acceptable. That is not acceptable. We have \nbeen told so much different, and Mr. Chris Crane says the same thing. \nHe goes on to say this:\n\n       S. 744 not only fails to contain needed interior \n     enforcement provisions, but weakens interior enforcement. \n     This is because powerful special interests involved in \n     crafting the bill's language are opposed to interior \n     enforcement--a fact ICE officers are all too familiar with. \n     The political agendas of these groups place the public safety \n     and security of our Nation at risk.\n\n  I believe he is accurate. I know he cares about what he is doing. Mr. \nCrane is a very impressive young leader--a marine. He loves his \ncountry. He believes this bill is bad for America and he has had the \ncourage to state that and his association has backed him up on it. They \nare all in it together, I guess. He goes on to say this, in addressing \nthe sponsors of the amendment:\n\n       As respected political leaders, I am asking you both to \n     work with me and others in Congress and law enforcement in \n     ensuring that this bill puts the safety of America before \n     powerful special interests.\n\n  I think that is a very important letter. It cannot be that our \ncolleagues can promote a piece of legislation as being the most \neffective improvement in history when our own officers who are out \nthere trying to enforce the law say it makes it worse. It is very \ndisappointing.\n  I wanted to kind of tease my colleagues a little bit about this \namendment that we are still waiting to see. It hasn't appeared yet. We \nthought we were going to have it at 6 o'clock last night, then 7, then \n8, then 9, then 10, then 10:30, and now it is 11:20 the next morning \nand we still haven't seen it. Presumably it must be OK, though, because \nit is going to fix everything we need to be concerned about.\n  Senator Schumer, in the markup in the Judiciary Committee, in talking \nabout enforcement, said this. This was all about Mr. Cornyn, our able \nSenator from Texas, who offered an amendment in the markup in the \nJudiciary Committee to enhance enforcement at the border and do a lot \nof different things he thought were important and add 5,000 new Border \nPatrol agents. So what did our colleagues who had written the bill--the \nGang of 8--who said they were going to stick together and fight off any \namendment that had any significance to it--and they all rallied and \nfought off the Cornyn amendment, too--what did they say about Senator \nCornyn's steps to make the legal system work better and to add some new \nagents to the border? Being a Texas Senator, he is familiar with those \nissues. Senator Schumer said this:\n\n       Just on the border alone, Senator McCain and I had an \n     amendment a few months ago that spent--a few years ago, \n     rather, that spent about $600 to $800 million on the border \n     and effectiveness rate went up from 68 to 82. We spent much \n     more than that, as much as $6.5 billion.\n\n  In other words, they spend in this bill, they say, $6.5 billion, as I \nmentioned earlier.\n  This is what he goes on to say:\n\n       The border will effectively be closed, we believe, with \n     these expenditures, in the way they will be done.\n\n  If he is going to spend a total of $6.5 billion in this bill and \neffectively close the border, how is it he is now supporting an \namendment that would add 20,000 agents to the border? Because the bill \nis in trouble and they are in panic mode, I would suggest.\n  A little later, in the same markup, referring to the Border Patrol \nagents, he said this:\n\n       Their numbers have gone way, way up and most people think \n     they're an adequate number.\n\n  Why, that was just May 9, a little over 1 month ago. He said they \nwere an\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nadequate number; that we don't need any more Border Patrol agents, and \nthey attacked Senator Cornyn for having the temerity to suggest we \nneeded 5,000 more. Now, when the bill is in trouble and they are in \npanic mode, they are coming in with an amendment--though we haven't \nseen it yet--they claim will add 20,000 Border Patrol agents.\n  Back in the markup on May 9, Senator Schumer said this:\n\n       Look, our goal is to make the border much more secure and \n     we do. We do dramatically.\n\n  If it does all that, why do we need a new amendment? The point I am \nmaking, what I am saying is the talking points of the bill sponsors \nhave been positive, positive, positive throughout. They say the things \npeople want to hear. The question is, does our legislation do what \npeople want done? That is the question.\n  Back then he said we are doing all you want, the border is \neffectively closed, we don't need any more agents.\n  Senator Flake, in talking about Senator Cruz from Texas, who offered \nan amendment in the Judiciary Committee markup on the border, and ably \ndid so, said this:\n\n       We add in our legislation 3,500 new customs agents. That's \n     at a cost of about $6 billion--3,500. What we're talking \n     about here is tripling border patrol. It's currently at about \n     21,000. Take it to 60,000. So 40,000 new agents. We're \n     talking about $30, $40 billion to do that. . . . and I know \n     it's sincere--a desire to--to put more resources on the \n     border, but we have fiscal restraints here.\n\n  So he opposed it, one of the Gang of 8 Members.\n  At the markup, Senator Schumer said:\n\n       And so, to simply for us to dictate, when we are not the \n     experts, to quadruple border patrol, is, in my opinion, \n     something, you know, that you might accuse me of: throwing \n     money at a problem without really knowing what its effect \n     would be.\n\n  He goes on to say on the floor, in talking about this bill on June \n11, just a week or so ago, before the Corker amendment had ever been \ndreamed of:\n\n       Make no mistake our border will be secured as a result of \n     this bill. We appropriate $6.5 billion upfront in this bill \n     to bolster our security efforts. That is in addition to the \n     annual appropriations made for each year of border security.\n\n  That must not have been accurate. He said the bill had taken care of \nit; that they have an adequate amount in the bill as it is, and now \nthis would add 20,000 more Border Patrol agents. Again, the point is, \nwe get positive spin no matter what the circumstances are because they \nare out to sell this bill. They are out to promote their creation, and \nthey have lost sight of what it actually does. They have truly lost \nsight, in my opinion, of the fundamental responsibility of important \nlegislation, which is not to achieve a political end but to achieve a \nbetter America, to serve the national interest.\n  I am going to continue to ask: Does this bill serve the interest of \nthe people of the United States of America? Not economically and not \nlegally, in my opinion.\n  Now this is Senator McCain, on June 18, just the other day:\n\n       But those who think we need more people--we do need more \n     people to facilitate movement across our ports of entry.\n\n  He says it is too slow; that we want more people to come in quicker. \nContinuing to quote Senator McCain:\n\n       But we have 21,000 border patrol. Today there are, on the \n     Arizona-Mexico, there are people sitting in vehicles in 120-\n     degree heat. What we need is not more people, because we've \n     gone--in 1986 we had 4,000 border patrol to 21,000, but what \n     we need is the technology that has been developed in the \n     intervening years.\n\n  So he says what we need is not more people, and what he means is we \ndon't need more Border Patrol agents, that we need some more \ntechnology. That is what they said last time when they undermined the \nfence. Some may remember the phrase they used then was that we are \ngoing to create a ``virtual fence.'' We are going to create a high-tech \nfence. We don't need to build those old fences. That is not good. We \nare going to take care of it with technology. So we spent, as Senator \nMcCain said on the floor, I think it was $980 million on a virtual \nfence at our borders that utterly failed. We got nothing for it. What \nelse didn't we get? We didn't get the fence. We wasted $1 billion on a \nfailed technology and didn't build the fence that was promised.\n  This is why the American people are not confident that anything \npoliticians tell them, about immigration particularly, will ever \nhappen, and the American people are right. Time and again, politicians \nhave promised, promised, promised and never delivered, delivered, \ndelivered. That is just a fact. I think this bill and these statements \nsay a lot.\n  With regard to Senator Cornyn's amendment that would add 5,000 agents \nand do some other things, this is what Senator Schumer said back in the \ncommittee in May, just this last month:\n\n       And what we have learned, and it was hit home to me when \n     Senator Flake and Senator McCain took me to the Arizona \n     portion of the border, it's vast. We have more people on the \n     border patrol. What's the number? 21,000. I think it was \n     triple what it was 5 years ago. But you can't have--yeah, if \n     you want to have the whole Federal budget, you guys figure \n     out how you're going to spend and get that money, the whole \n     Federal budget on just the border patrol? You could probably \n     have 100 percent operational control.\n\n  So he was saying then don't question our bill. This does all we need. \nWe don't have the money to spend more on it. Now, apparently, he is \ntrumpeting the great bipartisan agreement that would add 20,000 more \nBorder Patrol people.\n  Maybe we need more Border Patrol agents and we need to use technology \nand we need to use fences wisely, but what we need is a Secretary of \nHomeland Security who knows what they are doing, who is committed to \nending the illegality and using every resource we have wisely to \nconfront this illegality and ending it.\n  If we had that the last 4 years, we would have had far more reduction \nin illegality on the border than we have seen, and we would be in a \nmuch better position to go to the American people and say let's talk \nabout amnesty now because we have proven we have made real progress. \nBut they have never wanted to do that. They have been listening to the \nvoices out there and the political interests and the special interests, \nand they have not done it.\n  Now we have 11 million people here. What is their solution? Surrender \nto the illegality. Just give up. We will just give amnesty to everybody \nhere and we will pass a law and we promise it will fix things and we do \nnot really worry whether it does or not. I can tell you it will not, it \nwill not fix it.\n  There are a lot of things that are noteworthy. I would like to talk \nabout them as we go forward on this legislation. One of them I think is \ninteresting, and I am just going to raise it because it is an issue we \nneed to confront. We hear it a lot. People are talking like this out \nthere. Bill O'Reilly's talking points memo is consistently a high-grade \nmemo that has valuable insights that I think Americans would do well to \nlisten to on a regular basis. He is a very insightful individual.\n  In regard to what he said last night, I got a transcript of it. I \nthink it shows some of the misconceptions about the legislation that we \nsimply have to correct. It is not sufficient to pass this legislation \nbased on talking points, on spin from the sponsors of the bill. We have \nto say: OK, does it really do that? How does it do it? Can it be made \nbetter? Are there weaknesses?\n  This is what Bill O'Reilly said last night:\n\n       Senator Rubio told me on the phone today that it would be \n     at least 13 years--13--before people in the country illegally \n     right now could gain full legal working status and even \n     longer to achieve citizenship.\n\n  We will talk about that. He goes on to say:\n\n       \"Talking Points'' support immigration reform even though I \n     well understand the new law will be somewhat chaotic and it \n     will be a magnet for even more people to come here illegally, \n     which is why we need stepped up security.\n\n  Let's go back to that first statement. It said there ``would be at \nleast 13 years before people in the country illegally right now could \ngain full legal working status.'' Not so. Not so at all. Not even \nclose. Within a few months everyone who applies for the RPI status, the \nprovisional status, will be given a Social Security card and the right \nto go to work and be lawful in the country and they cannot be deported \nunless they commit a serious crime. It is virtually immediately, not 13 \nyears.\n  It says ``even longer to achieve citizenship.'' That is not accurate \neither. This is how the citizenship and green\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\ncard status works, the permanent legal status: Within months, everybody \nwho qualifies under the 11 million will be given RPI, provisional \nstatus, virtually immediately. They will be able to take any job in \nAmerica, move anywhere they want to in America, displace workers in \nAmerica, and compete for jobs wherever. That is what will happen under \nthe bill.\n  For about 2.5 million who were people who came here as teenagers, the \nso-called DREAMers, they get citizenship in 5 years. They will have \ncitizenship in 5 years. That is 2.5 million. Certain agricultural \nworkers, those individuals who are illegally here, become permanent \nlegal residents. They get their legal right to work immediately. But in \n5 years they get permanent legal status, and the other 8 to 10 million \nillegal immigrants would be eligible for green cards or legal permanent \nresidence in 10 years, not 13.\n  There is an immediate amnesty that precedes all this. Legal status \nand the right to work is immediate. It is not 13 years. A large number \nof persons will be able to have citizenship within 5 years--25 percent, \nmaybe, will be getting that.\n  I think our people who are commenting about this need to get away \nfrom the spin of the sponsors and spin of those who are vested in \ntrying to pass the bill and get down to what the bill actually says. \nThat is very important.\n  The sponsors of the bill, Senator Schumer and others, claim the bill \nis paid for, and they have all the money needed to fund the \nlegislation. They claim this Congressional Budget Office report that \ncame out the other day backs them up. But it does not. It does not back \nthem up.\n  I am ranking member on the Budget Committee, and we need to talk \nabout that in some detail because it is a very important matter. CBO \ndoes not back that up. The CBO report showed this bill reducing \ndeficits in the next decade, according to the sponsors of the bill, but \nin fact CBO plainly states on page 12 of the report that the \nlegislation will increase on-budget deficits over that time--increase \ndeficits of the on-budget accounts.\n  Why? Because the newly legalized immigrants will be paying some \npayroll taxes--they will be paying the payroll taxes, Social Security, \nFICA, Medicare taxes that are withheld from workers' pay--but they are \nnot drawing Social Security benefits at this time because most of them \nare younger than that and they are not yet past 65.\n  So that creates a surplus flow, right? Of the $459 billion in new \ntaxes and fees, only about half of that comes from the income taxes \nthese workers are going to pay. Why? Because most of the workers are \nlow-income workers. Over half of the people who are here illegally do \nnot have a high school diploma and they are not making real high wages. \nYou have to earn a pretty sizable wage before you pay any income tax, \nalthough you do pay your Social Security, Medicare withholding--the \npayroll tax.\n  How do they then say they have money created to pay for all this \nstuff? They count the money from the payroll taxes, OK? That makes \nsense, you think, at first glance. But that, by rights, though, belongs \nto the Social Security trust fund. That is not money available for the \ngovernment to spend on trips to Africa or some summit somewhere or for \nSolyndras. That is Social Security money. Using this money to offset \nother spending is an accounting trick that was used to pass ObamaCare, \nand it is not right.\n  Let's go back over that again. The on-budget account--income tax \ncoming in from the legalization because some people who are legalized \nare going to pay more income tax--but there are a lot of expenses out \nthere too. The earned-income tax credit is a direct payment, not a tax \ndeduction but a direct welfare means-tested payment to poorer workers. \nThat is a big cost. And there are other costs.\n  So the CBO said income taxes that are paid will be less than the cost \nof the immigration; therefore, adding $14 billion to the on-budget debt \nof America. But the sponsors of the bill want to claim their \nlegislation pays for itself. They say: But they are going to be paying \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes; therefore, we want to count that \nmoney and that will prove that we paid for the bill.\n  Really? Aren't the individuals who are now given a Social Security \nnumber, allowed to work and pay the payroll taxes--aren't those taxes \nsupposed to be put into a trust fund for their Social Security and \nMedicare benefits when they do get to be 65? Absolutely. Any surplus \nmoney that goes into Social Security and Medicare is not free money \ngiven to the U.S. Treasury to spend to pay for border control agents. \nThat money is loaned by the trust funds. They get a Treasury bill in \nexchange for it. The U.S. Government pays them interest on the money \nthat the Social Security loaned to them. It is their money. It is the \ntrust fund's money.\n  A lot of people try to deny that, but there actually is one. There \nare debt instruments showing the transfer of this money, and interest \npayments are paid by the U.S. Treasury. So you can't count the money \nthat people pay into Social Security as being money that can be used to \nspend on other programs of the government. That is an important issue.\n  Mr. Elmendorf, the Director of CBO, the night before the President's \nhealth care bill passed--I prevailed upon him to write a letter to \nexplain that. He wrote a letter and said you can't simultaneously--what \nhad happened in ObamaCare was they cut Medicare costs and increased \nMedicare payroll taxes and used that money to fund his new health care \nprogram. They claimed that it strengthened Medicare and at the same \ntime provided money to fund ObamaCare. Mr. Elmendorf used a sentence \nthat I thought was very powerful. I think I can recall it.\n  He said: You can't simultaneously use the money to strengthen \nMedicare and pay for a new program. He used the phrase ``double \ncount,'' the kind of things people in business go to jail for. He said \nthat is double counting the money.\n  This is exactly what has happened here. The money that goes to \npeople's Social Security and Medicare trust fund accounts is not enough \nnow to pay for the amount of money the individual will claim when they \nbecome 65 and start retiring and using health care and Social Security \nchecks every month. There is not enough now. You certainly can't claim \nthat this is going to strengthen these programs and provide money for \nthe government to use outside of these programs. According to CBO, that \nis precisely what this immigration bill does with respect to Social \nSecurity. I feel strongly about that.\n  Mr. President, I see no one else here. I yield the floor at this time \nand reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there certainly is a lot of discussion--and \nunderstandably so--about the fact that so often there really aren't \nbipartisan efforts here in the Senate on major issues. We can turn on \npractically any talk show in America, and the constant refrain is, they \nare just not working together down there. The Democrats and Republicans \ncan't find common ground and in many instances aren't even trying.\n  The issue before the Senate right now shows that is certainly not the \ncase. We all understand how important this immigration issue is. It is \nan economic issue. It is a justice issue. It affects scores and scores \nof communities across the country. And for many months now here in the \nSenate, four Democrats and four Republicans, hour after hour after \nhour, have sought to come together in a bipartisan way to tackle a \nmajor issue. I certainly don't support every single provision in the \nbill. I am sure that is the case for most Senators. But I think in \nterms of its large implications, this is an extraordinarily important \neffort.\n  The immigration system is broken. Our country knows it needs to be \nfixed. And what this shows is that we can find some common ground to \nreally address principled bipartisanship--not just bipartisanship for \nthe sake of patting ourselves on the back but bipartisanship in terms \nof actually showing\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nthat the values important to both sides of the aisle can be addressed \nand at the same time the Senate can come together, work together, and \npass a law and actually succeed in the business we are sent here to do, \nwhich is to pass legislation.\n  I particularly wish to commend three on our side of the aisle whom I \nhave worked with on these and many other issues--Chairman Leahy, \nSenator Schumer, and, of course, our majority leader. They have \nconstantly put the focus on trying to show that Senators will have a \nchance to be heard on this issue. We have had a lot of debate on it. \nThey had literally scores and scores of amendments in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have had a lot of debate here on the floor of the Senate. \nChairman Leahy, Senator Schumer, and Senator Reid have all indicated \nthat Senators are going to have an extensive opportunity to be heard. \nBut, yes, when there is a bipartisan bill produced by four Democratic \nleaders and four Republican leaders, those three have been resolute in \nsaying that we are actually going to get it in front of the Senate, and \nI commend them for their very important work.\n  In addition to making it clear that I think bipartisanship is \nvaluable, I wish to highlight for a moment three amendments that I hope \nthat I will be able to make pending and that we will be able to get \nvotes on. In particular, I am troubled by the fact that the bill as \nwritten waives our country's environmental laws in order to secure the \nborder.\n  I am of the view that strengthening our immigration system should not \ncome at the cost of throwing our environmental laws aside. These are \nbedrock principles with respect to protecting our environment, our \npublic lands, and our natural resources. So I and seven other \ncolleagues in the Senate have introduced an amendment that would strike \nseveral of the unnecessary provisions in the bill that thwart the rule \nof law and ensure, as we go forward with the very important security \nagenda in securing the border, that, as I have indicated, we don't do \nlong-term damage to our environment that may take generations to \nrecover from, if at all.\n  If we are talking about waiving the laws that protect our public \nresources--and I know the distinguished Presiding Officer cares a great \ndeal about these issues--we ought to waive those laws only where there \nis compelling evidence that it is necessary, and even then it ought to \nbe done in a narrow and targeted way.\n  So my first amendment I hope to be able to get pending and hope to be \nable to offer is amendment No. 1543. It would allow the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to work with the Department of the Interior and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, local landowners, and State and Indian \ntribes to determine if any negative impacts can be mitigated. This \nmeans that if in order to secure the border there is damage to \nimportant environmental concerns--private property, public lands, \ntribal lands--the Secretary could take action to reduce that damage. So \nif, for example, the wall along the border causes unintended flooding \nin a city, the Secretary would be able to look at measures such as new \ninfrastructure, dikes, or drainage systems to prevent flooding. If a \nroad has to be built through a wetland or the habitat of an endangered \nspecies, the Secretary would have the authority to restore wetlands or \nconserve habitat for that species elsewhere.\n\n  All I want understood is that the Department has testified--Secretary \nNapolitano has testified several times before the Congress, including \nrecent testimony before the Judiciary Committee, that the Department of \nHomeland Security does not need these blanket authorities to waive the \nenvironmental law. They have not requested blanket authority to waive \nthe environmental law.\n  I think the Secretary's view in this regard speaks volumes to the \nneed to carefully review what the legislation does so as to make sure, \nwhen we are talking about a matter of such enormous concern--and really \nalso setting a precedent--that we think through how to ensure that we \nprovide the security the American people want, and at the same time, if \nwe are talking about waiving environmental laws, at least we provide \nthe authority to the Department to mitigate the damages in doing that, \nparticularly given the fact that the Department has not sought the \nauthority in the first place. They didn't seek the authority in the \nfirst place, so let's at least give them the authority to mitigate the \ndamages.\n  Another amendment I seek to offer is amendment No. 1544, which would \nsimply sunset this provision to waive the environmental laws when what \nis called the second trigger in the legislation is met. There has been \nconsiderable interest in the committee with respect to sunset authority \nand provisions to do that in one additional area. We ought to make sure \nwe sunset the provision to waive the environmental laws when the second \ntrigger is met.\n  Finally, I hope to be able to offer amendment No. 1545, which creates \na definition for ``physical tactical infrastructure'' in the waiver of \nall of the environmental laws. The amendment would define it as \n``roads; vehicles and pedestrian fences; port of entry barriers; \nlights; bridges; and towers for technology and surveillance.''\n  So, again, what we are talking about is not getting rid of the \nwaiver. I understand that isn't going to happen. But let's at least \nmitigate these damages that I think are very real threats, and let's \nset forward some unambiguous terms that relate to how this waiver is \ngoing to be used.\n  In my view these are amendments that improve the bill. They don't \ntake away any of the authorities that are granted in this bill, but \nthey are going to ensure that private property, public lands, and our \nenvironmental values are also going to be a priority while allowing the \nborder to be secured as quickly as possible.\n  So in wrapping up, let me say again for all those who may be \nfollowing this debate and who have been skeptical about whether there \nwas enough good will to do anything bipartisan here, I think the \nSenate, in a bipartisan way, with a pretty significant vote next week--\nI will not join the parlor debates of speculating about how many \nSenators will vote for the bill, but I believe it is going to be a very \nsubstantial majority. It will, in fact, be a bipartisan law that is \npassed, that responds to a significant issue, not just some kind of \nissue du jour that may have come up in the last few days and all of a \nsudden a few Senators get interested and come to the floor. This is a \nmajor, substantive issue. It has gone on and on. It has been tackled in \na bipartisan way. Initially, eight Senators were willing to stick their \nnecks out and take a fair amount of flak, as invariably happens when \ntrying to work on a partisan issue in a bipartisan way.\n  Again, it is also important to acknowledge, particularly on our side \nof the aisle, Chairman Leahy, Senator Schumer, and Leader Reid, who \nhave tirelessly focused on trying to make sure Senators have a chance \nto be heard, and have done so, and I commend them for that effort.\n  I will conclude today by saying I think the three amendments I seek \nto make pending and get votes on will deal with another important \nissue. The bill as written waives the environmental laws in order to \nsecure the border, and I and a number of other Senators would like, at \na minimum, to make sure the Department of Homeland Security has the \nlegal authority to mitigate the damage associated with that waiver \nwherever possible. We think it is particularly important that those \nprovisions that would mitigate the damages be allowed since the \nSecretary has actually testified she does not need those authorities in \nthe first place.\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as this discussion and debate over the \nimmigration reform has gone on, I have made a number of statements. I \nthink many of them, unfortunately, have been proven true. I said the \nbill did not promise enforcement at the border. Now apparently we are \nwaiting again to see where this amendment comes. They claim it will \ndramatically improve enforcement at the border. And\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nwe have not seen it yet. Maybe it will not appear. But they say it \nwill. It was in the newspapers yesterday and said it would fix \neverything with the bill. Well, of course, it will only deal with the \nborder, apparently, in any significant way. There are many other \nserious flaws in this legislation that simply have to be addressed.\n  I also complained that we had all these secret meetings and groups \nthere, and the public interest, the law enforcement interest, was \nexcluded. The only people who were there were special interests. I have \ntalked about that. And I talked about the influence of the White House \nmeetings and directing the agenda and how the bill was all written.\n  Well, today's New York Times has a story about that. I think it is \nrelevant for us to read because it is further confirmation that we have \nan elite group of people with special agendas meeting to draft \nlegislation that is going to impact all Americans. It is going to \nimpact the entire country, and nobody is speaking up for the average \nAmerican citizen in any effective way that I can see. They are not even \nbeing thought about. They are talking to pollsters and consultants and \npolitical gurus and advocacy groups--open borders groups, low-wage \nlabor groups.\n  All right, here it is, today's ``New York Times.'' The headline is: \n``White House Offers Stealth Campaign to Support Immigration Bill.'' \nThey are stealthy? This is a secret campaign? Apparently so.\n\n  The hide-out--\n\n  ``The hide-out''--\n\n     has no sign on the door, but inside Dirksen 201 is a spare \n     suite of offices the White House has transformed into its \n     covert immigration war room on Capitol Hill.\n\n  Dirksen 201. I did not know that is where they were meeting. Last \nnight on the floor I said: I wonder where they are meeting, plotting \nall these things. Right now, I presume, they are plotting this \namendment, trying to get more votes, and wheeling and dealing and \ngiving Louisiana purchases and cornhusker kickbacks, I suppose, to get \nvotes. Where is the public interest?\n  Meeting secretly over there in a covert war room in Dirksen.\n\n       Strategically located down the hall from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee--\n\n  The Judiciary Committee room is on the second floor too.\n\n     in one of the city's massive Congressional office buildings, \n     the work space normally reserved for the vice president is \n     now the hub of a stealthy legislative operation run by \n     President Obama's staff. Their goal is to quietly secure \n     passage of the first immigration overhaul in a quarter \n     century.\n\n  So that is where the driving force is coming from. I have been \nwondering where they have been meeting. Now the New York Times tells \nus.\n  It goes on:\n\n       ``We are trying hard not to be heavy handed about what we \n     are doing,'' said Cecilia Munoz, the director of the White \n     House Domestic Policy Council and the president's point \n     person on immigration.\n\n  Director Munoz is an able person, but she has an agenda on \nimmigration. She was one of the leaders in La Raza a number of years \nago and publicly stated that workplace verification--the things this \nbill claims to have in it, but not very effectively, I am afraid; and \nwe have never implemented it effectively before--but there was a \nworkplace verification plan in the 1986 amnesty bill that was supposed \nto keep illegal entrants from getting jobs in America. It was under \nfierce criticism and basically never worked. Ms. Munoz said that \nworkplace verification was discrimination. In other words, to have a \npolicy that would require businesses to provide jobs only to people who \nwere legally in America is discrimination. She attacked it and said \nCongress had a moral obligation to repeal that law. I want to say, this \nis the White House director of the immigration policy. This is not an \nevenhanded policy we have. It is being driven by this kind of agenda. \nIt just is.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Six years ago President George W. Bush publicly sent \n     cabinet secretaries to roam the Capitol building daily to try \n     to woo Republican senators for a similar immigration bill. \n     But this time, high-profile help from the White House is \n     anathema to many Republicans who do not want to be seen by \n     constituents as carrying out the will of Mr. Obama.\n\n  So Republicans are sneaking over there. Maybe somebody ought to sit \noutside room 201 and see how many Republicans go in.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       So while lawmakers from both parties are privately relying \n     on the White House--\n\n  ``Privately relying on the White House''--both parties--\n\n     and its agencies to provide technical information to draft \n     scores of amendments to the immigration bill, few \n     Republicans are willing to admit it.\n\n  Well, I would think--I do not know why they would not want to admit \nthe President is basically drafting this bill and it is President \nObama's legislation fundamentally. That has been obvious to me, but I \ndid not have any proof of it until we read the New York Times today.\n  Quoting:\n\n       So while lawmakers from both parties are privately relying \n     on the White House . . . to provide technical information . . \n     . [s]ome are so eager to prove that the White House is not \n     pulling the strings that their aides say the administration \n     is not playing any role at all.\n\n  And they quote Mr. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Senator Rubio, to \nthat effect.\n  Well, who is writing this? Who is involved? The White House or not? \nIt is pretty clear to me the White House is.\n  It goes on to say this:\n\n       Inside Room 201, the administration has gathered a \n     collection of its own Congressional lobbyists, policy \n     specialists and experts from an alphabet soup of the agencies \n     that will have to put the immigration legislation into effect \n     if it passes. They all moved into the vice president's \n     offices on June 10, setting up laptop computers and thick \n     binders filled with proposed amendments on an oval conference \n     table.\n\n  There is no doubt about that, this bunch is prepared. This \nlegislation was put together haphazardly, in my opinion; fundamentally, \nnot well written. But everything else about it has been carefully, \nmeticulously planned with every kind of force they can bring to bear--\nmoney to run ads nationwide, sending people into living rooms in \nAlabama and Indiana and Illinois saying this is the toughest bill ever. \nIt is nowhere close to being as tough as the 2007 bill. It is weaker \nthan current law, as it lays before us today. They said all kinds of \nthings and how it was brought in committee, how it was brought to the \nfloor, that they have studied every bitty bit of it.\n  They have drafted talking points that they believe are poll tested. \nThey have talking points that people want to hear: that we are going to \ntreat compassionately people who are here illegally. Americans want to \ndo that. They do not want to try to uproot families who have been here \nfor years, who have children here, who have deep roots here. But they \nwant the lawlessness to end.\n  So they promised that. They have all kinds of promises in their \ntalking points, but they are not accurate, as I have pointed out \nrepeatedly. Senator Lee said last night it is not the talking points \nthat becomes law; it is these 1,000 pages that become law. What impact \nwill it have on the ability of law enforcement to have a lawful system \nin the future? That is the question.\n  Well, what do we know? Chris Crane with the association of ICE \nofficers, interior enforcement officers, said it will make the \nsituation worse, not better.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       ``We have folks who know the Senate really well, who know \n     the players, who have been through this before so they know \n     exactly what Senate staff needs,'' Ms. Munoz said. ``We are \n     deeply, deeply engaged.''\n\n  Well, maybe Ms. Munoz could not keep it to herself, she could not \nkeep the secret. The secret was supposed to be: We don't tell anybody \nPresident Obama is writing the bill because his administration has \nweakened law enforcement systematically. He has no credibility with the \nAmerican people on immigration reform. So even though they have been \nwriting it, doing all the staff work and supporting it continuously, \nthey did not want anybody to know. But maybe she is getting a little \nnervous. Maybe she and the President are afraid folks will not know it \nis their effort and so they could not keep it quiet any longer. I do \nnot know. Washington is a funny place.\n  It goes on to say in the article:\n\n       At one point, Mr. Pagano, Ms. Escobar and the other White \n     House advisers huddled for 45 minutes in the smaller of the \n     two rooms with Mr. Leahy's top aides. Working from \n     spreadsheets, they discussed each of the 10 amendments that \n     Mr. Leahy was likely to bring to the floor for a vote that \n     day.\n       ``When Republican amendments are filed and we are trying to \n     decide, 'Can we accept\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n     this? Can we accept this without some modifications?' they \n     are the ones who tell us--\n\n  ``They are the ones who tell us''--\n\n       `This is quite doable,' '' said one Democratic Senate \n     leadership aide, who requested anonymity to talk about \n     legislative strategy.\n\n  Well, that is very much affirming of the little overheard statement \non the hot mic in the Judiciary Committee. When an amendment came up \nthat would have some effect on the Gang of 8's bill--and they had all \nagreed they would vote down anything that was bad--Senator Schumer was \nheard to ask one of his staffers: Do the Republicans have a pass on \nthis?\n  What was he saying? He was saying: We will let these Republicans vote \nfor this tougher amendment because we have the votes to kill it anyway. \nWe are going to give them a pass so they do not have to stick with us.\n  And we had multiple references in the committee--members not of the \nGang of 8 saying: Well, I would like to vote for this amendment. I \nthink it is good for America. But I really cannot vote for it because \nit would upset the Gang of 8 and all their agreements that they have.\n  By the way, there is a misunderstanding of these agreements. The \nagreements are understood by most people to be agreements among the \nSenators. But that is not so. They met in exceedingly great length with \nMr. Zuckerberg and the high-tech industry. They met with the \nagriculture business, the farming interests for large corporate farms.\n  They met with La Raza. They met with the Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation. They met with groups wanting cheap labor. They met with \nall of those folks. Each one of them was asked to sign on to the bill. \nThey would not sign on to the bill until they got language in it that \nadvocated what they wanted. So they wanted to get their benefits in the \nbill. Once they got that, one for all, all for one, they signed in \nblood. We are going to support the bill, but don't you change my \nspecial interest.\n  So the Senators said: Ok. We got all of you special interests to \nagree, we all agree, we are not going to accept any substantial change \nto what you have in the bill. We will fight off any amendments. They \ncan make all of the arguments they want about what is good for America, \nbut we have told you, if you will support this bill, we are going to \ngive you what you want.\n  That is what the deal was all about. It is not good because the \nAmerican people are the ones who are not being taken care of in this \nlegislation. They discuss in this article, they asked themselves, can \nwe accept this or have we got some conflict out there we cannot accept? \nThe article goes on, ``Mr. Obama's political advisers say they are \nconfident he will get the credit he deserves if the bill passes this \nsummer. . . . ''\n  That is of big importance to him. They wanted to get credit. They \nhave a political agenda. But what is liable to happen is if the bill \npasses in its present form, it will do damage to the American working \nperson, families, legal residents, legal immigrants who are here trying \nto get a better payday. They are getting hammered. It could very well \nbe dangerous to be taking credit for the bill.\n  Finally, it concludes this way:\n\n       But White House and administration officials have been in \n     frequent touch with Republican senators as the lawmakers have \n     to come up with dozen of amendments on tighter border \n     security and other parts of the bill they deem insufficient. \n     White House officials declined to name them.\n\n  Declined to say which Republican Senators are over there begging and \nscraping to try to get their amendments approved. It goes on to say \nfinally, ``Mr. Pagano's team is planning to remain in Dirksen 201 for \nas long as the immigration bill remains on the Senate floor--\nclandestine, but not completely invisible.''\n  Another Democratic aide said:\n\n       People know where to find them. It's like going to the \n     nurse's office. They know where it is.\n\n  That is a complete revelation of what I have been saying all along; \nthat this is the way this bill has been put together and put together \nin secret by people not in connection with the American people. They \nare talking about polling data. They are talking about special agendas \nthey want to accomplish with the legislation. Somehow we have lost \nsight of the simple values the American people want to see in an \nimmigration bill. They wanted to see a lawful system. They want to see \nthose who wait in line be rewarded. They want a system that serves \nAmerican interests, a system that emphasizes immigration by people who \nare most likely to flourish in our society and be able to be successful \nand not be on welfare, not be dependent. Why, if we cannot accept \neverybody, why do we not create a system that substantially rewards \nthose who are going to be successful, who are going to pay more in \ntaxes than they will take out in revenue from the government and help \ncreate American wealth.\n  This bill claims to do that. But it is nowhere close to the Canadian \nbill which has about 70 percent of people there or 60-plus percent of \npeople coming into Canada on a merit-based system. But this bill will \nbe no more than 15 percent, maybe closer to 10 actually. But they claim \nit is a big move in that direction.\n  There has been further evidence on who wrote the bill. I will mention \nthis article, June 13 in the Miami Herald about Mr. Leon Fresco, a very \ntalented staff person who works for Senator Schumer who apparently has \nbecome the top person writing the bill. Mr. Fresco is from Miami \noriginally and apparently a man of talent and ability. But he is a key \nguy who is actually writing the bill. Who is writing the bill? Are not \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham trying to defend America, helping to \ndecide what to do in Libya and Syria? Chuck Schumer is writing tax \npolicy and doing Democratic campaigns. People are busy here. Who is \nactually writing the bill?\n\n       Fresco, now 35--\n\n  The article says--\n\n     led the brutal negotiating sessions, some of which lasted \n     until 2 a.m., with staffers of the so-called Gang of Eight \n     bipartisan team.\n\n  Staffers of the Gang of 8, bipartisan team.\n\n       He orchestrated several of the most delicate compromises, \n     including the final and most difficult agreement between the \n     labor and business interests, which allowed both Democrats \n     and Republicans to claim victory. It was his hands on the \n     keyboard drafting passages of the original 844-page bill that \n     the group ratified.\n\n  Now 1,000 pages.\n\n       He put in the longest of the long hours, said Chandler \n     Morse, the immigration staff negotiator for Republican Sen. \n     Jeff Flake of Arizona. He was the one that everyone called. \n     He was the one the Republicans called when they were mad \n     about how things were going--\n\n  Morse said--\n\n     and he was the one the Democrats called when they were mad \n     about how things were going. As most often is the case in \n     Washington, the most significant work on the deal happened \n     behind closed doors, far from the cameras. Senators gave--\n\n  This is important for us all to understand how legislation is \ndrafted, especially when it gets this big, this complicated, and \nattempts to be comprehensive on a matter that is as broad and as \nimportant and complex as immigration.\n\n       Senators gave their negotiators the principles to follow, a \n     framework, compromises they could and could not accept, and \n     then sent them off to find the solution on matters that have \n     plagued the nation for decades.\n\n  That is the way it has worked--turned it over to the staff. So when I \nasked my good friend, and I respect his ability and his skill, Senator \nSchumer, how many people would be admitted into America if the bill \npassed--I asked him that in Judiciary Committee--he would not say. I do \nnot know that he knew. I had estimated it would be over 30 million--\nabsolutely confident that was correct. CBO this past week has said it \nwould be 30 million in the first 10 years, three times the number of \npeople given legal status in America in the next 10 years over what the \nlaw says should be.\n\n  Under the current law, it should be 1 million a year, 10 million over \n10. If this bill is passed, 30 million over 10 will receive legal \nstatus and be put on a permanent path to citizenship--I mean a \npermanent path to citizenship. They may not get it in 10 years, but \nthey are close to it and on a path to it. Many of them will receive \ncitizenship--probably 5 million will receive citizenship within 5 \nyears.\n  The Herald goes on to say, Senator Schumer's good staff person--\n``Fresco set the group's agenda.'' He really went about driving the \nbill. So this impression that somehow it was a ``coming\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\ntogether'' of interested people without a real agenda that is seeking \nto fix our immigration system is not exactly correct, in my view.\n  My friend Karl Rove, from the Center for American Progress or \nsomething like that, raised a bunch of money for Crossroads to run ads \nin the last election that was supposed to elect Mr. Romney. Did not do \nso well, Karl. Sorry about that. Wish it had been more effective. I \nthink if Mr. Romney had looked the American people in the eye and said \none thing he might have been elected. I am sure Mr. Rove advised him \nnot to do this. If he had just simply said we are going to treat \ncompassionately the people who are in our country a long time, who are \nhere illegally, and we are going to work out something for them. But if \nyou elect me President, we are going to have a lawful system of \nimmigration, that is enforced. We are going to end the lawlessness and \nwe are going to serve the national interest. If you elect me, that is \nwhat is going to happen--just might have been Mr. Romney would have \nbeen elected President.\n  But the crew, the Crossroads guys who go to the country clubs and \ndrink with each other and plot and think they knew something about \npolitics, they have not been out talking to real people in decades. \nThey thought they knew better. They have been telling us all what we \nare supposed to do and what good politics is.\n  I think good politics is serving the American people's legitimate \ninterests. We are going to ask: Will this impact people's wages? It \nwill impact them in a way businesses like, because the wages will go \ndown so the employers will get to hire more people at lower wages.\n  Will unemployment--if this bill passes--go up or will more people be \nunemployed? Unemployment is going up if this bill passes. What about \nGDP? Of course, if we have 30 million new people in the country, we are \ngoing to have some increase in GDP. But per person, will GDP per person \ngo up or down? It goes down. That means wages will go down. This is \nwhat I have been saying, and what Professor Borjas at Harvard, \nProfessor Hero, Professor Matloff, and others have been saying \nrepeatedly.\n  The Congressional Budget Office just asserted that. The Congressional \nBudget Office said if this bill passes, unemployment goes up, wages go \ndown, GDP per capita goes down. What Professor Borjas said was, yes, \ncertain businesses will profit. They will get the benefit of increased \nGDP. But the working person will see their wages decline, and the \npoorer person will have the most decline.\n  I do not think this can be defended economically. But the fat cats \nwho fund American Crossroads, I am sure, see it differently. Obviously, \nthey do. Mr. Rove said this in his op-ed recently, just last week or \nso, ``It is also important that Republicans avoid calling a pathway to \ncitizenship amnesty.''\n  Thank you, Mr. Rove. I appreciate that advice. I have known Karl \nsince college. We were friends in college. I think he is one of the \nmost talented people I know. But I am not taking his advice about this \nmatter. I am still meeting with average American people every week.\n  He said Republicans should not use the word ``amnesty.'' Do not call \nthe pathway to citizenship amnesty.\n  We can call it amnesty, I think. He said:\n\n       Amnesty is the forgiveness of wrongdoing without penalty, \n     something President Ronald Reagan advocated and signed into \n     law with the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. The law \n     essentially told those here illegally that if they had \n     arrived in the United States prior to 1982 and wanted to \n     become citizens, simply raise your right hand.\n\n  He said Reagan didn't do that and that they had a much weaker plan \nthan this one. This one has penalties. This bill has penalties in it. \nHe says, ``They must pay $2,000 in fines: $500 when they surface, $500 \nif they want to remain in America after 6 years, and $1,000 when \nfinally eligible to apply for a green card'' 10 years later. So that is \n$2,000 to be paid over 10 years. This is the big fine that is going to \nbe paid. Under the 1987 law, the fine was I believe about $6,000 \nminimum, $8,000 maximum per person.\n  This bill is much weaker on fines and penalties than the 2007 bill. \nThis bill is much weaker. These fines are token fines--about $18 a \nmonth total. That is the penalty you are paying to be given a \nguaranteed pathway to citizenship.\n  I would say it is certainly not a very big penalty, but it is kind of \ninteresting. Ed Meese, a great Attorney General and a friend of Ronald \nReagan's, wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal to respond to Mr. \nRove's recollection of the Ronald Reagan amnesty bill. I think he was \nAttorney General at that time--if not, he soon would be. I believe he \nwas Attorney General at that time, and before that, he was one of \nPresident Reagan's closest advisors from California, a former \nprosecutor, and was very knowledgeable about how the legal and \nprosecutorial system worked. He said this:\n\n       I recall the 1986 Immigration Act rather differently. Karl \n     Rove's recollection of the 1986 Immigration Reform and \n     Control Act is, shall we say, highly selective. That law, he \n     writes, ``essentially told those here illegally that if they \n     had arrived in the U.S. prior to 1982 and wanted to become \n     citizens, simply raise your right hand.''\n\n  That is what Karl Rove said.\n  Mr. Meese goes on to say:\n\n       [Karl Rove] asserts that the Gang of Eight bill is \n     different because it ``has plenty of penalties and hurdles \n     for those here illegally who seek citizenship.''\n       Well, I was there in '86. I read that bill carefully. (We \n     did that back then.) And I can tell you that Mr. Rove's \n     blithe description of the bill is way off the mark. The 1986 \n     act didn't turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. \n     It granted temporary resident status only to those who could \n     prove they had resided continuously in America for five \n     years.\n\n  Let me say what this bill does. If you could prove in 1986 that you \nhad been here for 5 years, then you could stay even though you had \nentered illegally. This bill says that if you entered the United States \nillegally December 31, 2011, 18 months ago, you will be put on a path \nto guaranteed citizenship and given immediate legal status. You don't \nhave to prove that you have a job, that you ever had a job. You don't \nhave to prove you have family here, roots here, or any connection here.\n  Mr. Meese goes on to say, referring to the 1986 law:\n\n       After 18 months, their status could be upgraded to \n     permanent residency, and only after another five years could \n     they become U.S. citizens.\n\n  This bill delays citizenship further because when you become a \ncitizen, you are entitled to all the welfare programs. The government \nand the sponsors of the bill really felt they wanted to push \ncitizenship out so they could say that immigrants won't receive \nwelfare. It won't impact the Treasury in the first 10 years of the \nbill, and we normally score costs to the government over 10 years. They \nmoved it outside the 10-year window.\n  Mr. Meese goes on to say:\n\n       But advancement to citizenship was not automatic. \n     Immigrants had to satisfy various requirements along the way. \n     They had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, \n     understand civics, pass a medical exam and register for \n     military selective service. Those with convictions for a \n     felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible.\n       Sound familiar? It's pretty much the same ``penalties and \n     hurdles'' set forth by the Gang of Eight. Today they call it \n     a ``roadmap to citizenship.'' Ronald Reagan called it \n     ``amnesty.''\n  Apparently Ronald Reagan himself in 1986 called the bill amnesty. \nThey didn't try to deny that.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The '86 reform bill also had supposedly ``rigorous'' border \n     security and immigration law enforcement provisions. So how \n     did that pan out? On the day Reagan signed ``comprehensive'' \n     reform into law, only one thing changed: Millions of unlawful \n     immigrants gained ``legal'' status. The promised crackdowns \n     on security and enforcement never happened. Only amnesty \n     prevailed.\n\n  That is what we are afraid is going to happen with this bill. It is \nso similar, isn't it, in the way they have laid it out.\n  Mr. Meese said:\n\n       Since the '86 amnesty, the number of illegal immigrants has \n     quadrupled. That should teach Congress a very important \n     lesson: Amnesty ``bends'' the rule of law. And bending the \n     rule of law to reach a ``comprehensive'' deal winds up \n     provoking wholesale breaking of the law. Ultimately, it \n     encourages millions more to risk entering the country \n     illegally in the hope that one day they, too, might receive \n     amnesty.\n       On legislation as important as this, lawmakers must take \n     the time to read the bill, not rely on others' \n     characterizations of what it says. We can't have Congress \n     ``pass the bill to find out what's in it.''\n\n  That is what the former Attorney General of the United States said. \nHe served Ronald Reagan, and he was\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nthere actively when that happened, when that bill passed the last time. \nIt is very similar to what Senator Grassley, who is here in the Senate, \nsaid happened and why he can't vote for this bill today.\n  I believe there has been far too little discussion about the most \nimportant value of this bill, the most important result; that is, what \nwill be the impact on the American people? Whose interests are we \nserving?\n  One witness before the Judiciary Committee a number of years ago \nsaid: You tell me what you want. If it is to serve the interests of \npeople who are here illegally and those who want to come here, I can \ntell you how to do that--let them come. It tends to be in their \ninterest. Personal safety is better in America than most places in the \nworld. Opportunities to make money are better. The welfare benefits and \nthe Social Security safety net are stronger here. It is to their \nbenefit to come to America. We know that. If you want to serve the \nnational interests of America, then we can talk about that. I can tell \nyou some principles that you should include in your bill if you want to \ndo that.\n  Of course, one of the things he talked about was a merit-based \nsystem--the way you try to identify the people who have the skills \neducationally, academically, and the language proficiency that would \nallow them to have the best chance to succeed. We haven't talked about \nthat enough. We need to be asking what the impact will be on the \nAmerican people. That has not been discussed in any serious way.\n  It does not appear that the Gang of 8 ever sat down with the Nation's \nleading economists who have studied these issues because there are \nvarious issues that are crystal clear as we analyze these issues from \nan economic standpoint--peer-reviewed studies, not one-page op-eds by \nsome part-time economist opining to advance the agenda of this \nadministration or this legislation. Those are not the kinds of things \nwe need to be relying on. Those are just talking points. They are just \nputting out talking points. What do real economist who have actually \nstudied the Department of Labor statistics--what do they say? That has \nnot been discussed. Indeed, our sponsors of the bill won't even tell us \nhow many people will be admitted under this bill. We have had to get \nthe data from studying the language, talking to experts, and now this \nweek, finally, the CBO score.\n  Let me be frank. The reality is, the cold reality is, I think, this: \nthat Mr. Trumka, the top union man, he was involved, as his designees \nwere, to bless the bill finally. And he eventually did so, placing his \ngoal of citizenship for millions who have entered the country illegally \nover the welfare of American workers. I am afraid that is what he did. \nHe decided that political advancement for labor interests was more \nimportant than the impact it would have on American workers today.\n  And the business interests--what do they favor? Do you read the \nbusiness pages? They are always talking about wages--wages going up, \nwages going down. For a businessman, wages going down is good news; \nwages going up, bad news.\n  What should Senators seek? What is the goal for the American people? \nWages go up. Wages go down. Unemployment--do we want it to go up, \ntherefore making more labor available, resulting inevitably in lower \nwages, or do we want unemployment to go down so more American people \nare finding jobs? Do we want a tight labor market or do we want a loose \nlabor market? What is the public policy that the Congress of the United \nStates should be advocating? I understand what the business guys would \nwant. They want more great workers out there. They want to have 10 of \nthem apply for every job. They want to pick the very best one, and they \nwant to pay as low a wage as they can pay and still get that good \nworker. That is free market. I tend to favor free market. I believe in \nthat. But nobody can ever suggest that bringing in large amounts of \nforeign labor doesn't create more labor in the United States and \ninevitably reduce wages. The Congressional Budget Office found that. \nProfessor Borjas and others have found that. It is indisputable.\n  So Mr. Zuckerberg and the group out there in the West in Silicon \nValley and the agribusiness groups that want to continue to move this \nforward--they have their interests in getting workers at the lowest \nprice. I asked the other day if Mr. Zuckerberg would put clearly on his \nsite, Facebook, actual job openings from corporations all over the \ncountry and the salaries they would pay. I think these businesses would \nfind a lot more American workers than they say they can find. I don't \nbelieve he has to hire so many people from abroad to come over and work \nfor 3 years, go back to their home countries, and provide, basically, a \nlarge supply of low-wage labor for these jobs.\n  Maybe I am wrong. Maybe Mr. Zuckerberg should try. If he clearly put \nit out there, he might find that in this time of high unemployment, \nwith college graduates wondering where their next job is going to be, \nhe might find he and others in Silicon Valley have some pretty good job \napplicants out there.\n  La Raza wants amnesty and citizenship. They are the advocacy group. \nThey are not interested in borders and they are not interested in \nsovereignty issues. They are interested simply in being able to have \neverybody come. And they are against enforcement.\n  Ms. Munoz, who is now a top director for immigration policy in the \nWhite House for President Obama, said a number of years ago when she \nwas at La Raza that it was immoral to have workplace enforcement. So \nthe person who is supposed to be in charge of all of this believes that \nrequiring a business only to hire people who are here lawfully--that \nthat it is immoral, and she demanded that the law be changed?\n  This is the status we are in today. We need to understand the forces \nthat are at work. There are a whole lot on the far left, and they want \nto have a North American union. That is not talked about much now, but \nin 2007 it was out there. There is an open borders crowd, a survival-\nof-the-fittest crowd. These are people who believe in bringing in more \npeople, and believe that those who end up on the top will get cheaper \nwages. I will do fine, and I am not worried about other folks, whether \ntheir wages go up or not--the vast majority of American citizens. I am \njust not worried about that, I am going to end up on top. We are going \nto make more money if we have more people here. I don't think that is a \nhealthy approach.\n  National Review, a great conservative organization, wrote a recent \neditorial and made this observation. It caught my attention because I \nhave been thinking a lot about it lately. It said we are a nation--a \nnation--with an economy that we want to see do well. We are not an \neconomy with a nation. A nation creates a binding series of interests, \nand we call on our citizens to go fight wars and their children to go \nfight wars and put their lives on the line for the Nation. They serve \nour country, and the country owes them certain protections and a chance \nto be successful and a chance to be able to make a decent wage with a \nhealth care plan, with a retirement plan, so they can take care of \ntheir families, take care of their children, to raise them and send \nthem to college. A nation has those obligations.\n\n  So to simply say that millions can come to our country illegally, \nmillions can come legally in levels that jeopardize, perhaps, the \nworking majority of American citizens, that pulls down their salaries \nand does not allow them to prosper, is difficult for me to understand. \nHow can that be justified? I don't see how we can justify that.\n  I am not against immigration. We do 1 million people a year in this \ncountry. I think that is about right. We need to shift it some so we \nare getting people who have a better chance to succeed in America, and \nwe need to end the illegal flow, and then we would see, perhaps, a \nlittle tightening of the job market and maybe we would see some wages \nstart going up for a change. Wages have been dropping consistently \nsince 1999. This bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nwill drive down wages more over the next decade than if it wasn't \npassed.\n  I think we have a responsibility as national leaders not to \nradicalize some survival of the fittest, utterly open-borders theory of \nAmerican law and policy. I don't think that is right. We have the \nconservative establishment, some of them in the business crowd, and my \nfriend, Karl Rove, and we just disagree on this issue. I love Karl. He \nis so smart and he is so committed to America, but I think he doesn't \nget\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nthis correctly. He is not thinking clearly. He is rubbing shoulders and \nelbows with folks who have different agendas and haven't thought \nthrough the impact on the American citizen.\n  The only interest being ignored in this whole process, it seems to \nme, is the public interest--the interest of the American people, the \nmiddle class who are struggling today. These special groups have had \ntheir special interests heard. They have been meeting in secret. They \ngot the Gang of 8 to agree, they got the Gang of 8 to accept what they \nwanted, and they have agreed to put up money. They have agreed to \nadvocate for the legislation and to keep pushing for it. But where are \nthe law enforcement officers? Where were the good folks who represent \nthe working people of America? So the missing interest throughout this \nprocess has been the people's interest.\n  I look forward to seeing--we are now at 1 o'clock--if we are going to \nget a special amendment that is going to fix things. Actually, I don't \nthink the sponsors of this amendment have claimed to fix everything. It \ndoesn't have anything to do with the fundamental issues I just talked \nabout, about the ability of a nation to prosper, to take care of its \ncitizens in an effective way. This amendment doesn't deal with that in \nany effective way, but we will see what it includes, whether it makes \nthe situation better.\n  We are going to look past the talking points. We are going to look to \nthe actual language of this amendment that--at now 1:05 p.m.--we \nhaven't seen, but which we thought we would see last night at 6 \no'clock.\n  I thank the Chair, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the Leahy amendment No. 1183 \nis now pending; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                      Amendment 1183, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I modify my amendment with the changes I \nhave at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1183), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 3 and all that follows through the end, and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum required under rule XXII be waived; and the vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the Leahy amendment, as modified, occur at 5:30 \np.m., Monday, June 24.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for his modified amendment. Senator \nLeahy has moved this bill from the beginning and certainly we have all \nlooked with pride at the Judiciary Committee in marking up this \nbill. He was here last night late on the Senate floor. He is a proud \nSenator from Vermont, and rightfully so.\n\n  I thank profusely the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, \nSenator Charles Schumer, who has been the quarterback, the leader of \nthe Gang of 8. The Gang of 8, under his direction, negotiated the basis \nfor this bill, and it is now the pending Leahy amendment.\n  This amendment will put to rest any remaining credible concerns about \nborder security. Senator McCain said yesterday: ``If they can't accept \nthese provisions, then border security is not the problem.''\n  I thank all of the Members of the Gang of 8: Senators Schumer, \nDurbin, Menendez, Bennet, McCain, Graham, Rubio, and Flake. I think it \nspeaks volumes that Lindsey Graham stepped out, even though he faces a \nreelection effort. It was an act of courage, as it was with all of the \nSenators, but especially I wish to focus attention on him, as I have \njust done.\n  I thank Senators Corker and Hoeven for their yeoman's work, working \nwith the Gang of 8, to come up with the product we now have. The \nproduct we have now is the work of the Gang of 8 and the Gang of 2, \nwith their friends.\n  I have always been impressed with Bob Corker. I told him about that \nearlier today. Since he stepped foot in this body, he has wanted to \nlegislate, and for a lot of reasons he hasn't been able to do that. But \nhere is legislation at its best. He was mayor of a city. As a result of \nthat, he understands on any level of government that compromise is the \nway we get things done.\n  I always refer to Senator Hoeven as Governor Hoeven. I think it is \nremarkable that he is here with the background he has. He too \nunderstands how important it is to work to get things done. His \nexperience is more than just being part of a legislature, it is working \nwith a legislative body.\n  So I admire what both of these fine men have done. But for them we \ncouldn't have gotten this done. These Senators have charted a path to a \nbroad bipartisan vote for this measure. They have followed the model we \nhave used too infrequently in this body to pass legislation, including \nthe Violence Against Women Act, the Marketplace Fairness Act, and the \nfarm bill. Next week we are going to add immigration as another example \nof how to get things done. I hope it portends well for the future of \nthis august body that we all so love but in which we have been \ndisappointed in recent years.\n  Even with this broad bipartisan support, the broad bipartisan \nmajorities as we have for this package that is a wonderful product, \nthere are still a few who continue the take-no-prisoners opposition to \nany cooperation. We worked late into the night last night on a \npotential unanimous consent agreement to allow for processing \namendments. I have Senators over here who want to offer amendments. \nThey have ideas on how to improve this bill. We have heard from some of \nthe Republicans that they also want to offer amendments. We should be \nable to do that.\n  Now, as I have indicated to the two Republican Senators, Mr. Corker \nand Mr. Hoeven, there is still an opportunity to do that. We are going \nto continue to try to work to allow people to offer amendments before \nwe finish this legislation. Frankly, most of them would not pass, but \nthat is not the point. They should be able to offer amendments.\n  I hope we can come up with a list of amendments to move forward with \nin the body. We are going to move forward with the legislation \nregardless, but it would be nice if people who are elected to this body \nhave the opportunity to offer some amendments.\n  So we are going to continue to work on that, but we haven't been able \nto overcome the objections of a small minority of Senators. The \nopposition of this small group is not going to stop this bill from \nmoving forward. That is why I have taken steps this morning to set in \nmotion a process to bring this measure to finality within the next \nweek.\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\n  So the Senate will vote Monday evening on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the Leahy border security amendment. We will continue to \nwork to get a unanimous consent agreement to help process this \nlegislation. Barring any further agreement, the Senate will vote on \ncloture on the committee substitute early Wednesday and cloture on the \nbill on Thursday. We will finish the bill, I repeat, before the recess.\n  In the annals of history--and there has been a lot of stuff to go \nthrough this body over the 230-plus years we have been a country, but \nwhen those history books are written, this legislation--this \nlegislation we are going to pass in this body in 1 week--is historic. \nWhat we have done is good for our country in so many different ways.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office demonstrated a couple of days ago, \nit will be the largest boost to our economy we have seen in a long \ntime--up to almost $1 trillion--to reduce the debt. In the process we \nare going to increase the security of this great Nation.\n  I have indicated that Chuck Schumer is the subcommittee chair. Who \ndid he replace? Ted Kennedy. Ted Kennedy tried so hard to get something \ndone, and he was chairman of this subcommittee for decades. So Ted \nKennedy, I am sure, is going to wait until next Friday, but he is going \nto smile at all of us because this is a remarkably good piece of work \nand something he tried to do for a long time.\n  This country is a nation of immigrants. I know everybody is in a \nhurry, but I have to say just a couple more things.\n  My wonderful wife is here in America today because her father came \nhere from Russia. He and his people were persecuted. He came here as \nIsrael Goldfarb. That was his name. He, as did a lot of immigrants, \nchanged his name. I only knew him as Earl Gould. I don't know what he \naccomplished in his short life here--he died as a young man--but one \nthing he did accomplish, he fathered my wife, my wonderful wife, an \nonly child. As a result, I have five wonderful children and 16 \ngrandchildren.\n  That is what immigration is all about. That is why this country of \nours has found immigration as a source of vitality, not a burden. This \nis what has been part of America's genius that is different than any \nother country. That is our destiny.\n  I am very proud of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished majority leader, and I will be speaking further on this \nmatter later in the coming week. I thank him and everybody who worked \nwith him for getting us here.\n  I am reminded today that legislating is about making tough choices; \nit is not about standing on the sidelines and complaining that we can't \nget a perfect solution enacted. I have been privileged to serve in this \ngreat body for 38 years because of the trust of the people of Vermont. \nIn my time here, those 38 years, I have rarely seen such commitment to \nan issue as I have seen over the last 6 months to comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I think of the dozens of witnesses who came before the Judiciary \nCommittee, such as Jose Antonio Vargas and Gaby Pacheco, who called on \nthe Senate to achieve bipartisan immigration reform. I think of the \nhours we spent, Republicans and Democrats alike, in the Judiciary \nCommittee considering amendments and debating this bill. What was \ninitially a proposal from the Gang of 8 became, through an extensive \ncommittee process, the product of a Group of 18. Since the bill was \nreported to the Senate floor, bipartisan talks have continued and the \ncircle of Members supporting it has continued to grow.\n  I will speak next week more about those Members, but I hope my friend \nand neighbor from New York, Senator Schumer, will not be embarrassed \nwhen I mention something very few people know about him. He has a 10-\npound battery on his cell phone. It is the only way he could keep \nmaking those calls that harass and nudge and move us, at all hours of \nthe day and night. So I just gave away that secret. That is the way he \nis able to do it--that and the fact he hasn't slept for several weeks.\n  Senators have been negotiating for days, late into the night, trying \nto gain more Republican support for this important immigration reform \nlegislation. Senators Hoeven and Corker put together an aggressive \npackage that will add new Republican support to our bipartisan effort, \nand for that progress I am grateful. However, it is an understatement \nto say that this is not the amendment I would have drafted. I am \ndisappointed in many parts of it. The modification to the Leahy \namendment before us reads like a Christmas wish list for Halliburton.\n  I am sure there are Federal contracting firms high-fiving at the \nprospect of all of the spending demanded by some of our friends on the \nother side in this amendment. The litany of expensive services, \ntechnology, and hardware mandated by this package is combined with--the \nthing that bothers me--an inexplicable waiver of many of our normal \ncontracting rules. That is a potential we must watch out for--for waste \nand fraud.\n  It is astounding that we have not learned the hard lessons we learned \nin Iraq. All of us should remember the disgraceful conduct demonstrated \nby some private companies in Iraq--companies that will now be seeking \ncontracts here--which was uncovered by the work of the special \ninspector general for Iraq. I believe all of my friends, both \nRepublicans and Democrats on this floor, will join with me in saying \nthese border provisions are going to require significant congressional \noversight, and I add oversight of the inspectors general. It is when \nthe inspectors general looked into Iraq that we found out what was \ngoing on.\n  I worry that when many of my friends talk about border security, the \nhigh cost of these projects are absent from the discussion. Yet when we \ntalk about programs that help children who live near the poverty line \nor people who need medical research for what otherwise would be an \nincurable disease, then suddenly fiscal concerns are paramount. I think \nwe hear too much about spending money on one border rather than coming \nup with a comprehensive solution that takes pressure off that border.\n  This package is border security on steroids. Some are calling it a \nsurge, and that military reference makes sense because it is going to \nmilitarize hundreds of American communities in the Southwest. But with \na border surge--I say this as a compliment to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle--comes additional Republican support for the rest of \nthe essential pieces to reunite families, provide a path to citizenship \nfor millions, and spur significant job growth in our country. And that \nI do support, and I thank all of the Senators, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, for helping to bring that about.\n  One of the reasons I stayed on as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is because of this once-in-a-generation chance for us to \ntruly reform our immigration system. It is a tragic problem that calls \nout for a comprehensive solution. There are too many people, too many \nfamilies kept apart because of our broken immigration system, and there \nare too many people living in the shadows who should be allowed to gain \ntheir citizenship. We cannot fail. We owe it to them--to people like \nJose and Gaby and so many others--to get legislation passed.\n\n  So while I do not agree with many of the border demands, I will \nsupport this modification of my amendment because I am making the tough \nchoice that it is better than not making progress toward passage of \nthis critical bill. But I do not want anybody to mistake what I am \nsaying--there are many, many areas where both Republicans and Democrats \nhave come together, and that I applaud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, we have now filed the Hoeven-Corker border \nsecurity amendment. I believe the first order of business for \nimmigration reform is to secure the border. Americans want immigration \nreform. Of that there is no doubt. But they want us to get it right. \nThat means first and foremost securing the border.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from the great State of Tennessee \nfor his ceaseless efforts and untiring work to really craft an \namendment that puts\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nborder security first. That is exactly what we have worked to do.\n  I also thank the cosponsors we have been able to bring onboard for \nthis effort. They include Senator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, \nSenator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Flake, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Senator \nDean Heller, Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Senator \nMark Kirk. But also, on a bipartisan basis, we have Democratic Senators \nas well: Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Mark Pryor, Senator Mark Begich, \nand Senator Joe Donnelly.\n  We thank all of these cosponsors who show this is a bipartisan effort \nto secure the border as a first step in comprehensive immigration \nreform. That is what this is all about.\n  We provide five significant criteria--some have called them triggers, \nrequirements, conditions--that must be met to ensure the border is \nsecure before there are any green cards. Before illegal immigrants can \nget to a permanent legal status--a green card status--we have tough \nrequirements that must be met to ensure the border is secured.\n  First and foremost, it is a comprehensive southern border security \nplan. It is $3.2 billion worth of technology, planes, unmanned \naircraft, sensors--all on the border, spelled out in this legislation--\nthat ensures we have a secure border. That must be met before there are \nany green cards, and that is where we start; in addition, 20,000 more \nBorder Patrol agents on the border to not only detect people trying to \ncome across but to turn them back; also, 700 miles of fencing on the \nborder. These are things Republicans have repeatedly asked for as part \nof securing the border. We have put them right in the bill.\n  In addition, we have to have a mandatory national E-Verify system in \nplace and operating so that we enforce workplace law, so we not only \nhave a secure border, but we take away the incentive to come here \nillegally because you will not be able to get a job. That, combined \nwith a guest worker program that works, means, then, when people come, \nthey come legally, and they go back home.\n  Finally, we have an electronic entry-exit system at all of the \ninternational airports and seaports.\n  All of those things must be met before legal permanent resident \nstatus, before green card status. This is about securing the border \nfirst.\n  Again, I want to particularly thank my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee Senator Corker for all his hard efforts, as well as all of \nour cosponsors on this legislation. We are reaching out to everybody, \nand we want to work together on a bipartisan basis.\n  This is about securing the border first and doing comprehensive \nimmigration reform and doing it right.\n  With that, I yield the floor and again note the tremendous efforts of \nmy distinguished colleague, the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to reciprocate and talk about the \nwonderful leadership the Senator from North Dakota has provided. I have \nenjoyed working with him. I have enjoyed his foresight, his \nrationality, his reasoning, his common sense--all of the traits he \ndisplayed as Governor of the great State of North Dakota. And I thank \nhim for his friendship and for the opportunity to work on a piece of \nlegislation that--candidly, I am more proud to have done what I have \ndone over the last week than anything I have done since I have been in \nthe Senate. So I thank him for that.\n  I will just ask the people--I know we have had a lot of people on the \nfloor who have criticized this legislation without reading it. I know \nit has been called a magic amendment. I will just say to people who \ncare about border security--and obviously numbers of people on our side \nof the aisle care deeply about that--read the bill.\n  I thank the majority leader for his leadership in this effort, for \nhis comments earlier. By filing cloture today on this amendment, it is \ngoing to give everybody in this body and in the Nation the opportunity \nto read this piece of legislation for 75 hours before the cloture vote \noccurs.\n  So I thank the leader for the process he has put in place and for his \ncomments.\n  I thank the Senator from New York. My last call last night, at 12:33, \nwas with him, and my first call early, early this morning was with him. \nI thank him for the way he has worked with us to try to work through \nRepublican sensibilities so that we have a bill that not only meets the \nneeds of the Democratic side of the aisle, but we have a bill that \nmeets the needs of the Republican side of the aisle, which is why we \nall came here. I thank him for his leadership and his earnest efforts \nin this regard.\n  I want to say that I believe--and we were talking about this \nearlier--I believe we do have a historic opportunity to deal with the \nissues of security that many of our citizens across the country care \nabout but at the same time allow 11 million people to come out of the \nshadows and work in the light and be a part of this great, great Nation \nin a way that has dignity and respect.\n  So I thank all involved.\n  I want to again turn to the Senator from North Dakota and thank him \nfor his relentless efforts over the last 9 days and tell him that I \nlook forward to helping cause this to go across the finish line. I know \nthis is just the beginning. There are going to be some trials and \ntribulations, and there is going to be a lot of controversy. I \nunderstand that. But I think all of us came here to solve the big \nproblems of our Nation. To me, that is a privilege, it is an honor, and \ncertainly it has been an honor to work with the Senator.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \nhis hard work, his diligence. One of the hallmarks of a truly \noutstanding legislator is the ability to walk in the other person's \nshoes. It is something we should all try to do, to see why the other \nside thinks differently than you and come to meet somewhere in the \nmiddle. That is what my good friend from Tennessee has done throughout \nthe years he has been in the Senate, and he has had no finer moment--I \ncompletely agree--than this strong effort on immigration reform. I want \nto say the same about my colleague from North Dakota. I know for both \nof them this is not easy. This is courageous, and they are doing the \nright thing for their country, and with that, there is a great deal of \nsatisfaction.\n  I thank our great leader. His steadfast, quiet style helps us get \nthrough just about anything in this body. He is my friend, and he is a \ngreat leader. I am proud to serve under him.\n  I thank the chairman of our committee as well for his steadfast \nleadership and the other seven members of the Gang of 8. We have come \nto become friends. We have argued with each other, we have bonded with \neach other but, most of all, we are united in this effort to make our \nNation better by fixing our broken immigration system. It is a wacky \nsystem. It turns away people who will create jobs and lets people cross \nthe border who will take away American jobs. It makes no sense.\n  We are now ready to move forward further with this amendment. The \nbipartisan ship of comprehensive immigration reform, launched in \nJanuary, continues to sail forward with the acceptance by the Gang of 8 \nof this Hoeven-Corker amendment. Let's make no mistake about it, \nnothing in this amendment or the bill satisfies anyone completely, but \ntogether the amendment and the bill provide a sturdy craft that will \nweather the upcoming storms we face and get us finally to our long \ndesired port--comprehensive immigration reform signed into law.\n  It is easy for people to focus on what they do not like in this bill. \nThat is what has sunk effort after effort after effort. Instead, I urge \nall my colleagues--from the most liberal to the most conservative, from \nthe most Democratic to the most Republican--to look at the so many \npositives in this amendment and this bill.\n  The American people have told us over and over that they will be fair \nand accept commonsense solutions for the 11 million living in the \nshadows and for future immigration reform if they are convinced there \nwill not be wave after wave of future illegal immigration. That is just \nwhat this bill does. That is why it is a turning point.\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\n  This amendment--the offering of this amendment--is a turning point. \nWe have always known there would be large numbers of Democrats who \nsupport final passage of this bill in the Senate. But this amendment \ngives us the real chance of getting a very significant number of our \nRepublican colleagues.\n  I believe a large bipartisan vote in this body will change the \ndynamic in the House to make them far more amenable to passing \nimmigration reform. I believe a large bipartisan vote in this body will \nwake up our colleagues on the other side in the House, ask them to live \nup to their responsibility to fix our broken immigration system for the \ngood of the country. Hopefully, as Congressmen look at how their \nSenators voted, they will be influenced by it and take the same kind of \ncourageous stand the Senators from Tennessee and North Dakota and many \nothers have taken.\n  There have been three main objections to comprehensive immigration \nreform as we have moved forward: first, that the process was not going \nto be open; second, that it was going to cost the taxpayers a lot of \nmoney; and third, that it would not close down our borders. I believe, \nwith this amendment, we answer all three resoundingly.\n  On the first, the fact that we need an open process, this process has \nbeen tremendously, completely transparently open. The bill was filed \nway in advance of the committee markup of the bill. Amendment after \namendment was debated and debated and debated. Many amendments were \naccepted, many from the other side. Many were rejected. But it was an \nopen process.\n  The leader has endeavored to make that process be open on the floor \nas well. Some others--some of whom have actually complained about the \nlack of openness of the process--have delayed our ability to offer \namendments, but hopefully that will end soon.\n  The second objection--that it will cost money--that was successfully \ndebunked this week by the CBO report on this bill. It said three \nthings. It said, first, it will reduce the deficit by $175 billion in \nthis decade and another $700 billion in the next decade. There is a lot \nmore deficit reduction in this immigration reform bill than many other \nbills we have voted for where the specific goal was deficit reduction.\n  Second, it will grow our economy. Imagine, it is almost like an \nelixir. GDP grows over 3 percent this decade and another 5 percent in \nthe next decade. What we have struggled to do to get even a quarter as \nmuch growth with programs that either spend money or cut taxes--but the \nvitality of humanity, particularly the humanity that wishes to risk all \nand come to America, is perhaps the greatest economic engine of them \nall, and the CBO recognizes what that will do.\n  Third, it will create jobs. At a time when we worry about the future \njob market, we worry about the ratio of retirees to those who are \nworking, this bill is the best antidote.\n  Finally, on the border, there is no bill tougher on the border, there \nis no proposal tougher on the border than this one. We create a virtual \nhuman fence. There are enough border agents here to be on guard from \nSan Diego, CA, to Brownsville, TX, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 \ndays a year.\n  They will only be 1,000 feet apart for every minute the clock ticks. \nNo one--no one--will be able to cross the border with that number of \npeople on the border. It is a virtual human fence. Many have asked for \nthat to protect the border.\n  So these have been the three major objections. We have answered them \nall resoundingly. We have answered the fact that the process may not be \nopen by making it transparent and open. We have answered the view that \nit will cost money by showing it will save money. We have answered the \nview that the border will not be secured by the addition of the Hoeven-\nCorker amendment.\n  There is only one other objection to these three objections. Lack of \nopenness in the process, costing the government money, not closing the \nborder are the stated objections. There is only one other objection. It \nis usually unstated. That is the earned path to citizenship. If \nportions of this bill were voted on separately, most of our colleagues \nwho oppose the bill would vote for them. They would certainly vote for \nmore border protection. They would certainly vote for deficit \nreduction. They would certainly vote for a future immigration flow that \ncreates jobs. So why are they voting against it? They simply do not \nbelieve in a path to citizenship.\n  That is fine, but it ought to be stated. The beauty of the Corker-\nHoeven amendment is it rips bare the real objection. It is no longer \nborder security. It is, I do not want a path to citizenship that some \nmay profess. So let's debate it on that issue.\n  By the way, it is no mistake, no accident, that the House wants to do \nit in pieces, individually, because they do not believe in a path to \ncitizenship, those who profess that.\n  But mark my words here today. No bill--no bill--on immigration reform \nwill be signed into law by the President without a path to citizenship. \nIt can be an earned path, it can be a tough path, it can be a difficult \npath, but it is a real path. It is essential for any immigration \nreform. To those who think they can get the pieces of this bill on \ncomprehensive immigration reform without a path to citizenship, they \nare sadly mistaken.\n  In conclusion, we are just halfway through our process. We still have \na long road ahead. The good ship SS Immigration Reform will weather \nmany more storms. But the addition of Corker-Hoeven gives us new masts, \nnew wind in our sails. I am confident that if we stay united, Democrats \nand Republicans of good will, we will see, before the end of this year, \ncomprehensive immigration reform signed into law by the President of \nthe United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves, you know, I study legislation. I \nhave worked on this matter for many years. As the leader, I have \ndirected more floor attention to this than any other issue. So I \nunderstand the bill quite well.\n  But one thing I want to ensure people know before my friend from New \nYork leaves the floor is this: I always thought we could pass a bill. I \ntold my friend that. But I think Senator Schumer--no one, not one of \n100 Senators, no one other than the Senator from New York thought we \ncould get 70 votes.\n  I doubted he could get 70 votes. He knows I doubted that. No one in \nthis body thought we could get 68, 72 votes except him. So I have \nwatched a lot of things on the floor as long as I have been here in \nCongress--31, not as long as the Senator from New York, but I have been \nin the Senate longer than he has.\n  For the vision to see this could take place is remarkable. I so \nadmire his ability to hang tight when everyone was saying, leave this \nalone, just get a bill passed. He was not satisfied with that. That was \nnot good enough. Because Senator Schumer alone--alone--if there is \nsomeone I missed, he can tell me about that, but I do not know of \nanyone who agreed with him.\n  So, Mr. Subcommittee Chair, thank you for a vision, and for this big \nvote we are going to have. I am not sure that we could have gotten it \ndone. Perhaps. But this is a pathway to satisfying the demands of this \ncountry, the demands of this country. What is in this legislation is \nagreed to by a vast majority of Democrats, a vast majority of \nRepublicans, and a vast majority of Independents. So I thank the \nSenator for his vision.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, I thank the leader for his very kind words. He is \na kind man as well as a strong man. I thank him for being my friend, \nfor being a great leader.\n  I will add one additional group to others who thought I could put \ntogether a proposal that would get 70 votes--we are not there yet; we \nare climbing each day; we are not there yet. That is my staff.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4981-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

STAVRIDIS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a great \nAmerican on his retirement. ADM James G. Stavridis will retire at the \nend of this month after a distinguished Navy career lasting 37 years. \nDuring that career, he commanded forces at several levels, including a \ndestroyer, a destroyer squadron, and a carrier strike group.\n  He has also held significant joint commands, including U.S. Southern \nCommand and, most recently, U.S. European Command, EUCOM, and Supreme \nAllied Commander in Europe. Of note, he was the first Navy officer to \ncommand EUCOM.\n  At EUCOM, Admiral Stavridis had the very difficult task of ensuring \nthat the members of the coalition operating in Afghanistan, the \nInternational Security Assistance Force, ISAF, pulled together as a \ncoherent team to support NATO strategic objectives there. In this \nposition, Admiral Stavridis was a steady voice upon whom we could \nalways rely for an accurate assessment of the facts on the ground.\n  Admiral Stavridis was a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, the Naval War College, and the National War College. He also \nwas an outstanding student at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, \nwhere he earned two degrees: a doctor of philosophy and a master of \narts in law and diplomacy.\n  Admiral Stavridis has been a strong leader of the men and women in \nhis commands, but he has also been a leading strategic thinker with the \nDepartment. He has published numerous articles and essays, and has co-\nauthored several books on subjects as diverse as ship handling and \nforeign policy.\n  I am pleased that Admiral Stavridis will continue to make his talents \navailable to our country. Admiral Stavridis will assume new roles as \ndean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, and chairman of the \nboard of the United States Naval Institute.\n  On behalf of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nwish Admiral Stavridis ``fair winds and following seas'' as he \napproaches a new set of challenges in life. I know he will bring to \nthem the same steady hand, good heart and clear thinking he has given \nto our Nation for almost four decades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4981-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4981-S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MINORITY WEALTH GAP\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as part of Small Business Week, I would \nlike to mention a fact that is sometimes overlooked: minorities and \nwomen open small businesses at lower rates, and when they are able to \nopen businesses, they earn less than their white counterparts.\n  We have received many studies from all over the country that look at \nthe utilization of minority- and women-owned businesses by public \ncontracting agencies. As the studies show, minority- and women-owned \nbusinesses are routinely and disproportionately underutilized in public \ncontracting. In fact, one report that looked at almost 100 studies \nshowed that regardless of where the study was done or who did it, what \nwas seen over and over again was a stark underutilization of minority \nand women owned contractors.\n  Studies and litigation about mortgage rates also show us that \nminorities face additional, discriminatory hurdles when it comes to \nborrowing money. Minority business owners are more likely to have loan \napplications turned down than similar white business owners and, if the \nminority business owner is lucky enough to get the loan, he or she is \nmore likely to pay a higher interest rate.\n  Minority and women business owners are less likely to have the wealth \nto start their own businesses because of a history of discrimination in \nemployment. As a result, when they do start out, they are at a \nsignificant disadvantage.\n  We have also heard repeated testimony that minorities and women are \nexcluded from the networks that are essential for small businesses. \nMinorities and women are quoted higher prices for supplies or excluded \nfrom the meetings or the clubs where contacts are formed and decisions \nare made.\n  Federal programs that open doors and require outreach to minority-\nowned businesses are essential. In fact, when the Federal or local \ngovernment stops requiring that prime contractors reach out to \nminority- or women-owned businesses, those businesses' participation in \npublic contracts plummets. For example, when States in the western part \nof the U.S. stopped their programs after a court decision that \ninvalidated some applications of the program, participation in Federal \ncontracting by minority-owned businesses measurably decreased.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nstudies that demonstrate these facts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Recent Expert Reports, Disparity Studies and Congressional Hearings \n Addressing Public Procurement and Minority- and Women-Owned Business \n                              Enterprises\n\n                         Congressional Hearings\n\n\n                                  2013\n\n       Strengthening the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem for Minority \n     Women, Hearing Before the S.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about the \nimportance of Federal investment in biomedical research. There are many \nreasons to invest in biomedical research, but the two most important \nreasons are very simple: biomedical research saves lives, and it is \ngood for Pennsylvania's economy and the Nation's economy. A thriving \nbiomedical sector creates jobs, and we simply cannot afford, from a \npublic health or economic standpoint, not to support biomedical \nprogress.\n  I have been a strong and vocal advocate for Federal funds to support \nbiomedical research, including funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth--NIH. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, I authored a letter in \nsupport of funding for the NIH; the letter in 2013 was signed by a \nbipartisan group of 51 Senators.\n  In 2012, Pennsylvania researchers received $1,431,589,539--$1.4 \nbillion--in grants from the National Institutes of Health; the State is \nranked fourth in the Nation for the number of grants awarded. The \nfunding in 2012 supported over 3,400 competitive grants to almost 100 \nPennsylvania companies or universities; in turn, these grants supported \nthousands of jobs across the State--an estimated 2,500 in state jobs \nand total employment impact of over 24,000 jobs.\n  Long-term deficits are not sustainable, and government spending must \nbe reduced; however, we should not indiscriminately slash funding for \ngood programs, like medical research, that benefit Pennsylvanians, \nensure our global competitiveness and invest in our economic future. I \nhave been a champion for the continued growth of the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, which drives progress of biomedical \nresearch.\n  While the United States has been the world leader in medical \nresearch, other nations such as China are dramatically ramping up their \ninvestment in medical research, creating new competition and \nthreatening America's dominance in the field. We must continue to \ninvest in medical research and maintain the capacity we currently have \nto support work that benefits all Americans.\n  We risk a scenario in which promising young researchers, seeing the \nstruggles of their mentors and older colleagues to secure funding for \ntheir work, will choose a different path, putting a whole generation of \nscientists at risk. That capacity, that talent, once lost will not \neasily come back. Failure to invest in research now is a failure to \ninvest in our own future, and is incredibly shortsighted. We must work \nto support the basic research that has the potential to lead to major \nadvances in medical treatments and improved outcomes for patients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4983-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING NIGHTFORCE OPTICS\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as National Small Business Week \ncomes to a close I would like to rise today to recognize Nightforce \nOptics of Orofino, ID, an inspirational small business that has grown \nand expanded in spite of the economic challenges of the last half \ndecade. Founder Dr. Ray Dennis is an avid hunter and shooter from \nAustralia who had a dream of manufacturing and selling riflescopes of \nunmatched quality in the United States. His dream led him on a search \nfor a location to help make this vision a reality. Dr. Dennis was \nultimately drawn to the beautiful city of Orofino in my home State. A \nfriendly business climate, an enthusiastic labor base, and close \nproximity to major shipping centers made Orofino, ID the perfect place \nto establish Nightforce Optics.\n  In 1999, Nightforce Optics started with four employees occupying a \nsmall manufacturing facility. Today, Nightforce Optics employs over 100 \npeople and has expanded their Orofino headquarters to a 35,187 square \nfoot facility. Nightforce is committed to hiring a local workforce, as \nwell as attracting specialized craftsmen and women to Idaho. Throughout \nthis time, the company has delivered the utmost quality, performance, \nand craftsmanship of their products to customers. This dedication \nbecame self-evident as hunters, marksmen, police, and military users \nhave come to revere Nightforce Optics as a top-tier brand in the \nindustry.\n  Companies like Nightforce represent a critical part of the economy \nand even national security for the United States. Nightforce \nriflescopes produced in Orofino, ID have been used by U.S. servicemen \nin operations all around the globe. It is my opinion that the U.S. \nmilitary should always have available the best in quality and \ntechnology, and it is in small businesses like Nightforce Optics that \nwe often find the innovative ideas and determination that can make \nthese products available.\n  By 2011, Nightforce underwent a $1 million expansion, resulting in \nimproved manufacturing and research and development capabilities. This \ninvestment has directly led to the company's recent introduction of \nnew, innovative products that otherwise might never have been \ndeveloped.\n  Although we hear over and over again that the national climate for \npromoting small business needs to improve, it is refreshing to hear \nthat a sportsman from Australia with an idea and motivation relocated \nto Idaho to build his dream. Every year, thousands and thousands of \nproducts come from Orofino, ID with a label reading ``Made in USA.'' I \ncommend Dr. Ray Dennis for investing in American entrepreneurship and \nto Nightforce Optics for representing a small business with ingenuity \nand local ties that I am proud to honor as Idaho's Small Business of \nthe Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4983-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4983-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/21/senate-section/article/S4983-5", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 11:10 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Wolf) has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 475.
