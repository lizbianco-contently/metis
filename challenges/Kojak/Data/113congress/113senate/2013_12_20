Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, of \nthe District of Columbia, to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 1 \nhour of debate on the nomination equally divided and controlled between \nthe Senator from Delaware Mr. Carper and the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn or their designees.\n  Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly. Then I would \nlike to yield to Senator Leahy for some comments he would like to make \non the President's nominee to be our next Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. The Senator has known Mr. Mayorkas for a number of years, \nworked very closely with him through his committee's oversight of the \nEB-5 program.\n  I am delighted he is going to take the floor and move from presiding \nto speaking. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono.) The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Delaware. You know, the Department \nof Homeland Security is the leading agency for many of the pressing \nissues facing our Nation, from providing disaster relief to protecting \nour borders. The agency needs a full complement of leaders. That is why \nI am glad the Senate is considering the nomination of Alejandro \nMayorkas to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Carper, for pushing forward \nwith this nomination. Alejandro Mayorkas currently serves as the \nDirector of USCIS, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the \nagency that makes the immigration system work.\n  Director Mayorkas has made it, by every analysis, a stronger and \nbetter functioning agency. It is unfortunate that in these partisan \ntimes Director Mayorkas' nomination has been the subject of unfair and \npartisan attacks. It is wrong that some have tried to create \ncontroversy about him even before his confirmation hearing occurred in \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The attacks were made even less credible by the conduct of the former \nDHS deputy inspector general who was forced to resign in the face of \nallegations of serious misconduct, a person who frankly has no \ncredibility in my mind because of the egregious and inexcusable things \nhe did while serving in this role.\n  This former deputy inspector general, Charles Edwards, on the eve of \nDirector Mayorkas' confirmation hearing authorized the transmittal of \nan email to a Republican Senate office that contained sensitive \ninformation about an ongoing investigation involving Director Mayorkas.\n  One thing that both Republicans and Democrats should agree upon is \nthat this conduct is wrong. I believe it is a clear violation of the \nlaw. It is something that should be condemned no matter who did it. Of \ncourse, the timing of the transmittal raised serious questions about \nthe motivation for its disclosure.\n  Inspectors general are supposed to be way above politics. Well, guess \nwhat happened? The email authorized by this former and now disgraced \ndeputy inspector general was published shortly after its transmittal on \nthe Web site of a Republican candidate for Governor. Come on. This is \nwrong. Why would a Virginia gubernatorial candidate care about an \ninvestigation being conducted by the Office of Inspector General for \nthe Department of Homeland Security? Well, because some of the \nanonymous allegations repeated in that email by the Office of Inspector \nGeneral involved claims that Director Mayorkas intervened in an \nimmigration matter for Terry McAuliffe, the governor-elect of Virginia. \nIt was obvious this was done for political motives, not to make \nHomeland Security a better department.\n  Director Mayorkas, to his credit, has always put the interests of \nUSCIS ahead of his own. He has made tough decisions to make that agency \nbetter. Sometimes tough decisions are not popular but needed. He made \nthe decisions that were best for the country. He has brought \nsignificant resources to bear in the EB-5 Regional Center program.\n  Incidentally, the recommendations that he made to improve the EB-5 \nprogram were in a bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \ncomprehensive immigration reform, a bill that passed the Senate in \nJune. Every single Republican, and every single Democrat, voted for \nthose recommendations in the committee. Now, we have been waiting for \nthe House to pass this important legislation. But in the meantime, \nDirector Mayorkas has worked to ensure the program's integrity. He has \nacted to make sure the agency's decisions are correct under the \ncontrolling law and regulations. The suggestion that Director Mayorkas \nwould risk his reputation and his credibility by improperly intervening \nin a single immigration case, out of thousands his agency handles every \nyear, is absurd.\n  I remember during the consideration of comprehensive immigration \nreform in the Judiciary Committee--the former ranking member, Senator \nSessions, praised my amendment to improve the EB-5 program following \nthe recommendations of Director Mayorkas. These reforms contained a \nhost of improvements to provide USCIS with strong oversight tools, \nsecurity enhancements, and anti-fraud provisions. In fact, 68 Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, voted for the comprehensive reform bill \nwhich had the EB-5 program improvements in it. Now, some have said here \non the floor yesterday that we could make reforms to the EB-5 program \nthis very day.\n\n  I would respond that the Senate voted for it earlier this year. I \nappreciate those Senators who want these EB-5 reforms for having voted \nfor them back in June. I have seen no evidence that those Senators, who \nput such faith in the former Deputy Inspector General's flawed \ninvestigation, have asked the tough questions necessary to test the \nintegrity of that investigation.\n  Instead of considering the circumstances of the disgraced former \nDeputy Inspector General's disclosure, and taking the opportunity to \nask tough questions of Director Mayorkas at his confirmation hearing, \nRepublican Senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee instead decided to boycott that hearing. And when Chairman \nCarper scheduled a Committee business meeting to vote on Director \nMayorkas' nomination, all Republican senators but two failed to attend \nthat meeting.\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\nThis is unfortunate and in my view, an abdication of our responsibility \nto evaluate the President's nominees.\n  As senators, we are obligated to ask the tough questions of all \nnominees, but it is also important that we carefully consider the \nsource and motivations behind any allegations against those nominees. \nRegarding the immigration case about which Director Mayorkas is accused \nof acting improperly, it is clear in emails that he wrote, which have \nbeen publicly disclosed, that he asserts his inability to become \ninvolved in any specific case. The emails that have been disclosed \npaint a picture of an agency director who took great pains to avoid any \nappearance of favoritism or impropriety.\n  I would urge my colleagues to review carefully, and in context, that \nwhich has been disclosed. Furthermore, the Senate should consider the \nreliability of those who refused to meet with Democratic staff on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to discuss their \nallegations.\n  Come on. Let's stop playing political games with this. We have a good \nperson, a person we should be thankful is willing to serve this \ncountry, a person who has been the subject of lies and smears. Director \nMayorkas will serve the Department of Homeland Security, and the \nAmerican people, honorably. Let's vindicate this person. Let's put him \nto work for the good of the country.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman from Delaware for his work on \nthis.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the many years working on the EB-5 program to make sure \nit fulfills its potential.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the unfortunate thing is we have a \ndisagreement on the precedents of the Senate. We just had the President \npro tempore of the Senate say that there were lies and smears. Not one \nmember of the minority voted against Mr. Mayorkas in his confirmation \nhearing.\n  They all voted ``present.'' The reason they did that was for a very \nimportant reason. The President pro tempore of the Senate did not \nmention the fact that there still--regardless of all of those things, \nthere is still an ongoing investigation.\n  Never before in the history of the Senate has a position at this \nlevel been approved with an ongoing investigation. Facts are stubborn. \nI would like for him to tell me what the lies and smears are, that he \nclaims, politically we have made. We have made no such claims.\n  What we have said is the ICE review of this program said it should be \neliminated. It happened to have been authored by the President pro \ntempore. We had the majority whip on Wednesday night saying the \nfollowing:\n\n       My colleague, Senator Tom Carper, chairman of this \n     committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to investigate \n     every allegation--\n\n  Is that right? Every allegation? They do not even know what the \nallegations are because we are not privy to them.\n\n     --to answer every question, and to be there to work with the \n     other side of the aisle to try to resolve any problems that \n     they have with this nomination. Sadly, it has not been \n     successful because we do not know what the claims are. We \n     think we know. We also have the chairman of the committee, \n     before he ever heard the specifics of any complaint by \n     whistleblowers demeaning those very whistleblowers and \n     describing their words as ``rumors and innuendo''--people who \n     put their jobs on the line to report.\n\n  Then he claims they will not meet with him, even though he has asked \nthem to meet twice. I cannot blame them, because he has already \ndismissed any credibility that they have.\n  We should wait for this investigation to be completed. I know we are \nnot going to; we are going to roll this right through here. It is a \ndisservice to Mr. Mayorkas. It is a disservice to the American people. \nIt is a disservice to this body. All that I have heard from people who \nknow Mr. Mayorkas are positive things. It is positive, but a legitimate \ninvestigation is ongoing.\n  I would make this other point: The administration knew that there was \nan ongoing IG investigation, and it failed to inform the chairman and \nfailed to inform the ranking member when they sent his nomination over. \nWhy is that? Why would they not tell us that? Was it just an oversight, \nor did they intend for us not to know?\n  The worst thing that comes about because of this nomination moving \nforward is the relationship and the trust that has gone from our \ncommittee. The difficulties going forward will be major because things \nhave been implied that I, personally, am doing things for a political \npurpose rather than from a principled basis. There is no nominee who is \nunder an investigation that I will ever meet with before that \ninvestigation is cleared.\n  The other claim that has been made is we wouldn't meet with Mr. \nMayorkas because we didn't want to know the truth. The fact is we \ndidn't want to prejudice our position without the knowledge of the \nfacts, but that has not kept some in this body from claiming we had a \nmotive other than what we have stated. Therefore, all our motives, \nrather than finding out the truth, our motives are that it has to be \npolitical.\n  I reject that. I take great offense at that.\n  I have no doubt that Mr. Mayorkas will be confirmed today.\n  The question I have is if, in fact, the IG investigation finds \ncredible findings of wrongdoing or undue influence or impropriety, what \nthen? How effective is this going to be?\n  I am not saying they will find it; I don't know. But we certainly \nknow. The extent of the chairman's investigation is meeting with the \nnominee--and I am sure he is an honorable man. But my duty as a Senator \nis to know the facts, not to know my feelings, and we can't do that at \nthis time. We are precluded from doing that.\n  Therefore, we are going to approve someone without full knowledge. We \nwill not be able to ably give our advice and consent because we know \nthere are unanswered questions. If those unanswered questions fall to \nthe side that says Mr. Mayorkas has done nothing wrong, then he will be \nthere, but he will be there in less full power and less confidence than \nhe would have had otherwise.\n  There have been 20 nominees that have come through our committee. I \nhave voted against only one--only one. I have been a good partner for \nthe administration in moving their nominees. But to ask us to ignore \nwhat might be potential critical information is to ask us to abandon \nour duty of advice and consent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is unfortunate that this situation has occurred. \nWhat is most unfortunate is it casts a poor light on a very \nextraordinary individual, someone who I have had the privilege to know \nvery well for the last several years. It pains me and many Members of \nthis body who know Ali Mayorkas personally and know of his \nextraordinary service to the United States of America to date that his \nname would be dragged through the mud like this.\n  I know the Senator from Oklahoma has been sincere in many of his \nefforts to streamline our government, to make it more efficient. While \nthere have been individuals on the other side who have used the seats \nthey have been privileged to gain in not the most admirable way, he is \nnot one of them. I do not have any poor feelings or disappointment in \nhim personally.\n  I think what has happened is a complete breakdown of trust on all \nsides, which has caused very extraordinary measures to be taken, \nbecause from our perspective, from my perspective, if a candidate such \nas this who has already been confirmed twice by the Senate, who served \nour country already as a U.S. attorney with the highest credentials \nprosecuting criminal cases and criminal activity that Senator Coburn \nand Senator Carper have spent a career themselves pushing back so our \ngovernment can be better, more transparent, and more honest, then I \ndon't know where we go from here. I truly don't.\n  I do know this gentleman was willing to meet with anyone to try to \nclear up\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\nany misinformation. In fact, several Republicans, at my request--my \nspecific personal request--met with him and came away with amazing \nopinions, high opinions of him when they asked him questions and he \nanswered.\n  There is a lot of evidence to suggest the ``investigation'' against \nhim is bogus, is being conducted for inappropriate reasons. Sometimes \nthese things happen in government, and it is our job to sort through.\n  Senator Carper as chairman--I know because I serve on the committee \nas well--tried for months and months to get meetings to try to clear \nthis up. We couldn't move forward in any way.\n  Should this man's name be ruined because there is not cooperation in \nthe Senate for the first time in many decades? I have been here almost \n20 years. I have never seen it like this and it is not this gentleman's \nfault.\n  I know his wife. I know his two girls. They have been to my office. I \nknow his family. I have met his brothers. This is very painful to his \nfamily, and it is just not responsible.\n  It is not only about Director Mayorkas--Ali Mayorkas and his family, \nthe Mayorkas family--it is about thousands of good people out there who \nwould love to serve in this government despite the fact that many \npeople on the other side think it is the worst thing ever created in \nthe history of man. That is their view. It happens to be one of the \ngreatest creations of man, with divine help, but we cannot convince \nthem of that.\n  There are thousands of people who would want to serve in our \ngovernment. But after listening to speeches that Mr. Coburn just gave \nor Mr. Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, or the Senator from Oklahoma or \nothers, who would want to put their families through this? No one.\n  Just because there is a group of people over there who despise the \ngovernment--for whatever reason, I don't know--they shouldn't take \ntheir anger out on the individuals trying to make it better and fix \nwhat is broken. The EB-5 Program was broken way before Director \nMayorkas had the responsibility to try to fix it, and he is only one \nhuman being. We all have the responsibility to fix this program.\n  To blame him and to drag his family through this after an \nextraordinary career prosecuting crime, I understand--and Senator \nCarper will speak more to this--but when the people he worked with in \nthe past needed someone to head something such as the integrity \ncommittee, they would choose him quite often. He has run the integrity \ncommittees in places where he has worked. That is a great honor.\n  In conclusion, now he comes up in one of the most important \ndepartments of the whole government, Homeland Security--which Tom \nCarper authorizes as chair, and I fund to the best of my ability, with \nall sorts of attacks to our budget, to try to provide resources to this \nagency--and this gentleman whom we should be thanking every day for \nwanting to step up and take this job has to be dragged through this.\n  I make no apologies for the rules changes that made this possible. I \nam sorry we were unable to convince people on the other side of his \noutstanding integrity and that the investigation against him is bogus, \npersonal, and should be dismissed. The IG who was in charge of it has \nresigned under a cloud. That doesn't seem to make any difference to \nthem.\n  I am proud to put my name and my vote behind this nominee who I know \nwill do an exceedingly fabulous job for this country in a very \nimportant role we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I wish to thank the Senator from Louisiana for that \nheartfelt, passionate endorsement of Ali Mayorkas' nomination.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Louisiana. \nIt goes right to the point. She may be 100 percent right, but we do not \nknow the facts. What we have is testimony from a lot of people that he \nis a fine man, but we don't know the facts. We say we do, but we don't. \nTherefore, we are asking this body to make a judgment without the \nknowledge. It goes against the very charge we have for advice and \nconsent.\n  We besmirch all of the 650 people who work for this IG--who has not \nbeen associated with this case in over a month, in terms of personally \ndirecting it. We besmirch all those other people.\n  Were there credible accusations made? There must have been. There \nmust have been. Maybe they are not accurate. They are allegations, but \nthey should be cleared up and they should be cleared up for Mr. \nMayorkas' sake so that when he takes this position, it is not under a \ncloud and he is totally exonerated. But we are going to go ahead \nanyway. Regardless of our experience, facts still count.\n  I have raised three daughters. They are in their forties and late \nthirties, and I love them dearly. They have great integrity, but they \nhave made mistakes in their lives. They have made poor judgments. It \ndoes not mean they are not great individuals, but they have made \nmistakes.\n  What the Senator is saying is cover your ears and cover your eyes and \ndon't see mistakes that were made. Make the judgment without that \nknowledge. I have no doubt the words my colleague from Louisiana spoke \nwere true in terms of her experience, but the Senator wasn't there. The \nSenator didn't know.\n  There are six individuals who have put their jobs on the line to make \nallegations that have to be disproved by nonbiased people who work at \nthe inspector general's office.\n  What we are saying today is, You are not capable. You don't have the \nquality or the integrity to make a fair decision on this issue and so \nwe are going to vote with that. It is amazing how good we are at \nlooking into the crystal ball to know the truth without knowing the \nfacts.\n  The vote is going to be based on the faith that we think Mr. Mayorkas \nhas done nothing wrong. I hope that is true. I would have loved to be \nable to have voted for him knowing the facts, fulfilling my \nconstitutional duty, but the Senator precludes that. I have no choice \nbut to oppose the nomination, not because I don't know Mr. Mayorkas but \nbecause I don't have the facts.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Our leadership is the most important element of any \norganization, be it a public or private organization, a business, \nschool, a military unit, an athletic team. Leadership is key in \neverything.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, which protects us from all kinds \nof attacks--foreign and domestic, manmade and natural--needs \nleadership. They need confirmed Senate leadership. They haven't had it \nfor months.\n  I am going to thank my colleagues who voted this week to confirm Jeh \nJohnson's nomination as the Secretary of this Department. He will be \nsworn in next week, thank God. He needs a team. On top of that team he \nneeds Ali Mayorkas to be the Deputy Secretary.\n  Those are not only my words or the words of Senator Landrieu or \nSenator Leahy or Senator Feinstein. We received dozens of letters from \npeople who know him. We know these names. We know their faces. We know \ntheir reputation. Some are Democrat and some are Republican. A number \nof them have helped lead the Department of Homeland Security--lead it.\n  This is a vacancy we are trying to fill. Jane Holl Lute is the last \nDeputy who stepped down 6 or 8 months ago. She literally oversaw his \nwork and she was his boss, if you will. She thinks the world of him, \nnot only in a role he served but as a guy who can step in and fill the \nshoes she used to fill.\n  I want to talk about this investigation. There are two tracks we are \ngoing down here. One is an investigation that was launched in September \nof 2012 by the IG--the OIG for the Department of Homeland Security--in \n2012, 15 months ago. How did we find out about it? We found out about \nit through a leak, information leaked by the office to our friends on \nthe other side 3 days before the hearing was supposed to occur.\n  We asked to talk to folks who came forward as whistleblowers. We \nasked\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nfor them to talk to the minority. We have asked and asked and asked and \nhave never been given the chance to talk to them to find out what are \ntheir allegations, what is their story. Let's hear it. By the same \ntoken, they have refused to turn to the one person who knows the most \nabout what is going on in this agency for the last 4 years--Ali \nMayorkas--to say: You have been accused of this. Under our system of \njustice in this country the accused actually has a chance to defend \nhimself, and when he did--we had a hearing--they didn't show up. They \nwon't meet with him either.\n  So here is the situation. We have people who may be very good people. \nWe don't know them, we don't know their names, and we don't know what \nthey are saying. We just know we haven't had a chance to meet with \nthem, and we know the one guy who is being accused here hasn't had a \nchance to give his story to those who are accusing him. Is that fair? I \ndon't think so. I don't think so.\n  So we had that hearing at the end of July and no Republicans came. We \nput every tough question we could to Mr. Mayorkas, under oath, and he \ncame through. He said about this case involving Terry McAuliffe that \nMr. McAuliffe and his company wanted something; they didn't get it. The \nguy who really made the decision, who works for Ali Mayorkas, basically \nsaid--Mr. Rhew--that he made the decision. He made the decision. He was \nnot pressured to make the decision. He ruled against Terry McAuliffe's \ncompany. End of case.\n  Here we are at the end of July. We have the hearing and the \nRepublicans don't come. Dr. Coburn joined me in a letter to the \nInspector General and said: Please, provide the resources to expedite \nand make a priority of this investigation. They were 9 months into that \ninvestigation at that time. That was the end of July. In August, we \nreached out and said, through staff: What kind of assets, what kind of \npriority are you giving this case? They had three people working on it. \nThey have 650 employees in this office--650--and they had 3 full-time \npeople working on it, an investigator and two research assistants. So \nwe go into August, and they say we need a couple more months. A couple \nmore months was October. Dr. Coburn and I sent another letter to the IG \nand said: How are we doing? Let's provide some priority to this, and \nlet's get to the bottom of this.\n  That was in October. Two weeks ago, minority staff and majority staff \nfrom the committee had a phone conversation with the OIG's office and \nsaid: How are we doing? They said: There is no evidence of any criminal \nwrongdoing by anybody--not by Mr. Mayorkas, not by anybody at DHS--but \nwe are not done yet. We need several more months. Maybe come back in \nFebruary or March.\n  In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have the \nleadership it needs--at least confirmed by us. How long are we going to \nwait? The terrorists aren't going to wait. The ones in foreign \ncountries aren't going to wait. The ones in this country aren't going \nto wait. We need leadership. It is the key for everything--everything.\n  There is another audit that has been going on as well by the IG--the \nsame IG--of the EB-5 program. I'm an old Governor--here we have an old \nState treasurer. We used to get audits all the time in State \ngovernment. Auditors came in to do audits. It drove me crazy when the \nauditor would come in, make an audit for sometime in the past, and \nrefuse to acknowledge that the department or the agency being audited \nhad actually fixed those problems and submitted an audit that pretends \nlike nothing is different. You have seen this. Senator Durbin has seen \nthis. I have seen this. It drove me crazy.\n  We have an audit that is going to be released, I think publicly in a \nday or 2, that has been shared with us in the Senate this week, and \nthere are really four recommendations. As it turns out, of those four \nrecommendations one of them needs the Congress to do something. We need \nto pass a law. Ali Mayorkas, 18 months ago said to the Judiciary \nCommittee--to Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley: In order for us to make \nsure there is not fraud in the EB-5 program, to make sure there are not \nnational security concerns, we need you--Congress--to do something \nabout it.\n  When they reauthorized the EB-5 program in 2012, guess what. They \ndidn't take his recommendations--none of them. This year we were doing \nimmigration reform in committee--Senator Durbin was one of the key \nplayers there--and when we did it, Pat Leahy, chairman of the \ncommittee, made sure those recommendations were actually included in \nthe immigration reform law--the recommendations from Ali Mayorkas--and \nthey are in the immigration reform bill. We voted for them. It is over \nin the House now. It is sitting there gathering dust, unfortunately.\n  If Senator Leahy doesn't introduce as a stand-alone bill those \nprovisions allowing the EB-5 program to have the kind of governance it \nneeds through the USCIS agency, if he doesn't do it, I said to him, I \nwill introduce the legislation myself. I hope we will have a lot of \ncosponsors.\n  There are four recommendations. One of them needs us to do something \nin order for it to occur. The other two are either acknowledged, \ncompleted or done. On the other one, we just are in disagreement. It is \noutside the scope of the law. That is the audit. That is the audit.\n  So, my friends, I just want to say this: This is not a criminal \ninvestigation. The things Terry McAuliffe and his company sought were \ndenied. The one person within the agency who has actually worked on \nthese investigations and worked on these EB-5 programs has come forward \nand said: Look, Mayorkas did nothing wrong. I decided. I decided \nagainst Mr. McAuliffe's company and Mr. Mayorkas stayed out of my way.\n  We have endorsements. We don't know who the detractors are of Mr. \nMayorkas. I wish we did, and I wish we had a chance to talk to them. We \nare never going to have a chance. I wish my friends on the other side \nhad taken the time to talk to Mr. Mayorkas to say: Listen, this is what \nyou are accused of. The Democrats don't know what you are accused of, \nbut this is what we have been told by these six people. What is your \nstory? What is your story?\n  Whatever happened to the Golden Rule? What happened to the idea that \njustice delayed is justice denied? You know, Mr. Mayorkas, as Senator \nLandrieu said, has a wife, they have two kids. They have a life to \nlive. We have put them through hell for months. What kind of message \ndoes this send to other people, other agency leaders who go in and take \non an agency that is in trouble, that has problems and needs to be \nfixed, needs to be shaken up? That person goes in and does it and gets \nwhistleblowers or complaints out of it as a result? What do we say to \nother leaders who go into agencies that are in trouble and need to be \nshaken up, to those who are willing to get people to do things \ndifferently? What do we say to them? Don't do it; don't rock the boat; \njust let things slide? Is that the message we want to send? I don't \nthink so.\n  We will not have a chance on this side to hear from those six people, \nbut I tell you the other people who work in that agency had a chance to \nsay something about the way they feel about how their agency is going. \nAs my colleagues know, every year we get a report from a nonprofit \norganization that looks at 300 Federal agencies and asks the questions: \nHow is morale? How do you feel about the work you are doing? One of \nthose 300 was this agency led by Ali Mayorkas, the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. The Department of Homeland Security, again this \nyear--we just got the results this week, and again this year, the worst \nmorale in the Federal Government of any department--in our government, \nthe worst morale. But guess what. There is one agency in this \ndepartment that stood up, that stood out, because out of those 300 \nagencies, No. 76--the top 25 percent--No. 76 was this agency led by Mr. \nMayorkas.\n  Another question asked of the employees: Do you feel better or worse \nabout your senior leadership this year than last year? Since 2009, \nsince he took over this organization in 2009, Madam President, guess \nwhat. Satisfaction with senior leadership increased by more than 20 \npercent. They feel better. They feel better about the senior leadership \nwith Mr. Mayorkas than they did without his leadership.\n  Something is going on in that agency, folks. We are not getting the \nfull\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nstory, but that survey that we got this week says a lot.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARPER. Please.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I want to ask a question of the \nSenator from Delaware because he has touched on an issue that is \nimportant to everyone, but especially to this Senator from Illinois.\n  It was 12 years ago when I introduced the DREAM Act, and it was a \nlittle over a year ago the President issued an executive order which \nsaid they would defer the deportation of those eligible under the DREAM \nAct, but there was also a little wrinkle to it. They said the fees we \nwere going to collect under this DACA, they called it--this executive \norder--had to pay for the administration of this executive order. This \nis extraordinary. We were basically saying this was a pay-as-you-go \neffort that has drawn more than 600,000 applications and over 450,000 \napprovals. This went right through Mr. Mayorkas's responsibility and \njurisdiction.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Delaware, not only is the morale \ngood in his agency, but the job they have done is extraordinary. They \nwere given an extraordinary responsibility, and they rose to the \nchallenge and handled it professionally. I can tell you, with firsthand \nknowledge, having met with him, watched him, this man is a capable \nadministrator, and the people who work for him--clearly, as a result of \nthis survey--are very happy with his performance.\n  I would just say to the Senator from Delaware, what absolutely \nconfuses, mystifies, and infuriates me, is the notion that unidentified \npeople will make nonspecific charges against this man, and he is \nsupposed to wait for month after weary month? If we talk about the \nbasic standard of justice in America, when the government makes a \ncharge against someone, there is a complaint--a bill of particulars. \nYou know what the charge is, and fairness and justice requires that you \ncan confront your accusers and hear from them the information and \nevidence against you.\n  In this situation, as best I can understand--and what my colleague \nhas said repeatedly on the floor, I say to the chairman--is that this \nnever took place. You have waited month after weary month for these \naccusers to come forward and at least tell Mr. Mayorkas what they think \nhe has done wrong. Their silence, their refusal to do so, speaks \nvolumes to me.\n  I am sorry they didn't make their report more fully, but I think, as \nI said the other night on the floor, you are an honorable person. I \nknow you, and I have worked with you for over 30 years both in the \nHouse and in the Senate. When I hear you say on the floor you do your \nbest to be fair and bipartisan in everything, and when I hear you stand \non the floor and say this man has been treated unfairly, he deserves \nhis chance, that is what I need to hear.\n  I would just ask the Senator from Delaware: Has he had a chance to \nconfront his accusers? Has your committee had a chance to even know the \nallegations against him at this point?\n  Mr. CARPER. The answer, Madam President, sadly, is no, we have not. \nNo, we have not.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to speak in support of \nPresident Obama's nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas. I have known Ali for many \nyears and am proud to have recommended him to President Clinton for the \nposition of U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, as \nwell as to President Obama for his current position as Director of U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS.\n  The role of Deputy Secretary within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is an important one. The Deputy Secretary is charged with \noverseeing the agency's efforts to counter terrorism and enhance the \nsecurity and management of our borders, while facilitating trade and \ntravel and enforcing our immigration laws. Additionally, the Deputy \nSecretary assists in the safeguarding and security of cyber space and \nprovides support for national and economic security in times of \ndisaster, in coordination with Federal, State, local, international, \nand private sector partners.\n  Mr. Mayorkas is extremely well qualified for this position and brings \nto this office a diverse background and set of experiences in both the \nprivate and public sectors. I am confident he will do an outstanding \njob as Deputy Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, and he \nhas my enthusiastic and unwavering support.\n  Born in Havana, Cuba, Mr. Mayorkas earned his B.A. with distinction \nfrom the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981. He earned his law \ndegree from Loyola Law School in 1985. Those who have enjoyed the \nopportunity to work with him regard him as being highly intelligent, \nthoughtful, kind and compassionate, and dedicated to doing the right \nthing.\n  From 1989 to 1998, Mr. Mayorkas served as an assistant U.S. attorney \nfor the Central District of California, where he prosecuted a wide \narray of Federal crimes, specializing in the prosecution of white \ncollar-crime. Federal law enforcement agencies recognized his success \nwith multiple awards. For example, he received commendations from FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh for his successful prosecution of Operation \nPolarCap, the largest money laundering case in the Nation at the time.\n  He continued to distinguish himself by becoming the first U.S. \nattorney in the Central District of California to be appointed from \nwithin the office. Mr. Mayorkas created the Civil Rights Section in the \noffice to prosecute hate crimes and other acts of intolerance and \ndiscrimination more effectively. He developed an innovative program to \naddress violent crime by targeting criminals' possession of firearms, \nprosecuting street gangs, and at the same time developing afterschool \nprograms to help at-risk youth discover and realize their potential. He \nuniquely demonstrated the ability to simultaneously be firm with \ncriminals, protective of the innocent, and supportive and empowering to \nour future leaders.\n  As supported by the many law enforcement and community awards he \nreceived during his tenure as U.S. attorney, Mr. Mayorkas' \naccomplishments extended beyond his district. He successfully expanded \nhis office's community outreach programs and cooperation with \ninternational players in the fight against crime. He directly resolved \ncases while also overseeing hundreds of attorneys addressing \nimmigration matters, which included complex and sensitive prosecution \nof individuals and rings producing false immigration documents, illegal \nreentry cases, and alien smuggling conspiracies.\n  The Administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele \nLeonhart, noted that ``he was instrumental in broadening collaboration \nbetween law enforcement agencies to address violent crime and expanded \ncooperation with other nations to address the growing threat of \ntransnational crime.'' Combined with his prosecuting white collar \ncrime, public corruption, computer-related crime, and international \nmoney laundering, she wrote that such a ``broad base of experience . . \n. provides him with a unique perspective on threats to national \nsecurity.''\n  Mr. Mayorkas further developed his sharp legal skills and management \nexperience as a Partner at O'Melveny & Myers, from 2001 to 2009, where \nhe represented companies in high-profile and sensitive government \nenforcement cases. He was recognized by his worldwide firm with an \nannual award for ``leadership, excellence and citizenship,'' and was \nnamed by the National Law Journal as one of the ``50 Most Influential \nMinority Lawyers in America'' in 2008.\n  Since his confirmation as Director of USCIS 4 years ago in 2009, he \nhas continued to exert his positive influence through leadership, \nexcellence, and citizenship in accomplishing the agency's mission. He \nhas improved the immigration services and policies of USCIS by \nrealigning its priorities for a modern-day America that seeks to \npreserve its legacy as a nation of immigrants while ensuring national \nsecurity and public safety--no easy task.\n  Throughout his current role as Director of USCIS, he has successfully \npreserved and increased the integrity of our immigration laws by \ndecreasing fraud and bringing accountability to our immigration system. \nFor example, Mr. Mayorkas has worked to secure our Nation's criminal \nand immigration laws in the face of increasing gang and border \nviolence.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  As technology advances, so too have our needs to prevent fraud and to \nsafeguard immigration documents from tampering; Mr. Mayorkas has \nconfronted that challenge by enhancing the scope and frequency of \nnational security vetting of applicants for immigration benefits and by \nredesigning immigration documentation with enhanced security features.\n  Simultaneously, Mr. Mayorkas has led USCIS in the other half of its \nmission--to preserve the role of America as a just nation that treats \nimmigrants at our shores humanely and with an eye towards the potential \nthey bring to our nation.\n  He ensured the prompt review of applications of victims of \ntrafficking and domestic violence so that they may begin to pick up the \npieces and move forward in their lives. Mr. Mayorkas has also improved \nthe immigration program for victims of crime who cooperate with law \nenforcement in investigation and prosecutions.\n  To combat notario fraud and other unscrupulous practices that \nundermine the integrity of the immigration system, Mr. Mayorkas \nlaunched the unauthorized practice of immigration law initiative. It is \na nationwide collaborative effort with Federal, State, and municipal \nagencies and enforcement authorities that works to raise awareness \namong immigrant communities and to investigate and prosecute \nwrongdoers.\n  After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, he developed and implemented a \nhumanitarian parole program on an emergency basis to save orphans and \nunite children with their adoptive families here.\n  Significantly, upon President Obama's directive to grant deferred \naction to immigrants who were brought to this country as children and \nwho seek to legally remain in the United States, Mr. Mayorkas swiftly \nimplemented the deferred action for childhood arrivals initiative in 60 \ndays. In less than 1 year, over half a million people have applied to \nremain in the United States, the only home they have known.\n  He also boldly realigned the agency's organizational structure, \nincluding 246 offices and facilities worldwide, to more accurately \nserve key priorities and achieve efficiency. For example, his stringent \nbudget reviews resulted in cost-saving measures of $160 million in \nbudget cuts for the fiscal year 2010.\n  I recognize that my colleagues have raised concerns about the EB-5 \nprogram in connection with Mr. Mayorkas' nomination.\n  I actually believe that Mr. Mayorkas' actions to improve the \nintegrity of the EB-5 program are a reason to support his nomination. \nThey show that, when Mr. Mayorkas sees a systemic issue requiring \naction, he will figure out what to do and then do everything possible \nwithin the confines of the law to fix it.\n  As my colleagues know, the EB-5 program essentially allows a foreign \ninvestor to obtain a conditional green card by investing $500,000 or $1 \nmillion in a U.S. business. The conditions can be removed if, after 2 \nyears, the individual shows 10 jobs have been created by the \ninvestment.\n  Because of the various economic issues involved in adjudicating EB-5 \napplications--which can run for thousands of pages--the EB-5 program \nhas been called the most complex program USCIS administers.\n  I will say up front: I have my own serious concerns about this \nprogram. I am concerned about the potential for fraud, against both \nforeign and domestic investors. I am concerned that a business created \nwith this money may not turn out to be legitimate, and as chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, I know that certain immigration programs \nmay be ripe for exploitation.\n  I look forward to the opportunity, before the EB-5 program requires \nour reauthorization in 2015, to bolstering the security of this \nprogram.\n  But none of that has anything to do with this nomination. Mr. \nMayorkas was required by law, as Director of USCIS, to administer the \nEB-5 program.\n  As Director, Mr. Mayorkas saw flaws in the program--flaws in the \nagency's ability to vet participants in the program, and flaws in the \nagency's ability to do the economic analysis necessary. So, Mr. \nMayorkas set about fixing them. For example:\n  Routine security checks of foreign investor applicants and principals \nof regional centers are now done.\n  Regional centers now annually must show they meet the eligibility \nrequirements and update USCIS on new lines of business. More vetting is \nconducted with these annual filings.\n  Mr. Mayorkas brought on financial experts and business lawyers, who \nhelp review business documents associated with applications.\n  The program has been moved entirely to DC with specialized \nadjudicatory officers and antifraud staff. The program is now close to \nthe investigative, intelligence, and financial communities that help \ndetect suspicious financial activity.\n  I agree with many on the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle \nthat the EB-5 program must be reformed. I supported Chairman Leahy's \namendment to the immigration bill to do that, and I believe further \nlegislative action will be needed to make sure that, if this program is \nreauthorized, it is secure.\n  But I also believe that Mr. Mayorkas has performed his job as \nDirector of USCIS admirably, including by making the EB-5 program more \nsecure. That is a reason to support his nomination.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this nominee has my strong support. He \nis a fine individual whom I have known for a very long time. He \nimpressed me as U.S. attorney, and he has continued to do so as \nDirector of USCIS.\n  He understands the immigration system and the many other issues, like \ntransnational drug trafficking and national security, that the leaders \nof the Department of Homeland Security must face. And I believe he will \nmake an outstanding Deputy Secretary.\n  I recognize there is an investigation by the inspector general's \noffice at DHS, but the OIG confirmed that ``there is no indication of \ncriminal activity'' on Mr. Mayorkas' part. There has been a significant \ndelay in this investigation, and it now appears from press reports that \nthe inspector general, who himself was being investigated, has \nresigned.\n  DHS needs its leaders confirmed. It cannot wait for months and \nmonths, which it has done already. I do not believe that in this case--\nwhich involves a distinguished nominee who has my confidence--that \nconfirmation should be delayed. Rather, we need to confirm a leader who \nunderstands our complicated immigration laws and policies and who can \nknowledgeably help us navigate and ultimately implement comprehensive \nimmigration reform. He has this needed knowledge and ability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Mayorkas.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Department of Homeland Security is \nthe leading agency for some of the most pressing issues facing our \nNation, from providing disaster relief to protecting our borders. To \nserve the American people, this agency needs a full complement of \nleaders, and that is why I am glad the Senate is considering the \nnomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. I commend Senator Carper, chairman of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, for making his nomination to this \nimportant position a priority for the committee and getting his \nnomination to the Senate.\n  Alejandro Mayorkas currently serves as Director of U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services, USCIS. This is the agency that makes our \nimmigration system work, and Director Mayorkas has made it a stronger, \nbetter functioning agency. His expertise on immigration issues will \nhelp him in his new role, where he is sure to improve coordination \nwithin the Department. Those Senators who claim to care about \nprotecting our borders and improving our broken immigration system \nshould support this nomination, just as they should call on the House \nto pass comprehensive immigration reform as we did here in the Senate \nearlier this year.\n  It is unfortunate that Director Mayorkas' nomination has been the \nsubject of unfair and partisan attacks, and it is wrong that some tried \nto create controversy about Director Mayorkas even before his \nconfirmation hearing occurred in the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. The attacks mounted against Director \nMayorkas are made even less credible by the conduct of the former DHS \ndeputy inspector general,\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nwho was forced to resign in the face of allegations of serious \nmisconduct.\n  On the eve of Director Mayorkas' confirmation hearing, this former \ndeputy inspector general, Charles Edwards, authorized the transmittal \nof an email to a Republican Senate office that contained sensitive \ninformation about an ongoing investigation involving Director Mayorkas. \nThe timing of its transmittal raised serious questions about the \nmotivation for its disclosure. Then, the email authorized by the former \ndeputy inspector general was published shortly after its transmittal on \nthe web site of a Republican candidate for Governor of Virginia. Why \nwould a Virginia gubernatorial candidate care about an investigation \nbeing conducted by the Office of Inspector General for the Department \nof Homeland Security? Because some of the anonymous allegations \nrepeated in that email by the Office of Inspector General involved \nclaims that Director Mayorkas intervened in an immigration matter for \nTerry McAuliffe, the Governor-elect of Virginia. What is worse, the \nformer inspector general had received these anonymous allegations in \nSeptember of 2012, yet only disclosed them publicly just days before \nDirector Mayorkas was scheduled to appear before the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Director Mayorkas' professional integrity further undermines these \nbogus allegations. Alejandro Mayorkas served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney and as the U.S. attorney for Southern California, posts he \nheld during the course of a decade. Where he has made mistakes, he has \ntaken responsibility. In my experiences with him while he has served as \nDirector of USCIS, Director Mayorkas has put the interests of USCIS and \nthose it serves at the forefront. He has made tough decisions to make \nthat agency better--decisions that are sometimes not popular with \nagency employees but decisions that put the institution first. He has \nbrought significant resources to bear on the EB-5 regional center \nprogram, a program that a bipartisan majority of this Senate supported \nwhen we passed comprehensive immigration reform in June. While the \nHouse has failed to pass this important legislation that includes \nmeaningful improvements to the EB-5 program, Director Mayorkas did not \nlet up on his efforts to ensure the program's integrity. He has acted \nto make sure the agency's decisions are correct under the controlling \nlaw and regulations. The suggestion that Director Mayorkas would risk \nhis reputation and his credibility by improperly intervening in a \nsingle immigration case, out of thousands his agency handles every \nyear, is absurd.\n  Those who have concerns about the integrity of the EB-5 regional \ncenter should remember that in May of this year, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously approved broad reforms to the EB-5 program during \nthe committee's consideration of comprehensive immigration reform. \nThese reforms, which received praise from the Judiciary Committee's \nformer ranking member, Senator Sessions, contained a host of \nimprovements recommended by Director Mayorkas and other administration \nofficials to provide strong oversight tools, security enhancements, and \nantifraud provisions. In June, 68 Senators voted in favor of the \ncomprehensive reform bill, of which my EB-5 reforms were a part. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who have supported this program \nknow it creates jobs in American communities and is an important and \nviable source of capital investment for many American entrepreneurs. \nSenator Grassley said on the Senate floor earlier this week that we \ncould make reforms to this program ``this very day.'' I would respond \nthat the Senate has voted to make them already this year, and I was \nglad to have his support for my strong reforms in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Those who say that the Senate should not approve Director Mayorkas' \nnomination because a scandal-plagued and now- resigned deputy inspector \ngeneral sat on allegations made against Director Mayorkas for 10 months \nbefore disclosing them in a highly improper way days before Director \nMayorkas' confirmation hearing should carefully consider whether these \ncircumstances merit our faith that the investigation is truly impartial \nor legitimate. I have seen no evidence that those Senators who put such \nfaith in the former deputy inspector general's flawed investigation \nhave asked the tough questions necessary to test the integrity of that \ninvestigation. Instead of considering the circumstances of the former \ndeputy inspector general's disclosure, and taking the opportunity to \nask tough questions of Director Mayorkas at his confirmation hearing, \nRepublican Senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee decided to boycott that hearing. And when Chairman Carper \nscheduled a committee business meeting to vote on Director Mayorkas' \nnomination, all Republican Senators but two failed to attend that \nmeeting. This is unfortunate and, in my view, an abdication of our \nresponsibility to evaluate the President's nominees independently.\n  As Senators, we are obligated to ask the tough questions of all \nnominees, but it is also important that we carefully consider the \nsource and motivations behind any allegations against those nominees.\n  Regarding the immigration case about which Director Mayorkas is \naccused of acting improperly, it is clear in emails that he wrote which \nhave been publicly disclosed, that he asserts his inability to become \ninvolved in any specific case. The emails that have been disclosed \npaint a picture of an agency director who took great pains to avoid any \nappearance of favoritism or impropriety. I would urge my colleagues to \nreview carefully, and in context, that which has been disclosed. \nFinally, it is troubling that the individuals who have brought \nallegations to Republican Senators against this nominee would not even \nagree to meet with Chairman Carper or his staff. The Senate should \nconsider the reliability of those who have made allegations but are \nunwilling to let those allegations be fully considered.\n  I have every reason to believe that Director Mayorkas will serve the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the American people honorably. I \nhave no doubt about the quality of his character or his integrity as a \npublic official. And I regret that his nomination has been so \nneedlessly politicized. Alejandro Mayorkas deserves an up-or-down vote \nand the support of the Senate.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, my friend Senator Durbin, from \nSpringfield, IL, Land of Lincoln, reminds me as I close here this \nmorning of something Lincoln once said. He was meeting with his Cabinet \nduring the heart of the Civil War. Things had started to turn for the \nbetter for the Union. The Union leader on the military side was a guy \nnamed Grant. He allegedly liked to drink, a lot. Some of the folks on \nthe President's cabinet didn't like him. They said: Mr. President, we \nneed to get rid of Grant. He is not the kind of guy we want to have \nleading our forces.\n  Grant had led a reversal of fortune, so that the Union having been on \nthe losing side ended up on the winning side again and again. Lincoln \nlooked at his Cabinet, and he said these words, and I paraphrase them: \nFind out what Grant is drinking, and give it to the rest of my \ngenerals.\n  Rather than criticize or hang out to dry a leader of an agency who \nhas turned it around, who enjoys the broad support of the folks within \nhis agency; rather than criticize him and finding fault and leaving him \nout there unable to defend himself against unknown accusations, we \nshould find out--in the words of Lincoln--what Grant is drinking. In \nthis case we should find out what Mayorkas is doing, what has he done \nto turn around an agency and make sure the other people who come into \npositions of authority are taking of the same beverage.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the unanimous consent agreement is that \nwe would move to this vote on the Mayorkas nomination following the \ndebate. This debate has ended a little earlier than we anticipated. \nThis first rollcall, we are going to accommodate Members and leave it \nopen so they have a chance. But because most are anxious, we are hoping \nMembers come to the floor early, vote, and we can start the series of \nvotes agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNevada (Mr. Reid) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. CORNYN.

People have planes to catch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Brian J. Davis\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today we consider the nomination of \nBrian Davis to be a District Court Judge for the Middle District of \nFlorida. I will vote for him today (although there has been some \ncontroversy surrounding his nomination). I wish to take a minute to \ndiscuss the nomination.\n  Judge Davis made a number of controversial remarks a few years ago. \nDuring his hearing last Congress, Judge Davis was asked to provide some \nclarification regarding those comments. After carefully reviewing his \nanswers from the hearing, many of us concluded that they didn't provide \nthe clarity that we had hoped he would provide. For that reason, \nfollowing his hearing, I asked Judge Davis some follow-up questions for \nthe Record, hoping to get the clarity, in writing, that I didn't hear \nhim provide during his hearing.\n  Unfortunately, after reviewing his written answers, I concluded that \nJudge Davis didn't fully appreciate why many found his comments so \ntroubling. For instance, when I asked him about these statements he \nwrote that a ``number of my statements could be misunderstood'', but he \nneither apologized for them nor said anything to demonstrate that he \nfully appreciated why his comments were so problematic.\n  As a result, in the last Congress I reluctantly opposed his \nnomination.\n  Judge Davis, of course, was renominated this Congress. On September \n12th, he submitted a letter to the Florida Senators.\n  In that letter, Judge Davis apologized for his comments--without \nqualification.\n  He wrote, ``I believe that several of the statements I made in the \npast were inappropriate and improper.'' He went on to write, ``I \napologize for any inappropriate statements and deeply recognize the \nharm that they could cause if they gave the misimpression that I am \nanything other than impartial or that I maintain any bias or \nprejudice.''\n  As I wrote to Judge Davis in a follow-up letter on September 25th, \nunlike the last Congress, I believe the apology Judge Davis transmitted \non September 12 for those comments was without qualification. \nTherefore, in my view, it demonstrated both courage and humility.\n  In my letter to Judge Davis, I asked him simply to confirm that he \nwas apologizing for his comments regarding Dr. Henry Foster, Dr. \nJoycelyn Elders, and Justice Thomas.\n  In a follow-up letter he wrote to me on September 26, he confirmed \nthose were the ``inappropriate comments'' he referenced in his letter \nto the Florida Senators.\n  I ask consent that both my letter to Judge Davis, and his response, \nbe made part of the Record.\n  I have given this nomination a great deal of consideration. I believe \nJudge Davis has taken steps this Congress that, in my view, he didn't \nappear willing to take last Congress. Taking this into consideration, \ntogether with the fact that he enjoys the support of his home State \nSenators, I am willing to give Judge Davis the benefit of the doubt and \nwill support his nomination today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2013.\n     Judge Brian J. Davis,\n     Nassau County Courthouse,\n     Fernandina Beach, FL.\n       Dear Judge Davis: I write to follow up on your September \n     12th letter to Senators Nelson and Rubio, copying me and \n     Chairman Leahy, regarding concerns with your record Members \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including me, raised last \n     Congress.\n       As you alluded in your letter, during your hearing last \n     Congress, Senator Lee asked you a number of questions \n     regarding various remarks and speeches you made throughout \n     your career. After carefully reviewing the answers you gave \n     during the hearing, I concluded your responses lacked the \n     breadth and clarity I had hoped you would provide when \n     afforded the opportunity. For instance, you conceded that \n     some comments were ``inappropriate,'' but then stated ``they \n     were inappropriate for the reason that an impression could be \n     gotten from them that somehow the court maintained a racial \n     prejudice.'' That response troubled me because it did not \n     appear to fully recognize the reason some find those comments \n     concerning. Specifically, the comments appeared quite plainly \n     to assign a racial motivation to those who opposed particular \n     nominees on purely policy grounds.\n       Consequently, following your hearing I sent you a number of \n     follow up questions for the record. Again, I was hopeful to \n     receive some clarity regarding those comments. But after \n     carefully reviewing your responses, I reluctantly reached the \n     conclusion that you still did not fully appreciate why some \n     viewed your comments as inappropriate. For instance, I asked \n     about your comments regarding President Clinton's nomination \n     of Dr. Henry Foster's nomination to be surgeon general. But \n     rather than concede what appears to be apparent by the words \n     you used, you answered instead that the comments were \n     inappropriate because they ``could be interpreted'' in a \n     particular way, and therefore that you lacked impartiality. \n     In my view, your answers to several other questions lacked \n     clarity in a similar fashion. For these reasons, among \n     several others, reluctantly I opposed your nomination last \n     Congress.\n       With this background, I received your letter of September \n     12th, 2013. In your letter you wrote, without qualification, \n     ``I believe that several of the statements I made in the past \n     were inappropriate and improper.'' You went on to write, ``I \n     apologize for any inappropriate statements and deeply \n     recognize the harm that they could cause if they gave the \n     misimpression that I am anything other than impartial or that \n     I maintain any bias or prejudice.'' I note that these two \n     statements represent a step that you did not appear willing \n     to take last Congress. In my view, this demonstrates both \n     courage and humility. Thank you for that letter.\n       As your nomination is now again pending before the \n     Committee, I write to seek one further clarification. As I \n     noted, you wrote in your recent letter that you apologize for \n     ``any inappropriate statements,'' but you did not specify the \n     statements to which you referred. I want to confirm that you \n     are referring to your comments regarding Dr. Henry\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\n     Foster, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, and Justice Thomas.\n       Thank you in advance for your prompt reply.\n           Sincerely.\n\n                                          Charles E. Grassley,\n\n                                                   Ranking Member,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Circuit Court,\n\n\n                                               Fourth Judicial\n\n                                           Circuit of Florida,\n\n                         Fernandina Beach, FL, September 26, 2013.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter of \n     September 25, 2013, and the opportunity to further clarify my \n     views.\n       I understand your concerns, and please know that my \n     appreciation of the inappropriateness of statements I have \n     made in speeches include those referenced in your letter \n     regarding Dr. Foster, Dr. Elders and Justice Thomas.\n       Thank you for your continued consideration of my \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian J. Davis.\n\n\n                      Nomination of John Koskinen\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to speak on the nomination of John \nKoskinen to be the next Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I want to say upfront that I support Mr. Koskinen's nomination as I \nbelieve he is a qualified candidate for this position and he deserves \nto be confirmed.\n  However, I do have to say that I am disappointed in the process by \nwhich his nomination has been moved through the Senate, both in the \nFinance Committee and here on the floor. There is simply no reason for \nthe Senate to rush to confirm Mr. Koskinen, and there is ample reason \nfor us to take our time.\n  It goes without saying that the IRS is one of the most powerful \nagencies in our government. It is both feared and loathed by people \nthroughout the country. That being the case, it is absolutely essential \nthat all the actions of the IRS and its leadership are above board.\n  That is the only way for the agency to maintain its credibility.\n  That is the only way an agency this powerful can maintain the trust \nof the American people.\n  The American people should be able to trust that the IRS will enforce \nour Nation's tax laws without bias or prejudice. If that trust is \nbroken, it damages the credibility of our entire government.\n  Needless to say, over the last few years, the IRS hasn't done a good \njob of maintaining that trust and, as a result, it has eroded its own \ncredibility.\n  I am talking, of course, about the IRS political targeting scandal \ncurrently under investigation in the Finance Committee.\n  If there is one thing that everyone should agree on, it is that the \nIRS should enforce the tax laws as they are written by Congress without \nconsideration of political views. Sadly, it appears that, for a time, \nnot everyone at the IRS shared that view.\n  When this scandal first came to light, there was condemnation on all \nsides and everyone--regardless of party affiliation--wanted to get to \nthe bottom of it.\n  President Obama, for example, said ``I have got no patience with it, \nI will not tolerate it, and we will make sure that we find out exactly \nwhat happened on this.''\n  Majority Leader Reid expressed similar views here on the floor, \nstating: ``I have full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and \nthe Finance Committee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend \nappropriate action.''\n  I hope that hasn't changed.\n  I hope that the effort to rush Mr. Koskinen's nomination through the \nSenate is not part of an effort to sweep the Finance Committee's \ninvestigation under a rug and hope it disappears.\n  As I said, there is no reason for us to move so quickly on this \nnomination.\n  By waiting until our investigation has concluded, we can ensure that \nthe next commissioner--presumably Mr. Koskinen--will begin their time \nwith the benefit of the findings of the investigation. This would put \nhim in a better position to fix the problems we have uncovered and to \nmove the agency forward. In addition, it would ensure that he has the \nconfidence of Members of both parties, which is vital with an agency of \nthis size and stature.\n  I am encouraged by Mr. Koskinen's commitment to continue the \ncooperation the Finance Committee has enjoyed so far in its \ninvestigation, as well as his commitment to working with Congress to \nfix the IRS's many problems.\n  I plan on holding him to his promise.\n  The confirmation of a new IRS Commissioner should not be a partisan \nissue.\n  My fear is that, by including Mr. Koskinen in the current partisan \nfight over executive branch nominees, the Senate Democratic leadership \nis injecting partisanship where none should exist. This further \nundermines the IRS as an agency, not to mention Mr. Koskinen's future \nleadership of the agency.\n  This is not a time that we should be undermining the IRS. In addition \nto restoring the agency's damaged credibility--which I believe should \nbe the next commissioner's top priority--there are a number of other \nchallenges facing this agency.\n  For example, there is the IRS's significant role in the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. As we have seen thus far, this presents a \nnumber of difficulties, both in terms of operation and enforcement.\n  Both the IRS's inspector general and insurers throughout the country \nhave questioned whether the agency is capable of administering the \nAffordable Care Act's premium subsidy program without massive amounts \nof fraud or improper payments.\n  On top of that, there are the proposed IRS and Treasury regulations \naddressing the political activities of tax-exempt organizations. Given \nthe IRS's recent problems in dealing with these types of organizations, \nmany of us have reason to be skeptical that the agency can promulgate \nsuch rules without further bias or prejudice.\n  On all these issues, Mr. Koskinen has committed to working with \nCongress, and with Members of both parties.\n  I hope that he lives up to this commitment.\n  It is essential that he does so, because, as I said, the IRS is an \nagency rife with problems, most of which are self-inflicted. These \nproblems are not simply going to go away when a new Commissioner is \nconfirmed, and they aren't going to be solved if the agency ignores the \ninput and inquiries from Members of Congress.\n  Once again, I support Mr. Koskinen's confirmation. I just wish we had \ngone a different route with regard to his nomination in the Senate.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Janet Yellen\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I wish to express my support \nfor Vice Chairman Janet Yellen, nominee for Chairman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Dr. Yellen has dedicated her life to understanding the complex and \nevolving field of economics, and her background makes her an ideal \ncandidate to replace Chairman Ben Bernanke and continue the Fed's \nefforts to boost economic growth, increase the pace of job creation, \nand ulitimately reduce the crushing unemployment that has been a drag \non our recovery.\n  Dr. Yellen's academic credentials and experience in economics are \nfirst rate.\n  She graduated suma cum laude from Brown University in 1967 and later \nearned a doctorate in economics from Yale University in 1971.\n  She began her teaching career as an assistant professor at Harvard \nUniversity, where she taught from 1971 to 1976.\n  In 1977 and 1978 she began her public service as an economist at the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors.\n  In 1980, Dr. Yellen headed west to my home State of California to \nbecome an assistant professor at the University of California, \nBerkeley, She rose to professor emeritus of business and economics and \nwas twice awarded teacher of the year at Berkeley's distinguished Haas \nSchool of Business.\n  During her time at Berkeley and elsewhere, Dr. Yellen published \nnumerous research works, including the well-regarded ``Waiting for \nWork,'' a comprehensive study of unemployment she completed with her \nhusband, the economist George Akerlof.\n  Dr. Yellen's research has been published in the Journal of Economics, \nBusiness Economics, and the Brookings Papers on Economic Policy, \namongst others.\n  Her research has primarily focused on unemployment, monetary policy, \nand international trade--a perspective that will be vitally important \nas the Fed works to solve the complex issues facing the global economy.\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\n  In 1997, she left the Federal Reserve to chair the Council of \nEconomic Advisers during the Clinton administration.\n  Before her appointment to Vice Chairman of the Fed she led the \nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, keeping watch over financial \nconditions in the region as well as providing counsel on the direction \nof monetary policy.\n  In 2010, she was appointed by the president and confirmed by the \nSenate to be Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve where she has ably \nserved. She has been intimately involved with the Fed's interest rate \npolicy and its continuation of the unprecedented program of \nquantitative easing.\n  I believe that this extensive experience working on monetary policy \nissues at the Federal Reserve will make for a seamless transition to \nChairman and provide stability to financial markets.\n  Recently, a lot of attention is being paid to the issue of growing \nincome inequality in our country.\n  Over the last few decades, middle-class incomes have stagnated while \nincomes for high earners have enjoyed a stratospheric rise. \nIncreasingly, the owners of capital are reaping a greater and greater \nshare of the profits, while hard working Americans struggle to keep up.\n  If this trend continues, it will make for a more volatile economy and \nput middle and lower income families in increasing financial strain.\n  Most importantly, if income inequality is really a product of \ninequality of opportunity, then the United States will no longer \ndeliver on its most fundamental promise, one that serves as the \nfoundation for our social contract.\n  To me, that outcome is unacceptable, and our leading economic \nthinkers should be working night and day to ensure that every hard-\nworking American has the opportunity to be successful in this country.\n  The most direct way to address income inequality is to increase the \nrate of job creation in the United States. We have made significant \nprogress in the recovery from the great recession, but the recovery has \nnot been robust enough to translate into a robust labor market which \nincreases wages for all Americans.\n  Dr. Yellen has demonstrated a consistent ability to balance the Fed's \nmission of increasing employment and maintaining stable inflation. Her \nacademic work suggests that she is keenly aware of the devastating \nimpact of persistently high unemployment, both for families and the \neconomy writ large.\n  With her keen understanding of economics and a rigorous analytical \nprocess and a distinguished career in academia, Dr. Yellen is the right \nperson to lead the Fed at this time.\n  And let me just say, a woman as Chairman of the Federal Reserve--a \ntalented and extraordinarily well qualified woman--is a positive thing.\n  I enthusiastically support her nomination, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9081-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's commitment to \nthis particular issue. However, this is just one of many tax provisions \nwhich will expire at the end of the year.\n  In the past, the senior the Senator from New York supported the \nextension of numerous provisions, as have I, particularly the State and \nlocal sales tax deduction in his case. I can only wonder if he is \nsignaling that the State and local sales tax provision, along with all \nthe others which are expiring, are no longer a priority for him.\n  In any event, the Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over all \nthe tax extenders, including the one being offered here today. As of \nyet, the committee has not been able to fully consider and report a tax \nextenders bill. As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee \nhimself, I would hope my colleague would want to work with other \nmembers of the committee to preserve its jurisdiction.\n  Since the House of Representatives has been out for 1 week, my \ncolleague's request--even if agreed to in the Senate--would not result \nin extending the mass transit provision. Finance Committee Republicans \nstand ready to work with our Democratic colleagues when we return in a \ncouple of weeks, and the House will be back then too. If we want to \nenact this extension into law, rather than just sending out talking \npoints, we ought to engage in regular order when we get back.\n  On that basis, I ask unanimous consent to modify my colleague's \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified to refer this \nbill to the Finance Committee so it can be properly considered through \nregular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New York accept the \nmodification request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. We are good friends \nand I know his heart is in the right place. I would just make a couple \nof quick points before I get into a little bit of the substance, and I \nwill be brief.\n  The reason this extender has special weight and deserves being \nbrought up today is the following: Most of the tax extenders--and I \ncertainly support a large number of them--can be put into law \nretroactively with little harm done. Since most of them affect people's \ntax returns in 2015 if the law is changed, say, January or February of \n2014, it doesn't affect this because the tax deduction would actually \nbe filed before April 2015.\n  The one problem with the mass transit benefit is it is much harder to \nmake retroactive. People try and we tried last year. We did it \nretroactively. But since the benefit goes each month to the commuter \nfrom his or her employer, retroactivity doesn't work quite as well.\n  That is why I felt it was important to try to get this passed now, so \nperhaps when the House returned immediately--there is good bipartisan \nsupport for this in the House support as well--they might enact it and \nwe would not have to wait for the Finance Committee to go through a \nlarge number of other tax extenders hearings and whatever, because the \nlonger it is retroactive, the harder it is.\n  I certainly appreciate my colleague's objection. I am going to fight \nvery hard to try to get this done in January when we return. I would \njust make these following points about the benefit.\n  It is a win-win. It is a win for our mass transit commuters because \nthen they get the same benefit--no more, no less--than those who drive \nto work and park. It was an anomaly in the law, pointed out by my late \ncolleague, friend, and mentor, Senator Moynihan, that it was unfair to \ngive people who drive their cars to work double the tax benefit of mass \ntransit commuters. It is only fair to make them equal.\n  Right now, the law will raise the parking-driving benefit--those who \ndrive to work--at the rate of inflation to $250. That is a good thing \nand I am all for that. But if the law is not renewed before December \n31, the mass transit benefit, which I have worked hard to make equal to \nthe park-and-drive benefit, will revert back to $130 a month, which is \na lot less and unfair.\n  The second benefit is to people who drive. You say why would they \nbenefit? They are getting theirs. The bottom line is, for every person \nwho takes mass transit and doesn't take his or her car to work, that \nreduces congestion on the roads. So even if you never want to ride the \ntrain or the bus to work, you should be for this.\n  Finally, I would say the following: It benefits our environment. We \nall know that mass transit pollutes the air a lot less than people \ndriving individual cars. In many places it is not possible to use mass \ntransit, but in more and more parts of the country it is and we ought \nto be encouraging that. To have this benefit expire is bad, bad for \npeople who take mass transit. Obviously there are a lot of them in my \nState--700,000--who get this benefit. It is bad for those who drive and \nbad for the clean air that we wish to breathe.\n  I will continue my quest because I think it is only fair and only \nright and it is good for all of America. As my colleague noted, it is a \ntax break. We generally can find more agreement on tax breaks than many \nother issues--fiscal and tax issues in this Congress. I will continue \nmy quest to have this renewed as soon as possible, and I think it is \nnot unfair to do it ahead of the other tax breaks because of the unique \nway that this benefit functions and how it is harder--not impossible \nbut harder to enact retroactively.\n  Mr. President, I wish you, the entire staff who has done a great job \nhere through the year, and all of my colleagues as well as those here \nin the gallery, a merry Christmas, a happy new year--not least of whom \nis my good friend and colleague from Utah who I know has a big and \nhappy family. I wish them a merry Christmas and a happy new year as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor, I guess with just about almost certainty for the \nlast time in 2013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from New York. He \nis a great Senator. I understand his concern here, but we ought to do \nthis in accordance with regular order, especially on the Finance \nCommittee, to get to where we work on these matters and get them done \nin an exigent and good way, and I will certainly try to work with my \ncolleague throughout this process.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to wish everybody who serves in this \nbody a merry Christmas and a happy new year. This is a wonderful time \nof the year. We all feel pretty good today, having finally gotten \nthrough most of the work that we needed to get through.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the debacle that is \nthe so-called Affordable Care Act. I don't think there is anyone in \nthis Chamber, Republican or Democrat, who would dispute that thus far \nthe implementation of this law has been a disaster, particularly with \nregard to the healthcare.gov Web site and the President's promise that \n``if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.''\n  The administration has admitted that it bungled the rollout and has \ntried to cover up for what PolitiFact dubbed ``the lie of the year,'' \nby passing the buck to States and insurers as to whether individuals \nwould be able to keep their plans for the next year.\n  Let's be clear about this. ObamaCare's problems are deeply rooted in \nits DNA, and they are far larger, far bigger than just a Web site. Is \nthe Web site causing the cost of health insurance premiums to go up \ndramatically? Is the Web site causing businesses to force more and more \nemployees to work part-time? Is the Web site sending out cancellation \nnotices to patients and consumers, telling them that their health care \nplans are no longer available? Of course not. Yet as the functionality \nof the Web site continues to improve, the administration is starting to \ntalk as if every problem with the law has been fixed and that all the \nother issues are going to simply dissolve.\n  We know that is not the case. In reality the problems with ObamaCare \nare only beginning. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss some \nof the problems we are going to be seeing in the future as the \nPresident's health law continues to be implemented. I have to say that \nwhen it comes to ObamaCare, it is a little difficult to make \npredictions. That is because the administration has gone to great \nlengths to muddy the waters with delayed deadlines and unilateral \npolicy changes. However, I think we can look through the opaque waters \nand identify at least six general areas where we can expect to see \nmajor problems in the coming months. These are six areas among many, \nbut theses are six I want to talk about today.\n  No. 1, we are going to continue to see problems with the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. Like I said, there have undoubtedly been \nimprovements to the Web site. They should be able to resolve that \nproblem. It is a technical problem. It is a shame it was not resolved \nto begin with. It is a shame that enough time wasn't given to resolve \nit, but there still are issues that are far from resolved besides that.\n  Let's just look at the enrollment in the exchanges to see how things \nare going. As of November 30, roughly 365,000 individuals enrolled in \nhealth insurance coverage through the State and Federal exchanges. That \nis a small improvement from the numbers that we saw at the end of \nOctober but still far short of the benchmarks that the Department of \nHealth and Human Services had set for enrollment in the exchanges. \nOriginally, HHS touted a goal of enrolling 7 million people in the \nexchanges by March of 2014. According to a memo obtained by the \nAssociated press, HHS projected that on the way to reaching that goal \nof 7 million enrollees, they would enroll roughly half a million people \nin the first month. Yet after 2 months they were still more than \n100,000 people short of that one-month benchmark, which is not a high \nbenchmark in my opinion.\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\n  The same memo projected that they would have 3.3 million enrollees by \nthe end of 2013. Yet, if they are going to reach that goal, they will \nhave to enroll nearly 10 times as many people as they have enrolled so \nfar in just the next week and a half.\n  Sure, many of these enrollment problems are due to a poorly designed \nand poorly executed Web site, but even with the Web site's \nimprovements, it would take a substantial miracle for the \nadministration to meet its enrollment goals for the coming months.\n  There are other significant problems to be concerned about, most \nnotably those associated with the premium subsidy program administered \nby the IRS.\n  Earlier this month the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration issued a report that found that the IRS has an \ninadequate system in place for preventing fraudulent premium subsidy \npayments from occurring and that people's personal information will \nlikely be at risk. That is the Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration. That is not Republicans. There are real questions as to \nwhether the IRS can effectively verify the income of those applying for \nthese subsidies. I have also raised the concern on a number of \noccasions.\n  Similar tax subsidy programs, including, for example, the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit, EITC, that are paid out before they are verified, \nhave improper payment rates as high as 25 percent. Think of that.\n  If we see the same improper payment rate on these ObamaCare subsidies \nas we do on the EITC, it will end up costing taxpayers hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the next 10 years. As I have said in the past, \nthe ObamaCare premium subsidies with the lack of security and \nsafeguards are a fraudster's dream. We have warned the administration, \nand I personally warned the administration.\n  The administration may claim that with the recent improvement to the \nhealthcare.gov Web site all is now right with the world. However, as \nyou can see, there are a number of administrative problems that, even \nwith a functional Web site, have yet to be resolved.\n  No. 2, Americans will be left without coverage due to the problems \nwith ObamaCare. As a result of the dismal rollout of ObamaCare, many \nAmericans, particularly those who have tried to enroll in the \nexchanges, could very well end up being uninsured for a time. Maybe a \nsignificant time.\n  Last week an article appeared in the Washington Post that told the \nstories of people had were forced out of their existing health plans \ndue to ObamaCare's coverage mandates but are unable to sign up for the \nnew plans on the exchange due to the failings of the Web site. The \ndeadline for signing up for coverage that starts on January 1, 2014, is \nDecember 23, 2013. Anyone who has been kicked off their plan who is \nunable to sign up before that date, which is just a few days away, will \nfind themselves facing a gap in medical coverage.\n  For the chronically ill or for people with expensive medical \nconditions, this gap in coverage will be particularly acute. These \npeople are, according to the Washington Post, ``ObamaCare's biggest \nlosers.'' Yet, ostensibly, these are the very people that this law was \nenacted for and supposed to help.\n  Another reason countless Americans may end up seeing gaps in coverage \nis simply because they will be unable to navigate the ever-changing \nlandscape that is ObamaCare's dates and deadlines. Due to the failures \nof the rollout, the administration has delayed or shifted virtually \nevery deadline associated with obtaining and paying for coverage. For \nexample, like I said, the deadline for enrolling in insurance coverage \nthat starts on January 1 is December 23, just a few days away. The \ndeadline for actually getting the first premium payment to insurers is \nDecember 31. Both of these dates have been moved at least once already \nand could be moved again. They probably will be. On top of that, the \nadministration has issued statements ``encouraging'' insurers to extend \ntheir own deadlines for payment and enrollment.\n  This is on top of the delays in the employer mandate, the SHOP \nexchanges, and the countless other provisions we have seen delayed or \nextended over the past year.\n  People are bound to be confused by all of these changes. It is nearly \nimpossible for anyone, let alone those with serious medical conditions, \nto keep track of the ever-changing deadlines the administration keeps \nissuing. With no clarity as to when people should sign up and who they \nshould pay and when, it is a virtual certainty that many consumers will \nfind themselves uncovered for a period of time through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  The administration added to all of this uncertainty last night with \nthe announcement it was going to allow people with canceled insurance \nplans to either buy catastrophic plans or avoid the requirement that \nthey buy health insurance altogether. It has been less than a full day, \nand already this decision is causing confusion among insurers. It will \nalmost certainly do the same for consumers.\n  It seems the Obama administration is making all of this up as they go \nalong. Undoubtedly, many people will suffer the consequences of this \nineptitude. The administration should be ashamed of the way this is \nbollixed up and messed up, and it is just going to get worse.\n  No. 3, there will continue to be spikes in premiums and other costs. \nWe have already seen what is happening to the price of insurance in the \nindividual market. Thanks to ObamaCare, millions of people have already \nlost their existing health insurance and have found that their options \non the exchanges come with much higher premiums. This sticker shock has \nbeen widely reported. But that is not the end of the crisis problem.\n  Unfortunately, many people are also finding that their out-of-pocket \ncosts will be dramatically increased thanks to higher copayments and \nprescription drug costs, included in plans on the exchanges. In many \ncases, it is difficult for patients to determine which medications are \ncovered on the ObamaCare plans.\n  Unlike in Medicare Part D, the ObamaCare Web site does not have a \nplan finder that would enable consumers to search for plans based on \ncoverage. These new costs are particularly high when compared with the \ninsurance plans that were recently canceled.\n  But it is not just happening in the individual market. These price \nspikes are also hitting people with employer-provided insurance. \nAccording to a recent poll by the Associated Press, nearly half of \nAmericans with job-based or other private insurance say their policies \nwill be changing next year, mostly for the worse. So 69 percent say \nthat the cost of their insurance will be going up; 59 percent say their \nannual deductibles or copayments are increasing. The Affordable Care \nAct did little to reign in the actual cost of health care.\n  When you add in the costs associated with the law's mandates and \nregulations, costs are going up, particularly for small businesses, our \nmain job creators.\n  A recent survey of small business owners by the National Federation \nof Independent Business confirmed that this is already starting to \nhappen. In the survey, 64 percent of small businesses reported that \nthey paid more for employee health insurance premiums in 2013 than they \ndid in 2012. Small business owners consistently cite the rising cost of \nhealth care as their top business concern.\n  This brings us to the next obvious prediction, No. 4. Millions of \npeople will lose their existing employer-provided health insurance. \nOnce again, we are all too familiar with President Obama's infamous \npromise, ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,'' but \nlittle has been said about the threats ObamaCare's mandates pose to \npeople who get their health insurance from their employers.\n  Put simply, the health law was designed specifically to invalidate \nexisting health care plans--those deemed inadequate by the drafters of \nthe law--in order to force people into more expensive plans with \nexpanded coverage they don't necessarily want or need. This applies to \nboth individual market plans and employer-provided plans alike. The \nadministration's own estimates, published in the Federal Register, \npredicted that tens of millions of Americans with employer-sponsored--\nkeep in mind, employer-sponsored--insurance will see their plans \ninvalidated by the\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\nso-called Affordable Care Act's mandates and regulations.\n  According to a recent analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, \nas many as 50 to 100 million insurance policies in the employer-\nprovided insurance market will see their plans canceled next fall when \nall business plans must be fully compliant with ObamaCare's insurance \nmandates. At that point businesses will have to face a difficult \nchoice: Offer a more expensive health care plan to their employees or \nsend employees into the exchanges. As we have already seen, that is not \na great place to be.\n  No. 5, health insurers will either leave the market or face \nbankruptcy. One of the foundational assumptions made by the drafters of \nthe Affordable Care Act was that the costs to insurers of providing \nvastly expanded coverage would be offset when more young and healthy \npatients are brought into the risk pools. Indeed, this is almost the \nentire basis for the individual mandate. The problem is that so far \nthis doesn't seem to be happening, and I doubt it ever will. There is \ngood reason to question whether it ever will. With the ever-increasing \ncost of insurance as a direct result of ObamaCare, there will likely be \nmany who opt to stay out of the market altogether.\n  There is ample data right now to support this conclusion. For \nexample, in a poll released earlier this month from the Harvard \nInstitute of Politics, those in the millennial generation--the very \npeople whom proponents of ObamaCare desperately need to add to the \ninsurance pool--were shown to be highly skeptical of the law. In the \npoll, a majority of 18- to 29-year-olds disapproved of the Affordable \nCare Act and said it will increase their personal health care costs. \nOnly 18 percent of respondents in that age group said they thought the \nlaw would improve their health care.\n  Clearly, the authors of ObamaCare thought that the individual \nmandate, along with the strong sense of civic duty, would coerce people \ninto acting against their own interests and paying expanded costs for \ncoverage they don't necessarily want or need; however, in the real \nworld where people weigh costs and benefits before making a decision, \nmillions of people are more likely to pay a fine instead of entering a \nskewed and unstable insurance market where costs are forever going up. \nA lot of these young people will not even pay the fine because there is \nno penalty for not doing so.\n  Without a greatly expanded risk pool of younger and healthier \nconsumers, it is not going to be worth it for many insurers to stay in \nthe market. Those insurers who do stay and try to stick it out will do \nso at greater risk to their financial future.\n  Insurers are not the only ones facing a dismal economic outlook as a \nresult of ObamaCare, which brings me to my final prediction. Remember, \nI am just limiting it to six today. I will have more later.\n  No. 6, ObamaCare will continue to be a drag on business and our \noverall economy. It isn't just patients and consumers who are suffering \nunder ObamaCare; employers are also facing difficulties as a direct \nresult of ObamaCare. As I have discussed here on the floor at length in \nanticipation of the employer mandate, businesses all across the country \nhave either reduced employment or have stopped hiring. Workers who had \nfull-time jobs before the passage of ObamaCare are finding themselves \nmoved into part-time work because under the law employers will be \nforced to provide coverage for full-time workers.\n  Even the unions, which were among the largest and biggest supporters \nof the health law when it was being debated in Congress, have come out \nand said the law is destroying the 40-hour workweek for American \nworkers.\n  Last week the National Association of Manufacturers released its \nquarterly survey of its members which showed overwhelmingly that the \nPresident's health care law is having a negative impact on the \nmanufacturing sector. According to that survey, more than 20 percent of \nmanufacturers have cut or decelerated their business investment as a \nresult of ObamaCare. Nearly one-quarter of them have either reduced \nemployment or ceased hiring. Roughly one-third of them say they have \nreduced their business outlook for 2014 as a result of the so-called \nAffordable Care Act. And more than 77 percent--nearly 8 in 10--of \nmanufacturers cited rising health insurance costs as a primary business \nchallenge.\n  In other words, at a time when our economy is growing at a sluggish \npace and job growth remains lackluster, the President and Democrats in \nCongress continue to support a health care law that is making America a \nmuch more difficult place to do business and to find and keep a job. It \nis only going to get worse as this wears on. These are just some of the \nproblems we are going to see in the coming months as a direct result of \nObamaCare, and they are not going to go away so long as the Affordable \nCare Act remains in place.\n  As I see it, with 2013 coming to a close, the President and his \nallies here in Congress are at a crossroads. As I see it, they have two \nchoices: They can continue to double down on the same failed policy \nthat is increasing the cost of health insurance in this country and \ncausing millions of people to lose their existing coverage and will \ncontinue to wreak havoc well into the future or they can, for once, try \nto work with Republicans on replacing this failure with something that \nhas a real chance of success. I hope that eventually my colleagues will \nchoose the latter, but needless to say I don't think I can keep my \nhopes up.\n\n  Last but not least, I hope this is not leading to a throwing of the \nhands in the air, admitting this doesn't work, and then saying we have \nto go to socialized medicine, or what many call a single-payer system. \nIf we do that, I have to tell you, we will never get out from under \nthis mess.\n  We had a system that was working pretty well. There were up to 30 \nmillion people who did not have coverage. Why didn't we just \nconcentrate governmentally on helping the 30 million people rather than \ndoing this colossally bad bill that we are all going to rue the day we \ndid? I am so concerned about it.\n  There are ways we can work together. I really believe we have to find \nsome folks on the other side of the aisle who really understand this \nand who really understand that they are getting killed by this bill. \nHopefully, we can find some folks who will sit down and work with \npeople like myself. I have been instrumental in an awful lot of health \ncare legislation over the last 37 years. Hopefully, we can work \ntogether in order to get this terrible problem resolved. I am concerned \nabout it.\n  Health care should never have been a partisan issue, and in this case \nit is a totally partisan issue. Every Democrat in the House and Senate \nvoted for it. Not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for \nit. We all voted against it, knowing in advance that it would be a \ndisaster. Frankly, I would like to get rid of the disaster, and I hope \nwe can find some colleagues on the other side who will be willing to \nwork to do that.\n  I hope the President will wake up. I think he thinks he is going to \ndouble down and fight for this, when, in fact, it is killing his \nreputation and the Democratic Party's reputation as well.\n  We clearly can't keep going the way we are.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to be able to engage the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire in a colloquy for about 20 minutes. I would \nappreciate it if the Presiding Officer would let us know when the 20 \nminutes has expired. I would like to discuss the military retiree \nposition and the budget with Senator Ayotte when she gets here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Presiding Officer is from Virginia, and I know he \nunderstands military men and women very well. It is a very patriotic \nState when it comes to their military footprint. I am confident that he \nand I--and others--will be able to fix the problem that occurred in the \nbudget agreement.\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\n  Let me say about the agreement itself that I do appreciate the fact \nthat we were able to find a bipartisan way forward to relieve \nsequestration from the military and nonmilitary for a couple of years. \nThat is just a drop in the bucket as far as what we have to do to \nrepair the military. GDP spending on the military is moving toward an \nalltime low over a 10-year period with sequestration. The historical \naverage has been well over 4 percent, and we are going to hit below 3 \npercent if we continue sequestration. That is an issue for another day.\n  The budget agreement called for relieving sequestration in the pay-\nfors. Quite frankly, they were not big. They did not change the course \nof the country. They are not what the Senator from Virginia and I hoped \nfor. We would have liked to have done entitlement reform. I would like \nto do Tax Code simplification. I am willing to eliminate deductions in \nthe Tax Code and take some of the money to pay down the debt, even \nthough some folks on my side say we have to put it all in tax \nreductions. And I think the Senator from Virginia would be willing to \nengage in commonsense entitlement reform to keep us from becoming \nGreece.\n  This was the best deal we could get. It didn't do the big deal, but \nit did provide some budget relief for a 2-year period, and it was about \n$60-something billion; I can't remember the number.\n  The bottom line is that one of the ways you paid for relieving \npressure on the defense budget and nondefense spending was there was a \nprovision that will affect military retirees, which nobody will own, \nthat got into the budget agreement.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. I was not consulted about the \nagreement; I read about it in the paper. There is a fine line between \nhaving a bunch of people involved who kind of keep things from never \ndeveloping to produce a product and having a handful of people doing \nsomething in a small room, not vetted.\n  So the bottom line is that $6.3 billion of the pay-fors came from \nadjusting military retirement cost-of-living allowances for those who \nhave served our military for 20 years and are therefore eligible for \nretirement. What they did was they took the COLA and reduced it by 1 \npercent for every military retiree until they reach the age of 62.\n  The President, to his credit, has called for an adjusting CPI, the \nway COLAs are calculated, for everybody--for civilians, military, \nSocial Security--to make it more consistent with sustainable \ninflationary increases. This didn't adjust the COLA, it left the \nformula as it is; it just reduced the military retiree's COLA by 1 \npercent until the military retiree reaches age 62, and that is the only \ngroup in the country that had that happen. So $6.3 billion is taken \naway from men and women who have served for 20 years, and no one else \nhad the pleasure of that experience.\n\n  Civilian employees, new hires, had to contribute additional funds to \nthe Federal retirement system to help pay for the deal, but it only \naffected new retirees; the people who are in the system were \ngrandfathered. The only group that Congress found fit to single out for \nthe retroactive application was the retiree community.\n  All I can say is that military pay--retirement, pension pay, health \ncare benefits are going to be subject to being reviewed and they will \nbe subject to reform, because a larger portion of our budget in DOD is \npersonnel costs. The Congress, in its wisdom, set up a commission to \nlook at this issue. They are supposed to report back in 2014--now maybe \nit is as late as 2015--about how to reform military pay and benefits as \npart of an overall restructuring of the Pentagon.\n  One thing Congress put into the commission's charter was that they \nhad to grandfather people who are currently in the system. In the \nbudget agreement we singled out military retirees for a 1-percent \nreduction of their COLA and nobody was grandfathered--$6.3 billion \ncoming out of the pockets of those who have served. For an E-7 who is \ngoing to retire at 40 and has his or her COLA reduced to age 62, it is \nbetween $71,984 or $80,000, depending on who you talk to, in loss and \nbenefits. And the E-7 receives in retirement pay after 20 years of \nfaithful service about $25,000 a year--not exactly becoming \nindependently wealthy.\n  We have one of the leading voices on this issue, Senator Ayotte from \nNew Hampshire, who took up this challenge and came up with some \nsolutions early on and has been a great voice about how unfair this is. \nSo I will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Carolina.\n  I picked up an editorial this morning from the Washington Post that \ncalls the cuts to the cost-of-living adjustments to military retirees \nminuscule and demeans this criticism. It calls the cuts teensy-weensy.\n  I don't understand why anyone would want to support a measure that \nsingles out--in other words, under this budget agreement, the group \nthat got the cuts to their current benefits are those who have \nsacrificed the most for our country. To call this minuscule or teensy-\nweensy--I don't think it is so minuscule, as the Senator from South \nCarolina said, to an E-7 who makes about $25,000 a year in retirement \nand will lose close to $72,000 from the time he or she retires at 40 \nuntil they are 62. That is about 3 years of their retirement. That is \nnot minuscule in a working family.\n  This is not a minor situation. It is not minuscule to our veterans, \nthose wounded warriors who have given the most, and who have, \nunfortunately, suffered so much.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This applies to disabled retirees as well, right?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. It does. We have all visited Walter Reed and we have all \nmet our wounded warriors who are heroes. They have sacrificed more than \nwe could ever ask anyone to sacrifice for our Nation. Some of them \ndon't have arms, legs. They receive a medical retirement because of \ntheir service and their disability as a result of the service they have \nrendered so gravely for our country, and they get cut under this too. I \ndon't think the cut to them is teensy-weensy or minuscule. Only in \nWashington would this be minimized in terms of how people are viewed as \nminuscule or teensy-weensy in light of the service they have given to \nour country. I thought this description of it was wrong and offensive \nand demoralizing in terms of the message it sends to our men and women \nin uniform.\n  I think the encouraging part of where we are right now is that so \nmany in this body have come forward and said we need to fix this and \nrecognize this does have an unfair impact on our military retirees and, \nof course, those who have received a medical retirement.\n  Whether I disagreed with my colleagues voting for the agreement, \nregardless of where my colleagues stand on the agreement, I think it is \ntime for us to come together on a bipartisan basis and do the right \nthing and fix this on behalf of our men and women in uniform, \nespecially our wounded warriors.\n  Obviously, this body realizes this is not minuscule and this is not \nteensy-weensy in terms of the impact on our heroes and those who have \nsacrificed so much for our country. I am very encouraged to see so many \nof my colleagues over the last couple of days coming forward with \ndifferent ideas about how we can fix this and do the right thing on \nbehalf of our men and women in uniform.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation that would come up with \nbillions of dollars for a pay-for to fix this. I know others have \ndifferent ideas. But I know this: We can put politics aside. We can fix \nthis for our men and women in uniform.\n  After we go home for the holidays, I think when we come back in \nJanuary, this should be a No. 1 priority in this body, which is to do \nthe right thing for our military retirees, for those who are our \nwounded warriors. The number of people I have seen speak out on this \nissue in the last few days gives me encouragement that we will be able \nto do this and do it quickly on their behalf, to right this wrong. Some \nof them are 19 years in. Maybe they have done multiple tours in \nAfghanistan and are thinking of retiring. We need to let them know we \nunderstand their sacrifice, we should not have singled them out, we \nwill get this right, and that we understand that of all the people who \nshould not have been singled out in this agreement are those who take \nthe bullets for us and whose families have\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nhad to go through multiple deployments.\n  I think about the fact that when someone has done a 20-year military \ncareer and one has had multiple deployments, the spouse can't have the \nsame kind of career as if they were able to live in one place. They \nsacrifice so much because they are traveling around the world and the \nretirement they receive obviously recognizes that.\n  So as we leave for the holidays, I hope when we get back, we get this \nright, we take this up, we honor the service of our men and women in \nuniform and do what is right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Ayotte mentioned this Washington Post editorial. \nThe Washington Post is, in my view, a very good newspaper. I like the \neditorial board. They have been right on Syria and a lot of other \nissues. Sometimes we disagree, that is for sure. But this one editorial \nhas gotten my attention to the point that I have to respond and, quite \nfrankly, ask my friends at the Washington Post to reevaluate their \nposition and think a little bit about what they are saying in their \neditorial when it comes to military retirees.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S9088, December 20, 2013, in the first column, the \nfollowing language appears: . . . and do what is right. Senator \nAYOTTE mentioned . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . and do what is \nright. Mr. GRAHAM.Senator Ayotte mentioned . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  As she said, the editorial says this is a ``teensy-weensy'' small \ncut. I said that we were screwing the military retirement community and \nmaybe a better way of saying it was we are disrespecting the military \nretiree community, because when I said we were screwing the military \nretirees, it was sort of like the financial package. They are having to \ngive up retirement benefits--the COLA reductions--that not one other \nperson in the entire country has to go through. And it is not teensy-\nweensy. When it is 1 percent calculated from 40 to 62, it is $71,000 to \n$80,000; if you are an officer, $100,000. Again, you get about $25,000 \nin retirement when you are an E-7; some in the thirties if you are an \nO-5. But to get that you have to serve your country for 20 years, \nuprooting your family--probably the average number of moves has to be \nfive or six. If you have been on Active Duty since 9/11, God knows how \nmany times you have been to Iraq and Afghanistan and other places.\n  Here is the deal: Your children are not subject to being drafted. \nWhy? Because we abolished the draft, and we put in place an all-\nvolunteer force, and part of the deal was that we would take care of \nthe military member and their family in an appropriate way if they \nwould bear that burden for the rest of us.\n  Are these people really living large off the rest of us? Should we be \noffended at this ``great deal'' we are giving these people who retire \nat 40 or 45 or 38? You know, the ``My God, aren't they just sort of \ntaking the rest of us for a ride'' attitude really offends the hell out \nof me.\n  To get that $25,000 in retirement for the rest of your life--and I \nhope you live to be 80, or you just name the number--you had to work \nfor it, you had to risk your life for it, you had to ask of your \nchildren something that most people do not have to ask; that is, move \nand leave your friends every couple years. You had to do things for the \nrest of us that, apparently, we do not appreciate anymore at the \nWashington Post.\n  I do not know what the editorial board's makeup is. They are all \npatriotic, I am sure good people, and if they have veterans down there, \nboy, you let your fellow veteran down by approaching this issue in such \na harsh, insensitive way. Their response was: No, the military retiree \nis not getting screwed. This is just a small step to something larger.\n  What they are trying to do--which offends me--is, one, they do not \nknow what they are talking about, which is unusual for the Washington \nPost. Do not confuse my disgust with the singling out of military \nretirees in a retroactive fashion to pay for a budget deal that does \nnot do a whole lot to change the course of the country with my desire \nand willingness to reform military pay and pension benefits in the \nfuture through a logical process. Now, that offends me. That is pretty \nclever.\n  So can you be for reform and be disgusted at the same time? Yes. And \nhere is the good news. Very few U.S. Senators are taking the Washington \nPost tactic that these people deserve more cuts--not less--singled out. \nI think the Washington Post is on an island of its own, at least I hope \nso.\n  People who voted yes--Senator McCain, God knows he has earned his \nretirement; Senator Chambliss; Senator Isakson--have come up with a way \nto fix this, and all three of them will say: I will embrace military \npay and pension benefit reform in the future. I am not just going to \nsingle out the military retiree and reduce their COLA when no one else \ngets that reduction retroactively, violating their own commission \ncharter.\n  Senator Shaheen on the other side wants to fix it. Senator Murray \nwants to fix it. I am really pleased that a lot of people have said: \nNow that I understand how this works, we need to fix it.\n  I have not even mentioned the fact that it does apply to disabled \nretirees. If you had your legs blown off in Afghanistan, it might be \npretty hard to get another job. Your COLA is reduced too.\n  What do you say to those people? Thank you? Itsy-bitsy, teensy-\nweensy? Really? But they did not mention in the editorial that it \napplies to the disabled retiree. Mr. President, $600 million of the $6 \nbillion comes from that community.\n  Here is my point: It is not so much that we were insensitive. It just \nshows me how far we have fallen as a nation and how comfortable we are \nfor other people to do the fighting and we see these folks almost as \nthe hired help, even though we profusely praise them, and we should. We \nwelcome them home when they come back. We cheer when they go away. We \ntrip over ourselves as politicians to show our love and affection. The \naverage person at the airport says: Thank you for your service. We are \nwell-meaning people. But to believe that somehow they are being fairly \ntreated in this budget deal and really we are just not doing enough \nfrom the Washington Post's perspective, I think loses sight of what \nthey have done for the rest of us.\n  Let's say we never reformed a penny of military retirement in the \nfuture and we left it as it is. About $1.734 million is the package \nover the lifetime from the 20-year retirement point to death, which the \naverage could be 40 years. We need to look at that. But let's say we \ndid not change a penny. Over a 40-year period, at $25,000 a year, do \nyou begrudge these people this package? After 20 years of service, they \nare now in their forties, their late thirties--the average is probably \nin the mid forties--they have to start over again. Go do that. Not so \neasy. And somehow we are suggesting that we are being too generous?\n  Would you send your kid? If I gave you $1.74 million over the next 40 \nyears, is that worth it for you to have your kid sent over to \nAfghanistan or Iraq, if they did not want to go? That is what this is \nabout.\n  So to my friends at the Washington Post, I do not know what happened \nhere. I do not know how you could justify and defend this provision in \nthe budget agreement that nobody wants to claim credit for. Again, I \nwill reform military pay and pension benefits through the commission \nprocess prospectively, but I will not sit on the sidelines and watch \nthese people, yes, get screwed financially but, more than that, be \ndisrespected.\n  To my House and Senate colleagues, Republican and Democrats, we \ncreated this problem together. We will have to fix it together. And to \nthe military retiree community, the disabled retiree, I am confident \nthat Republicans and Democrats will right this wrong.\n\n  Having said that, there will come a day when we will sit down and \nlook long and hard about the sustainable nature of personnel costs--\nTRICARE reform--pay and pension reform--but we are going to do it \nunderstanding you have a special place in our heart, but when it comes \nto balancing the budget and writing the Department of Defense long-term \nfinancial obligations, that we will look at this in a professional \nmanner, and we will do it in the way least intrusive, and we will give \npeople notice. We will not change the deal.\n  Can you imagine what it is like to have fought since 9/11; you are \ngetting ready to retire in 2016, after 20 years of faithful service--or \nmaybe longer--you are from your last deployment in Afghanistan; you \nhave been to Iraq a couple times, Afghanistan a couple times; you had a \ncouple buddies die; you have missed countless birthdays and \nChristmases, and every time a strange car\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\npulls up into the driveway, your spouse loses their breath, and you \nread that this is what the Congress is doing to you--changing the deal? \nYou did your part of the deal, but all of a sudden we decide to change \nthe deal because we have to find some money around this place to pay \nfor a budget deal that does not do a whole lot for the long-term \nindebtedness of the country. And when we look to find money, we saw you \nas a source of money--not as the patriot, not as the front-line \ndefender of freedom, not as the volunteer who took the burden off our \nbacks and gave our families a pass. Shame on us all.\n  But the way you fix it is you fix it. To my friends at the Washington \nPost, Bowles-Simpson never said as part of their efforts to balance the \nbudget--and I embrace their process--that we would eliminate military \nretiree COLAs as a recommendation. They set a target goal of saving $70 \nbillion over 10 years from a Federal workforce entitlement task force \nto be set up to look at civilians and the military who work for the \nFederal Government, and they created the task force with a target goal \nof achieving $70 billion as a contribution toward reforming \nentitlements on that side of the ledger.\n  They gave examples of what the task force might look at: Use the \nhighest 5 years of earnings to calculate civil service pension benefits \nfor new retirees, rather than the highest 3 years. That could save $5 \nbillion. Defer cost-of-living adjustments, as we are talking about \nhere. That could save $5 billion. Adjust the ratio of employer-employee \ncontributions to Federal employee pension plans to equalize \ncontributions, $4 billion. These are examples of things to look at--not \nBowles-Simpson recommendations. The recommendation of Bowles-Simpson \nwas to find $70 billion from military and civilian retirement programs \nover 10 years through a task force.\n  What did the Congress do? We set up a commission--rather than a task \nforce--to do exactly what Bowles-Simpson said to do. And to our wisdom, \nwe told the commission, when it comes to the military, grandfather \nthose who are currently in the system. That made sense to me. But under \nthe budget agreement, we violated our own instructions to the \ncommission by getting $6.3 billion from the military retirement \ncommunity retroactively, from everybody in the system up to age 62, and \nonly them. The civilian workforce had to make a contribution only for \nnew hires.\n  If that is OK with the Washington Post, then I would suggest you have \nlost your way down there. I hope I never get so smart that taking \n$72,000, $80,000, $100,000--whatever the number is; the bottom line is, \nthe minimum was $72,000 out of the E-7 cost-of-living adjustment; 3 \nyears of their retirement--I hope I never get so smart about the budget \nthat I find that to be itsy-bitsy, teensy-weensy. I hope I never get so \ncallous that I could sit on the sidelines and allow the military \nretirement community to be singled out, unlike anybody else in the \nNation, to find $6.3 billion when we are looking for money.\n  The bottom line is we will find the $6.3 billion. We are going to \nfind it in a more acceptable way. And there will come a day when we \nreform benefits, but we are going to do it consistent with the charter \nthat the Congress has created.\n  To our military community, you need to fight. You need to show up \nduring the holiday break, and you need to remind all of us--just not \nMembers of Congress--you need to toot your horn a little bit because it \nis so darn hard for you to do. You should humbly ask the U.S. House and \nSenate to reconsider this. You should humbly ask that the pay you \nreceived has been earned, and to change the deal in midstream is wrong. \nAnd you should remind us that: I have lived up to my end of the \nbargain. I am only asking that you live up to your end of the bargain. \nWe need your voice.\n  So to the Senator from Virginia, who is presiding over the Senate, I \nknow you will be part of the solution. There is a sweeping movement \nhere in the Senate to try to find a way to right what I think is an \ninjustice. Reform will come with it. But it sure as hell is not going \nto come this way.\n  I yield the floor.

Eighty-three \nare on the Executive Calendar and 155 are pending in committee--\nnominations sent by the White House to Capitol Hill which have either \nbeen lost--not lost in committee but held in committee--or sent to the \ncalendar. Of the group I have just mentioned, of the 238, 47 are \njudicial nominations, 36 are Ambassadors--and I have read through the \nlist of countries here and they range from some of the smaller ones to \nlarger countries as well--and 86 are nominees to Cabinet-level \nagencies. So it is a wide spectrum of appointments that have been sent \nfor Senate consideration to Capitol Hill.\n  We are embroiled in an internal debate about the rules of the Senate \nconcerning the filibuster and nominations. It is one that has not been \nresolved to the satisfaction of either side of the aisle, but we have \nlabored through it over the last several weeks and will when we return.\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request that those \nnominations--all of them; the military nominations as well as others--\nbe held here on the calendar and in committee and not be returned to \nthe White House, thereby requiring we repeat everything we have done in \nthis previous year. We don't get high marks at the end of this year for \nour legislative performance, and to throw aside all of the effort that \nhas been put into these nominees and require the White House to start \nover is literally a waste of time and unfortunate for these nominees, \nmany of whom have been waiting for a long period of time for \nconsideration and a vote by the Senate.\n  This is a chance, with this unanimous consent request, to get the \nnext year off to a good start, where we can take what has been done \nwith nominees, use it, take those nominations that are on the calendar, \nmove forward; they will still be subject to an up-or-down vote. The \nSenate has to work its will, and that will not be compromised at all by \nthe unanimous consent request I am making, but I am hoping we can get \nit through so that when we return on January 6, we will have an \nopportunity to move with a little more dispatch and a little more \nproductivity in the Senate.\n  As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that all nominations \nreceived by the Senate during the 113th Congress, first session, remain \nin status quo, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXXI, paragraph \n6, of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. Reserving the right to object, to my good friend \nfrom Illinois, all I can say is that the normal way the Senate has \noperated for a couple of hundred years has been destroyed this year, \nand asking that normalcy come about now is beyond the pale, but we are \nwhere we are. So I object.\n  However, I urge the Senate to act to confirm the many military \nnominations pending for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. So \nI object, with that understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand we are at a point of great \nemotions and feelings, stress in the Senate over the change in the \nrules about the use of the filibuster in the Senate. Unfortunately, it \nappears that we are going to stay in that state for at least a short \nperiod of time, and I am not holding my colleague from South Carolina \naccountable for that. I believe what he has done is reflect the \nfeelings on that side of the aisle, not just his personal feelings. \nHowever, I believe he has made a valuable suggestion.\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9090-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                NATIVE AMERICAN MEMORIAL AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed the Native \nAmerican Memorial Amendments Act of 2013. The bill now heads to the \nPresident for his signature. I introduced the Native American Memorial \nAmendments Act in May. I have worked with Representative Mullin since \nhe introduced an identical bill in the House in June.\n  This bill is needed to facilitate construction of a long-awaited \nNative American Veterans' Memorial on the National Mall. This memorial \nhas languished for almost 20 years since the passage of the original \nNative American Veterans' Memorial Establishment Act. This legislation \nbuilds off of the great work of Senator McCain, who introduced the \ninitial bill to authorize the Native American Veterans' Memorial, and \nSenator Inouye, who as the Indian Affairs Committee chairman worked to \nenact the law in 1994.\n  My bill also continues Senator Akaka's great legislative effort to \nfulfill the promise of this memorial. Native Americans, including \nNative Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians, serve and have \nalways served at a higher rate in the Armed Forces than any other group \nof Americans per capita.\n  In every conflict since the Revolutionary War, Native Americans have \nanswered the call to serve and defend our country. I introduced my bill \nso our Nation can recognize Native Americans' service and patriotism \nwith a fitting memorial. A memorial to Native veterans will make sure \nfuture generations learn about the sacrifices Native Americans have \nmade in service to our Nation.\n  It will commemorate their exceptional commitment to the principles of \nfreedom and democracy. Last month, Congress awarded its highest honor, \nthe Congressional Gold Medal, to the American Indians we know as code \ntalkers. These brave men played a critical, and for too long \nunacknowledged, role in both World Wars. The celebration of our \nlegendary code talkers in Emancipation Hall at the U.S. Capitol was a \nhistoric and proud moment.\n  But it is regrettable that most of the 216 honored did not live to \nsee their heroic contributions acknowledged. Congress was decades late \nin recognizing the Native American code talker's work when we needed \nthem most. We cannot make that mistake again. I believe now is the \nperfect time to move forward on a lasting tribute to all Native \nveterans, including the extraordinary contribution of Native Hawaiians.\n  My home State of Hawaii is second to none when it comes to \npatriotism, public service, and personal sacrifice. The heroic deeds of \nAnthony T. Kaho`ohanohano from Wailuku, Maui, prove just how true this \nis. He joined the Army to fight in combat in the Korean war.\n  He was assigned to Company H, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry \nDivision. Private First Class Kaho`ohanohano displayed extraordinary \nheroism near Chopra-Ri, Korea, on September 1, 1951. Due to the enemy's \noverwhelming numbers, troops were forced to execute a limited \nwithdrawal. As the men fell back, Kaho`ohanohano ordered his squad to \ntake up more defensible positions. He provided cover fire for them.\n  Although painfully wounded in the shoulder during the initial enemy \nassault, he gathered a supply of grenades and ammunition and returned \nto his original position to face the enemy alone. Kaho`ohanohano \ndelivered deadly, accurate fire onto the advancing enemy. After going \nthrough all of his ammunition, he engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand \ncombat until he paid the ultimate price fighting to protect his fellow \nsoldiers.\n  President Obama awarded U.S. Army Private First Class Kaho`ohanohano \nthe Presidential Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest military honor, \nposthumously. Private First Class Kaho`ohanohano, the thousands of \nNative Hawaiians, and Native Americans who have served our country with \nsuch honor deserve a memorial on the National Mall.\n  My Native American Memorial Amendments Act that passed last night \nwill allow for a privately funded memorial to be located on grounds \nunder the jurisdiction of the National Museum of the American Indian. \nThe museum will have the much needed flexibility to raise funds and \ntake on a more active role in planning and construction.\n  The Native American Memorial Amendments Act of 2013 was endorsed by \nthe National Congress of the American Indians, Alaska Federation of \nNatives, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, the largest three \nNative American membership organizations in the country. The National \nMuseum of the American Indian and the National Park Service are in \nagreement as well.\n  I wish to thank the strong support of the bipartisan cosponsors of \nthis bill: Senators Barrasso, Begich, Heitkamp, Inhofe, Murkowski, \nTester, Thune, and Wyden. I also wish to thank especially chairwoman \nMaria Cantwell for her work to ensure the passage of this bill. It is \nlong past time for our Nation to honor the uncommon contributions of \nNative Hawaiians, Native Alaskans and American Indians and other Native \nveterans. These brave men and women have served during war and peace to \npreserve our freedoms in remarkable high numbers. The valor of our \nNative American veterans, their dedication to duty and remarkable \nrecord of military service must forever be remembered. This memorial \nwill do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9090-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BIPARTISAN BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n\n                       Payments in Lieu of Taxes\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I come to the floor today with my friend \nChairman Wyden to express support for extending natural resource \nprograms that are critical to communities across the country. This week \nthe Senate passed a bipartisan budget resolution. In January we will \nreturn to consider legislation to fund the government for the rest of \nthe fiscal year.\n  This past October, Congress was able to extend critical payments to \nforested counties under the Secure Rural Schools, SRS, program for 1-\nyear in a bipartisan fashion. Irrespective of the appropriations bill \nthat we may take up in January, we now need to do the same for counties \neligible for payments under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, or \nPILT. PILT is a permanently authorized program created in 1976 that \nsince 2008 has received direct spending. It is an essential source of \nfunding for local governments that cannot collect taxes from Federal \nland within their borders.\n  A long-term solution to provide stable direct funding for PILT and \nother natural resource programs that buttress rural economies, like SRS \nand the Land and Water Conservation Fund, is our common goal. In the \nmeantime, we remain committed to extending direct spending on PILT and \nlook forward to finding an opportunity to do so in the first half of \n2014. Does the distinguished senator from Oregon wish to express \nhimself on these points?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to associate myself with the \ncomment of my friend from Montana and affirm that I too share the \ncommitments he described. These payments extend a vital lifeline to \ncounties across America, many of which are perched on the edge of \nfinancial disaster. Securing that funding has been a top priority for \nme this Congress. I am pleased that Congress found a way to continue \nits commitment to the Secure Rural Schools Program thanks to the helium \nbill that I worked on with colleagues in the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. There is still work to do for the 1,850 PILT-\neligible counties, and I look forward to working with the majority \nleader and Chairman Baucus--who are both longtime champions of PILT--\nand other supportive colleagues to find a short-term extension and also \na long-term solution for these communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9090-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9090-S9091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FARM BILL CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while the days are limited before the end \nof 2013, the Farm Bill Conference Committee presses on, working \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to resolve differences and to take the \nsteps necessary to enact a comprehensive and balanced farm bill. Under \nthe leadership of Chairwoman Stabenow and\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nChairman Lucas, it now appears we are on target to complete our work on \nthis bill early in the New Year.\n  Nonetheless, it has now been more than 440 days since the farm bill \nfirst expired. Farms are businesses, and farmers in Vermont and across \nthe country are desperate to have a new farm bill enacted to give them \nthe much-needed certainty for their planting and other farm decisions. \nSince the 2008 farm bill expired last year, we have seen parts of the \ncountry ravaged by blizzards that wiped out cattle herds while \ncommodity prices slump. More than 20 programs, including the Organic \nCertification Cost Share Program, the Beginning Farmer and Rancher \nDevelopment Grant Program, livestock disaster, renewable energy \nprograms, and assistance for rural small business owners have been \nstranded without updated charters, and the USDA has had to press the \npause button since these programs are stuck with no authorized funding. \nThose who participate in these programs are left hanging. That is as \nunwise as it is unfair.\n  Last week the House of Representatives quickly took up and passed a \nshort-term extension of the farm bill with very little debate and has \nasked the Senate to do the same. I have heard a lot of concern here in \nthe Senate that this short, 1-month extension could allow direct \npayment subsidies to continue for another full year. We have already \nagreed on a bipartisan and bicameral basis to get rid of these \nunnecessary and expensive direct payment subsidies to agribusiness, so \nwe should not fall into this trap of extending them for a full year. \nThat would be unacceptable, and, according to Secretary Vilsack, \nunnecessary.\n  Secretary Vilsack has indicated that if Congress completes the farm \nbill in early January, which can be done based on progress we have \nalready made, we will not see the negative effects of the expiration of \nthe dairy title, and implementation of the law should go smoothly. This \nis a reassuring, positive signal from the Secretary that consumers and \nour dairy farmers will not see the spikes in the cost of milk that we \nhad all feared last New Year's Eve.\n  Of course, if the House of Representatives really wanted to get a \nfarm bill done sooner, they would have kept the House in session this \nweek instead of recessing for the year. Instead, they pushed forward a \ncounterproductive short-term extension to make it seem that they are \ndoing something for farmers. This comes after the House leadership \nspent much of the past 2 years dragging their feet on farm policy and \nreforms, while the Senate has now passed two overwhelmingly bipartisan \nand reform-oriented farm bills.\n  While we had first hoped to complete this work in 2012, the farm bill \nwas pushed back to 2013, and it will soon become the 2014 farm bill. \nOver the last 2 years, the need for this comprehensive legislation has \nonly grown. We have all heard stories from our home States about the \nreal impacts caused by the failure of Congress to pass a new farm bill \nand the continued uncertainty for farmers and those who rely on USDA's \nnutrition programs. I regret that far too many hungry and food insecure \nfamilies across America have to wonder whether this most basic \nassistance will still be in place to offer support in the new year. I \nhave always been a strong proponent of nutrition assistance programs \nand the doors they open and will continue to oppose drastic and \ndraconian cuts and damaging changes to these programs.\n  I look forward to returning in January and sitting down with the \nConference Committee to work through the final details of this bill. We \ncannot delay any longer, and I am pleased that Chairwoman Stabenow and \nChairman Lucas have come together in a bipartisan way to move the farm \nbill forward. As a past chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nand a seven-time farm bill conferee, I know the challenges they have \nfaced. I look forward to helping with the final steps in conferencing \nthis legislation--a bill that touches every American. Its passage will \nstrengthen the Nation and grow our economy.\n  The Farm Bill has long stood as a model of bipartisan consensus. I \nlook forward to the Senate and House reaching a final bipartisan \nagreement that will move the bill forward to the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9091-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9091-S9092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS IN 2013\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Republicans are once again--for the fifth \nyear in a row--rejecting the longstanding Senate practice of scheduling \nconfirmation votes on consensus nominees before the end of the session. \nRather than working in a bipartisan fashion to confirm consensus \nnominees to fill judgeships as we wind down for the year, Senate \nRepublicans have deliberately refused to agree to vote on consensus \nnominees who could and should be confirmed without delay. The result is \nthat we will spend a significant portion of the next year on the Senate \nfloor doing work that should have been completed this year. And now the \nRepublican abuse of Senate rules has further escalated--Republicans \nhave, for the first time ever, refused to allow any currently pending \njudicial nominees to be held over so that they could be ready for \nimmediate action next year. For purely political reasons, Senate \nRepublicans are forcing us to duplicate work next year that we have \nalready completed in 2013. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars and \nvaluable resources that could be spent addressing the difficult issues \nfacing our Nation.\n  As it stands, nine judicial nominations pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar--all reported by the Judiciary Committee unanimously \nor with significant bipartisan support--are being returned to the \nPresident. Another 15 judicial nominees who could have been reported to \nthe full Senate and confirmed by the end of this year had Senate \nRepublicans not blocked the Judiciary Committee's ability to meet to \nreport these nominees to the full Senate are being returned to the \nPresident. Another 31 judicial nominees pending in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will also be returned to the President. Each of these \nnominations represents a significant amount of work by the nominees \nthemselves, the White House, the Department of Justice, and Senate \nstaff on both sides of the aisle. The only judicial nomination not \nbeing returned to the President is Robert Wilkins' nomination to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit because the procedural posture \nof his nomination enables the Senate to hold his nomination over until \nnext year. I am pleased that Judge Wilkins' nomination will not be \nreturned, which allows for quick action next year, but there is no good \nreason to return any of the other 55 judicial nominations pending in \nthe Senate.\n  Senate Republicans' persistent obstruction over the last 5 years has \nled to record-high vacancies in Federal courts throughout the country. \nAt the end of 2009, Senate Republicans left 10 nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar without a vote. Two of those nominations were \nreturned to the President, and it subsequently took 9 months for the \nSenate to take action on the other eight. This resulted in the lowest \n1-year confirmation total in at least 35 years. At the end of 2010 and \nagain in 2011, Senate Republicans left 19 nominations on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar. It then took nearly half the following years for \nthe Senate to confirm these nominees. Last year they blocked 11 \njudicial nominees from votes and refused to expedite consideration of \nothers who had already had hearings. And this year, they have escalated \ntheir obstruction and delay of judicial nominations by indiscriminately \nrequiring that nominees be sent back to the President at the end of \nthis first session of the 113th Congress, the effect of which is to \nneedlessly cause delay in the Senate's ability to process these \nnominations and prevent more judges from getting to work for the \nAmerican people.\n  Senate Republicans will argue that the change in Senate precedent a \nfew weeks ago on nominations is the cause of their refusal to \ncooperate, but history shows that this is simply not true. The truth \nis, from the first day President Obama took office, Senate Republicans \npursued a path of delay and obstruction on judicial nominees that \ndeparted dramatically from Senate tradition. That it took 5 years into \nthis Presidency for the rules to change has been the result of certain \nSenators, including me, who have been reluctant to change prior Senate \npractice. But once the government stops functioning, the right course \nof action is to do what\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\nneeds to be done so that the American people have a government that \nworks to make their lives better. The American people do not want to \nhear about tit-for-tat politics or their representatives playing the \nblame game. They are tired of Congress wasting time and resources when \nthere is so much to be done. They want their representatives to work, \nvote, and fulfill their constitutional obligations. They want their \nrepresentatives to fulfill their duty of advice and consent so that our \ncourts have the necessary judges to provide speedy, quality justice.\n  The reality, unfortunately, falls short of the American peoples' \nexpectation. During 2013, the same obstruction that has plagued the \nSenate during the first term of the Obama administration continued to \ndelay the rate of confirmations to appointments on the Federal bench. \nThe 113th Congress began with a high level of vacancies on the Federal \nJudiciary. As of January 2013, there were 77 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary, and, of these, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \ndetermined 27 of them to be ``judicial emergencies.'' Over the course \nof 2013, the number of vacancies has hovered around 90. Right now, at \nthe end of the fifth year of the Obama administration, there are a \ntotal of 88 judicial vacancies, 36 of which are judicial emergency \nvacancies. In stark contrast, at the end of the fifth year of the Bush \nadministration, there were less than 50 judicial vacancies, and only 16 \nof those were judicial emergency vacancies.\n  As the year closes, judicial vacancies remain at crisis levels. \nHowever, despite these high levels, Republican obstructionism continues \nto impose severe delays on the confirmations process, particularly in \nthose States that faced significant obstruction from Republican home \nState Senators, such as Arizona and Texas.\n  A year after the American people voted to reelect President Obama, \nSenate Republicans decided to escalate their obstruction to an \nunimaginable level this year, preventing the President from filling any \nof the three vacancies on what is often considered the second most \nimportant court in the Nation--the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. Senate Republicans chose to filibuster all three nominees to \nthat court without even considering their qualifications. This type of \nwholesale obstruction was simply unacceptable.\n  Republicans attempted to justify their opposition to filling any of \nthe three vacancies on the DC Circuit by arguing that the court's \ncaseload did not warrant the appointments. We all knew that this was a \ntransparent attempt to prevent a Democratic President from appointing \njudges to this court. In 2003, the Senate unanimously confirmed John \nRoberts by voice vote to be the ninth judge on the DC Circuit--at a \ntime when its caseload was lower than it is today. In fact, his \nconfirmation marked the lowest caseload level per judge on the DC \nCircuit in 20 years. Not a single Senate Republican raised any concerns \nabout whether the caseload warranted his confirmation, and during the \nBush administration, they voted to confirm four judges to the DC \nCircuit, providing the court with 11 active judges. In light of this \ndouble standard, I finally agreed that past precedent had to be \nrevisited because a faction of the minority party should not be \npermitted to nullify an election by blocking the President's nominees \nwithout regard to their qualifications.\n  I am pleased to say that in the last few weeks, after taking action, \nwe were finally able to confirm Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard--two \nhighly qualified attorneys--to the 9th and 10th seats on the DC \nCircuit. With the confirmation of these two women, there will now be \nfive women and five men actively serving as judges on the DC Circuit--\nthis is a historic first for any Federal appellate court. I am, \nhowever, disappointed that Senate Republicans refused to allow us to \ntake a vote on Judge Robert Wilkins, another well qualified nominee \nwhose confirmation would enable the DC Circuit to function at full \nstrength, with 11 judges. I am hopeful that we will have a vote on his \nnomination early next year.\n  Other historic firsts for women serving on our Federal judiciary also \noccurred this year. In April, Jane Kelly became the first woman from \nIowa to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, and, in \nMay, Shelly Dick was confirmed as the first woman to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. Late last week, \nafter the majority leader was forced to file cloture over Republican \nopposition to moving forward on district court nominees, three more \nnominees were confirmed to serve as the first women on their respective \ncourts: Elizabeth Wolford, to be U.S. district judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York; Landya McCafferty, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe District of New Hampshire; and Susan Watters to be U.S. district \njudge for the District of Montana.\n  After an extraordinarily long delay of nearly 22 months since his \nnomination, we were also finally able to confirm Brian Davis to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida. I am disappointed that it required overcoming a \nRepublican filibuster on his nomination. He is a superb nominee. The \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously rated \nhim to be ``well qualified'' to serve on the Federal bench. For the \npast 20 years he has served as a State court judge, where he has \npresided over 600 cases in both civil and criminal matters that have \ngone to verdict or judgment. Prior to becoming a State court judge, he \nserved for a total of 9 years as a state prosecutor, including 3 years \nas chief assistant State attorney. Judge Davis also has experience in \nprivate practice, where he was a partner at the law firm of Terrell \nHogan. He will make a fine Federal judge.\n  I am pleased that despite continued Republican attempts to block or \ndelay confirmation of judicial nominees, we were able to continue to \nmove forward on these and other nominees this year. I have heard, \nhowever, some suggestion that Republicans will now seek to delay \njudicial nominations by exploiting a Senate tradition known as the \n``blue slip.'' The Constitution requires that judicial appointments be \nmade ``with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' For nearly 100 \nyears, chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee have sought to give \nmeaning to this constitutional edict by a blue slip policy to ensure \nthat Senators are given an opportunity to advise the President about \npotential judicial nominees before they are nominated to fill lifetime \npositions in their home State. A blue slip is a piece of paper sent by \nthe chairman to home State Senators asking that it be signed and \nreturned with an indication of whether they approve of or oppose the \njudicial nomination made by the President.\n  Over the years, other chairmen have taken a more flexible view of the \nblue slips, but during my chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I have protected the rights of Senators--whether Republican \nor Democrat--to be meaningfully consulted. Honoring the blue slip \npolicy allows judicial nominations to move forward in committee only \nafter receiving positive blue slips from home State Senators. Another \nimprovement I made when I first became chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in 2001 was to make home State Senators more accountable for \ntheir blue slip decisions by making the process transparent for the \nfirst time. I will continue to honor the blue slip policy as it \ncurrently stands, but I hope that Republicans will not abuse this \ntradition and force me to reconsider.\n  As we approach the new year, I hope that reasonable Republicans will \njoin us in restoring the Senate's ability to fulfill its constitutional \nduties and do its work for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9092-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9092-S9093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Unfortunately I was unable to record my vote but \nhad I been in the\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nChamber I would have voted in favor of this important piece of \nlegislation. I supported this legislation when it was reported out of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I would also like to thank Senator Levin \nand Senator Inhofe for their tireless efforts to complete this bill and \nfulfill our commitments to the men and women serving our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to call attention to a \nprovision within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2014.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Inhofe, Chairman \nMcKeon, and Ranking Member Smith, for including in this year's National \nDefense Authorization Act my amendment, with Senators Collins, Kaine, \nand Grassley, to expand whistleblower and enhance protections for \nservicemembers who alert authorities to misconduct that includes sexual \nassaults and other sexual misconduct. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Collins, Kaine and Grassley, for their partnership \nin winning this breakthrough in newly-strengthened free speech rights \nfor our troops when they defend accountability in the military \nservices. It is important to be clear about a cornerstone of our \namendment, which is the guaranteed right to an administrative due \nprocess hearing in all whistleblower retaliation cases. New subsection \nf(3)(B) provides that if the Secretary does not make a finding of \nillegal retaliation and order corrective action, the case shall be \nforwarded to the appropriate Board for Corrections of Military Records \nto receive a mandatory administrative due process hearing, ``when \nappropriate.'' There should not be any confusion. It is always \nappropriate to forward the case for hearing if jurisdiction exists for \nwhistleblower retaliation alleged in the servicemember's complaint. It \nis only inappropriate if another provision of law provides the relevant \nrights, procedures and remedies to resolve the complaint, such as when \nthe alleged misconduct is sexual harassment per se as opposed to \nwhistleblower retaliation for disclosing sexual harassment.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to welcome the \nfinal passage of the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act--\nfrequently referred to as the NDAA. I would like to thank Armed \nServices Committee Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe, as well as \nChairman McKeon and Ranking Member Smith in the House of \nRepresentatives, for their tireless and collaborative efforts in \nsecuring this critical piece of legislation. Although the NDAA did not \ngo through the optimal amendment process, its passage today extends the \nnecessary authorities to implement our national security strategy and \nsupport and protect Colorado's military community. As we head into the \nsecond session of the 113th Congress, I hope that we will remain \nmindful of the importance of a full and robust debate and ensure that \nthe 2015 NDAA is open to amendments on the floor of the Senate.\n  As the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I also want to \nthank my friend and colleague on the committee, Ranking Member \nSessions. Senator Sessions has a long tenure on the subcommittee, and I \nhave benefited from his experience. I am grateful for the collegiality \nhe has shown over the past year, and I look forward to starting our \nwork together again in the next session.\n  I would also like to recognize the staff of the subcommittee for \ntheir tremendous support and dedication. For Senator Sessions and his \nsubcommittee staff, I want to thank Dr. Robert Soofer, who advises on \nnuclear and missile defense matters, and Daniel Lerner, who advises on \nspace, intelligence and cyber security. I also want to thank both Pete \nLandrum, Senator Sessions' senior defense policy adviser and Casey \nHoward, my military legislative assistant. On my subcommittee staff, \nJonathan Epstein, deserves great credit for his work on nuclear \nweapons, space, and a host of other issues. Richard Fieldhouse, who \nadvises on missile defense, and Kirk McConnell, who assists me on cyber \nand intelligence, also have my thanks and respect. Finally, special \nthanks to Lauren Gillis, the subcommittee's staff assistant, for her \ncountless hours of preparation for our hearings, working with \nwitnesses, and organizing our subcommittee markup.\n  In closing, I would like to highlight one provision of the 2014 NDAA, \nsection 3112, which establishes an Office of Cost Analysis and Program \nEvaluation in the National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA. I \nwant to be clear that the establishment of this new office was not \nmeant to in any way alter the responsibilities and oversight of the \nNaval Reactors Program--a division of the NNSA that has a long track \nrecord of producing high quality projects on time and within budget. \nThe Naval Reactors Program has traditionally been semi-independent \nwithin the NNSA, being dual hatted with fleet activities of the Navy, \nwhose overall responsibilities are found and carried out under \nExecutive Order No. 12344. While section 3112 speaks to the NNSA as a \nwhole, it was not our intent to include the Naval Reactors Program \nunder the purview of the new Office of Cost Analysis and Program \nEvaluation. During the next session, I will work with my colleagues in \nboth the House and the Senate to correct this provision and reflect \nthat intent.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is a great pleasure to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Warner, Collins, and Kaine, for their partnership \nin winning this breakthrough in newly-strengthened whistleblower \nprotections for our troops. It is important to be clear about a \ncornerstone of our amendment, which is the guaranteed right to an \nadministrative due process hearing in all whistleblower retaliation \ncases. New subsection f(3)(B) provides that if the Secretary does not \nmake a finding of illegal retaliation and order corrective action, the \ncase shall be forwarded to the appropriate Board for Corrections of \nMilitary Records to receive a mandatory administrative due process \nhearing, ``when appropriate.'' There should not be any confusion. It is \nalways appropriate to forward the case for hearing if jurisdiction \nexists for whistleblower retaliation alleged in the servicemember's \ncomplaint. It is only inappropriate if another provision of law \nprovides the relevant rights, procedures and remedies to resolve the \ncomplaint, such as when the alleged misconduct is sexual harassment per \nse as opposed to whistleblower retaliation for disclosing sexual \nharassment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9093-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9093-S9094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BANGLADESH ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last week Senators Enzi, Murphy and I \nintroduced a resolution on the political tensions in Bangladesh as that \ncountry prepares for a national election on January 5.\n  Since then, Senators Boxer, Boozman, Shaheen, Kaine, Blunt, and \nMenendez have also cosponsored and yesterday the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee voted unanimously in support of the measure.\n  The resolution calls for peaceful political dialogue between the \ncountry's various political factions in the hopes that the election \nwill go forward in a credible and peaceful manner.\n  With so much else going on in the world from Ukraine to Iran, one \nmight wonder why focus on elections in Bangladesh?\n  My interest is in part due to the role of Nobel Prize, Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal winner Professor \nMohammad Yunus, whom many may know from his pioneering work to help the \nworld's poor through microfinance programs.\n  Professor Yunus has done so much to help the poor of Bangladesh and \nthe world, particularly poor women, that former Senator Bob Bennett and \nI, as well as Congressman Rush Holt, led an effort several years ago to \naward him the Congressional Gold Medal. That bill passed both chambers \nof Congress in 2010, and earlier this year we gave him this award in \nthe Capitol Rotunda.\n  It was a deeply moving event.\n  Sadly--and almost inexplicably--during the same period that \nBangladesh was in such an international spotlight, its government \npursued a mean-spirited and bewildering effort to undermine the Grameen \nBank's independence and remove Professor Yunus from his leadership \nrole.\n  I and others wrote repeatedly to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh \nHasina urging her to not take such destructive and counterproductive \nmeasures.\n  Last year, Senator Boxer led a letter with all 17 women of the Senate \nto Hasina that called on the Bangladeshi government to stop interfering \nin the management of Grameen Bank.\n  Those Senators pointed out that its 8.3 million borrowers are mostly\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nwomen who gain financial independence and help support their families \nthrough its important programs.\n  I am sorry to report that the Government of Bangladesh ignored all \nsuch calls and just last month essentially imposed state control over \nthe bank.\n  Yunus responded by saying, ``Grameen Bank was created as a bank owned \nby poor women, and managed by poor women. Its legal structure did not \nallow any government interference of any kind, except for regulatory \noversight.'' The government-imposed changes, ``fundamentally changing \nthe character of the bank. With these amendments, the government has \nopened the door for its ultimate destruction. What a shame for the \nnation, and the whole world!''\n  So understandably this Senate resolution calls on the government of \nBangladesh to restore the independence of the Grameen Bank.\n  There is more at stake in Bangladesh that should be of concern to the \nUnited States and the world.\n  You see, Bangladesh is a relatively stable, moderate, Muslim \ndemocracy with the world's seventh largest population and the world's \nfourth largest Muslim population.\n  And despite many difficult years since its independence from Pakistan \nin 1971, it has often stood out as an example of a moderate and diverse \nMuslim democracy--one that deserves the world's attention and support.\n  Yet, tragically, as Bangladesh nears another national election, it \nhas experienced considerable political unrest with hundreds perishing \nin violent clashes.\n  The country's opposition coalition has called for numerous nationwide \nstrikes and transportation blockades, resulting in further violence, \ninstability, and the disruption of students' abilities to attend \nschool.\n  Last week United Nations Assistant Secretary General Oscar Fernandez \nTaranco visited Bangladesh to try and foster political dialogue between \nBangladesh's political parties and leaders to bring a halt to the \nviolence and allow for a credible and peaceful election period.\n  His efforts are to be supported, and this resolution reaffirms his \ncall for peaceful political dialogue.\n  The squabbles between Bangladesh's political parties distract from \nthe real progress that has been made--and should continue to be made--\nin alleviating the country's widespread poverty.\n  For example, between 2005 and 2010 Bangladesh reduced its poverty \nrate from 40 to 31 percent of the population.\n  This is where the country's political leadership should continue to \nfocus, not on perpetuating personal animosity between the two main \npolitical parties.\n  So our resolution states the obvious:\n  It condemns the political violence,\n  It urges the country's political leaders to engage directly in a \ndialogue toward free, fair, and credible elections; it expresses great \nconcern about the country's political deadlock that distracts from so \nmany other pressing problems; and it urges the Government of Bangladesh \nto ensure judicial independence, end harassment of human rights \nactivists, and restore the independence of the Grameen Bank.\n  The United States relationship with Bangladesh is strong and includes \nconsiderable trade and cooperation on such issues as counterterrorism, \ncounter-piracy, food security, and regional stability.\n  Peaceful democratic elections and greater respect for the Grameen \nBank will only further those ties.\n  I urge the full Senate to pass this resolution before we adjourn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9094-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9094-S9095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 PEPFAR\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, PEPFAR has been and remains one of the \nmost successful foreign policy achievements of the United States in the \n21st century. This unprecedented humanitarian effort has touched \nmillions, either through providing lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, \nkeeping together families impacted by the disease, caring for orphans, \nor improving the lives of others affected and infected by this horrible \ndisease as well as tuberculosis and malaria. In an era of war abroad \nand deep political divisions at home, this program is one that has \nbipartisan support here and has generated good will toward the United \nStates abroad. Every American should be proud of the success of this \ninitiative as it represents what is great about our Nation and has \nrestored hope for so many.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee worked hard to get S. 1545, \nthe PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, through this Chamber. I thank \nChairman Menendez and Ranking Member Corker for their cooperation and \nattentiveness in the process. This bill, which became law on December \n2, is a positive step toward increasing program transparency and \naccountability in PEPFAR's annual report. It also renews and \nstrengthens several components of the last reauthorization, including \nGlobal Fund governance provisions and the requirement that more than 50 \npercent of PEPFAR's appropriations to be spent on treatment and \nessential medical care.\n  This latter component, the treatment spending requirement, is one of \nthe key accountability provisions my colleagues and I fought for in the \npast. In short, PEPFAR is required to spend at least 50 percent of its \nappropriations on essential medical treatment and care. Members on both \nsides of the aisle voted for authorizations with this treatment floor. \nCongress sought to prevent the program from straying from its core \nmission of treating and caring for patients. If PEPFAR were to lose \nsight of this goal, the result would not just be a waste of money, it \nwould be lives lost on account of mission creep. We cannot let PEPFAR \nbecome another well-intentioned but unfruitful and nebulous \ninternational development program.\n  This statutory treatment floor has changed somewhat over the last \ndecade, but the purpose has remained the same throughout: to focus more \nthan half of PEPFAR's total appropriations on essential treatment and \nmedical care. Unfortunately, as I will discuss in a moment, the Office \nof the U.S. Global Coordinator, OGAC, at the Department of State has \nnot been following this law. Rather, it has excluded a significant \nportion of its appropriations from the calculation and is now spending \nless than is statutorily required on treatment and care.\n  The original PEPFAR authorization in 2003, P.L. 108-25, first \nincluded a treatment spending floor that said, ``Not less than 55 \npercent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of \nappropriations . . . shall be expended for therapeutic medical care of \nindividuals infected with HIV, of which such amount at least 75 percent \nshould be expended for the purchase and distribution of antiretroviral \npharmaceuticals and at least 25 percent should be for related care.''\n  Similarly, the full reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008, P.L. 110-293, \nincluded a treatment requirement that said, ``More than half of the \namounts appropriated for bilateral global HIV/AIDS assistance . . . \nshall be expended for . . . (1) antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS; \n(2) clinical monitoring of HIV-seropositive people not in need of \nantiretroviral treatment; (3) care for associated opportunistic \ninfections; (4) nutrition and food support for people living with HIV/\nAIDS; and (5) other essential HIV/AIDS-related medical care for people \nliving with HIV/AIDS.''\n  This version expanded somewhat on the original category of \n``therapeutic medical care,'' but Congress maintained a minimum \npercentage of appropriations intended for direct care and treatment \nservices.\n  Lastly, the recent PEPFAR legislation, S.1545, now P.L. 113-56, \nreiterates and even clarifies the treatment requirement further. This \nnew law says more than half of the funds appropriated for activities \nunder section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act--which contains all of \nPEPFAR's functions ranging from drug treatment to training health \nprofessionals and capacity building--need to be going to these five \ncategories of essential medical treatment and care.\n  None of these definitions from laws in 2003, 2008, or 2013 has \nallowed for an exclusion of certain components of PEPFAR's funding from \nthe treatment calculation. No appropriations bill has implemented an \nexception to the calculation. The charge and requirement has always \nbeen to examine total PEPFAR appropriations in a given year and ensure \nat least half goes to services in these five categories.\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\n  As I said previously, PEPFAR management has not been abiding by the \nletter of the law. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator at \nthe Department of State has been excluding several spending categories \nfrom the treatment and care calculation. A smaller denominator makes it \neasier for the program to meet the treatment calculation. In reality, \nhundreds of millions of dollars more should be going to treatment and \ncare if the law were followed. Millions more patients could be \nreceiving lifesaving antiretroviral treatment.\n  A Government Accountability Office report released in March 2013 \nhighlighted how OGAC has been excluding a significant portion of PEPFAR \nappropriations, categorized as ``Other'' activities, from this \ncalculation. In fiscal year 2008, this ``Other'' category accounted for \nabout 15 percent of PEPFAR country budgets, or $574 million. By fiscal \nyear 2012, the category increased to 21 percent of PEPFAR country \nbudgets, or $710 million. Over the same timeframe, total spending on \ntreatment and care decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion.\n  This ``Other'' category includes spending for health systems \nstrengthening, strategic information, management and operations, and \nlaboratory strengthening. OGAC told GAO it had excluded the ``Other'' \ncategory based on OGAC's interpretation of the intent of the treatment \nspending requirement. They have also not included any of OGAC's \nadministrative costs.\n  As one directly involved with PEPFAR throughout my time in the \nSenate, I can say firmly the treatment spending requirement was \nintended for all of PEPFAR's appropriations, not just a portion.\n  PEPFAR's operational plan for fiscal year 2011 shows that PEPFAR \nreceived about $5.0 billion for all bilateral activities, including \nheadquarters administrative costs. To be meeting the treatment spending \nrequirement as written, PEPFAR should have planned to spend about $2.5 \nbillion on treatment and care. Instead, it spent $1.6 billion. That \nfigure about $900 million short of what should be going to direct \ntreatment and care services that fit the categories already in law.\n  I understand the need for PEPFAR to invest in some capacity building \nand other ancillary development. A nation needs labs to check HIV test \nresults, for example. Labs and clinics need health professionals, and a \nhost government needs to be able to track the program results. However, \nwe have seen time and again how development programs get off track, \nlose focus, and fail to meet their goals. They spend money on \nactivities that are noble but ineffective. For example, in 2012, the \nU.S. Agency for International Development used millions of dollars to \nfund an economic development program in Morocco that included pottery \nclasses, even though Moroccans have been making pottery for thousands \nof years. Not only so, but the classes were poorly designed. The \ninstructor only used materials not available in Morocco, and the \nclass's translator was not fluent in English. Ultimately, the \ndevelopment program failed.\n  To prevent mission creep and failure, Congress put a treatment and \ncare requirement in law to ensure more than half of go to direct \ntreatment and care services, which have a clear and measurable impact \non the lives of those living with this HIV/AIDS.\n  I call on PEPFAR to follow the letter of the law when it comes to \nspending on treatment and care. All PEPFAR appropriations should be \nentered into the denominator of this equation. No funding will be lost \nfrom doing so. Rather, hundreds of millions of additional dollars will \nbe going to essential treatment and care. Millions of new patients \ncould start receiving new life.\n  I will continue to monitor whether PEPFAR is following this \ndefinition in the future. Given that 26 million people worldwide need \nantiretroviral treatment, we cannot afford to let PEPFAR get off track.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, first, I want to say I appreciate Senator \nCoburn's work on the PEPFAR Program. He has been a tireless advocate \nand has made this program better, more efficient, and more focused. \nPEPFAR has saved millions of lives since President Bush signed it into \nlaw in 2003. I was pleased to work with Chairman Menendez and our \ncolleagues in the House on legislation, the PEPFAR Stewardship and \nOversight Act, which continues its important work, and I truly \nappreciate the support Senator Coburn offered to this critical effort. \nPEPFAR is the single most successful program to date to address the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and the largest commitment by any nation to \ncombat a single disease internationally. In fact, due to PEPFAR, almost \n6 million people are receiving life-sustaining antiretroviral \ntreatment, millions have avoided infection, and more than 11 million \npregnant women received HIV testing and counseling last year. PEPFAR \nhas also provided care and support to nearly 15 million people, \nincluding more than 4.5 million orphans and vulnerable children. This \nis significant progress, but there is still work to do. The PEPFAR \nStewardship and Oversight Act renews Congress's commitment to this \nvital program and ensures this work will continue our progress towards \nan AIDS-free generation.\n  As my colleague Senator Coburn has stated, a provision in the PEPFAR \nStewardship and Oversight Act extends authority from the Tom Lantos and \nHenry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 that requires ``more than half \nof the amounts appropriated for bilateral global HIV/AIDS assistance'' \nbe spent on programs that provide treatment and care to HIV/AIDS \npatients. We included an extension of this authority in the 2013 bill \nbecause it is important to ensure the program remains focused on \ntreating and caring for patients. The plain language of the provision \nrequires the ``more than half'' calculation to be made on all ``amounts \nappropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the provisions of \nsection 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.'' We expect this \nrequirement to be followed going forward.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Coburn and the Office of the \nGlobal AIDS Coordinator to ensure that the provision as intended by \nCongress is properly carried out.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the Globe Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand Malaria has recently made significant improvements and reforms, \nincluding building new data collection and reporting mechanisms. S. \n1545, the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, takes advantage of \nthese reforms and provides for additional public reporting from the \nGlobal Fund on import duties and taxes on Global Fund services and \ncommodities under section 4(b)(1)(F). This reporting is intended to \nidentify discriminatory duties and taxes levied upon the Global Fund, \nand therefore should not be construed to require the reporting of de \nminimus administrative charges or nondiscriminatory fees. In addition, \nin order to allow the Global Fund time to develop the data collection \nsystems required to implement this reporting, it is our intention that \nthese requirements become fully effective as soon as is practicable, \nbut no later than the end of the 2015 fiscal year. In the meantime, the \nGlobal Fund's efforts to meet the requirements of section 4(b)(1)(F) \nwith additional reporting on these matters should be sufficient to meet \nthe requirements in our legislation.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \ncomments and work on this legislation. The reforms being made by the \nGlobal Fund are important and we both share the view that the reporting \nrequirements for the Global Fund on import duties and taxes ought to be \nunderstood to provide flexibility until the end of the 2015 fiscal \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9095-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9095-S9096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PEDIATRIC RESEARCH NETWORK ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I wish to praise the passage of the \nNational Pediatric Research Network Act, signed into law by President \nObama on November 27, 2013. I was proud to introduce this bipartisan \nlegislation along with my colleague and friend Senator Wicker.\n  I am a longtime supporter of expanded pediatric medical research and, \nas a member of the House and later of the Senate, have fought to \nincrease funding to carry out these essential efforts. This bipartisan \nbill promises to build on the important body of work in pediatric \nresearch that the National\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nInstitutes of Health, NIH, already supports.\n  This law authorizes the NIH to establish a number of multi-\ninstitution consortia conducting high-impact research into the most \nchallenging pediatric issues of our day. These research networks will \nallow for the participation of multiple institutions through the use of \na ``hub and spoke'' arrangement, with one or more central pediatric \nmedical centers collaborating with other supporting sites.\n  Network applicants can focus on any type of pediatric research \nagenda, from basic laboratory research through later stage \ntranslational research and clinical investigations on a variety of \npediatric disorders and diseases.\n  Importantly, the act will bridge the research gap between pediatric \nand adult conditions. Only 5 to 10 percent of the NIH's annual research \nbudget is devoted to pediatric research, despite children comprising \napproximately 20 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Additionally, this act promises to strengthen our collective focus on \npediatric rare diseases or conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy, \nmuscular dystrophy, Down syndrome, and Fragile X.\n  We are all aware that the NIH faces tight budgets and that these \nfiscal challenges are not going away overnight. Thus, Members on both \nsides of the aisle came together in support of this research model to \npromote efficiency and the sharing of resources. Modeled after the \nsuccessful Cancer Centers and other successful networked initiatives, \nthis law reflects the current fiscal climate and seeks to do more with \nless.\n  The National Pediatric Research Network Act could not have been \nenacted without the support of thousands of families, care providers, \npediatric researchers and research institutions across the country. I \nwould especially like to thank FightSMA and the Coalition for Pediatric \nMedical Research for organizing a grassroots effort that led to strong \nbipartisan support in both houses of Congress, and to Cincinnati \nChildren's Hospital Medical Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital in \nColumbus, and Akron Children's Hospital for their endorsement and hard \nwork in support of the bill.\n  The legislation received the strong support of Parent Project \nMuscular Dystrophy, the Children's Hospital Association, Federation of \nPediatric Organizations, Kakkis EveryLife Foundation, National Down \nSyndrome Society, and the National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize Madison Reed, a valiant Ohio \nteenager living with SMA, for sharing her story with me when I visited \nNationwide Children's Hospital earlier this year. The National \nPediatric Research Network Act has given hope to thousands of families \nlike hers, across Ohio and the country, that collaborative pediatric \nresearch will speed knowledge from bench to bedside, allowing young \npeople with medical concerns to lead healthier and fuller lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9096-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACK HANNA\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, today I wish to honor ``Jungle'' Jack \nHanna for his 35 years of service to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. \nJack is a world-renowned conservationist, author, television \npersonality, lifelong adventurer, and champion of the Columbus Zoo.\n  In 1978, Jack Hanna joined a small zoo in Columbus, Ohio as the \nexecutive director. The challenges he faced as director were \nstaggering. The zoo was outdated, the animals had little contact with \nthe outside world, and the attendance was low. Jack worked to increase \nattendance by offering educational and entertainment programs at the \nzoo. Under his leadership, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium became the \nworld-class facility it is today. The Columbus Zoo is a state-of-the-\nart park with exceptional attractions such as Zoombezi Bay waterpark \nand Jungle Jack's Landing. The park has also expanded its reach outside \nof Columbus to include The Wilds near Cambridge, OH.\n  Jack's work as a conservationist has saved endangered animals and \nhabitats around the globe. He helped found Partners in Conservation, \nand is an active supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, \nthe Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project, and the SeaWorld Busch Gardens \nConservation Fund.\n  Jack was named director emeritus in 1992 of the Columbus Zoo but has \ncontinued to spur economic development and promote central Ohio since \nthat time. Jack has made countless television appearances since 1983 on \nshows such as ``Good Morning America,'' the ``Late Show with David \nLetterman,'' FOX News programs, and CNN News programs. We still watch \nhim today on his latest syndicated TV series, ``Jack Hanna's Into the \nWild.''\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with Jack over the years and have \nwitnessed his genuine love of animals and wildlife firsthand. He is a \npassionate advocate for conservation, and his skill for sharing the \nmajesty of nature has opened the minds of millions of readers, viewers, \nand listeners.\n  The Columbus Zoo is an asset to central Ohio because of Jack Hanna's \nwork and inspiration. I congratulate him on his service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9096-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9096-S9097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO NICHOLE DISTEFANO\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, as we come to the end of 2013, I \nwish to pay tribute to a friend and a stellar long-term staff member of \nmine, Nichole Distefano. Nichole left my office earlier this year to \npursue an exceptional opportunity with the Environmental Protection \nAgency. She spent more than 6 years as an indispensable member of my \nWashington, DC, staff and was an exceptional member of staffs of mine \ngoing back to 2004.\n  Nichole is affectionately known as ``H'' in our office, initially \nbecause of the ``h'' in her first name and later for reasons best not \nshared on the Senate floor but related to her tenacity and direct \nnature. Nichole was the absolute rock and foundation of our legislative \nstaff during her tenure.\n  She was, in fact, the first legislative aide that I hired. It did not \nmatter--although was a shock to some--that she had no previous \nexperience in DC. I knew she would dive right into her responsibilities \nwith attention to detail and skill. In fact, within 2 years on the \nstaff, she assumed responsibility for my government reform portfolio, \nwhich encompassed the issues that I focused on most intently during my \nfirst 6 years in the Senate. During that time we promoted her four \ntimes and continually increased her responsibility. In each case, she \nperformed beyond even my highest expectations. There was no challenge \nand no issue Nichole could not tackle.\n  Nichole's policy accomplishments are too many to number. She was our \nlead staffer on earmark reform work; whistleblower legislation for both \nFederal employees and contractors; our complex regulatory reform \nefforts; everything and anything that had to do with empowering our \ninspectors general. She led all the office work on screening policies \nat the airports along with handling innumerable challenging situations \nwith the GSA in regards to Missouri and was the lead staffer in writing \nbills to curb some of the excesses that we discovered in that Agency. \nShe also patiently waded through all of the difficult policy and \npolitics of energy issues, including the challenging and politically \nsensitive debate on cap and trade. There was no detail too small for \nNichole to master and no nuance she could not grasp. One of her \nearliest policy responsibilities had to do with an energy issue much \nsmaller than cap and trade, however. She prepared legislation dealing \nwith the measurement of gasoline as it relates to temperature--hot gas \nwas not the most exciting issue. It involved no bright lights and no \nheadlines, just hard, complicated, solid, public policy work--the exact \nkind of thing Nichole thrived at. Those issues that take more than a \ncut-and-paste memo were Nichole's specialty.\n  I have known Nichole since she was 8 years old, as the granddaughter \nof a strong public servant, Carole Roper Park Vaughn, who served with \nme in the Missouri State Legislature. As Nichole ran around Carole's \nJefferson City office, Carole helped instill in her that leadership \nspark. In 2004, when I ran for Governor, I hired Nichole for the first \ntime to help run our Kansas City volunteer crew. By the end, most \npeople on staff thought she was the one really running our KC office--\nand for all intent and purposes, she was.\n  By our 2006 Senate race, she became my rural outreach director, \nhelping us\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nfind some of the gems of our campaign, like Sweet Corn Charlie. On both \ncampaigns she was always willing to do whatever was needed at any level \nfrom literally boosting me up onto an RV so we could grab a picture of \nour ``McCaskill for Senate''-wrapped RV in front of my family's old \nflour mill in Houston, MO, to walking into a field office unannounced \none day and saying she was there to go door-to-door, despite her senior \nrole on the campaign.\n  She is a take-charge kind of woman but taking charge by immersing \nherself in a subject. That became her trademark. We all grew to expect \nher remarkable technical competence on very complicated issues and her \npenchant for digging deeper to find the real answer. Of course, at \ntimes, she let her desire to dig deep bleed into her personal life, \ntoo. Just ask her new husband Ryan what her first two responses to his \nmarriage proposal were: ``Are you serious?''\n  Because of this knack for asking the right questions and learning the \ndetailed answers, I always listened to what she had to say--I did not \nalways agree, of course, but listened nonetheless. As one of her male \ncolleagues said, ``She looks tiny and sweet, but everyone is a little \nterrified of her because she's tougher and smarter than most everyone \nout there.'' And have no doubt, when Nichole believes something, she \nwill let you know, and she will fight for it. I cherish this attribute \nbecause in this kind of job you need people who aren't just smart, \naren't just aggressive, but who are real and honest.\n  Now no one stays terrified of Nichole for too long because they \nfigure out how genuine she is, and funny too. The gifted members of our \nstaffs are both intense and blessed with great humor.\n  Our legislative correspondents have been lucky to have her as a \nmentor, as well--someone who expects a high level of performance, gives \npraise when it is due, and encourages professional development. It is \nno accident that one of the first LC's to work for her grew into one of \nmy staff's most important legislative assistants today.\n  It is always bittersweet for me when these kinds of junctures \nhappen--these times when you want your staff to blast forward and make \nyou proud as much as you want them to stay--because they have been so \nessential to your work.\n  With Nichole now working as a senior advisor within the Office of \nCongressional and Intergovernmental Relations at the EPA, she is \nproviding the kind of public service that embraces intellect, \ncuriosity, and precision. It is why they brought her on, of course. \nThey quickly saw what we already knew. They are benefiting greatly from \nher deep vein of common sense and her refusal to stop working until she \nhas asked every question and gotten every answer.\n  I am proud to say thank you to Nichole Distefano as 2013 comes to an \nend, to express my deep gratitude for all she has done for me, for \nMissouri, and for our great Nation over so many years. I am proud to \nsee her continue to grow and excel. I know she is doing exceptional \nthings in her new position. She is my friend. She is a rock. And I miss \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9097-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING PETTY OFFICER OBENDORF\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am here today to pay tribute to the \nlife of PO3 Travis Obendorf, a Coast Guard boatswain mate, who passed \naway on December 18, 2013, from injuries he sustained during the \nsuccessful rescue of 22 individuals from the disabled fishing vessel \nAlaska Mist in the Bering Sea on November 11, 2013.\n  Petty Officer Obendorf, whose nick name was ``Obie,'' gave the \nultimate sacrifice for his Nation, and in doing so he assisted in the \nrescue of 22 mariners who otherwise may have been lost to the sea.\n  Petty Officer Obendorf was a native of Idaho Falls, IA. He enlisted \nin the Coast Guard in 2004 and quickly became a leader within his boot \ncamp platoon. He proudly served aboard the Coast Guard Cutters Alert \nand Waesche and deployed to Bahrain as member of Coast Guard Patrol \nForces Southwest Asia. He also served at Coast Guard Station Boston, \nMA.\n  Upon reporting aboard Coast Guard Cutter Waesche on 26 June 2013, \nPetty Officer Obendorf quickly integrated into the Deck Division and \nbegan rapidly pursuing his qualifications. During Waesche's shakedown \ncruise prior to an Alaska deployment, Petty Officer Obendorf qualified \nas a helmsman and lookout and made significant progress in all other \nqualification areas. One month into Waesche's August to November 2013 \nAlaska deployment, Petty Officer Obendorf qualified in basic and \nadvanced damage control, as boatswain's mate of the watch, helicopter \ntie-down crewmember, and boat crewmember on all three of Waesche's \ncutter boats. Less than a month later, Petty Officer Obendorf added \nboarding team member and antiterrorism force protection watch stander \nto his list of qualifications. Petty Officer Obendorf's rapid \nqualification in a wide variety of watch stations resulted in him being \nsignificantly involved in almost all aspects of Waesche's operations. \nHis efforts as a boat crew and boarding team member were critical in \nthe Waesche's execution of over 40 fisheries and recreational law \nenforcement boardings during the 2013 Alaska deployment.\n  When Waesche was diverted for the search and rescue case involving \nfishing vessel Alaska Mist, Petty Officer Obendorf was selected as a \nboat crewmember for what would be a challenging rescue operation. Petty \nOfficer Obendorf immediately began assisting his shipmates and \npreparing for the operation, which would involve removing 14 \nnonessential Alaska Mist personnel as well as passing a towing line to \nthe vessel in order to take it in tow.\n  Once on scene, Waesche launched Petty Officer Obendorf and the rest \nof the boat crew aboard a Coast Guard small boat to begin the rescue \noperation. As the Coast Guard small boat came alongside Alaska Mist, \none boat crewmember went aboard the vessel to brief the crew and rig \nthe rescue ladder. Once this was complete, Petty Officer Obendorf began \nguiding Alaska Mist crewmembers down the ladder and into the Coast \nGuard small boat. Petty Officer Obendorf showed exceptional skill and \nfocus as he timed the rolls of both vessels and a significant swell to \nensure the safety of the crewmembers descending the ladder. Despite \ndeteriorating weather conditions, Petty Officer Obendorf courageously \nand successfully guided five Alaska Mist crew members to safety.\n  The Coast Guard small boat returned to Waesche with the first group \nof passengers and entered the stern notch with Petty Officer Obendorf \npositioned on the bow to assist in securing the boat for recovery. \nDuring the recovery evolution, Petty Officer Obendorf received a severe \nhead injury. Waesche completed the operation, ultimately rescuing 22 \npeople and towing the fishing vessel to safety, but despite the \nlifesaving first aid of his shipmates and the excellent care of two \nmedical centers, Petty Officer Obendorf succumbed to his injuries on 18 \nDecember 2013.\n  Petty Officer Obendorf will surely be missed by his family, loved \nones, and shipmates. I am thankful for his service and honored by his \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9097-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9097-S9098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NELLIE FREEMAN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, staff turnover is part of life in the \nSenate, just as it is in any other institution. But some departures are \nparticularly bittersweet. Today is the last day Helen Eleanor Freeman \nwill be working in my office; she is retiring after more than 23 years \nof faithful--and joyful service--to me and to former Senator Paul \nSarbanes, to the Senate, and to the people of Maryland.\n  Her name is Helen Eleanor Freeman, but throughout the Senate and \nbeyond Capitol Hill, everyone knows her as Nellie. She is an avid \nvolleyball player and her recreational activity led, through another \nplayer, to her first job in the Senate, with Senator Sarbanes, in 1989. \nWhen Senator Sarbanes retired and I was elected to replace him, he was \nadamant that I must hire Nellie as I filled out my Senate staff. He \ntold me, ``There is no one quite like Nellie,'' and over the past 7 \nyears I have been fortunate to have Nellie on my staff, I certainly \nhave come to agree with that assessment. Nellie is unique. She is the \n``glue'' that holds our office together. While I am happy for her, I am \nsad she will be leaving the office and I know the rest of my staff \nshares that assessment.\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n  Nellie is an avid fan of the local teams, especially the Baltimore \nOrioles. So I will use a sports analogy from baseball. Nellie is like \nthe super utility infielder--the person who can play any position well, \nthe consummate team player. Name just about any task or function in the \noffice, and Nellie has performed it--manning the phones, sorting and \nresponding to constituent correspondence, helping to select, train, and \nsupervise the interns--you name it and Nellie has done it.\n  So there are the official duties and there are the unofficial duties. \nWith regard to the unofficial duties, Nellie has been the go-to person \nwhen it comes to organizing office parties to celebrate birthdays, \nafterhours social events, staff book clubs, and so forth. That is the \n``glue'' I was talking about a moment ago. The Senate can be a \ndifficult place in which to work, both for Senators and staff. Nellie \nhas played a critical role in helping my staff feel more like a \nwelcoming family and that redounds not only to my benefit, but to the \nbenefit of the Senate.\n  Nellie is unfailingly calm, courteous, solicitous, kind, and happy. \nHer personality shines through and her cheerfulness is infectious, much \nappreciated, and an example for all of us. Nellie makes friends with \neveryone: constituents, colleagues, other Senate staff, Senators. She \nmakes it easier and more pleasant for everyone to work here. That is no \nsmall accomplishment.\n  Nellie is retiring today, but she is far from having a ``retiring'' \npersonality so I know she will remain as busy and engaged as ever. She \nhas volleyball and book clubs and volunteer activities and the Orioles. \nDuring the season, I didn't need to read the sports page to determine \nwhether the Orioles had won the night before. If they had won, Nellie \nwould be at work in the morning resplendent in black and orange attire.\n  Most of all, Nellie has her beloved husband Bob Ham and the rest of \nher large family--her parents Bob and Molly Freeman; her siblings \nDavid, Mary, Emily, and Teddy; in-laws Jessica, Andy, and Nadia; and \nher nieces and nephews Rachel, Zach, Francesca, Koby, Saul, Ben, Molly, \nand Amelie and most of them live in the area. It is a big, raucous \nfamily filled with the same love and good cheer Nellie exudes.\n  So to Nellie Freeman on the occasion of her retirement after more \nthan 23 years of serving the people of Maryland and all Americans, \nthank you for your exemplary service and, above all, thank you for your \nfriendship.

Madam President, as a longtime advocate for youth \nin the juvenile justice system during my time in the Connecticut State \nLegislature and in Congress, I congratulate my home State of \nConnecticut on new evidence that its major juvenile justice reforms \nover the past 10 years have been a resounding success. These reforms \nare based on the principle that children are fundamentally different \nfrom adults, and they should not be criminalized just like adult \noffenders. While other States have begun to recognize this principle \nand put it into practice, my home State has led the way. I am proud to \nnote that Connecticut has achieved the largest reduction in its \nconfinement of minors of any state in the United States over the last \ndecade.\n  Like many other States, Connecticut adopted tough-on-crime policies \nthat drastically increased the number of children locked up through its \njuvenile court system in the 1990s and early 2000s. But in the mid-\n2000s, the State recognized that these policies were ineffective, \ncostly, and worst of all, ended up harming children more than helping \nthem. Connecticut began to reform its juvenile system, passing a law in \n2005 that prohibited the detention of youth for violating a court order \nin any status offense case.\n  Then, in 2007, Connecticut passed Raise the Age, a law that has ended \nthe prosecution of most 16- and 17-year-old teenagers in the adult \ncriminal system and returned them to the juvenile system where they \nbelong. Not an easy victory, Raise the Age took more than a decade of \nefforts by children and families, youth advocates, and State \nlegislators to pass and fully implement.\n  Together with other State reforms, the status offense change and \nRaise the Age have led Connecticut to cut its rate of juvenile \nincarceration by 60 percent between 2001 and 2011. This drop--\ndocumented in a report by the National Juvenile Justice Network and the \nTexas Public Policy Foundation entitled ``The Comeback and Coming-from-\nBehind States: An Update on Youth Incarceration in the United States'' \nand released just this week--is the largest in the Nation. More than \nany other State, Connecticut has succeeded in locking up fewer children \nand turning to more effective policies instead, such as relying \nincreasingly on community-based treatment and cutting back on law \nenforcement referrals for school discipline issues.\n  One of the key architects of the Raise the Age effort in Connecticut \nwas Liz Ryan, a nationally known and leading juvenile justice advocate. \nLiz is the president and CEO of the Campaign for Youth Justice, an \norganization she founded in 2005, around the same time that advocates \nin Connecticut first formed the Connecticut Juvenile Justice Alliance, \nCTJJA. Liz consulted with the founders of CTJJA to mobilize the Raise \nthe Age campaign, and our State was one of the first to receive her \nexpertise and support.\n  Throughout her career, Liz has worked tirelessly to build and \nstrengthen the juvenile justice field by guiding and supporting other \nadvocates and organizations. She serves on the National Juvenile \nJustice & Delinquency Prevention Coalition, cochairs the Act 4 Juvenile \nJustice campaign, and serves on the working groups for the National \nGirls Institute and the National Center for Youth in Custody. Along \nwith these advocacy organizations, Liz has worked closely with us in \nCongress to raise the profile of juvenile justice issues and push for \ngreater reform.\n  Unfortunately for the many who have worked with Liz over the years, \nshe is now stepping down from her current role. While she is \nirreplaceable and will certainly remain involved in the advocacy field, \nI congratulate her on the work she has accomplished over the course of \nseveral decades. On behalf of those of us in Connecticut, I also thank \nLiz for her commitment to our State's reform efforts. As was said best \nby the director of CTJJA, Abby Anderson, ``If movements have best \nfriends, Liz is the best friend of the Connecticut juvenile justice \nreform movement.''\n  Connecticut's success in improving how it treats its youth is an \nexample for the rest of the country. More and more evidence shows that \nmy home State should be a model for other States as they look to reduce \ncosts and improve outcomes for children. I will continue to highlight \nConnecticut's success and to expand its best practices at the Federal \nlevel so that we can help support other States make these same \ncommonsense and humane reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9098-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9098-S9099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BATAAN CORREGIDOR MEMORIAL BRIDGE\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, today I wish to commemorate \nthe dedication of Bataan Corregidor Memorial Bridge in Weatogue, CT, \nearlier this month.\n  Crossing over the Farmington River in Connecticut, this bridge will \nnow honor the patriotism and courage of the brave men from Connecticut \nand across the nation who fought in the Battles of Bataan and \nCorregidor in 1942 in the Pacific during World War II. From January to \nApril 1942, American and Filipino forces fought Japanese soldiers along \nthe Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor in the Philippines. \nWhen both fell to the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 American and \nFilipino troops were killed and 20,000 wounded. Another 15,000 American \nand 60,000 Filipino troops were taken prisoner and forced to endure the \nBataan Death March.\n  Dan Crowley of Simsbury and Darrel Stark of Stafford Springs, who \nwere there in combat, are the last two surviving residents of \nConnecticut who fought in these historic battles in the United States \nArmy following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After Mr. Crowley fought in \nthe Battle of Bataan, he refused to surrender and swam to the island of \nCorregidor where he was later\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\ntaken prisoner by the Japanese and endured 42 months in Japanese prison \ncamps. His story is one of many heroic accounts from this theater \nduring World War II.\n  The moving dedication ceremony included a flyover, musical \nperformances, blessing of the bridge, ribbon cutting, and a stirring, \nclosing bugle taps. I deeply appreciate the work of Mr. Crowley, State \nSenator Kevin Witkos, and the Connecticut Department of Transportation \nin creating this important symbol of our Nation's stalwart gratitude \nfor the tremendous sacrifices of countless men during this series of \nbattles. The Bataan Corregidor Memorial Bridge is vivid in its \nsimplicity and elemental strength. It is not a grand structure, but \nlike the men whose unimaginable courage we celebrate, it is there in \nits simple, physical strength.\n  We can never forget the service of the Greatest Generation, who \nprotected our freedom and liberty--all who lost their lives and those \nwho lived to pay tribute to their fellow comrades. This bridge will \nalways be a memorial--a living memorial--used every day by all of us \nwho will continue to remember and thank the brave patriots who fought \nso gallantly at Bataan and Corregidor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9099-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills were read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 1961.

A bill to facilitate a land exchange involving certain \nNational Forest System land in the Inyo National Forest, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Inyo \nNational Forest Land Exchange Act.\n  This legislation will facilitate a land exchange between the \noperators of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in the Eastern Sierra Nevada \nregion of California and the Inyo National Forest. Enactment of this \nbill will allow the ski resort to redevelop the parcel of land it \ncurrently leases from Forest Service, while providing the Forest \nService with a combination of high resource value lands and a cash \npayment equal to the value of the exchanged land.\n  Since the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, LLC, MMSA, began operations in \n1953, Mammoth Mountain has grown to be one of the most popular ski \nareas in the United States, attracting up to two million visitors a \nyear.\n  However, the Main Lodge area, which is located on approximately 21 \nacres of land leased by MMSA, has become outdated and inadequate to \nmeet visitor needs. The Main Lodge building and Mammoth Mountain Inn \nare now more than 50 years old and require significant improvements and \nupgrades. Insufficient employee housing, parking and guest amenities \nmust be corrected and skier staging and lift line queuing areas must be \nmodernized. In order to make the necessary long-term investments, \nresort operators are seeking fee title to the land and have been \nworking with the Inyo National Forest since 1998 to complete a land \nexchange.\n  Equal-value land exchanges involving Forest Service land are \npermitted under the Exchange Act. However, the typical land exchange \nprocedures do not conform well to this particular exchange due to the \ncomplexity, size and scarcity of large, high resource value parcels in \nthe Inyo National Forest. Consequently, this legislation would \nauthorize a one-time exception to the Exchange Act to accomplish the \nproposed land exchange. Specifically, the bill would require the \nSecretary of Agriculture to acquire two parcels of private land \noutside, totaling approximately 1,500 acres, the boundary the Inyo \nNational Forest in exchange for the conveyance of the 21 acre parcel \nwithin the forest currently leased to MMSA; accept a cash equalization \npayment in excess of the 25 percent value of the federal lands to fully \ncompensate the Forest Service for the exchanged lands; and use the cash \npayment to acquire land or interests in land for additions to the \nNational Forest System as such lands become available.\n  This bill will provide both economic and environmental benefits. The \nnew construction that this bill will help facilitate will not only \ncreate new construction jobs during renovations, but will also allow \nthe Ski Area to expand and improve its operations, creating more \nsustainable and permanent jobs. Additionally, the land MMSA will be \ntransferring to the Forest Service includes high resource value lands \nthat have long been desired for protection by local environmentalists \nand the Forest Service. This includes lands within the view shed of the \nMono Basin\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nNational Scenic Area, the first designated National Scenic Area and a \nplace of incredible natural beauty.\n  This legislation has bipartisan support. The bill was first \nintroduced by Rep. Buck McKeon in June 2011 and passed the House in \nApril 2012 by a vote of 376--2. It was reintroduced by Rep. Paul Cook \nearlier this year with the support of both Democratic and Republican \ncosponsors and passed the House a second time on December 3, 2013.\n  Local government and community organizations also support this \nlegislation, including the Mono County Board of Supervisors, the \nMammoth Lakes Town Council, the Mammoth Lakes Chamber of Commerce, \nMammoth Lakes Tourism, the Mono Lake Committee, and the Eastern Sierra \nLand Trust.\n  This trade has long been supported by noted environmentalists, \nincluding the late Andrea Mead Lawrence, after whom Congress earlier \nthis year named a mountain in the nearby Sierra Nevada.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Enactment of this \nbill will ensure the long term success of one of the Nation's top ski \nresorts and benefit the local and regional economy, while allowing the \nForest Service to acquire high resource value lands that will be \nenjoyed by Americans for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the United States Sentencing Commission \nwith respect to penalties for the unlawful production of a controlled \nsubstance on Federal property or intentional trespass on the property \nof another that causes environmental damage; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Protecting \nLands Against Narcotics Trafficking or PLANT Act of 2013 with my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Orrin Hatch.\n  This bill, which is similar to House legislation introduced by \nRepresentative Jared Huffman, will help curb the severe environmental \ndamage caused by illegal marijuana grows. I thank my friend and fellow \nCalifornian, Representative Huffman, for his leadership on this issue.\n  Across our Nation, but especially in California, drug traffickers \ncultivate marijuana with zero regard for the environmental destruction \nit causes. Motivated solely by profits, these criminals illegally \ndivert streams, poison wildlife, pollute watersheds and destroy the \nnatural heritage that we have worked so hard to protect.\n  Recognizing the destructive ecological impact of illegal marijuana \ncultivation, this legislation directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to review and amend Federal sentencing guidelines to account \nfor the environmental crimes drug traffickers commit on public and \ntrespassed lands.\n  Specifically, the bill instructs the Sentencing Commission to put in \nplace sentencing guidelines that increase penalties for individuals who \nengage in any of the following activities while cultivating illegal \ndrugs on Federal lands or while trespassing on another person's \nproperty:\n  Use of poisons or hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides and \nrodenticides; the diversion, redirection, obstruction, draining or \nimpoundment of local aquifers, rivers or bodies of water; or \nsignificant removal of vegetation or clear cutting of timber.\n  In addition to environmental concerns, this legislation addresses the \nsafety of our public lands. It directs the Sentencing Commission to \nprovide guidelines increasing penalties on drug traffickers who use or \npossess a firearm while producing illegal drugs on federal or \ntrespassed lands.\n  Last year alone, over 900,000 marijuana plants were eradicated at 471 \nsites on National Forest Lands. Sadly, this represents only a fraction \nof the total marijuana illegally grown in our National Parks, Forests \nand other public lands. In California, Operation Pristine, a recent \neffort to combat the environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana \nproduction, resulted in the removal of over 8,700 tons of trash \nincluding pesticides, batteries, fertilizers and propane tanks from \nenvironmentally sensitive lands.\n  Drug traffickers often use illegal pesticides smuggled in from \nMexico, such as carbofuran, which contaminate California's water \nresources. They also use pesticides and rodenticides in an illegal \nmanner, often on protected lands. These poisons are having a \ndevastating impact on California's wildlife, including the Pacific \nFisher, a member of the Weasel family being considered for listing as \nan endangered species.\n  Taxpayers are also being hit hard by the millions of dollars needed \nto clean up the environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana grows. \nEstimates put the cost of reclaiming land damaged by illicit marijuana \ngrowth at approximately $15,000 per acre. As you might expect, drug \ntraffickers are not setting aside funds for this work, and the cost is \npassed on to the American people.\n  Illicit marijuana cultivation also damages the economy and hurts \nlegitimate businesses. Timber companies, farmers and ranchers have had \ntheir operations disrupted by criminals growing marijuana illegally. \nMarijuana growers on agricultural lands, particularly in the Central \nValley, divert thousands of gallons of scarce water from legitimate \nagriculture. In 2013 alone, California has identified over 1,800 grow \nsites in the Central Valley, including 406 in Tulare County and 537 in \nFresno as of November.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control \nand also as a Senator who has worked to safeguard our country's natural \nresources, I believe that we cannot allow drug traffickers to destroy \nour public lands, pollute our waters and kill our wildlife with \nimpunity. It is time that sentencing guidelines take into account the \nenvironmental damage that drug traffickers all too often cause.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a registry of certain veterans who were stationed at or \nunderwent training at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown, New Brunswick, \nCanada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill addressing \nan issue important to Maine veterans who served at Canadian Forces \nBase, CFB, Gagetown. Veterans who served there may have suffered from \nadverse health impacts due to exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, \nwhich was used at CFB Gagetown in 1966 and 1967. This bill would \nrequire the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, VA, to establish a registry \nof U.S. veterans who served or trained at CFB Gagetown between 1956 and \n2006 and have subsequently experienced health issues, which may have \nresulted from exposure to these chemicals. It also directs the VA to \ncommission an independent study investigating any possible linkage \nbetween the spraying of Agent Orange at CFB Gagetown and subsequent \nhealth problems among the American soldiers who served or trained \nthere. The legislation I am offering with Senator King is similar to \nanother bill that has been introduced by Congressman Mike Michaud in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Protecting the health of those who have served our Nation is a solemn \nresponsibility. I have heard from veterans in Maine about how they have \nsuffered from diabetes, cancers, and respiratory illnesses. Many of \nthese veterans fear their illnesses are linked to the use of Agent \nOrange in the 1960s. These veterans, however, have had difficulty in \npersuading the VA that their health problems are related to this \nchemical exposure.\n  By requiring the VA to establish a registry of these veterans, we \nrecognize these widespread concerns and provide veterans with a way to \nmake their claims known to the VA and to identify commonalities among \ntheir shared experiences. It also provides the VA with the ability to \nreach out to veterans on this issue of critical importance.\n  Last month, I personally raised this issue with the Canadian Minister \nof Defence. Many Canadian veterans who served or trained at CFB \nGagetown voiced similar concerns with their government. He described \nhow the Government of Canada found a way to appropriately compensate \nservice members affected by the toxic chemicals used at Gagetown. \nUltimately, the Canadian government approved one-time ex gratia \npayments of $20,000 for qualifying veterans who demonstrated that they \nwere at CFB Gagetown during the days when the toxic agents were \nsprayed.\n  A crucial provision in this legislation requires the VA to commission \nan independent study that investigates the connection between health \nproblems and exposure to Agent Orange at CFB Gagetown. Previously, I \nrequested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry conduct an \ninvestigation into whether Maine veterans were exposed to toxic \nchemicals while training at CFB Gagetown. A significant deficiency with \nthe CDC report, however, was that it relied solely on existing Canadian \ngovernment studies on this subject rather than conducting interviews of \nthose who trained there. Many Maine veterans feel strongly that they \nsuffered negative consequences from exposure to Agent Orange while \ntraining at Gagetown. The United States Government should conduct its \nown independent study with interviews.\n  This legislation keeps faith with our veterans by demonstrating that \nour government takes the allegations of exposure to Agent Orange \nseriously. The bill will help identify and bring together the shared \nexperience of those who trained at CFB Gagetown. This bill will make it \neasier for the VA to conduct outreach on this issue pending any new \ndevelopments. I look forward to working with Senator King and all of my \ncolleagues to pass this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9108-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9108-S9110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 325--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF DECEMBER 22 THROUGH \n              DECEMBER 28, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL TOY WEEK''\n\n  Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

sanctities, propaganda against the regime \n     and spreading corruption on earth'';\n       Whereas the lawyer for these seven leaders, Mrs. Shirin \n     Ebadi, the Nobel Laureate, was denied meaningful or timely \n     access to the prisoners and their files, and her colleagues \n     and successors as defense counsel were provided extremely \n     limited access, and Ms. Ebadi stated that there was no \n     evidence to sustain the charges against the seven;\n       Whereas, on May 13, 2013, four United Nations human rights \n     experts, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \n     rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, the head of the Working Group \n     on Arbitrary Detention, El Hadji Malick Sow, the Special \n     Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Heiner \n     Bielefeldt, and the Independent Expert on Minorities issues, \n     Rita Izask, released a statement ``call[ing] on the Iranian \n     authorities for the immediate release of seven Baha'i \n     community leaders, known as the Yaran, nearing the fifth \n     anniversary of their arrests, whose detentions were declared \n     arbitrary by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, on \n     20 November 2008'';\n       Whereas, beginning in May 2011, Government of Iran \n     officials in four cities conducted sweeping raids on the \n     homes of dozens of individuals associated with the Baha'i \n     Institute for Higher Education (BIHE) and arrested and \n     detained several educators associated with BIHE;\n       Whereas, in October 2011, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran \n     sentenced seven of these BIHE instructors and administrators, \n     Mr. Vahid Mahmoudi, Mr. Kamran Mortezaie, Mr. Mahmoud \n     Badavam, Ms. Nooshin Khadem, Mr. Farhad Sedghi, Mr. Riaz \n     Sobhani, and Mr. Ramin Zibaie, to prison terms for the crime \n     of ``membership of the deviant sect of Baha'ism, with the \n     goal of taking action against the security of the country, in \n     order to further the aims of the deviant sect and those of \n     organizations outside the country,'' with six of them \n     remaining imprisoned;\n       Whereas, since October 2011, six other BIHE educators have \n     been arrested and imprisoned, with Ms. Faran Hessami, Mr. \n     Kamran Rahimian, and Mr. Shahin Negari serving 4-year prison \n     terms, and Mr. Kayvan Rahimian, Dr. Foad Moghaddam, and Mr. \n     Amanollah Mostaghim serving 5-year prison terms;\n       Whereas the efforts of the Government of Iran to collect \n     information on individual Baha'is have recently intensified \n     as evidenced by a letter, dated November 5, 2011, from the \n     Director of the Department of Education in the county of \n     Shahriar in the province of Tehran, instructing the directors \n     of schools in his jurisdiction to ``subtly and in a \n     confidential manner'' collect information on Baha'i students;\n       Whereas, since September 2013, the Government of Iran has \n     imprisoned four Baha'i mothers, Taraneh Torabi, Zohreh \n     Nikayin, Neda Majidi, and Elham Rouzbehi, along with their \n     infant children, and Ms. Torabi, Ms. Nikayin, and Ms. \n     Rouzbehi remain imprisoned with their children;\n       Whereas, on August 24, 2013, Mr. Ataollah Rezvani, an \n     active member of the Baha'i community of Bandar Abbas, Iran, \n     was found shot in his car on the outskirts of the city, in \n     what may be a religiously motivated murder during a time of \n     increased pressure on Iran's religious minorities and a surge \n     in anti-Baha'i rhetoric by various clerics;\n       Whereas, in September 2013, the Government of Iran released \n     a number of prisoners of conscience, and none of the \n     prisoners released were known to be Baha'is;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is party to the \n     International Covenants on Human Rights and is in violation \n     of its obligations under the Covenants; and\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, \n     and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) authorizes \n     the President and the Secretary of State to impose sanctions \n     on individuals ``responsible for or complicit in, or \n     responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise \n     directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses \n     against citizens of Iran or their family members on or after \n     June 12, 2009'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored \n     persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued \n     violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release \n     the seven imprisoned leaders, the twelve imprisoned \n     educators, and all other prisoners held solely on account of \n     their religion;\n       (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in \n     cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn \n     the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights \n     and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on \n     account of their religion; and\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to utilize \n     all available authorities, including the Comprehensive Iran \n     Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to \n     impose sanctions on officials of the Government of Iran and \n     other individuals directly responsible for serious human \n     rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i community \n     of Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url":

Madam President, there are many traditions around this \nholiday season that I cherish, but I must confess that the tradition of \nspending Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve on the floor of the Senate is \nnot one of those traditions. Happily, this year we won't be repeating \nthat practice from previous years. We are leaving here shortly--some \nhave already--to spend the holidays at home with family.\n\n  As we close this first session of the 113th Congress, I wish to \npersonally thank our majority leader Senator Harry Reid--and let me add \nhis wife Landra--for their leadership and their resolve that helps to \nmake this Senate work.\n  I also thank the minority leader Senator Mitch McConnell. Although we \nmay disagree on many issues and have our debates on the floor of the \nSenate, I have a great respect for my colleagues and particularly their \nleader Senator McConnell. We all know we can't do this work alone. It \ntakes a lot of dedicated people to keep the Senate functioning.\n  On behalf of Leader Reid, I wish to acknowledge and thank the Senate \nParliamentarians and clerical staff and doorkeepers. I also thank the \ncloakroom staffs, the members of our floor staffs who put in even \nlonger than usual hours these past few weeks, and all of the Senate \nstaffers, Democratic and Republican.\n  I thank the Capitol Police officers for keeping us safe. We have to \nremember they risk their lives every day for us and all the people who \nwork and visit this great Capitol.\n  A special thanks to our Senate pages. We ask a lot of them--long \nhours for a lot of young people. We want them to know that their work \nis greatly appreciated. We wish them the best of luck. They will be \ncoming back in January to finish their current assignment as pages. I \nhope they have a great time at home with their families. Perhaps \nsomeday they will return here, maybe as Senators themselves.\n  Part of the magic of this holiday season is that it enables many of \nus, even just for a few moments, to consider a new world, to look at it \nwith a little less cynicism. I hope all of my colleagues will have a \nfew moments like that in the coming holidays, and I hope we are all \ngoing to come back and try to preserve some small measure of good will \nand make it part of our life's work in the next year of the Senate \nsession.\n  The budget agreement we passed this week was a good beginning to a \nless\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\npartisan, more productive Senate. I hope that is a portent of good \nthings to come.\n  There is a lot more we need to do. The American people are still \ncounting on us to work together on measures that will help to create \ngood jobs and strengthen America's economy, strengthen working families \nin Wisconsin and Illinois and all across America.\n  And particularly at this Christmastime, let's remember the message of \nPope Francis and religious leaders all over the world: to remember the \nneedy and the help they need that we can provide and must provide in \nthis caring world.\n  We all only serve in this body for a finite period of time. After we \nare gone, we want to look back on our service in the Senate and we all \nwant to be able to say: I was part of something important. I helped \nmeet the great challenges of my time, and I helped to preserve the \nAmerican dream. I hope that is part of our new year's resolve on both \nsides of the aisle.\n\n\n                             Senate Agenda\n\n  When we return in January, the Senate will continue working on \nnominations, starting with confirmation of Janet Yellen to head the \nFederal Reserve when we vote on January 6. Our first order of \nlegislative business will be to vote to extend unemployment benefits \nfor those who have exhausted their benefits and still can't find work \nthrough no fault of their own. This is a matter of simple fairness. It \naffects more than 1 million Americans and their families. We will not \ngive up on them and on our responsibility to help them through this \ndifficult time.\n  In closing, let me wish all of my fellow Senators and our staffs, \nthose who transcribe our remarks, and many others who make the Senate \nwork every single day, as well as our fellow Americans, a Merry \nChristmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/20/senate-section/article/S9116-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, DECEMBER 24, 2013 THROUGH MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
