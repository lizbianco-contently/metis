Good morning.\n  Mr. President, over the past week there have been numerous press \narticles written about the intelligence committee's oversight review of \nthe detention and interrogation program of the CIA.\n  Specifically, press attention has focused on the CIA's intrusion and \nsearch of the Senate select committee's computers, as well as the \ncommittee's acquisition of a certain internal CIA document known as the \nPanetta review.\n  I rise today to set the record straight and to provide a full \naccounting of the facts and history.\n  Let me say up front that I come to the Senate floor reluctantly. \nSince January 15, 2014, when I was informed of the CIA's search of this \ncommittee's network, I have been trying to resolve this dispute in a \ndiscreet and respectful way. I have not commented in response to media \nrequests for additional information on this matter. However, the \nincreasing amount of inaccurate information circulating now cannot be \nallowed to stand unanswered.\n  The origin of this study.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n  The CIA's detention and interrogation program began operations in \n2002, though it was not until September 2006 that members of the \nintelligence committee, other than the chairman and the vice chairman, \nwere briefed. In fact, we were briefed by then-CIA Director Hayden only \nhours before President Bush disclosed the program to the public.\n  A little more than a year later, on December 6, 2007, a New York \nTimes article revealed the troubling fact that the CIA had destroyed \nvideotapes of some of the CIA's first interrogations using so-called \nenhanced techniques. We learned that this destruction was over the \nobjections of President Bush's White House counsel and the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n\n  After we read about the destruction of the tapes in the newspapers, \nDirector Hayden briefed the Senate intelligence committee. He assured \nus that this was not destruction of evidence, as detailed records of \nthe interrogations existed on paper--in the form of CIA operational \ncables describing the detention conditions and the day-to-day CIA \ninterrogations.\n  The CIA Director stated that these cables were ``a more than adequate \nrepresentation'' of what would have been on the destroyed tapes. \nDirector Hayden offered at that time, during Senator Jay Rockefeller's \nchairmanship of the committee, to allow members or staff to review \nthese sensitive CIA operational cables, given that the videotapes had \nbeen destroyed.\n  Chairman Rockefeller sent two of his committee staffers out to the \nCIA on nights and weekends to review thousands of these cables, which \ntook many months. By the time the two staffers completed their review \ninto the CIA's early interrogations in early 2009, I had become \nchairman of the committee and President Obama had been sworn into \noffice.\n  The resulting staff report was chilling. The interrogations and the \nconditions of confinement at the CIA detention sites were far different \nand far more harsh than the way the CIA had described them to us. As a \nresult of the staff's initial report, I proposed and then Vice Chairman \nBond agreed, and the committee overwhelmingly approved, that the \ncommittee conduct an expansive and full review of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program.\n  On March 5, 2009, the committee voted 14 to 1 to initiate a \ncomprehensive review of the CIA detention and interrogation program. \nImmediately, we sent a request for documents to all relevant executive \nbranch agencies, chiefly among them the CIA.\n  The committee's preference was for the CIA to turn over all \nresponsive documents to the committee's office, as had been done in \nprevious committee investigations.\n  Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide, \nliterally, millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, \nmemos, and other documents, pursuant to the committee's document \nrequests at a secure location in northern Virginia. We agreed but \ninsisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity \nof this congressional investigation.\n  Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-\nDirector Panetta, and I agreed--in an exchange of letters--that the CIA \nwas to provide a ``stand-alone computer system'' with a ``network drive \n. . . segregated from CIA networks'' for the committee that would only \nbe accessed by information technology personnel at the CIA, who would \n``not be permitted to'' ``share information from the system with other \n[CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.''\n  It was this computer network, notwithstanding our agreement with \nDirector Panetta, that was searched by the CIA this past January, and \nonce before, which I will later describe.\n  In addition to demanding that the documents produced for the \ncommittee be reviewed at a CIA facility, the CIA also insisted on \nconducting a multilayered review of every responsive document before \nproviding the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did \nnot mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program--or provide documents that the President could \npotentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.\n  While we viewed this as unnecessary, and raised concerns that it \nwould delay our investigation, the CIA hired a team of outside \ncontractors--who otherwise would not have had access to these sensitive \ndocuments--to read, multiple times, each of the 6.2 million pages of \ndocuments produced, before providing them to fully cleared committee \nstaff conducting the committee's oversight work. This proved to be a \nslow and very expensive process.\n  The CIA started making documents available electronically to the \ncommittee staff at the CIA-leased facility in mid-2009. The number of \npages ran quickly to the thousands, the tens of thousands, the hundreds \nof thousands, and then into the millions. The documents that were \nprovided came without any index, without any organizational structure. \nIt was a true ``document dump'' that our committee staff had to go \nthrough and make sense of.\n  In order to piece together the story of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program, the committee staff did two things that will be \nimportant as I go on.\n  First, they asked the CIA to provide an electronic search tool so \nthey could locate specific relevant documents for their search among \nthe CIA-produced documents--just like you would use a search tool on \nthe Internet to locate information.\n  Second, when the staff found a document that was particularly \nimportant or that might be referenced in our final report, they would \noften print it or make a copy of the file on their computer so they \ncould easily find it again. There are thousands of such documents in \nthe committee's secure spaces at the CIA facility.\n  Now, prior removal of documents by the CIA.\n  In early 2010, the CIA was continuing to provide documents, and the \ncommittee staff was gaining familiarity with the information it had \nalready received.\n  In May of 2010, the committee staff noticed that the documents that \nhad been provided for the committee's review were no longer accessible. \nStaff approached the CIA personnel at the off-site location, who \ninitially denied the documents had been removed. CIA personnel then \nblamed information technology personnel, who were almost all \ncontractors, for removing the documents themselves without direction or \nauthority. Then the CIA stated that the removal of the documents was \nordered by the White House. When the committee approached the White \nHouse, the White House denied giving the CIA any such order.\n  After a series of meetings, I learned that on two occasions, CIA \npersonnel electronically removed committee access to CIA documents \nafter providing them to the committee. This included roughly 870 \ndocuments--or pages of documents--that were removed in February 2010 \nand, secondly, roughly another 50 that were removed in mid-May \n2010. This was done without the knowledge or approval of committee \nmembers or staff and in violation of our written agreements.\n\n  Further, this type of behavior would not have been possible had the \nCIA allowed the committee to conduct the review of documents here in \nthe Senate. In short, this was the exact sort of CIA interference in \nour investigation that we sought to avoid at the outset.\n  I went to the White House to raise the issue with the then-White \nHouse counsel. In May 2010 he recognized the severity of the situation \nand the grave implications of executive branch personnel interfering \nwith an official congressional investigation. The matter was resolved \nwith a renewed commitment from the White House counsel and the CIA that \nthere would be no further unauthorized access to the committee's \nnetwork or removal of access to CIA documents already provided to the \ncommittee.\n  On May 17, 2010, the CIA's then-Director of Congressional Affairs \napologized on behalf of the CIA for removing the documents. And that, \nas far as I was concerned, put the incident aside. This event was \nseparate from the documents provided that were part of the internal \nPanetta review which occurred later, and which I will describe next.\n  At some point in 2010, committee staff searching the documents that \nhad been made available found draft versions of what is now called the \ninternal Panetta review. We believe\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nthese documents were written by CIA personnel to summarize and analyze \nthe materials that had been provided to the committee for its review. \nThe Panetta review documents were no more highly classified than other \ninformation we had received for our investigation. In fact, the \ndocuments appeared based on the same information already provided to \nthe committee.\n  What was unique and interesting about the internal documents was not \ntheir classification level but, rather, their analysis and \nacknowledgment of significant CIA wrongdoing. To be clear, the \ncommittee staff did not hack into CIA computers to obtain these \ndocuments, as has been suggested in the press. The documents were \nidentified using the search tool provided by the CIA to search the \ndocuments provided to the committee. We have no way to determine who \nmade the internal Panetta review documents available to the committee.\n  Further, we do not know whether the documents were provided \nintentionally by the CIA, unintentionally by the CIA, or intentionally \nby a whistleblower. In fact, we know that over the years on multiple \noccasions the staff have asked the CIA about documents made available \nfor our investigation. At times the CIA has simply been unaware that \nthese specific documents were provided to the committee. And while this \nis alarming, it is also important to note that more than 6.2 million \npages of documents have been provided. This is simply a massive amount \nof records. As I described earlier, as part of its standard process for \nreviewing records, the committee staff printed copies of the internal \nPanetta review and made electronic copies of the committee's computers \nat the facility. The staff did not rely on these internal Panetta \nreview documents when drafting the final 6,300-page committee study. \nBut it was significant that the internal Panetta review had documented \nat least some of the very same troubling matters already uncovered by \nthe committee staff, which is not surprising in that they were looking \nat the same information.\n  There is a claim in the press and elsewhere that the marks on these \ndocuments should have caused the staff to stop reading them and turn \nthem over to the CIA. I reject that claim completely. As with many \nother documents provided to the committee at the CIA facility, some of \nthe internal Panetta review documents--some--contained markings \nindicating that they were ``deliberative'' and/or ``privileged.'' This \nwas not especially noteworthy to staff. In fact, CIA has provided \nthousands of internal documents to include CIA legal guidance and \ntalking points prepared for the CIA Director, some of which were marked \nas being ``deliberative'' or ``privileged.''\n  Moreover, the CIA has officially provided such documents to the \ncommittee here in the Senate. In fact, the CIA's official June 27, 2013 \nresponse to the committee study which Director Brennan delivered to me \npersonally is labeled ``deliberative process, privileged document.''\n  We have discussed this with the Senate legal counsel who has \nconfirmed that Congress does not recognize these claims of privilege \nwhen it comes to documents provided to Congress for our oversight \nduties. These were documents provided by the executive branch pursuant \nto an authorized congressional oversight investigation, so we believe \nwe had every right to review and keep the documents.\n  There are also claims in the press that the Panetta internal review \ndocuments, having been created in 2009 and 2010, were outside the date \nrange of the committee's document request or the terms of the committee \nstudy. This, too, is inaccurate. The committee's document requests were \nnot limited in time. In fact, as I have previously announced, the \ncommittee study includes significant information on the May 2011 Osama \nbin Laden operation, which obviously postdated the detention \nand interrogation program.\n\n  At some time after the committee staff identified and reviewed the \ninternal Panetta review documents, access to the vast majority of them \nwas removed by the CIA. We believe this happened in 2010, but we have \nno way of knowing the specifics, nor do we know why the documents were \nremoved. The staff was focused on reviewing the tens of thousands of \nnew documents that continue to arrive on a regular basis.\n  Our work continued until December 2012 when the Intelligence \nCommittee approved a 6,300-page committee study of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program and sent the executive report to the \nexecutive branch for comment. The CIA provided its response to the \nstudy on June 27, 2013.\n  As CIA Director Brennan has stated, the CIA officially agrees with \nsome of our study, but, as has been reported, the CIA disagrees and \ndisputes important parts of it. And this is important. Some of these \nimportant parts the CIA now disputes in our committee study are clearly \nacknowledged in the CIA's own internal Panetta review. To say the \nleast, this is puzzling. How can the CIA's official response to our \nstudy stand factually in conflict with its own internal review?\n  Now after noting the disparity between the official CIA response to \nthe committee study and the internal Panetta review, the committee \nstaff securely transported a printed portion of the draft internal \nPanetta review from the committee's secure room at the CIA-leased \nfacility to the secure committee spaces in the Hart Senate office \nbuilding. And let me be clear about this. I mentioned earlier the \nexchange of letters that Senator Bond and I had with Director Panetta \nin 2009 over the handling of information for his review. The letters \nset out a process whereby the committee would provide specific CIA \ndocuments to CIA reviewers before bringing them back to our secure \noffices here on Capitol Hill.\n  The CIA review was designed specifically to make sure that committee \ndocuments available to all staff and members did not include certain \nkinds of information, most importantly the true names of nonsupervisory \nCIA personnel and the names of specific countries in which the CIA \noperated detention sites. We had agreed upfront that our report didn't \nneed to include this information, and so we agreed to redact it from \nmaterials leaving the CIA's facility.\n  In keeping with the spirit of the agreements, the portion of the \ninternal Panetta review at the Hart building in our safe has been \nredacted. It does not contain names of nonsupervisory CIA personnel or \ninformation identifying detention site locations. In other words, our \nstaff did just what the CIA personnel would have done had they reviewed \nthe documents.\n  There are several reasons why the draft summary of the Panetta review \nwas brought to our secure spaces at the Hart building. Let me list \nthem: No. 1, the significance of the internal review, given disparities \nbetween it and the June 2013 CIA response to the committee's study. The \ninternal Panetta review summary, now at the secure committee office in \nHart, is an especially significant document, as it corroborates \ncritical information in the committee's 6,300-page study that the CIA's \nofficial response either objects to, denies, minimizes, or ignores.\n  Unlike the official response, these Panetta review documents were in \nagreement with the committee's findings. That is what makes them so \nsignificant and important to protect.\n  When the internal Panetta review documents disappeared from the \ncommittee's computer system, this suggested once again that the CIA had \nremoved documents already provided to the committee in violation of CIA \nagreements and White House assurances that the CIA would cease such \nactivities.\n  As I have detailed, the CIA has previously withheld and destroyed \ninformation about its detention and interrogation program, including \nits decision in 2005 to destroy interrogation videotapes over the \nobjections of the Bush White House and the Director of National \nIntelligence. Based on the above, there was a need to preserve and \nprotect the internal Panetta review in the committee's own secure \nspaces. The relocation of the internal Panetta review was lawful and \nhandled in a manner consistent with its classification. No law prevents \nthe relocation of a document in the committee's possession from a CIA \nfacility to secure committee offices on Capitol Hill. As I mentioned \nbefore, the document was handled and transported in a manner consistent \nwith its classification, redacted appropriately, and it remained secure \nwith restricted access in committee spaces.\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n  Now the January 15, 2014, meeting with Director John Brennan. In late \n2013, I requested in writing that the CIA provide a final and complete \nversion of the internal Panetta review to the committee, as opposed to \nthe partial document the committee currently possesses.\n  In December, during an open committee hearing, Senator Mark Udall \nechoed this request. In early January 2014, the CIA informed the \ncommittee it would not provide the internal Panetta review to the \ncommittee citing the deliberative nature of the document.\n  Shortly thereafter, on January 15, 2014, CIA Director Brennan \nrequested an emergency meeting to inform me and Vice Chairman Chambliss \nthat without prior notification or approval, CIA personnel had \nconducted a ``search''--that was John Brennan's word--of the committee \ncomputers at the offsite facility. This search involved not only a \nsearch of documents provided by the committee to the CIA but also a \nsearch of the stand-alone and walled-off committee network drive \ncontaining the committee's own internal work product and \ncommunications.\n  According to Brennan, the computer search was conducted in response \nto indications that some members of the committee staff might already \nhave had access to the internal Panetta review. The CIA did not ask the \ncommittee or its staff if the committee had access to the internal \nPanetta review or how we obtained it.\n  Instead, the CIA just went and searched the committee's computers. \nThe CIA has still not asked the committee any questions about how the \ncommittee acquired the Panetta review. In place of asking any \nquestions, the CIA's unauthorized search of the committee computers was \nfollowed by an allegation--which we have now seen repeated anonymously \nin the press--that the committee staff had somehow obtained the \ndocument through unauthorized or criminal means, perhaps to include \nhacking into the CIA's computer network.\n  As I have described, this is not true. The document was made \navailable to the staff at the offsite facility and it was located using \na CIA-provided search tool running a query of the information provided \nto the committee pursuant to its investigation.\n  Director Brennan stated that the CIA search had determined that the \ncommittee staff had copies of the internal Panetta review on the \ncommittee staff's shared drive and had accessed them numerous times. He \nindicated at the meeting that he was going to order further forensic \ninvestigation of the committee network to learn more about activities \nof the committee's oversight staff.\n  Two days after the meeting, on January 17, I wrote a letter to \nDirector Brennan objecting to any further CIA investigation due to the \nseparation of powers constitutional issues that the search raised. I \nfollowed this with a second letter on January 23 to the Director, \nasking 12 specific questions about the CIA's actions--questions that \nthe CIA has refused to answer.\n  Some of the questions in my letter related to the full scope of the \nCIA's search of our computer network. Other questions related to who \nhad authorized and conducted the search and what legal basis the CIA \nclaimed gave it authority to conduct the search. Again, the CIA has not \nprovided answers to any of my questions.\n  My letter also laid out my concern about the legal and constitutional \nimplications of the CIA's actions. Based on what Director Brennan has \ninformed us, I have grave concerns that the CIA's search may well have \nviolated the separation of powers principles embodied in the U.S. \nConstitution, including the speech and debate clause. It may have \nundermined the constitutional framework essential to effective \ncongressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other \ngovernment function. I have asked for an apology and a recognition that \nthis CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was \ninappropriate. I have received neither. Besides the constitutional \nimplication, the CIA's search may also have violated the Fourth \nAmendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as Executive Order \n12333, which prohibits the CIA from conducting domestic searches or \nsurveillance.\n  Days after the meeting with Director Brennan, the CIA inspector \ngeneral David Buckley learned of the CIA search and began an \ninvestigation into the CIA's activities. I have been informed that Mr. \nBuckley has referred the matter to the Department of Justice given the \npossibility of a criminal violation by CIA personnel.\n  Let me note, because the CIA has refused to answer the questions in \nmy January 23 letter and the CIA inspector general is ongoing, I have \nlimited information about exactly what the CIA did in conducting its \nsearch.\n  Weeks later, I was also told that after the inspector general \nreferred the CIA's activities to the Department of Justice, the acting \ncounsel general of the CIA filed a crimes report with the Department of \nJustice concerning the committee staff's actions.\n  I have not been provided the specifics of these allegations or been \ntold whether the Department has initiated a criminal investigation \nbased on the allegations of the CIA's acting general counsel.\n  As I mentioned before, our staff involved in this matter have the \nappropriate clearances, handled this sensitive material according to \nestablished procedures and practice to protect classified information, \nand were provided access to the Panetta review by the CIA itself. As a \nresult there is no legitimate reason to allege to the Justice \nDepartment that the Senate staff may have committed a crime. I view the \nacting counsel general's referral as a potential effort to intimidate \nthis staff, and I am not taking it lightly.\n  I should note that for most, if not all, of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program, the now-acting general counsel was a lawyer in \nthe CIA's Counterterrorism Center--the unit within which the CIA \nmanaged and carried out this program. From mid-2004 until the official \ntermination of the detention and interrogation program in January of \n2009, he was the unit's chief lawyer. He is mentioned by name more than \n1,600 times in our study.\n  Now this individual is sending a crimes report to the Department of \nJustice on the actions of congressional staff--the same congressional \nstaff who researched and drafted a report that details how CIA \nofficers, including the acting general counsel himself, provided \ninaccurate information to the Department of Justice about the program.\n  Let me say this: All Senators rely on their staff to be their eyes \nand ears and to carry out our duties. The staff members of the \nintelligence committee are dedicated professionals who are motivated to \ndo what is best for our Nation. The staff members who have been working \non this study and this report have devoted years of their lives to it, \nwading through the horrible details of a CIA program that never, never, \nnever should have existed.\n  They have worked long hours and produced a report unprecedented in \nits comprehensive attention to detail in the history of the Senate. \nThey are now being threatened with legal jeopardy just as the final \nrevisions to the report are being made so parts of it can be \ndeclassified and released to the American people.\n  I felt I needed to come to the floor to correct the public record and \nto give the American people the facts about what the dedicated \ncommittee staff have been working so hard on for the last several years \nas part of the committee's investigation.\n  I also want to reiterate to my colleagues my desire to have all \nupdates to the committee report completed this month and approved for \ndeclassification. We are not going to stop. I intend to move to have \nthe findings, conclusions, and the executive summary of the report sent \nto the President for declassification and release to the American \npeople. The White House has indicated publicly--and to me personally--\nthat it supports declassification and release. If the Senate can \ndeclassify this report, we will be able to ensure that an un-American, \nbrutal program of detention and interrogation will never again be \nconsidered or permitted.\n  The recent actions I have just laid out make this a defining moment \nfor the oversight of our intelligence committee. How this will be \nresolved will show whether the intelligence committee can be effective \nin monitoring\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nand investigating our Nation's intelligence activities or whether our \nwork can be thwarted by those we oversee.\n  I believe it is critical that the committee and the Senate reaffirm \nour oversight role and our independence under the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is on the floor, I will tell her through the Chair that I \nhave had the privilege of serving in this body for 40 years. I have \nheard thousands of speeches on this floor. I cannot think of any speech \nby any Member of either party as important as the one the Senator from \nCalifornia just gave.\n  What she is saying is that if we are going to protect the separation \nof powers and the concept of congressional oversight, then she has \ntaken the right steps to do that.\n  The very first vote I cast in this body was for the Church Committee, \nwhich examined the excesses of the CIA and other agencies--everything \nfrom assassinations to spying on those who were protesting the war in \nVietnam. There was a famous George Tames picture, where then-chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee John Stennis was berating Senator Frank \nChurch for proposing this committee. He said that he, Senator Stennis, \ncould find out what he wanted to find out but didn't really want to \nknow everything.\n  I was standing behind George Tames when he took that picture in my \nfirst caucus. There is pressure on the junior Members--and I was the \nmost junior Member of the Senate at that time--not to vote for the \nChurch Committee.\n  Senator Mike Mansfield said to me--as did Senator Fritz Mondale and \nothers--that the Senate is bigger than any one Senator. We come and go, \nbut the Senate lasts. If we do not stand up for the protection of the \nseparation of powers and our ability to do oversight--especially when \nconduct has happened that is, in all likelihood, criminal conduct on \nthe part of a government agency--then what do we stand for? We are \nsupposed to be the conscience of the Nation.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, has spoken to our \nconscience--to every one of the 100 Senators, men and women, of both \nparties. She has spoken to our conscience. Now let's stand up for this \ncountry. Let's stand up as the Senate should and as the Senator from \nCalifornia has.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

She works tireless hours leading the \nIntelligence Committee. It is a very difficult job, always away from \nthe press, one that is very important to our country.\n  Her statement outlined I believe one of most important principles we \nmust maintain; that is, separation of powers. The Founding Fathers were \nvisionary in creating this great government of ours, three separate but \nequal branches of government: executive, judicial, and legislative.\n  Her statement today pronounced, in a very firm fashion, that must \ncontinue, that separation of powers. The work the committee has done \nover the last many years dealing with what went on in the prior \nadministration is imperative.\n  I do not know much of the details as to what they are working on, but \nI know what they have been working on generally. I admire what she has \ndone and the committee has done, and especially her statement today was \none of courage and conviction. We know, those of us who have worked \nwith her over the years, that no one has more courage and conviction \nthan Dianne Feinstein.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

As a survivor of polio as a child, I have always \nempathized with children battling life-threatening or disabling \ndisorders. I also have a special place in my heart for those who work \nday in and day out to help kids who are battling childhood diseases. \nThat is especially true when these researchers and physicians are \nworking with children in my home State of Kentucky at places such as \nthe University of Louisville, the University of Kentucky, and Kosair \nChildren's Hospital. That is why I have long been a strong supporter of \npediatric medical research.\n  I cosponsored and helped shepherd the Childhood Cancer Act of 2008 \nthrough the Senate. I also voted for the Combating Autism Act of 2006 \nand, as Republican leader, helped to secure its reauthorization in \n2011. These were not partisan initiatives. They were areas where the \ntwo parties had generally worked together to advance the common good. \nMaybe that is why we don't hear that much about them, but I think we \nall agree there is more to be done.\n  Late last year the House passed bipartisan legislation, which I \nstrongly support, to shift funding from lower priority programs to \npediatric research, including childhood cancers, autism, Down syndrome, \nFragile X, and countless other disorders and diseases that affect our \nchildren and don't yet have a cure. These efforts could be paid for by \nusing taxpayer funding of the Republican and Democratic political \nconventions.\n  Frankly, it is hard to imagine that there would be any objection to \nmoving these funds to do something we can all agree is a very high \npriority, and that is pediatric research.\n  Thanks to the leadership of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the \nGabriella Miller Kids First Research Savings Act, which was named in \nhonor of a young girl from Virginia, passed the House on a wide \nbipartisan majority with nearly 300 votes. After it arrived in the \nSenate, I asked my colleagues on the Republican side to pass it and \nsend it to the President for his signature, because I saw the positive \nimpact these funds would have on pediatric research. All Republicans \nagreed to pass the bill on January 7, and today marks the 63rd day that \nSenate Democrats have failed to act--although I must say I understand \nit has now cleared and I think that is excellent. It is about time we \npassed this bill out of the Senate. I believe we are about to do that. \nThis is the type of bipartisan legislation that should move easily \nthrough the Senate. We should be able to pass the measure today and it \nis my understanding we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am pleased today the Senate will pass \nlegislation I support, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. \nThis bipartisan legislation honors the memory of Gabriella Miller, a \nyoung girl from Leesburg, VA who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain \ntumor at age 9.\n  In the face of her own diagnosis, Gabriella worked to help other \nchildren with pediatric diseases. She raised money for the Make-A-Wish \nFoundation, spoke at local and national awareness events and authored a \nspecial writing in a children's book about cancer.\n  Gabriella and her family started the Smashing Walnuts Foundation, \ndedicated to finding a cure for childhood brain cancer. The \norganization was named for the walnut-sized tumor in her brain. \nGabriella passed away last year, but her dedication to raising \nawareness and funding for pediatric disease research is part of her \nlegacy.\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n  The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act will require the \ndirector of the National Institutes of Health to allocate $126 \nmillion--$12.6 million each year for 10 years--of appropriated funds \nfor pediatric research. The money would be allocated into needed \nresearch grants for pediatric autism, cancer and other diseases.\n  The fight for funding pediatric research is far from over but this is \na step in the right direction. As Gabriella said, ``You may have a bad \nday today, but there's always a bright shining star to look forward to \ntomorrow.'' It is my hope that this legislation will help fund research \nthat leads to future treatments and cures.\n  I would like to thank Senator Mark Warner and Senator Orrin Hatch for \nsupporting this legislation and Congressman Cantor for championing the \nbill through the House of Representatives.\n  This bipartisan effort is about making sure pediatric disease \nresearch is a high priority. I am proud we were able to pass \nlegislation that honors Gabriella Miller, her family, and her inspiring \nwork as an advocate for pediatric disease research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1492-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GABRIELLA MILLER KIDS FIRST RESEARCH SAVINGS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 289, H.R. 2019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       An act (H.R. 2019) to eliminate taxpayer financing of \n     political party conventions and reprogram savings to provide \n     for a 10-year pediatric research initiative through the \n     Common Fund administered by the National Institutes of \n     Health, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to the \nmeasure?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we on this side accept this measure, but I \ndo have a few things I want to say before saying there is no objection.\n  Sequestration cut $1.6 billion from NIH last year--$1.6 billion. In \nthe omnibus we passed, we gave them current level funding, but that \nhole for NIH is still there. NIH has lost huge amounts of money over \nthe past few years in the way that we have struggled to get financing \nfor our country. We in the past have been the guiding light for \nresearch on diseases and conditions. We are still there, but we are \nlosing ground. Every country in the world looks at the NIH as a place \nthey would like to be.\n  This is a small amount of money, but it will be extremely helpful to \nthe NIH.\n  I would hope my Republican colleagues would join with us in \nincreasing funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  Senator Durbin is going to introduce a bill today that will fund NIH \nat levels they need to be funded. It has to be paid for, but it is so \nvery important that we not claim victory for the NIH because of this. \nIt is a small victory and I accept that. I think it is extremely \nimportant that we understand the NIH is billions of dollars short of \nbeing able to maintain the place they have had in years past.\n  I repeat, they have been losing ground. The last 5 years have been \nextremely tough for them. We need to do better for the National \nInstitutes of Health. We have scientists around our country who want to \ndo good work. They want to devote their lives to medical research, but \nthey are not applying for these grants. So many of them are turned down \nthat they are basically--well, maybe I won't even bother trying.\n  I am pleased to hear the Republican leader move forward. It is \nsomething that is a small step forward to help children who badly need \nhelp in the ways of these diseases, which are so difficult for the \nkids, of course, for the parents and families and certainly our \ncountry.\n  Again, before we leave this issue, I would hope that the \nappropriations process we are going to go through this year will help \nus get money. What we have done today is only an authorization, and the \npublic out there should understand it is only an authorization. Until \nwe have appropriations going, there will be nothing going to pediatric \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health. We have to carry forward \nand not have all of these banner headlines that the kids are going to \nsuddenly get help they deserve. That will not happen until we \nappropriate money for this.\n  I do not object.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2019) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to reiterate what we have done. H.R. 2019, \nwhich will now go to the President for signature--the original author \nis Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the House--will eliminate taxpayer \nfinancing of political party conventions and reprogram savings to \nprovide for a 10-year pediatric research initiative through the Common \nFund administered by the NIH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1492-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1492-S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. President, our friends on the other side who run the Senate spent \na lot of time talking last night. I am not sure what any of it \naccomplished. The reviews seem to be pretty terrible. The AP dubbed the \ntalk-athon a lot of hot air about a lot of hot air and said the \nspeeches were little more than theatrics.\n  Maybe, as some speculate, Senate Democrats were just trying to please \nthe left-coast billionaire who plans to finance so many of their \ncampaigns.\n  The talking Senators didn't really introduce any new legislation. I \ndidn't hear the talking Senators announce votes on bills already \npending before the Senate. They basically just talked and talked and \ntossed out political attacks at a party that doesn't even control the \nDemocratic-run Senate.\n  No wonder the American people have such a low opinion of Congress.\n  The so-called talk-athon perfectly illustrated something else too--\nthe emptiness of today's Washington Democratic majority.\n  I remember a time when Democrats could say with some legitimacy that \nthey were the party for working people. Those days seem to be receding \nfurther and further into the rearview mirror. Because whether it is \naddressing the opportunity gap in the ObamaCare economy or building the \nKeystone Pipeline or last night's whatever that was, Washington \nDemocrats keep opting for the empty political stunt over the \nreasonable, substantive solutions for the middle class.\n  Here is the thing: We need two serious political parties in this \ncountry debating serious ideas. When we see Washington Democrats \nthrowing seriousness out the window like this, it is bad for everybody. \nIf Washington Democrats are actually serious about all of the talk last \nnight, they should follow it with action. The Democrats control the \nSenate. Bring up, bring up the cap-and-tax bill and let's have a \ndebate, put it on the agenda, and let's debate it.\n  As the AP noted, despite all of the bravado, Democratic leaders made \nit clear they have no plan to bring a Democratic climate bill to the \nfloor this year. So what was all the talking about?\n  Our friends on the other side set up the agenda. Call up the bill. \nThe reason they won't isn't because of obstructionism or whatever else \nthey might want to claim. It is because too many Members of their own \nparty would vote against it.\n  Remember, Washington Democrats couldn't even pass that bill when they \ncontrolled the Senate with a filibuster-proof majority back in 2009 or \n2010. More importantly, the American people don't want a national \nenergy tax that would make their utility bills even higher than they \nalready are.\n  Look. Americans have widely differing opinions about how Washington \nshould be approaching environmental policy. That much is very clear. \nBut one thing we should all be able to agree upon is this: Imposing \nmassive restrictions upon our own economy, devastating the lives of our \nown mining\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nfamilies, and imposing higher energy bills on our own seniors makes \nabout zero sense, while huge carbon emitters such as China and India \ncontinue to ramp up energy consumption.\n  Global carbon emissions would hardly be affected anyway, but millions \nof lives here certainly would be. The American middle class would be \ndeeply and adversely affected.\n  Left, right, and center, we should all be able to agree this is \nsimply nonsensical. What we should all be working for is an ``all of \nthe above'' energy strategy that will utilize more of our domestic \nresources to create jobs and meet America's energy needs. It is a smart \nand focused approach that accommodates both our economy and our \nenvironment, and it is one that Republicans strongly support and \nDemocrats should as well.\n  Democrats should also work with us to pass the legislation that would \nallow Congress to actually vote on environmental regulation to ensure \nWashington's rules strike the right balance between protecting the \nenvironment and creating jobs. That legislation is so important to my \nhome State of Kentucky.\n  Case in point. I spent this past weekend with hundreds of coal miners \nand their families at a rally in eastern Kentucky, and I heard from \nthem how the administration's war on coal is hurting so many who \nstruggle every day just to get by. It is a war that is taking away hope \nand destroying jobs.\n  Let's be honest. The most immediate crisis in the Obama era is the \njobs crisis--the jobs crisis. It always has been. If only our friends \non the other side were willing to talk a little less and work with us a \nlittle more. There is so much we could get done on that front. There is \nso much we could be doing to create jobs and grow the middle class \ntoday. We could build a Keystone Pipeline that would create thousands \nof American jobs right away. We could increase U.S. exports and expand \nAmerican jobs with trade legislation. We could reform our tax and \nregulatory structures to free small businesses so they can grow and \nhire and enrich their communities. And we could pass the dozens of \nHouse-passed jobs bills just sitting on the majority leader's desk--so \nmany that even House Democrats are starting to complain. These are the \nkinds of things we could get done once Washington Democrats show they \nare ready to work with us.\n  Talk is cheap. We know that. And America's middle class is tired of \nall the talk. They want action. Let's provide it on jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the very unfortunate events in \nUkraine in the headlines and the Ukrainian people close to our hearts, \nI rise today to speak to a topic that has significance not only for \nthat European crisis and for our own well-being but also bearing a \nlittle bit on the longer term subject of climate change, which, of \ncourse, was a big discussion here last night.\n  This morning I am speaking to the American energy renaissance and its \nbroader benefits to us all.\n  Today American technology and know-how are delivering energy \nabundance, keeping energy affordable, enabling energy to be cleaner \nthan the next most likely alternative, permitting us to rely on ever \nmore diverse energy sources, and, finally, improving energy security \nfor our people here in this country and around the world.\n  America's overall production of nearly every type of energy is \nrising. The efficiency of just about everything--whether it is our \nvehicles or whether it is our buildings--is increasing. And in \ncomparing our supply with our demand, we are rapidly approaching a \nself-sufficiency rate of 90 percent. The American energy revolution has \ngenerated a variety of welcome benefits. It is creating jobs. It has \ngenerated revenues. It has helped reduce both energy prices and price \nvolatility. And as our Nation imports less, the simple fact is there is \nmore energy available for others. That, in turn, is creating the kinds \nof supply conditions in the world oil market that allow all of us to \ndeal with the bad actors from a position of relative strength.\n  There was a recent essay in Foreign Affairs which argued that energy \nhas been viewed as a strategic liability in the United States since \nback in the 1970s. Now energy is becoming a strategic asset--a \nstrategic asset--and one that can boost the U.S. economy and grant \nWashington newfound leverage around the world. It is really hard to \ndisagree with that.\n  The question then becomes, What will we do with this strategic asset? \nHow will we use our newfound position? There was a survey of responses \nto Russia's disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty, and of those prudent \nareas where the United States might go. Energy is clearly among the \nmost major strategic assets we possess. How we use it to bring about \ngeopolitical stability can really define our leadership in the world.\n  Our first real challenge as a nation is how to keep this American \nresurgence going. There are two specific areas where we have to make \nsome decisions; that is, whether to grant access to new lands and new \nmarkets, and that will go a long way in determining whether we actually \ndo that.\n  As I noted, America's total energy production has increased \ndramatically in recent years, but within those numbers there is a \nserious dichotomy. Nearly the entire oil and gas production resurgence \nhere in the United States has occurred on State and private lands, not \nthe millions of acres managed by the Federal Government. Despite the \ndiscussion of all of the above and no small amount of credit taken by \nthe administration, combined carbon fuel production on Federal lands \nactually fell from 2008 to 2012. That is a disappointing trend which, \nin my view, needs to be reversed.\n  Consider, for example, the opportunity we are missing in my State of \nAlaska. Thirty years ago, in March 1984, Alaskan crude oil production \nstood at 1.6 million barrels per day. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System \nhad been completed just a decade earlier. There were debates over \nopening new areas to production and even allowing exports of crude oil \nfrom the State, but the Federal Government did not act at that time. It \ndid not seize Alaska's best and most obvious opportunities. Production \npeaked at 2.1 million barrels per day in March 1988. It has been on \ngeneral decline ever since then. Alaska's production has dipped below \nthe half million barrels per day marker several times since 2012. This \nis a fall of nearly 75 percent from its high.\n  Back home we keep talking about a pipeline that is less than half \nfull. The difference is not only geography, it is also policy. Our \nFederal policies are not working as they should. State policies, \ncombined with private sector inventiveness, powerful as they are, \ncannot overcome the Federal barriers. In North Dakota, where we see a \nbooming energy market, only 4 percent of that State is federally held. \nIn Texas, it is just 2 percent of Federal lands. In Alaska, 62 percent \nof our lands are Federal, and most of our untapped resources are within \nthese Federal areas.\n  Alaska's falling production is a missed opportunity--a missed \nopportunity--to create jobs, to generate revenues, to stabilize world \nenergy prices, to diversify world energy supplies. And it is not the \nonly place in America where potential growth is going unrealized. We \nare passing up tremendous opportunities off of our Atlantic coast, in \nthe eastern Gulf of Mexico, and in the Rocky Mountains West. We also \nhave increasingly burdensome regulations that slow the pace of \ndevelopment in the Federal lands that are open.\n  All of this highlights the need to reexamine our Federal energy \npolicies and really reorient them for a new century.\n  That leads us to the subject of exports.\n  Back in January I laid out the case for why we need to renovate the \narchitecture of U.S. energy trade. We have substantial opportunities \nfor exports of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, natural gas \nliquids, renewable technology, nuclear technology, and even crude oil. \nI have called for the lifting of the de facto prohibition on crude oil \nexports as a preemptive measure. I say what we need to do is lift it to \nprevent\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nfuture losses of production and jobs when our trade restrictions \ninevitably collide with this surge of light tight oil and condensate \nproduction that comes out. The conversation I hoped to frame last year \nin January when I submitted my ``Energy 20/20'' report is really very \nwell underway.\n  My point is that we must increase the value of energy as an American \nstrategic asset for global security and price stability.\n  I wish to say a couple of words--maybe more than a couple but a few \nwords--about climate change. Many groups have formed to go on the \noffensive to ``wake Congress up'' on the issue of climate. They want to \nforce the Nation to talk about this subject no matter what the issue of \nthe day might be. Unfortunately, they also seem to want to blame \nRepublican Members and somehow also to adopt policies that this body \nhas rejected year after year. So much of the climate change \nconversation seems to be defined by old ideas that have been rejected. \nIt seems that if one is not supportive of yet another regulatory \nedifice, either through cap and trade, a carbon tax, or letting the EPA \nexpand its authority without any checks by the people's representatives \nin Congress, then somehow or other one is against the environment. I \nreject that.\n  I want to see greater balance. I know we can achieve it, and I think \nit is important that, again, we reframe the conversation. I think \nfinding agreement on environmental policy is hard, but it is not \nimpossible. I think what we need to do is kind of pull back and change \nthe conversation we are having.\n  What I want to remind my colleagues of is that part of the opposition \nI have had to some of the ideas I have heard from folks is based on \nwhat those policies would mean for our affordability of energy. Here I \nmean not just for Americans who are energy insecure, including \nresidents in my State and in some of our most remote areas who already \nface exorbitant energy costs, but also the 1.3 billion people across \nthe globe with no reliable access to electricity. Worldwide--\nworldwide--families are struggling to attain the basic necessities of \nlife. Although many portray climate change as our most pressing moral \nissue, I would suggest it is but one of many. Energy poverty and energy \ninsecurity are others, and ones that we simply cannot ignore and we \nshould certainly not make worse.\n\n  Another part of my opposition to cap and trade or a carbon tax is \nbased on what we have seen in Europe as compared to what has actually \nhappened here in the United States. Without climate legislation, but \nwith the advent of increased domestic production here through shale gas \nproduction, our greenhouse gas emissions are now 11 percent below our \nrate of emissions in 2005. Yet our friends across the Atlantic, who \nactually did pass cap and trade several years ago, haven't exactly seen \nthe expected results. In the face of weak growth, high unemployment, \nand high debt, some European nations are now dialing back the extremely \nexpensive subsidies they have offered and, at the same time, many of \nour NATO allies are clamoring for the cheap and the abundant natural \ngas that we are now producing on our State and our private lands, and \nthey are importing our abundant and affordable coal.\n  The unfolding situation in Ukraine also highlights the compelling \nimportance of energy security--something that neither a carbon tax, cap \nand trade or any climate bill we have seen in the Senate has properly \naccounted for.\n  Then there is the approach the President seems to want to take. \nEarlier this year he threatened to use his regulatory authority to \nregulate greenhouse gases if Congress failed to act. It is really quite \na choice here. He suggests either to pass legislation that we don't \nlike or he will enact regulations that we don't like, either way to be \ncarried out under the Clean Air Act, just not according to the Clean \nAir Act.\n  It is difficult to consider really whether this is a serious offer. \nWhat we can say, though, is this threat and the rulemakings that will \nfollow is contrary--contrary--to what our forefathers envisioned. \nExecutive authority foregoes the benefits and protections of a \nlegislative process and it curbs the debate that is needed to ensure \nfair and balanced policy, and particularly in this area where we need \nto ensure they are fair and balanced policies.\n  To effectively combat climate change we have to safeguard our \neconomy. Prosperity is key to the resources that we will need to make \nprogress. The Nation has to pursue all forms of energy and stress \nenergy security. We cannot exclusively count on renewables to achieve a \nlow carbon environment. Emission free nuclear energy has to be part of \nthe solution. Technology must play a role in reaching the goals that we \nset for our country.\n  Finally, as we discuss the issues and the approaches to these issues, \nwe have to do so with humility, keenly aware of the unintended \nconsequences that could be worse than no action at all. Climate change \nis a global issue that requires global acknowledgment of the issue and \nglobal action. But through it all we must be deeply concerned and \nalways aware about the impacts of our actions on the individual family.\n  I spend a lot of time in the rural parts of my State. We don't even \ncall them rural; we use the terminology ``bush'' because it is just so \nremote, and these are areas where the only way to access the \ncommunities is either by air or by boat, up the river by barge. \nSupplies are brought in two times a year, if you live on the river \nsystem. You look around and you may be able to see the impact of \nclimate change, and that is an awareness the people in this region \nhave, but first and foremost, these people need to be able to live. \nThis is where they have lived for thousands of years.\n  When you appreciate the costs they are paying for their energy right \nhere and right now, I can't support anything that is going to increase \nthe energy cost for the people in my State who are already paying--\nsome--close to 50 percent of their income for fuel to stay warm in the \nwintertime.\n  I have one letter here that I received just last week from a village \nby the name of Kwigillingok. This is an area out in the coastal \nvillages region. In this letter from the tribal council they state:\n\n       The current cost of heating fuel is 6.02 per gallon and \n     gasoline at 6.52.\n\n  If I were to suggest to the fine people in Kwigillingok that in order \nto arrest what we may be seeing with increased emissions around the \nglobe that their energy prices are going to double, that the cost of \ntheir heating fuel is going to go from $6.02 per gallon to $12, how \nwill these people live?\n  We have to be aware of the energy insecurity, the energy poverty in \nfar too many places in this country and truly around the world.\n  So as we discuss these very important issues about energy and how we \ndo right by all, again let us do so with a level of humility and a \nlevel of respect for people all throughout our Nation.\n  I see that my colleague from Texas is here, another fine producing \nState. In fact, Texas is a State that is really doing quite well right \nnow when it comes to our energy and our energy resources. Through the \nefforts of States such as Texas, North Dakota, and California we are \nseeing a true resurgence in our energy production, and I think an \nopportunity for us as a Nation to again not only provide for our energy \nsecurity as a Nation but to provide for security and stability on the \nglobal scene as well.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for her wise words. I \nwasn't here for all of her remarks, but I was able to hear the \npercentage of her State that is owned by the Federal Government, which \nis extraordinary. I think she cited roughly 2 percent in Texas. That \nwas a deal we cut in 1845, and it turned out it was a pretty good deal \nbecause Texas lands are overwhelmingly private lands rather than \ngovernment lands.\n  I think part of the point she was making as well is that while we \nhave seen a resurgence of activity on private land, particularly when \nit comes to the shale gas, and on oil plays on public lands we haven't \nseen that same sort of productivity. If the Federal Government would \nsimply take the same approach that the private sector is taking when it \ncomes to developing these God-given natural resources, it could really \nboost our economy further and lower unemployment.\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n  So I thank my colleague for her wise words this morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1495-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1495-S1496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk about a number of subjects \nstarting, of course, with the fact that millions of Americans have lost \ntheir health insurances because of the unintended consequences of the \nAffordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n  We also know that in addition to losing the coverage they had, which \nthey were told they could keep, many have now been forced to pay higher \npremiums. The sticker shock from that has been something we have been \nreading a lot about. But whether there is sticker shock because of the \nhigher premiums, many people have been finding that their deductibles \nare huge, making them effectively self-insured up to $5,000 for their \nhealth care costs, definitely not something they were promised as a \nresult of ObamaCare.\n  We also know that roughly 10 million people, about 10\\1/2\\ million \npeople, remain unemployed in America and that 3.8 million of them have \nbeen unemployed for more than 6 months. Since the recession has ended--\nand, of course, a recession is, technically speaking, two consecutive \nquarters of negative growth--I think, if asked, most Americans today \nfeel as though we are still in a recession because of what is happening \nto them personally. We know that since the recession ended, median \nhousehold income--one measure of economic health in the country--has \ngone down by $2,500. So at the same time people are experiencing higher \ncosts for health care, for groceries, for gasoline, and other \nnecessities of life, they are seeing that their median household income \nhas declined by $2,500--a double whammy.\n  According to a Joint Economic Committee analysis, if the Obama \neconomic recovery had been as strong as an average post-1960 recovery, \nwe would currently have millions more private sector jobs.\n  I had the pleasure this last weekend of hearing a fascinating debate \nwith Larry Summers, economic adviser and former president of Harvard \nUniversity--a brilliant economist--and another brilliant economist, \nSenator Phil Gramm, who taught at Texas A Senator Gramm was making \nthe point that if we had had a typical recovery after a recession, it \nwould have been a V-shaped recovery. We did not get that. The economy \ncontinues to grow slowly, unusually slowly, and they were both \nexploring the reasons for that. A lot has to do with uncertainty about \nthe role of the Federal Government when it comes to taxes, when it \ncomes to regulation, and when it comes to our escalating national \ndebt--now over $17 trillion--and what that might mean in the future.\n  But add all this up and Americans are continuing to feel increasingly \npessimistic about the state of our economy, the state of their personal \nhealth care relationships with their doctors and hospitals, and the \nfuture of the country. That is something all of us ought to be \nprofoundly concerned about.\n  Yet rather than promote real health care reform that actually deals \nwith the unaffordability of health coverage or something that will get \nthe economy growing again, my friends across the aisle, many of them, \nspent last night--all night--talking about climate change. That is \nright, climate change.\n  So the message to millions of people out of work or who have lost \ntheir health coverage or to people who are living from paycheck to \npaycheck because median household income has actually declined is that \nwhat America really needs right now is more taxes and more regulation \nand the big government that goes along with it.\n  It is easy to see why many people think Washington is just out of \ntouch with the concerns of average hardworking American families, and \nlast night was an example. It is hard to square the message with the \ngenuine concern for the middle class and middle-class prosperity. I \nmean, if we are really concerned about hardworking American families \nworking from paycheck to paycheck just to make ends meet, I doubt we \nwould have an all-night debate on climate change.\n  If my friends across the aisle really did believe that job creation \nshould be our top priority, they wouldn't have wasted precious time \nwith last night's political stunt. For that matter, they wouldn't be \nopposing the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would single-handedly create \nthousands of well-paying American jobs.\n  I realize that many people have good-faith concerns about the long-\nterm implications of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Over the next \nthree decades worldwide emissions are indeed projected to surge. But \nthat has almost nothing to do with the United States and almost \neverything to do with developing countries such as China. As a matter \nof fact, the ranking member of the energy committee, the Senator from \nAlaska, and certainly the Senator from Wyoming know this very well. One \nof the reasons why carbon emissions in the United States are going down \nis because of the natural gas renaissance we have seen--because of \nunconventional shale gas exploration in places such as Texas and all \naround the country. So we are finding ways to reduce carbon emissions \nfor those who are worried about those, as a result of taking advantage \nof the resources we have here in the United States, together with the \ninnovative technology that is used to develop it.\n  Those of us who oppose bigger, more intrusive government in the form \nof cap and trade legislation or higher taxes such as carbon taxes or \nother job-killing greenhouse gas regulations are not denialists. I \nprefer to say we are realists.\n  We understand America's contributions to global emissions over the \ncoming decades will be relatively minuscule. We understand the economic \ncosts of President Obama's regulations through the Environmental \nProtection Agency would vastly outweigh the environmental benefit.\n  So why do they want to put a big wet blanket on the economy and on \nthe aspirations and dreams of hard-working families in order to pursue \npolicies in which the negative will vastly outweigh the positive \nbenefit to American families?\n  In fact, the Obama EPA itself has admitted its proposed greenhouse \ngas rule would not have a notable impact on U.S. carbon dioxide \nemissions until the year 2022.\n  I would also note, despite having Members of his party talk about \nclimate change all night--which is all it was, talk--there is no \nlegislation they are offering, nor will the majority leader, who \ncontrols the agenda of the Senate, bring legislation to the floor to \nactually vote on it. So it is just talk or, perhaps I can say, it was \njust a lot of hot air.\n  Our colleagues across the aisle--including the majority leader who \ncontrols the agenda of the floor in the Senate--seem to be content \nletting the President use his pen and phone, skirting the legislative \nprocess, not engaging with Congress to try to do things which actually \nare the priorities of the American people but instead to rely on \nunelected EPA bureaucrats. I could be surprised, but I would be \nsurprised to learn if the consensus in America wouldn't be that we \nshould be focusing on policies which create jobs, rather than destroy \njobs and punish families in return for meager or nonexistent benefits.\n  Speaking of destroying jobs and punishing families, the Congressional \nBudget Office--which is the official budgetary scorekeeper for \nCongress--recently estimated the President's proposal to raise the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour would actually destroy up to 1 million \njobs.\n  I believe sometimes here in Washington people think those who \nactually create jobs can absorb regulations, taxes, and other economic \nburdens, together with the uncertainty many of those policies cause, \nand it will have no impact on their ability to continue to create jobs, \ngrow jobs or to grow the economy. But the Congressional Budget Office \nhas stated what should perhaps be intuitive, which is, if you raise the \ncost of doing business on businesses, they are going to have to find \nsomeplace to cut.\n  What that means is they are going to have to cut more people from \ntheir jobs. They estimated up to 1 million people would lose their job \nif we raised\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nthe minimum wage 40 percent to $10.10 an hour.\n  Remember, in the President's State of the Union Message he said a \nminimum wage hike like that would help low-income families. It is \ncertainly a mystery to me how it would help a low-income family who is \nrelying on a wage earner to provide income when they end up losing \ntheir job as a result of the policy.\n  So the President's definition of ``help'' is unique, to say the \nleast, because any policy which destroys up to 1 million jobs would be \nan absolute disaster for low-income families.\n  The President also made his pitch for a higher minimum wage in the \ncontext of his concern about income inequality. He claims to be greatly \nconcerned about income inequality. Yet his policies actually threaten \nto make it worse.\n  But don't take my word for it. A news report from a major labor union \nargues that in its current form, the President's health care law will \n``heighten the inequality that the administration seeks to produce.''\n  These are not political adversaries of our President and his party. \nThese are supporters of the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--who have \nnow said in its current form, unless changed, the Affordable Care Act--\nor ObamaCare--will heighten the inequality the administration seeks to \nreduce.\n  The report also notes that ObamaCare ``threatens the middle class \nwith higher premiums, loss of hours, and a shift from part-time work \nand less comprehensive coverage.''\n  I think those would be very troubling words to the President and his \nallies who passed the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare--but so far \nthey have fallen on deaf ears.\n  Again, this report just in terms of its credibility was not issued by \nsome Republican or conservative organization which was opposed to \nObamaCare from the beginning. It was issued by a labor union which \nsupported ObamaCare which has now found that what was promised has not \nactually been delivered in terms of its implication.\n  So what union members and their families are learning the hard way is \nthe promise of ObamaCare is very different from the reality. We were \npromised ObamaCare would actually expand coverage, it would reduce \ncosts, it would help our economy, all without disrupting existing \nhealth care arrangements.\n  In reality, the law has forced millions to lose their coverage and \nforced millions to pay higher premiums or higher deductibles, \neffectively being self-insured. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects it will effectively shrink America's labor force by 2.5 \nmillion full-time workers over the next decade.\n  Remarkably, the administration now wants us to believe it is actually \na good thing so many people are reducing their work hours in order to \nkeep their government-mandated health care. For example, chief White \nHouse economist Jason Furman has said working less to keep ObamaCare \nbenefits ``might be a better choice and a better option than what they \nhad before.''\n  Of course, they don't have a choice to keep what they had before \nbecause they have been forced into ObamaCare. If you don't buy the \ngovernment-mandated insurance, then you are going to be fined by your \nfriendly Federal Government.\n  But think about it: The White House chief economist is celebrating \nthe possibility of a dramatic decline in American work hours. I would \nremind Mr. Furman that America's labor force participation is already \nat historic lows. It is as low as it has been for 30 years. In other \nwords, the percentage of people looking for work in America is at a 30-\nyear low already, and Mr. Furman is celebrating the further depressing \nimpact of ObamaCare on work in America.\n  All else being equal, a reduction in work hours means a reduction in \neconomic growth. It certainly means a reduction in income for the \npeople working. We know a further reduction of economic growth will \nmake it harder to create new jobs, improve living standards, and \nachieve broad-based prosperity--something I know we all hope for in \nAmerica.\n  This is a dangerous cycle, and it is definitely not something we \nshould be celebrating. It is something we should be fixing.\n  A truly compassionate agenda--not one that focuses on things which \nare largely irrelevant to the lives of Americans working families, but \na truly compassionate agenda would seek to improve opportunity rather \nthan encourage dependency. A truly compassionate agenda would place a \nmuch higher value on the dignity and self-reliance of American workers \nby making sure they have jobs.\n  For that matter, a truly compassionate agenda would aim to dismantle \nObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered alternatives which \nencourage work and encourage job creation.\n  The type of agenda I have described is pretty much the exact opposite \nof what we have seen over the last 5 years, and the results speak for \nthemselves. There is absolutely no reason we have to accept the status \nquo. With the right mix of economic policies, America can turn this \nship around and restore the strong growth rates and robust job creation \nwe enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s. We will on this side of the aisle \ncontinue to promote such policies, and we look forward to working with \nour colleagues across the aisle when they finally come around to the \nrealization the path we are heading on now is not one the American \npeople are happy with or that they have to settle for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Texas \nfor his comments, and I agree with his concerns. These are the same \nconcerns I hear at home in Wyoming.\n  I was in Buffalo, WY, at a health fair this past weekend. Hundreds of \npeople from the community turned out. They have concerns about the \nhealth care law. They have concerns about their take-home pay. They \nhave concerns about their jobs. And Wyoming is an energy State.\n  I am the only Republican Senator who is both on the energy committee \nas well as the Environment & Public Works Committee, and so I think \nabout the three Es: energy security, economic growth, and environmental \nstewardship. We need energy security for our country, economic growth \nfor our citizens, as well as to protect the environment and be good \nstewards of the land. I believe in Wyoming we continue to do all of \nthose.\n  The American people have made it very clear that what they want from \nWashington is a focus on jobs and the economy. This is not what I have \nheard, though, over the last 24 hours from the Democrats on the other \nside of the aisle. The American people I talk to want us to make it \neasier for them to get back to work, to provide for their families, to \nget the kids back to school so they can go off to work. People's jobs \nare linked to their identity, to their dignity, to their self-worth. I \nthink more of these regulations make it harder for people to have a \njob, to keep a job, and to provide for their families.\n  So we had an all-night talkathon, and what did it accomplish? To me, \nthe only accomplishment was a waste of time and more hot air. It seemed \nto be a dog-and-pony show to satisfy their big liberal donors.\n  The majority leader spent part of the weekend in California with a \nbig liberal donor who has promised $100 million to the Democrats on the \nissue they decided to hold an entire night talkathon on. They had five \nor six Democratic Senators at this man's home in California basically \nsaying: We want your money. We want your money. This is what the \nDemocrats did.\n  So they put on an entire dog-and-pony show, showing that Democrats \nand their leadership--including the majority leader--is beholden to \nthat liberal money that wants to call the tune for this Senate.\n  It is astonishing this would happen in the United States; that the \nmajority leader of the Senate would take a number of Democratic \nSenators to California specifically to go to the home of somebody who \nsays: I want to give $100 million to promote what he said was his \nagenda--his agenda--and make the majority leader dance to that tune. \nThis is what we saw for the last 24 hours.\n  The majority leader could call a vote tomorrow--he could call it \ntoday--on a\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nnational energy tax. I think everybody on this side of the aisle is \nready and prepared to vote on that. But for most of these folks, they \nwanted to just talk all night. They don't actually want to do anything. \nThey just want to talk.\n  The Democrats control the agenda. They control the majority. They \nhave changed the rules in terms of approving nominees. They have it all \nlined up.\n  It is astonishing that the most vulnerable Democrats who are running \nfor office this year didn't show their faces last night. They wanted \nnothing at all to do with this.\n  So we hear about regulations which are going to crush jobs and make \nit harder for people to go to work. As a doctor having taken care of \npeople who are out of work for a long time--and I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer knows people like this as well--I know that being out of work \nimpacts their identity, the way they view themselves, and their human \ndignity. In fact, it affects their health as well.\n  As a doctor, I have put together an entire report: ``Red Tape Making \nAmericans Sick,'' a report on the health impacts of high unemployment. \nStudies show EPA rules--the rules, regulations, and redtape--cost \nAmericans not just their jobs but also their health.\n  For people who are chronically unemployed, we know there are higher \nrates of cancer, higher rates of suicide, higher rates of heart \ndisease, higher rates of stroke, and higher rates of abuse--whether it \nis substance abuse, spousal abuse, child abuse. All of these add to \nhospital visits, premature deaths, all in communities where there is \nhigh joblessness. It is because of regulations which continue to come \nout of the EPA which are burdensome, which are expensive, which are \ntime consuming. The costs are real, the benefits are theoretical, but \nyet this is what the Democrats on the other side of the aisle were \ntalking about all night last night.\n  So I would say, instead of spending 24 hours on extreme regulations \nwhich result in a national energy tax, Democrats ought to be listening \nto the American people and focus on jobs and on the economy.\n  It is too bad Democrats would rather talk about a national energy tax \nfor 24 hours than vote on the President's budget, a budget which never \nbalances. Then vote on the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline proposal \nwhich would bring, according to the State Department, 42,000 more \nindividuals in our country into the workforce or even discuss and vote \non other job proposals.\n  They don't want to talk about job creation ideas. I will continue to \ndo so in terms of the Keystone Pipeline and in terms of exporting \nliquefied natural gas. We have an abundance in the United States which \nwould be helpful to our economy, helpful to jobs, as well as helpful in \nour foreign policy as we work toward not just energy security but \nglobal security as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Madam President, I want to compliment my colleagues from \nWyoming and Texas for talking about the issues that are important to \nthe American people. People in this country care about jobs and the \neconomy. I think one of the reasons there were not more Democratic \nSenators down here last night is because a lot of them, as some pointed \nout, hit the snooze button, didn't want to come down here and talk \nabout an issue which they realize ranked very low in people's \nassessment of what is really important in their daily lives. I think \nthat is probably why most Americans, by and large, tuned out the all-\nnight session we had on the floor.\n  We did have a number of Senate Democrats who came down and engaged in \nwhat they referred to as a talkathon on climate change. I don't know \nwho coined the term ``talkathon'' to describe the event, but it is a \nperfect term. It really fits, since the event was all talk and no \naction.\n  In fact, writing ahead of the talkathon, USA Today noted, and I \nquote:\n\n       The Democratic effort is cause for some confusion, because \n     these Senators are calling for action in a chamber they \n     control, but without any specific legislation to offer up for \n     a vote or any timetable for action this year.\n\n  Well, that is exactly right. Last night's filibuster was not designed \nto advance any legislation, nor was it a protest about the lack of \nlegislation. After all, the Democrats control the Chamber and they can \nbring up a bill any time they want. Although last night's event may \nhave had all the trappings of significant Senate action, it was nothing \nbut talk.\n  If the Democrats really think government action on climate change is \nso important, one would assume last night they would have used it to \ndebate a bill or try to persuade their leadership to bring one up on \nthe floor. But they didn't, because it is an election year and \nDemocrats are already deeply worried about their election prospects, \nand they know very well the American people do not like the climate \nchange legislation they have offered up. The climate change bills \nDemocrats have proposed almost invariably involve tax hikes that would \ndrive the cost of energy sky high for ordinary families and kill jobs, \nall for extremely dubious environmental gains. The last time Congress \ndebated the cap-and-trade bill was in 2009. That bill was estimated to \ndestroy 2.5 million jobs. Perhaps that is why several Democrats who \nrepresent energy-producing States didn't make it to last night's \ntalkathon. They must be tired of defending more job-destroying \npolicies.\n  For families who are already struggling with reduced income and high \nhealth care costs that have characterized the Obama economy for the \npast 5 years, increased energy prices and more job losses are the last \nthing they want to face. Democrats know that climate change legislation \nis a nonstarter in an election year, but they still have their radical \nenvironmental base to worry about, the same base that is pushing the \nPresident not to approve the Keystone Pipeline despite five separate \nenvironmental reviews that found its impact on the environment would be \nnegligible.\n  Last night's talkathon, designed for maximum media exposure, allowed \nDemocrats to assure their donors that they are focused on climate \nchange without actually having to do anything, anything that would be \ndifficult or politically damaging, such as going on the record and \nactually voting for a specific bill.\n  Last month Gallup released a poll on America's top concerns. Climate \nchange didn't even make the top 10. Jobs and the economy, on the other \nhand, came in at the very top, not surprisingly. The American people \nhave a very good assessment of what is important. Gallup polling shows \nthat those two issues have been among Americans' top five concerns for \nmost of the past 6 years. Despite this, however, Democrats have shown \nvery little inclination to take real action on the economy. In fact, \nmost of their policies are making our economic situation worse.\n  The policy that is doing the most economic damage is ObamaCare. Any \nway you look at it, ObamaCare means bad economic news for just about \neverybody. Millions of Americans have had the plans they like canceled, \nand far too many of them have found their ObamaCare alternative will \ncost more and offer them less.\n  Families around the country have enrolled in exchange plans that have \nleft them wondering how they are going to be able to afford the plan's \n$10,000 and $12,000 deductibles. Low-income seniors enrolled in \nMedicare Advantage are wondering how they will afford the premium hikes \nand the benefit reductions that will soon hit them, thanks to \nObamaCare's Medicare cuts. Eleven million small business workers are \nnot sure how a bill that promised more affordable health care is \nactually raising--raising--their health care costs.\n  Then there are the businesses that are changing their plans to hire \nnew workers because ObamaCare's mandates and fees mean they cannot \nafford to expand. The workers who are having their hours cut because \nObamaCare means their employer cannot afford to keep them on as full-\ntime workers. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated \nObamaCare will mean 2.5 million fewer full-time workers and \napproximately $1 trillion in lower wages. That is a lot of lost \neconomic opportunity.\n  But you do not have to take my word for it, because Republicans are \nnot the only people who are worried about\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nObamaCare's effects on the economy and on the middle class. A lot of \nthe President's allies are worried too. Democrats who are running in \nred States are running scared and are starting to talk about the need \nto amend the law.\n  And then there are the unions. Unions are, of course, historically \nDemocratic supporters and they were instrumental in getting ObamaCare \npassed in the first place and helping to get the President reelected. \nNow unions are rethinking their support. At the end of last week UNITE \nHERE, which is a huge union with over one-quarter of a million members \nfrom all over the hospitality industry, published a white paper on \nObamaCare which they called ``The Irony of ObamaCare: Making Inequality \nWorse.''\n  What does the document say? Well, it says what Republicans have been \nsaying all along, that ObamaCare is going to make things much worse for \nthe middle class. I want to quote from the first page:\n\n       Ironically, the administration's own signature healthcare \n     victory poses one of the most immediate challenges to \n     redressing inequality. . . . without smart fixes, the \n     Affordable Care Act threatens the middle class with higher \n     premiums, loss of hours, and a shift to part-time work and \n     less comprehensive coverage.\n\n  That is from a white paper put out by one of the Nation's major \nunions. In 12 pages that document demolishes the administration's claim \nthat the bill will help the middle class. It takes aim at the \nadministration's ridiculous assertion that the law will not discourage \nbusiness expansion or result in employers cutting hours. Worker hours, \nthe union points out, have already been cut at nearly a third of U.S. \nfranchise businesses.\n  Other businesses have chosen to replace full-time workers with part \ntime workers, and still others have announced their intention of \nstaying below 50 employees to avoid being hit by the worst of the law's \nmandates. The union also points out the likelihood of employers dumping \nemployee health plans thanks to the law's requirements, leaving \nemployees to obtain health care in the exchanges.\n  Here is what the union has to say about dropped employees, and again \nI quote:\n\n       For dropped employees, being pushed onto the exchanges will \n     mean a major loss of income for health benefits. Families \n     moving to the exchanges may lose between 4 percent and 25 \n     percent of income to maintain equivalent benefits.\n\n  Again, that is from the union white paper on ObamaCare. Major loss of \nincome or health benefits, families within the exchanges may lose \nbetween 4 and 25 percent of income--between 4 percent and 25 percent of \nincome.\n  We are not talking about rich families here. We are talking about \nfamilies who are making $40,000 or $50,000 or $60,000 a year. Even a 4-\npercent income loss would make a huge dent in these families' budgets. \nA 25-percent income loss for a family making that amount of money would \nbe devastating.\n  Finally, the union concludes by pointing out a study in the Brookings \nInstitution--again, not exactly a bastion of conservatism--that shows \nthat those making below $25,000 will get some benefit of the Affordable \nCare Act. But those right above them, families with incomes of $20,000 \nto $38,000, will lose income. ``Only in Washington,'' the report \nconcludes, ``could asking the bottom of the middle class to finance \nhealth care for the poorest families be seen as reducing inequality.''\n  Again, that is a quote from that report by UNITE HERE labor union.\n  I want to remind everyone this is not a Republican document. It is a \ndocument produced by some of President Obama's biggest supporters. In \nfact, UNITE HERE was actually the first union to endorse then-Senator \nObama in 2008. So this isn't an organization seeking to damage the \nPresident politically or to provide Republicans with talking points. \nBut like so many Americans around the country, UNITE HERE has been \nforced to an inescapable conclusion, and that conclusion is that \nObamaCare just isn't working. It is doing the opposite of what it was \nintended to do. It is making health care more expensive for families. \nIt is discouraging employees from hiring. It is reducing Americans' \nhealth care choices.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. It is reducing Americans' health care choices, and it is \nencouraging employers to cut hours and benefits. Our health care system \nmay have needed reform, but this was not the way to do it. Even the \nPresident's strongest supporters are having buyers' remorse, and a lot \nof Americans are hurting right now thanks to the President's health \ncare law.\n  As we hear from more Americans, South Dakotans, people all across \nthis country, who are struggling under the law, I hope the Democrats \nhere who I believe privately are rethinking their vote for this law \nwill have the courage to publicly join us in calling for its repeal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1498-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1498-S1499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Last night the majority party had an all-night session talking about \nenergy, but there is no specific proposal coming forward. We are here \nready to vote to do our job representing the American people and \nactually craft a plan, a comprehensive energy plan for this country \nthat works.\n  Since we didn't hear one last night, I thought I would come today and \npropose one. I would like to propose a States-first all-of-the-above \nenergy plan. This isn't new. This is a plan I proposed along with \nothers, my good colleague from South Dakota, my good colleague from \nWyoming who was just here, and others. This is a comprehensive \napproach, a bipartisan approach, and actually specific legislation, a \nnumber of bills that will create a comprehensive plan to not only \nproduce more energy for our country but to create more jobs, to grow \nour economy, to help expand our tax base, so we can reduce the deficit \nand the debt without raising taxes and, maybe most importantly of all, \nactually providing national security so we do not have to import oil \nfrom the Middle East--a specific action plan with legislation drafted \nand introduced that, instead of talking about it here on the Senate \nfloor, let's do it. Let's start voting. Let's pass it. Let's put \nsolutions in place for the American people.\n  Now this is not one big monolithic one-size-fits-all Federal plan, \nFederal approach. Instead, it is a series of bills sponsored, as I say, \nby Members on both sides of the aisle that would truly create a States-\nfirst, all-of-the-above energy approach. It includes measures such as \nmy good colleague from South Dakota just said. Let's approve the \nKeystone Pipeline. The administration has been working on it for 5 \nyears. Maybe they are going to work on it for another 5 years. I don't \nknow. Well, let's approve it here in Congress. Let's act.\n  Another bill, the Dominion Energy and Jobs Act, is a bill I \nintroduced that has already been passed by the House. It is a series of \n13 different pieces of legislation that would help us produce more \nenergy in this country both onshore and off.\n  The Empower States Act is another piece of legislation I put forward \nthat would address hydraulic fracturing which is unleashing new areas \nof energy production in our country, or the coal ash recycling bill, \nthat not only would help us recycle coal ash, but provide better \nstandards to make sure that we are storing ash that is recycled in \nenvironmentally sound ways, addressing a problem that EPA is working \non, and has to come up with a solution by the end of the year. We work \nwith the EPA to come up with a commonsense solution that also \nencourages recycling coal ash to use on highways and buildings and \nother construction, and for other construction purposes. There is the \nDomestic Fuels Act, which is another piece of legislation that not only \nhelps us market traditional fuels at the pump, such as traditional oil \nand gas products, but also renewable fuels, such as biofuels, \nbiodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen, other types of energy that we are working \nto develop--renewable fuels. Let's make it easier to give consumers \nchoice at the pump and more competition that will help reduce their \ncosts.\n\n  This is the same kind of comprehensive plan that we developed in \nNorth\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nDakota when I was Governor. I was a Governor there for 10 years. We \ndeveloped a plan that we called EmPower North Dakota, and of course the \nwhole idea was to unleash the energy resources of our State--all of our \nresources. I am not just talking about oil and gas--traditional sources \nof energy--but all traditional and renewable energy that have truly \nmade our State an energy powerhouse for the country. We did it at the \nState level, and we can do it at the national level.\n  So how does it work? Quite simply, it empowers States to build on \ntheir relative strengths. It does so by giving them the primary role, \nor the primary responsibility, in terms of regulating energy \ndevelopment and growth in their State. That may be oil, gas, nuclear, \nbiofuels, hydro, wind, solar, biomass or whatever else may be an area \nof strength or expertise for their respective State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask the Chair for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  If you think about it, it builds on the very foundation and very \nconcept of how our country works. The United States is the laboratory \nof democracy. The States are the laboratories of democracy. Let's make \nthem the laboratories of energy development in this country. Why not? \nLet's make them the laboratories of energy development in this country, \nwhether it is Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota or \nWyoming. You name it. Different places have different strengths.\n  When it comes to producing energy, let's empower them to produce the \ntype of energy that works best in their respective State. It is \nbipartisan, it is inclusive, and it includes not only the Federal \nGovernment, but it includes the Federal Government in a way where they \nare working with the States and building on the very strength of our \ncountry.\n  I know my time is limited. I will be back later today to talk about \nit some more.\n  I want to leave with this point: It is not just about energy. It is \nabout better environmental stewardship because we unleash the very \ninvestment that drives and deploys the new technology that produces \nmore energy and does so with a better environmental stewardship.\n  It is about a growing economy that creates revenues without raising \ntaxes to help address the deficit and debt. It creates good-paying jobs \nthat we need in this country.\n  It is also about national security. Think about what is going on in \nEurope right now. Is the European Union going to join with us and \nimpose sanctions on Russia? Are they? Do they have the will or are they \nconcerned that 30 percent of all of the natural gas that goes to Europe \ncomes from Russia and half of it goes through the Ukraine?\n  Are they so concerned about their energy future that they are not \nwilling to stand with us to do the things we need to do to make sure \nthat an aggressor like Russia doesn't invade another sovereign country?\n  So energy is very much about national security, and we can be energy \nsecure in this country in very short order with the right approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1499-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1499-S1500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. There are currently 89 judicial vacancies in Federal \ncourts across the country, including four on the eastern court for the \nEastern District of Michigan. Two of these are considered emergency \nvacancies because they have been vacant for over 19 months. With so \nmany vacancies the case backlog isn't getting any smaller. It is a real \nproblem.\n  The good news is that today we have the opportunity to vote to move \nforward on four excellent nominees to fill vacancies in the courts.\n  Our Michigan nominees are highly qualified and represent some of the \nbest legal minds we have. Two of the nominees are sitting judges, one \nnominee is a U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan, and the \nother nominee is currently in private practice at one of Michigan's top \nlaw firms.\n  Throughout the confirmation process, they have all proven to be \nthoughtful and prudent stewards of the law. So not only are they \nexcellent nominees, but they are ready to go to work.\n  The first nominee is Judith Levy. She has served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Eastern District of Michigan since 2000. She was a cum \nlaude graduate at the University of Michigan Law School. She has \nreceived numerous awards for her legal work.\n  Ms. Levy clerked for the Honorable Bernard Friedman, the former chief \njudge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan. He was, in fact, a Reagan appointee.\n  She is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy created more \nthan 18 months ago.\n  Ms. Levy is an excellent nominee. The people of Michigan deserve to \nhave her on the bench, and she will serve with great distinction for \nall of us.\n  Second, we have Judge Laurie Michelson. Judge Michelson has served as \na U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Michigan since 2011.\n  Prior to her appointment to the bench, she spent nearly 18 years in \nprivate practice where she specialized in media law, intellectual \nproperty, and white collar criminal defense.\n  She earned her law degree from Northwestern University in 1992. She \nserved as a law clerk for Judge Cornelia Kennedy on the U.S. court of \nappeals. Judge Kennedy, as you may recall, was selected by President \nReagan for his short list of Supreme Court candidates to replace \nJustice Potter Stewart.\n  Judge Michelson is an excellent nominee, and again the people of \nMichigan deserve to have her on the bench, and she will serve with \ndistinction.\n  Next we have Judge Linda Parker. Judge Linda Parker has served as a \njudge on the Third Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan since 2009. Judge \nParker has served in State and for the Federal Government for over a \ndecade. Before that, she worked in private practice as well.\n  She earned her law degree from George Washington University and began \nher career as a law clerk in the District of Columbia Superior Court.\n  She has been recognized for her commitment to the community through \npro bono legal work and as a board member of an organization that \nprovides assistance to underserved academically gifted children.\n  Judge Parker is also an excellent nominee, and the people of Michigan \nlook forward to her service.\n  Next is Matthew Leitman. Mr. Leitman is a principal at the Law Firm \nof Miller Canfield in Troy, MI, where he handles complex commercial \nlitigation, criminal defense, and appellate matters before both State \nand Federal courts.\n  Prior to joining Miller Canfield in 2004, he spent 10 years in \nprivate practice.\n  He earned his law degree magna cum laude in 1993 from Harvard Law \nSchool and began his career as a clerk to Justice Charles Levin on the \nMichigan Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Leitman's nomination will also fill a judicial emergency vacancy \nwhich has been open for nearly 2 years.\n  Mr. Leitman is also an excellent nominee, and the people of Michigan, \nagain, deserve his service on the bench. We look forward to his service \nand to the service of all four of those nominees that we will be voting \non today.\n  We have four excellent nominees for the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Michigan. They are thoughtful, they are prudent, \nand they are ready to get to work.\n  I encourage and ask that all of my colleagues join together today in \na strong bipartisan vote to be able to move these nominations forward \nand bring them to the floor tomorrow morning for the final vote.\n  We are very pleased with the President's nominees and with their \nqualifications. We are very confident of their service to the courts \nand to the people of Michigan.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\n  Mr. KAINE.

Madam President, I am happy to be on the floor this \nafternoon to give the announcement and the update about the running of \nthe 42nd Iditarod in my State of Alaska. It is an extraordinarily \nfamous and fabulous sporting event where man and dog test the elements \nof a course of almost 1,100 miles beginning in Willow, AK, and going \nall the way to Nome.\n  This year there were 69 teams that started out, and the first team \ncrossed the finish line at 4 a.m. Alaska standard time this morning. It \nwas one of those races that truly came down to almost a photo finish, \nwith the leaders trading off literally in the last several hours. This \nwas a situation we honestly have not seen in quite some time with the \nIditarod.\n  With that buildup, I am pleased to announce that this year Dallas \nSeavey has become the winner of the 42nd running of the Iditarod, \nbeating out Aliy Zirkle by 2 minutes 22 seconds. He and Aliy Zirkle \nbattled it out in the last hour of the race not even understanding that \nthe frontrunner, who had been in place of Aliy and in place of Dallas, \nJeff King, had to scratch because of a ground blizzard that forced him \noff the trail, losing his sled and effectively having to call and ask \nfor assistance. It was a very dramatic ending to a pretty fascinating \nrace.\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\n  The weather has been problematic throughout. We had warm weather \nconditions at the outset of the race, and then to have the weather \nreally be the No. 1 opposition at the end made it something we are \ngoing to be talking about for years.\n  The Presiding Officer has had the opportunity to attend the \nceremonial start of the Iditarod and is familiar with the excitement \nwhen there are 60 to 70 dog teams, mushers, and all their supporters \naround handling the dogs. There were literally 1,000 dogs in the \ndowntown area of Anchorage. It is really quite exciting. It is a \nfabulous way to come to understand the history of the Iditarod but, \nmore importantly, to understand the mindset of some of these mushers \nand the dedication they have to this sport and the passion they have \nfor their dogs.\n  This year I was in the chute, and I like to visit with each of the \nmushers as they are coming down. Dallas Seavey was in the chute, and I \nwas talking to him. He was really excited about the course because he \nsaid: This is going to be fast. This is going to be the quickest course \nwe have seen. It is just perfect for someone like me who is young and \nfit and can stand up on his sled and literally be running next to his \nsled the whole way.\n  Three mushers later is Jeff King, and Jeff is telling me: This race \nis the perfect race for us older guys.\n  Jeff is my age.\n  He said: It is perfect because it takes the maturity and the wisdom \nand having been through a series of Iditarods to know exactly how to \nhandle a course like this.\n  I think both of them were right. We saw the energy and determination \nof young Dallas Seavey 2 years ago. When he won for the first time, he \nwas the youngest musher to win. He demonstrated a level of energy and \ndetermination that truly knocks your socks off. But what Jeff King was \nable to do with his methodical planning and strategy that goes into \nthat race is certainly something to be embraced. And then, of course, \nAliy Zirkle, a 44-year-old woman demonstrating once again that tough, \nindependent female spirit--my gosh, she was in there all the way. This \nis the second year now that she has come in--actually, it is not the \nsecond year she has come in second. She has come in second more times \nthan any other musher out there.\n  Dallas Seavey broke the Iditarod record this morning at 4 a.m. He \ncame in at 8 days, 13 hours, 4 minutes, 19 seconds. He shaved off \nalmost 5 hours from John Baker's previous win back in 2011.\n  There were a lot of firsts and a lot to be celebrated. There are \nstill more mushers out on the trail.\n  When I talked to Dallas about an hour ago to congratulate him, I \nsaid: You must be pooped and ready to go to sleep after the last 8 \ndays.\n  He said: Well, I am going to wait up for my dad.\n  His dad, Mitch Seavey, is in third place at this point in time. We \nexpect him to come across the finish line.\n  I said: Isn't it nice to know that after all the years your dad \nwaited up for you, you get to wait up for your dad before you take a \nbreak?\n  Alaskans are pleased with the outcome. We are happy to celebrate \namazing athletes--both human and canine--doing amazing things in an \namazing State. I am pleased to be able to announce today's results.\n  I thank the indulgence of the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1502-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize \nour Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives who last week \ncast the 50th vote in their effort to dismantle the Affordable Care \nAct--their 50th. I know it is a tradition to give gold in celebration \nof a 50th milestone. I instead would like to gift my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle with a reality check.\n  More specifically, today I would like to talk about a certain group \nof people who arguably stand to lose if their antics continue. So I \nhave come to the floor this afternoon to set the record straight on the \nAffordable Care Act and how it is working for women in America. It is \nnot much of a stretch for me to say the Affordable Care Act is probably \none of the most significant pieces of legislation for women in my \nlifetime. Not because of the battles we fought to get it to the \nPresident's desk, not necessarily because of the size or scope of the \nlaw, but because of the tangible and positive impact it has had and \nwill continue to have on the health and well being of women in America.\n  Four years ago health insurance companies could deny women care due \nto so-called preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or being a victim \nof domestic violence. Four years ago women were permitted to be legally \ndiscriminated against when it came to insurance premiums and were often \npaying more for coverage than men. Four years ago women did not have \naccess to the full range of recommended preventive care, such as \nmammograms and prenatal screenings and more. Four years ago the \ninsurance companies had all the leverage. Four years ago too often \nwomen were the ones who were paying the price. That is why I am proud \ntoday to highlight just how far we have come for women in the past 4 \nyears.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act became law, women have been treated \nfairly with increased access to affordable health insurance, benefits, \nand services. Deductibles and other expenses have been capped so a \nhealth care crisis does not cause a family to lose their home or their \nlife savings.\n  Women can use the health care marketplaces to pick quality plans that \nwork for them and their families. If they change jobs or have to move, \nthey are able to keep their coverage. Starting in 2012, we saw these \nbenefits for women expand even further. Additional types of maternity \nare now covered. Women are now armed with proper tools and resources in \norder to take the right steps to have a healthy pregnancy.\n  Women now have access to domestic partner violence screening and \ncounseling, as well as screening for sexually transmitted infections. \nNow women finally have access to affordable birth control. As public \nservants here, it is our job to help our constituents access Federal \nbenefits available to them, particularly when it comes to health care. \nSince 80 percent of women are not only making health care choices for \nthemselves but also their families and loved ones, it is our \nresponsibility to serve as a guide when it comes to understanding how \nto best access these benefits.\n  It might mean putting them in touch with a navigator to ensure they \nare getting the most affordable health insurance available or making \nthem aware of an enrollment event where they can get information on \navailable coverage options. But our responsibilities do not end there. \nIt is our job to have an open, honest discussion about what the \nAffordable Care Act means for our constituents and to talk about ways \nto responsibly improve it.\n  Instead, as we saw in the House last week, others have spent the \nbetter part of the last 4 years trying to take away the critical \nbenefits that I just talked about, trying to score cheap political \npoints on an issue that can literally mean the difference between life \nand death. I can understand why some of our colleagues disagree with \ncertain parts of this law or maybe how it was implemented, but what I \ncannot understand is why anyone elected to Congress would decide to \nsimply ignore real life stories of their own constituents whose lives \nwere changed the day this law took effect.\n  It is people like Susan Wellman. She lives in Bellingham in my home \nState of Washington. She is self employed. She has had to pay for \nindividual insurance. Every year she has watched her health care costs \nrise higher and higher. It got to the point where she was\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\npaying $300 monthly premiums with an $8,000 deductible, all for a plan \nshe described as ``paying for nothing.''\n  So as soon as Susan could access health care through the Washington \nState health care exchange, she jumped at the chance. She spoke on the \nphone with a real live person. She was able to sign up for an \naffordable plan in a matter of minutes. Now Susan is on a plan that \ncosts her $125 a month instead of $300. It is a plan that has a $2,000 \ndeductible that actually pays for things. Guess what. She can afford to \ngo to the doctor, not just in the case of an emergency but for a \nphysical or a mammogram that could save her life, not to mention \nthousands and thousands of dollars in health care costs.\n  That kind of preventive care is good for women like Susan. It is good \nfor her family, and it is good for this country because when more \npeople have access to preventive care, it makes health care cheaper for \nevery single one of us.\n  It is also good for women like Carrie Little. She is a certified \norganic farmer who lives in Orting, WA. A few weeks ago she was working \noutside when one of the rams on her farm attacked her, leaving her with \nbruises and a broken leg. Fortunately, because of her new health plan, \nher visit to the emergency room was painless. Well, as painless as it \ncould be with a broken leg. But her hospital bills, her cast, and her \nvisits to the orthopedic physician were paid in full.\n\n  Until last year, Carrie had been spending half of her income for a \ncatastrophic-only health plan, forcing her to pay out of pocket for \neven the most basic of care. Carrie wrote an op-ed, and I want to quote \nfrom it. She said:\n\n       What a welcome relief that my new health plan covers \n     preventive care, like mammograms, immunizations, and yearly \n     doctor visits. I can keep the primary care doctor I have been \n     seeing for years. And I no longer worry about family members \n     getting kicked around due to pre-existing conditions. Thank \n     goodness. In agriculture, profits and losses shift like the \n     weather, so for our community, it is crucial that health \n     premiums stay affordable.\n\n  Or women like Ingrid Gordon. Ingrid is a small business owner from \nSeattle who immediately enrolled in coverage when it became available. \nAfter an hour on the Web site, she told us, with minimal technical \ndifficulties, Ingrid was enrolled and received her insurance card in \nthe mail a few days later. Since her coverage began on January 1, \nIngrid had her first dental and physical exams in 14 years. She cured a \nskin disorder thanks to prescription medicine. She scheduled a \ncolonoscopy now that she is 50, and finally had her bothersome knee x-\nrayed.\n  All of those exams, visits and prescriptions would have cost Ingrid \nthousands if not tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket just 1 year \nago. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Ingrid paid a grand total \nof zero dollars in copays.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women like Susan and Carrie and \nIngrid are now fully in charge of their own health care, not their \ninsurance company. That is why I feel so strongly that we cannot go \nback to the way things were. While we can never stop working to make \nimprovements, of course, we owe it to the women of America to make \nprogress and not allow the clock to be rolled back on their health care \nneeds.\n  As we all know, unfortunately, there are efforts underway all across \nthe country, including here in our Nation's capital, to severely \nundermine a woman's access to some of the most critical and life-saving \nservices that are provided by the Affordable Care Act. No provision of \nthis law has faced quite as much scrutiny as the idea of providing \naffordable, quality reproductive health services to the women of \nAmerica.\n  We have seen attempt after attempt to eliminate access to abortion \nservices and low-cost birth control all while restricting a woman's \nability to make personal decisions about her own care. I guess we \nshould not be surprised. The truth is that the tide of these \npolitically driven, extreme efforts continues to rise.\n  In 2013 our Nation saw yet another record-breaking year of State \nlegislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women's access to \nreproductive services. In fact, in the past 3 years the United States \nhas enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years \ncombined. That means that now more than ever, it is our job to protect \nthese kinds of decisions for women, to fight for women's health, and to \nensure that women's health does not become a political football.\n  For this reason I was very proud to lead members of my caucus in \nfiling a brief with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case \nof Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., where a secular corporation \nand its shareholders are trying to get in between a woman and her \nhealth.\n  Just like the many attempts before this case, there are those out \nthere who would like the American public to believe that this \nconversation is anything but an attack on women's health care. To them \nit is a debate about freedom, except of course freedom for a woman to \naccess her own care. It is no different than when we are told that a \ntax on abortion rights is not an infringement on a woman's right to \nchoose; they are about religion or State's rights; or when we are told \nthat restricting emergency contraception is not about limiting a \nwoman's ability to make her own family planning decisions; it is about \nprotecting pharmacists; or just like last week, when an Alaskan State \nSenator said he did not think there was a compelling reason for the \ngovernment ``to finance other people's recreation.'' That was in \nreference, of course, to contraception coverage in health care. In \nfact, after doing some research, this State Senator concluded that \nsince birth control costs about ``four or five lattes'' the government \nshould really have no reason to cover this cost to women.\n  The truth is that this is about contraception. This is an attempt to \nlimit a woman's ability to access her own health care. This is about \nwomen. Allowing a woman's boss to call the shots about her access to \nbirth control should be inconceivable to all Americans in this day and \nage, and it would take us back to a place in history when women had no \nvoice and no choice.\n  In fact, contraception was included as a required preventive service \nin the Affordable Care Act on the recommendation of an independent, \nnonprofit institute of medicine and other medical experts because it is \nessential to the health of women and families.\n  After many years of research, we know ensuring access to effective \nbirth control has a direct impact on improving the lives of women and \ntheir families in America. We have been able to directly link it to \ndeclines in maternal and infant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian \ncancer, better overall health outcomes for women, and far fewer \nunintended pregnancies and abortions, which is a goal we all should \nshare.\n  But what is at stake in this case now before the Supreme Court is \nwhether a CEO's personal beliefs can trump a woman's right to access \nfree or low-cost contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\n  Every American deserves to have access to high-quality health care \ncoverage, regardless of where they work. Each of us should have the \nright to make our own medical and religious decisions without being \ndictated to or limited by our employers. Contraceptive coverage is \nsupported by the vast majority of Americans who understand how \nimportant it is for women and their families.\n  In weighing this case, my hope is that the Court realizes women \nworking for private companies should be afforded the same access to \nmedical care regardless of who signs their paychecks. We can't allow \nfor-profit secular corporations or their shareholders to deny female \nemployees access to comprehensive women's health care under the guise \nof religious exemption. It is as if we are saying: Because you are a \nCEO or a shareholder in a corporation, your rights are more important \nthan your employees', who happen to be women. That is a slippery slope \nthat could lead to employers cutting off coverage for childhood \nimmunizations if they object to that idea or prenatal care for children \nborn to unmarried parents if they think it is wrong, or blocking an \nemployee's ability to access HIV treatment.\n  I was proud to be joined in filing the brief by 18 other Senators who \nwere here when Congress enacted the religious protections under the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and who were also here when \nCongress made access to women's health care available under the \nAffordable Care Act of 2010. They are Senators who\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nknow Congress did not intend for a corporation or, furthermore, its \nshareholders to restrict a woman's access to preventive health care.\n  In the coming weeks, as the Supreme Court prepares to begin oral \narguments in this case, these Senators and our colleagues who support \nthese efforts will echo those sentiments, because we all know that \nimproving access to birth control is good health policy and good \neconomic policy. It means healthier women, healthier children, \nhealthier families, and it will save monies for our businesses and \nconsumers.\n  I know many of our colleagues here believe that repealing the \nAffordable Care Act and access to reproductive health services is a \npolitical winner for them. But the truth is this law and these \nprovisions are a winner for women, for men, for our children, and our \nhealth care system overall.\n  I am very proud to stand with my colleagues who are committed to \nmaking sure the benefits of this law don't get taken away from the \nwomen of America, because politics and ideology should not matter when \nit comes to making sure women get the care they need at a cost they can \nafford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1504-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I know others are waiting, so I will make \nsome brief remarks about something that is very important to me.\n  I rise today to discuss S. 2087, the Medicare Protection Act.\n  Over the past few years one of the things we have witnessed in the \nSenate is, unfortunately, an irresponsible few who are trying to turn \nMedicare into a voucher system and raise the eligibility age for \nbenefits. This would not only have a catastrophic effect on seniors' \nhealth but also on their financial security. It would force seniors to \npay more for their doctor visits and for prescription drugs.\n  People in my State have figured this out. In fact, I recently got a \nlittle note from Philip of Jonesboro who said: ``Raising the Medicare \neligibility age would shift thousands of dollars in costs to seniors \nand drive up premium costs.''\n  He got it exactly right. That is what it will do. That is what pretty \nmuch every study I have seen, at least, says it will do.\n  In Arkansas alone, we have well over 500,000 seniors who depend on \nMedicare. I encourage all of my colleagues to look at the numbers in \ntheir States. My guess is everyone has a large number of seniors in \ntheir State and the seniors understand how vitally important it is that \nwe protect Medicare.\n  Turning Medicare into a voucher system or fundamentally changing it \nin any way by using some sort of voucher--they call it premium \nsupplement, I don't know; they have a different word for it sometimes--\nor raising the eligibility age or cutting benefits would be very \ndetrimental to the people in my State, and I am sure in all 50 States.\n  As Rebecca from Fayetteville said:\n\n       Raising the Medicare age would simply force seniors such as \n     my mother and me to pay more out-of-pocket. We need \n     responsible, common-sense solutions to keep Medicare strong . \n     . .\n\n  I agree with that. That is exactly what we need. We need these \nresponsible commonsense solutions. Hopefully they are going to be \nbipartisan solutions. That is how we get things done in Washington, by \nworking in a bipartisan way. I am hoping, over time, this Medicare \nProtection Act will become a great bipartisan vehicle for us to protect \nMedicare.\n  It does two things, in a nutshell. First, it amends the Congressional \nBudget Act to define any provision in reconciliation legislation that \nmakes changes to Medicare to reduce or eliminate guaranteed benefits or \nrestrict eligibility criteria as extraneous and an improper use of the \nreconciliation process.\n  I know that is technical and that is kind of getting down in the \nweeds, but that is a very smart way to do it, to use the Congressional \nBudget Act to protect Medicare.\n  Secondly, it expresses the sense of the Senate that the Medicare \neligibility age should not increase and that the Medicare Program \nshould not be privatized or turned into a voucher system.\n  Again, if we look back over the years, there have been attempts to do \nthis, most of them originating in the House of Representatives, but we \nhave had a few of those attempts here.\n  As Hubert Humphrey once said: ``The moral test of government is how \nthat government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; \nthose who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; those who are in \nthe shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.''\n  The Medicare Protection Act is the right thing to do. I hope my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle will look at this legislation, \ngive it serious consideration, and join me in supporting this critical \npiece of legislation. It is a great way to protect our Medicare system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1504-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1504-S1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           McHUGH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I express my strong support for the nomination of Carolyn \nB. McHugh to the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Judge McHugh \nreceived her undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Utah. \nShe is exactly the kind of outstanding nominee of varied legal \nexperience that I set out to find to fill this vacancy.\n  She has both practiced and taught law. She has practiced in both \nState and Federal court. She has extensive experience both before and \nbehind the bench. She has served the county and State bars, as well the \nState judiciary on committees and on commissions. She has been widely \nrecognized and awarded for her distinguished legal career.\n  Somehow, along the way, Judge McHugh has found time to serve her \ncommunity with groups such as Big Brothers Big Sisters, Voices for Utah \nChildren, and Catholic Community Services of Utah.\n  Judge McHugh's 22 years of litigation experience were almost evenly \nsplit between State and Federal court. In nearly a decade on the Utah \nCourt of Appeals, currently as the presiding judge, she has heard more \nthan 1,100 appellate civil and criminal cases that ultimately reached \njudgment.\n  When she is confirmed to the 10th Circuit, I think Judge McHugh may \nhave one of the shortest learning curves on record of any judge in any \ncircuit court of appeals to this country.\n  When we have a judicial vacancy in Utah, I spend a lot of time \ntalking to lawyers and judges throughout our State's legal community, \nand so does Senator Lee. We both work together on these nominations, \nand I appreciate the input that he has and what a great deal of legal \nexpertise and understanding he brings to these matters.\n  Judge McHugh received much praise, but perhaps the most common \ndescription was simply that she works harder than anyone else. Her \nformer law partner said it, judges said it. Over and over the same \ncomment came up: She works incredibly hard.\n  I have been doing this a long time and have participated in the \nnomination or confirmation of more than half of the judges who have \never served on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. I know a first-rate \nnominee when I see one.\n  Judge McHugh's varied experience, her personal character, \nintelligence, and her work ethic make her one of the best. The \nJudiciary Committee approved her nomination without opposition, and I \nexpect the same result in the Senate.\n  I do have to say that this nomination could have been confirmed \nmonths ago. Despite some controversy over a few nominees, the \nconfirmation process was working well. In his first 5 years, President \nObama appointed 24.6 percent of the Federal judiciary, compared to 25.8 \npercent in President George W. Bush's first 5 years.\n  The Congressional Research Service says the Senate confirmed a higher \npercentage of President Obama's appeals court nominees than it did so \nfor President Clinton and did so faster than it did for President Bush.\n  In President Bush's first 5 years, Democrats conducted 20 filibusters \nof appeals court nominations, compared to only seven in President \nObama's first 5 years. Filibusters were much\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nless of a factor in the confirmation process under President Obama than \nthey had been in the past, but that was not good enough. Last November, \nDemocrats abolished nomination filibusters altogether.\n  For more than 200 years the minority in the Senate, no matter what \ntheir political party, had a real role in the confirmation process. The \npossibility of a filibuster had two effects. First, it suggested to the \nPresident that he might want to send more moderate nominees to the \nSenate. Second, it prompted the minority to cooperate with the majority \nin confirming noncontroversial nominees.\n  The new confirmation process that Democrats created has no real role \nfor the minority. As a result, neither of those positive effects exists \nanymore. The President has no incentive to choose more moderate \nnominees to consult with home State Senators or to look for a \nconsensus, and the minority in the Senate no incentive to waive rules \nor to agree to shortcuts.\n  There used to be balance in this process. The minority could \nfilibuster a few of the more extreme nominees and so the minority \nhelped process the large majority of noncontroversial nominees. That \nbalanced approach was apparently unacceptable to the current majority. \nDemocrats took that approach away, leaving a process--it can be called \nthat--that only the majority controls.\n  Democrats did not want the minority's cooperation. They did not want \na process that has some give-and-take in it. Democrats wanted a process \nthat is all take and no give, and so here we are.\n  Part of the process we used to have would have been confirming \nadditional nominations before adjourning the first session of the \nCongress. The nomination before us would have been confirmed that way \nmonths ago--as well as a whole raft of other judges that we are now \nvoting on ad seriatim. Instead, we are forced to do things in this new \nway.\n  Judge McHugh is the same highly qualified, noncontroversial nominee. \nThere is no good reason why the majority will want to take months \nlonger to confirm a nomination such as this. But this is the \nconfirmation process the Democrats created. They got the control they \nwanted, and I believe this distortion of the process harms the Senate \nas an institution. By creating unnecessary controversy and delay, this \nnew process also harms the other branches to which nominations have \nbeen made. It did not have to be this way. It should not have been this \nway.\n  I might add that I wrote a Law Review article a number of years ago \nthat I did not believe we should filibuster judicial nominations at \nall. That is why I voted ``present'' on so many of the President's \njudges, but there is no reason for me to do that anymore because the \nDemocrats have changed the rules. They have broken the rules to change \nthe rules, and so I might as well vote no along with the rest of the \nRepublicans on some of these nominees--just as an expression that we \ndon't like the way the Democrats are handling this matter. I have been, \nin the last few days, changing from ``present'' to no or yes depending \nupon the person.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I will take a few minutes to talk about the Senate Democrats' latest \neffort to grab headlines and energize their base.\n  Although the business on the floor has officially been nominations, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle came in overnight to talk \nabout climate change and the supposed need to change the way we produce \nand consume energy in this country.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about science and its supposed refusal on \nthe part of Republicans to acknowledge the ``truth.'' What we haven't \nheard is a plan for lowering energy costs or for putting Americans back \nto work.\n\n  The fact is, when the Democrats talk about climate change, more often \nthan not they are advocating policies that would do exactly the \nopposite. The funny thing is they have to know it by now. They have to \nknow that is what they are doing. They are talking about proposals that \nwould increase energy costs for American families and businesses. They \nhave to know that, and they are pushing policies that will put even \ngreater stress on our economy and make it more difficult for our \ncitizens to find and even keep a job. That is why we have an \nunderemployment rate of over 12 percent.\n  For example, last year, the President announced his Climate Action \nPlan, which directs the EPA to implement and impose new oppressive \nregulations on the energy industry that will have a significant impact \non jobs and the pocketbooks of the American people. Increasing the cost \nof energy, which this plan would surely do, will not only make our \nstruggling manufacturing sector less globally competitive, it will \nimpose costs directly onto the American people in the form of higher \nprices on electricity and other costs as well.\n  Put simply, in order to create jobs and improve our global \ncompetitiveness, we need to find ways to help businesses reduce the \namount of money they spend on energy. Unfortunately, this President is \ntrying to do the exact opposite. At the same time, we should be \nexploring ways to make raising a family more affordable.\n  Unfortunately, the President's plan would increase the cost of living \nfor every household in America. Talk about inequality. I was very \ninterested that one of the leading unions--one of the first to support \nthe President--said that he has caused more inequality than anybody. \nWhen I say ``he,'' they mean the President. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's plan would increase the cost of living for every household \nin America. This is the height of irresponsibility.\n  At a time when so many people are still feeling the impact of the \ngreat recession, the administration, not to mention its allies in \nCongress, wants to put in place regulations and mandates that will \ncripple American businesses and cause direct harm to American families \ntrying to make ends meet.\n  I find it striking that throughout all the lectures we have seen on \nclimate change science on the floor over the past 2 days, none of my \ncolleagues appear to be willing to acknowledge the very real impact of \ntheir preferred policies. Thousands of communities across the country \ndepend on the responsible development of our Nation's natural resources \nfor a living. Access to abundant and affordable energy is attractive to \ndomestic investment and provides high-paying jobs in our local \neconomies. We can develop these resources in an environmentally \nfriendly way. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't \nappear to be willing to have that conversation. Instead, they want to \ndemagogue the use of fossil fuels and impose costly mandates and \nregulations on the harvesting of our resources and on the production of \nour energy. What is interesting is they are doing it to a lot of the \npeople in a lot of the States that used to support them.\n  We need to be pushing an ``all of the above'' inclusive approach to \nthe development of energy if we are going to improve our energy \nsecurity and become a global leader in energy production. It is not the \njob of the government to pick winners and losers. Yet with all their \ntalk about climate change and the need for Republicans to ``wake up,'' \nthat is precisely what my friends in the other party want to do.\n  I would hope, given all the challenges facing our Nation--from \nsluggish economic growth to lackluster jobs creation, to jobs providing \nless than 30-hour work weeks and on and on and on--my colleagues would \ndevote more of their time trying to find real solutions for the \nAmerican people instead of trying to please their liberal base with \nalarmist rhetoric about climate change and false promises about the \nfuture of energy production in this country.\n  We all know that some of their preferred production of energy is not \nproducing. We all know it never will produce enough to solve our \nproblems. We all know people have lost jobs time and time again in this \ncountry because of the lack of energy. We all know it has made us a \nweaker country. Yet we have this blind faith that they are right and \neverybody else is wrong.\n  I think jobs are the conversation the American people want us to talk \nabout. Yes, we would like to keep things clean and good and orderly. On \nthe other hand, you can't do that without jobs. You can't do that \nwithout people being able to earn a living. You can't run our inner \ncities and towns without energy. We are giving in to some of the most \nradical theories I have ever seen in the whole time I have been here.\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\n  We ought to get rid of these false promises and we ought to do the \nvery best we can to clean up our environment in every possible way we \ncan without destroying the energy and the energy capacities we know we \nhave and loosen all the jobs that would come with that. That is the \nconversation the American people want to hear, and I hope eventually \nthat is a conversation we can have in the Senate.\n  This is an issue where my colleagues are very sincere. I don't want \nto disparage any of them. On the other hand, in many respects they are \nsincerely wrong and they are costing America its greatness.\n  One of the problems I have with our current President is that I don't \nbelieve he believes in American exceptionalism, and he is doing so many \nthings that are destroying our exceptionalism. The rest of the world \nknows it, but our folks here in America are having a rough time \ngrasping it. I think it is a desire to always treat everybody well, to \ntry to support our Presidents, which certainly we ought to try to do, \nbut there is a reason we are starting to slip.\n  There is a reason the average wage in this country has gone down \n$4,000 to $5,000. There is a reason why, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation of just a few years ago, 51 percent of the \nAmerican people are not in the process of paying one dime of income \ntaxes. I am the last one to want them to pay income taxes, those who \nshouldn't, but, my gosh, you can't run a country this way. We are going \nto have to start facing the music that the greatest country in the \nworld is losing its nerve, it is losing its verve, and there is no \nexcuse for it. No other country in the world can even compare with us. \nSo why are we doing things that are making us less and less and less \nand less?\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to again advocate that we move \nforward, we come together across the aisle as Democrats and Republicans \nto agree on what we do agree on and to do some things constructively--\nspecifically, to help veterans across our country.\n  There are 27 community-based VA clinics that are on the books at the \nVeterans' Administration ready to go. The VA is ready to break ground, \nmove forward, and build these expanded community-based clinics to serve \nareas around the country and veterans around the country in a much \nbetter way. I am particularly interested because 2 of those 27 clinics \nare in Louisiana, in Lafayette and in Lake Charles.\n  All of these clinics have gotten stuck in the mud through several \nrounds of bureaucratic delay at the VA--funding delays, authorization \ndelays, and a dispute about whether moving forward with these clinics \nwas kosher under the budget rules. We have solved all of those \nproblems. We have figured out solutions to all of those problems that \nsatisfies everyone. The House of Representatives has taken those \nsolutions, put them together in a bill and passed it overwhelmingly out \nof the House with over 400 votes in support--virtually unanimous. Now \nwe are on the Senate floor and all we have to do is take that bill, \nadopt a simple noncontroversial amendment and pass it through the \nSenate. No one in the Senate disagrees with the substance of this bill. \nNo one disagrees with the substance of the amendment we would add to \nthis bill. No one disagrees with the importance of moving forward with \nthese 27 VA clinics. Yet we are still finding it difficult to move this \nsimple noncontroversial matter through the Senate. Why? Because, quite \nfrankly, some of our colleagues who have a much bigger, broader \nveterans package want to hold this hostage for their veterans package. \nWhile I applaud their sincerity, I applaud their passion, I think we \nshould agree on what we can agree on and move forward with what we \nagree on. Let's not get bogged down and defeat 27 very important \ncommunity-based veterans clinics because there are major and sincere \ndisagreements about the much broader package.\n  I also think it will build good will to resolve some of those issues \nand come forward with a compromise version of a larger package if we do \nthat. In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of H.R. 3521, which was received from \nthe House; that my amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I appreciate the interest of Senator \nVitter in this very important issue. Senator Landrieu of Louisiana \nshares his concern, as do Senators from many States in this country \nbecause, as Senator Vitter indicated, this bill will authorize the VA \nto enter into 27 major medical facility leases in 18 States and Puerto \nRico. So this is, in fact, a very big issue.\n  But as Senator Vitter knows very well, 2 weeks ago this very same \nprovision was part of a comprehensive veterans bill supported by the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and virtually \nevery veterans organization in this country because the veterans \ncommunity is facing a host of problems.\n  Senator Vitter points out one problem. He is right. But there are \nmany other problems. I say to my friend, we could have resolved this \nproblem 2 weeks ago if I could have had four more Republican votes, \nincluding his, to pass this legislation.\n  What this bill does, and the reason it is supported by millions of \nveterans all over this country, is that it addresses the major problems \nfacing our veterans community. I say to my friend from Louisiana, and \nany other Senator, if you are not prepared to stand with veterans in \ntheir time of need, don't send them off to war. If you don't want to \npay for the care veterans need, don't send them off to war and then \ntell us it is too expensive to take care of them.\n  The legislation that again is supported by virtually every major \nveterans organization in this country, expands the caregivers program, \nimproves and expands dental care, provides advanced appropriations for \nthe VA--something many of us feel is terribly important--takes a major \nstep to end the benefits backlog, deals with the very serious problem \nof instate tuition assistance for post-9/11 veterans, and addresses the \nhorrible problem that women and men in the military face when they are \nsexually assaulted. We address that issue as well.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of reproductive health. We \nhave 2,300 men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who \nwere wounded in the war in such ways they are unable to have babies. \nThey want families but can't have babies, and so we help address in \nthis bill that issue; whether through in vitro fertilization, adoption \nor other ways to help them have families. That is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  So I look forward to working with my colleague and friend from \nLouisiana to get that legislation passed or to sit down and work on a \ncompromise piece of legislation.\n  I would say to my friend from Louisiana, today you can be a hero. \nToday you can get your concern passed and the concerns of veterans all \nover America by supporting my unanimous consent request to pass the \nbill that came up 2 weeks ago.\n  Mr. President, I object to Senator Vitter's proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 297, S. 1950; that a Sanders substitute \namendment, the text of S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and \nBenefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act,\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nbe agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; \nand the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The first objection is heard to \nthe request by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Is there objection to the request by the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, on behalf of 43 Members of the Senate, I \nobject based on substantive disagreements about this very broad-based \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor and my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I think it is really regrettable. The Senator from \nVermont and I can talk about the substance. I will be happy to talk \nabout the substance of his big bill. But the bottom line is that 43 \nMembers of the Senate disagree with him about serious substantive \nissues.\n  Because there is major disagreement--almost half of the Senate, 43 \nMembers of the Senate--he is going to block moving forward with 27 \nclinics to serve veterans around the country, about which there is no \ndisagreement. On my bill, as amended, there is zero disagreement on the \nsubstance of that bill. Because he can't get his way fully on a bigger \npackage, he is going to take the bat and take the ball, and home plate, \nfirst base, second, and third, and go home. I don't think this is the \napproach and spirit in which the American people want us to work. I \nthink the American people want us to agree when we can agree. I think \nwe should bend over to agree in those instances where we can agree and \nactually accomplish substantive, concrete things. We would be doing \nthat by moving forward separately with these 27 important community-\nbased clinics. And by the way, I think we would be creating a much \nbetter environment to continue to work on a compromised broader \npackage.\n  I commend this approach again to my friend from Vermont. I think we \nshould come together where we agree. I think we should accomplish what \nwe can and continue to work on a broader package. But taking these 27 \nclinics hostage is not doing that, is not creating an atmosphere which \nis conducive to progress on a broader package, and is not properly \nserving the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would remind my colleague from \nLouisiana that the vote on that bill was 56 to 41. This is a 15-vote \nplurality. There is another person who was not here who would have \nvoted for us on that bill, so 57 votes. But because of a Republican \nrequest for a budget point of order, we need 60 votes. So a strong \nmajority of the Members in the Senate support this comprehensive \nlegislation. We are three votes shy of passing it. I intend to reach \nout to the Senator from Louisiana and every other Senator to see \nwhether we get these three votes so we can pass the most comprehensive \nveterans legislation brought to the floor of the Senate in many \ndecades.\n  This is not a complicated issue. On Veterans Day and on Memorial Day, \nevery Member of the Senate and House goes back to his or her district \nand tells veterans just how much they respect them and love them and so \nforth and so on. That is all fine and well. Speeches are important. But \nat the end of the day, serving our veterans means a lot more than \ngiving speeches. It means voting for programs that will improve their \nlives.\n  I will not disagree with anybody who says veterans programs are often \nexpensive. They are expensive. When somebody goes off to war and comes \nback without any legs, without any arms, losing their eyesight or their \nhearing or dealing with TBI--traumatic brain injury--or PTSD--post-\ntraumatic stress disorder--or suffering from sexual assault, it is an \nexpensive proposition to make those folks as well as we possibly can. \nBut, as I said earlier, if we are not prepared to support the men and \nwomen who come back from war, don't send them off to war in the first \nplace.\n  So I very much hope I will be successful in working on an agreement \nwith the Senator from Louisiana and some of my other Republican \ncolleagues so we can do what the veterans community wants us to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1507-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1507-S1510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I spoke last night in anticipation of this \nall-night session that was going to take place. I was not surprised at \nthe general topics that were covered. There are probably five all \ntogether that they were stated over and over. I would like to clarify a \ncouple of things that probably are worthwhile this afternoon.\n  One is my good friend from California--this is a quote, we took it \ndown--said:\n\n       When 97 to 98 percent of the scientists say something is \n     real, they do not have anything pressing them to say that \n     other than the truth. They do not have any other agenda. They \n     don't work for oil companies. And I will tell you, as \n     chairman of the environment committee, every time the \n     Republicans chose a so-called expert on climate, we have \n     tracked them down to special interest funding, those 3 \n     percent. They know where their bread is buttered.\n\n  That is kind of an interesting and a timely statement to make because \nwhat they are not telling you--and I am talking about the Senator from \nCalifornia and the other Democrats--is that the hedge fund billionaire \nand climate activist Tom Steyer plans to spend $100 million through his \nNextGen PAC. The NextGen PAC is his political action committee. He has \nmade the statement that he is going to be spending $100 million in the \nmidterm elections of 2014 and is going to be looking very carefully to \nmake sure that all of the Democrats go along with his activist agenda.\n  That was actually a statement that was made, that has been written \nup. It is all documented. I am going to submit for the Record at this \npoint all of the newspaper articles, the Washington Post, the \nWashington Times, and others that talk about this climate activist Tom \nSteyer, who is going to be spending $100 million in the next election.\n  What I would like to do is cover the points that were made. As I say, \nthey were made over and over, different people saying them, the same \ntalking points. I am sure Tom Steyer's people had the talking points \nwell prepared and moveon.org and George Soros and Michael Moore and the \nHollywood elites and that crowd all had their talking points to sound \nreal good. I noticed that so many of them were reading those points and \nwere not familiar with the issues.\n  But last night many of my colleagues pointed to weather as the reason \nfor manmade climate change. Yet they failed to quote meteorologists in \nthe speeches. Let me read just what the meteorologists are saying about \nclimate change.\n  A recent study by George Mason University reported--that was over 400 \nTV meteorologists--they reported that 63 percent of the weathercasters \nbelieve that any global warming that occurs is the result of natural \nvariations and not human activity. That is a significant 2-to-1 \nmajority.\n  Another study by the American Meteorological Society last year found \nthat of their members, nearly half did not believe in manmade global \nwarming. Furthermore, the survey found that scientists who professed \nliberal political views were more likely to proclaim manmade climate \nchange than the rest of their colleagues.\n  I think we can name names here. Certainly one of the more prominent \nnames is Heidi Cullen. She was with the Weather Channel. She spent most \nof her time with a background of very liberal thinking, liberal agenda, \ntalking about this until she is no longer there anymore. She is now \nwith one of the groups, the very liberal groups.\n  This is a good one, a lifelong liberal Democrat. His name is Dr. \nMartin\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nHertzberg. He is a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.D. in physical \nchemistry who also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. This \nis a quote from Dr. Martin Hertzberg:\n\n       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the \n     constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering clap-\n     trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to \n     science. The global warming alarmists don't even bother with \n     data! All they have are half-baked computer models that are \n     totally out of touch with reality and have already been \n     proven to be false.\n\n  CNN, not exactly a bastion of conservatism, had yet another of its \nmeteorologists dissent from global warming fears. His name is Chad \nMyers, a meteorologist for 22 years and certified by the American \nMeteorological Society, spoke out against anthropogenic climate change \non CNN in December of 2008.\n  He said, ``You know, to think that we could affect weather all that \nmuch is pretty arrogant.''\n  Since they are talking about the weather, here are a few facts that \nare not mentioned on drought and hurricanes. Several of the people came \nto the floor during the evening to talk about increase in drought, the \nincrease in hurricanes and all of that. According to NOAA, hurricanes \nhave been in decline in the United States since the beginning of \nrecords in the 19th century. The worst decade for major--category 3, 4, \n5--hurricanes was in the 1940s. Severe drought in 1934 covered 80 \npercent of the country. The current one, the drought we went through a \nyear and a half ago was 25 percent of the country.\n  Then they talked about, last night, the icecaps are melting and all \nof that. My colleague Senator Feinstein from California pointed to \nmelting icecaps as proof of climate change. Yet reports on what is not \nmelting show a different story. This past December a research \nexpedition of climate scientists got stuck in deep ice in Antarctica. \nWe all remember that. I remember talking about that and showing \npictures on the floor when that took place. That was a bunch of people \nwho were going up there to try to solidify their case on global \nwarming. They were stuck in ice for weeks on end. It took a couple of \nweeks and a couple more icebreakers getting stuck before the research \nvessel was finally freed.\n  A paper published in the October Journal of Climate examines the \ntrend of sea ice extent along the east Antarctic coast from 2000 to \n2008 and finds a significant increase, average of 1.43. That is 1.5 \npercent a year of increase of ice in the Antarctic.\n  Greenland, the IPCC--now, keep in mind, I talked yesterday about the \nIPCC. That is the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. In a minute, I will show how it was discredited. But in \nGreenland they said--they admitted that in 2001, to melt Greenland the \nice sheet would require temperatures to rise by 5.5 degrees Celsius and \nremain for 1,000 years. The ice sheet is actually growing by 2 percent \na year. That is what is going on right now on this very ice sheet. \nEveryone is concerned about Greenland. Yet it is actually growing, not \ndecreasing.\n\n  In January 2010, Time magazine: Himalayan Melting: How a Climate \nPanel Got it Wrong: ``Glaciergate'' is a black eye for the IPCC and the \nclimate-science community as a whole.\n  In December of 2008, Al Gore said--this is good. Al Gore said, ``The \nentire--\n  That is a little over 5 years ago. Gore said, ``The entire North \npolar icecap will disappear in 5 years.'' It is now 5 years and 1 month \npast the deadline, December of 2013, and the Arctic ice is actually \ndoing pretty well. Last month, BBC reported that the Arctic icecap \ncoverage is close to 50 percent more than in the corresponding period \nin 2012. So contrary to what Al Gore predicted, that it would be gone \nby now, it did not disappear.\n  I had a good quote there by Richard Lindzen talking about Gore. This \nis Richard Lindzen, one of the foremost authorities, scientific \nauthorities on climate anywhere in the world. He is MIT. He has been \nquoted extensively. He said, talking about Gore:\n\n       To treat all changes as something to fear is bad enough. To \n     do it in order to exploit that fear is much worse.\n\n  I mentioned last night that the New York Times designated Al Gore as \nperhaps the first environmental billionaire in the United States. He \nsaid the entire North polar icecap would disappear in 5 years. It has \nactually increased substantially.\n  Last night they talked about the IPCC is the gold standard of climate \nscience. Senator Whitehouse defended the credibility of the IPCC \ndespite climategate, saying last night:\n\n       So after all that, after six published reviews whose \n     results confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the \n     science as a result of these emails--\n\n  We are talking about climategate now.\n\n     --for people to continue to come to the floor and suggest \n     that the email chains revealed some flaw in the data or some \n     flaw in the science, it's untrue. It's as simple as that. \n     It's just not true.\n\n  But we know this is not the case. The emails are very clear that the \nscientists were manipulating the data to generate a result they wanted. \nThis is what some of the emails disclose: One of the scientists said, \nand the emails disclosed, that the IPCC was systematically distorting \nfacts, cooking the science of global warming to either cover up data \nthat did not tell the story they wanted everyone to hear and \nexaggerating the impacts of the changing climate to help drive people--\nout of fear--into action.\n  Here are two examples. We have about 12 examples. I have read them \nall in the past on the floor of the Senate. But here are a couple of \nexamples of how the IPCC was cooking the science. The IPCC claimed the \nHimalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. Of course it is not true. Yet it \nwas put into the IPCC's fourth assessment report.\n  The assessment report is a report the IPCC has that the media picks \nup and the public consumes. According to the Sunday Times, that is in \nthe UK, this claim was based off of a brochure that was used by the \nWorld Wildlife Fund to promote global warming activism. They put it on \na brochure after finding a paper from a little-known scientist in \nIndia.\n  That scientist was wrong. According to the Times, Himalayan glaciers \nare so thick and at such a high altitude that most glaciologists \nbelieve it would take several hundred years to melt them at the present \nrate. More alarming, from the East Anglia University's Climatic \nResearch Unit, the CRU, disturbing evidence was revealed that the \nclimatologists had been increasingly cooking the books. One leaked \nemail from 1999--keep in mind, these are the guys who are giving the \nscience to the IPCC.\n\n       I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding the real \n     temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e., from 1981 \n     onwards, and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\n\n  In other words, they were falsifying the increase in the temperature. \nWhat he is saying is that he changed the numbers to show the warming is \nhappening when it has not happened.\n  Another e-mail that was revealed in 2009:\n\n       The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming \n     at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't. Our \n     observing system is inadequate.\n\n  Despite this, the IPCC has continued to say global warming is \ncontinuing to happen.\n  The media outcry from these email leaks was surprising because we did \nnot hear as much about it in the United States as we did in the UK and \nother places. It seemed to be the mainstream press organizations that \nhave been strong partners with the global warming activists, alarmists, \nthat began to question their confidence in the whole premise.\n  Here are some quotes. Keep in mind these are from legitimate \norganizations, publications, major publications that are credible.\n  Christopher Booker of the UK, the Telegraph--one of the largest \npapers in the United Kingdom--said that what has happened with climate \nchange is they are talking about falsifying the information to make the \npublic believe this is actually happening. They said it is the ``worst \nscientific scandal of our generation.'' That is very serious, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, the ``worst scientific scandal of our \ngeneration.''\n  Clive Crook of the Financial Times stated: ``The closed mindedness of \nthese supposed men of science . . . is surprising, even to me. The \nstink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.'' That was from the \nFinancial Times. We are all familiar with that publication.\n  A prominent IPCC physicist said: ``Climategate was a fraud on a scale \nI've never seen.''\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\n  U.N. scientist Dr. Philip Lloyd said: ``The result is NOT \nscientific.''\n  Newsweek magazine said: ``Once celebrated climate researchers feeling \nlike the used-car salesman.''\n  ``Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations were taken \nstraight out of unchecked activist brochures.''\n  George Monbiot is a columnist for the Guardian. He was on the other \nside of this issue. He was upset because people were finding out the \ntruth and said: ``It is no use pretending that this isn't a major blow. \nThe emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic unit at the \nUniversity of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging . . . I'm \ndismayed and deeply shaken by them . . . I was too trusting of some of \nthose who provided the evidence I championed. I would have been a \nbetter journalist if I had investigated their claims more closely.'' He \nis one of the strongest supporters of global warming.\n  Last night we heard more and more, and now we get to the rest of the \nstory, and that would be what is most important. I say this is the most \nimportant because many years ago--this would have been about 2002, when \nalmost everyone believed the world was coming to an end and it was \nglobal warming that was causing it--they all talked about how it must \nbe true. Frankly, I thought it was true at that time until we did some \nchecking to find out what would it cost to regulate greenhouse gases. I \nmean, even if it were a legitimate problem that was destroying this \ncountry, what would it cost?\n  The first reports we got were from Charles Rivers and from the \nWharton School. Some of their economists came up with it. The range is \nbetween $300 to $400 billion a year. This is based off of a regulatory \nthreshold of 25,000 tons. This is very tough.\n  I have a good friend, Senator Ed Markey, who was in the House with me \nfor quite some time. We disagree on this issue, but the last bill that \ncame up, the last legislation to force us to have a type of cap-and-\ntrade, was based on capping these people who emit 25,000 tons or more. \nThat is based off of the regulatory threshold of 25,000 tons. Only the \nlargest facilities, such as oil refineries and powerplants, would have \nbeen affected. But doing by regulation what they cannot do by \nlegislation, they have to do it under the Clean Air Act.\n  This is kind of under the weeds, but it is very important. I thought \nthe bill was too costly for the American people. It would regulate \nthose who emitted 25,000 tons or more, but the Clean Air Act would \nregulate those at 250 tons or more. That is every church, every school, \nevery small shop would be covered, apartment buildings in America.\n  So when you stop and think about it, we have never been able to \ncalculate. No one disagrees with the fact that if we did it through \nregulation, it would cost between $300 to $400 billion a year. For \nthose people who are listening right now, $300 to $400 billion a year \nmay not mean too much. But every year I calculate, in my State of \nOklahoma, how many people, families we have who file a federal tax \nreturn. Then I do the math. That would have meant $3,000 to each family \nin the State of Oklahoma. So it is a big deal. That is what it would \ncost them.\n  While they are extremely costly, the agency is busy doing other \nthings that also include other types of regulations. The ozone, for \nexample, their regulation--and it hasn't gone through yet--all 77 of my \ncounties in Oklahoma would be out of attainment. That would be 7,000 \njobs lost in my State.\n  Utility MACT is something that has already been implemented. That is \nwhat put coal out of business--$100 billion in cost, 1.65 million jobs.\n  Boiler MACT is already implemented also. Every manufacturing company \nhas a boiler, and so they would regulate those boilers. The cost of \nthat is $63 billion, costing 800,000 jobs that were lost. That is \nalready implemented.\n  The BLM fracking regulations would be about $100,000 per well. On \nfracking, I can remember when hydraulic fracturing was something not \nmany people knew much about. I did because the first hydraulic \nfracturing took place in my State of Oklahoma. It was 1948.\n  I remember when the last Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Lisa Jackson, made the statement when I asked her \nthe question live on TV--I said: Is it causing groundwater \ncontamination? She is the one who said there has never been a \ndocumented case of groundwater contamination by using hydraulic \nfracturing.\n  President Obama, in his effort and his war on fossil fuels, is trying \nto stop them. We have heard him say several times: Well, we have good, \ncheap, abundant, plentiful natural gas to take care of our energy needs \nin America. That part was true, but then the next thing he said was: We \nhave to stop hydraulic fracturing. Without hydraulic fracturing, we \ncan't get 1 cubic foot of gas.\n\n  What I have tried to do is let the public know the cumulative impact \nof all of these regulations. A lot of people think of regulations as \nonly affecting large corporations. If someone talks to Tom Buchanan of \nthe State of Oklahoma--he was recently elected president of the \nOklahoma Farm Bureau. If we ask him what the most critical thing is for \nthe farmers in the State of Oklahoma, he will say the overregulation by \nthe EPA. He said: Overregulation by the EPA is much more significant to \nthe ag community in Oklahoma and across the country than anything in \nthe farm bill.\n  So the cumulative impact of all of these regulations so far is about \n$630 billion annually and about 9 million jobs lost.\n  I would only say that last night they had a good time talking about \nthese things, and the same story was told over and over using a \nslightly different slant on it.\n  But in terms of the cost, this is the reason that they have tried \never since the Kyoto Convention. The first bill was introduced in 2002 \nand several of them since then. They were never able to pass a bill \nthrough the House and the Senate on regulating greenhouse gases because \ncap and trade is so costly.\n  But what people have to realize--I know right now as I speak that \nthere are a lot of people out there who really believe global warming \nis happening, really believe the world is going to come to an end, \nreally believe we are going to have to do something about it, and so we \nstart in the United States. So knowing that these people are out \nthere--and there are even people in my State of Oklahoma who have \nbought into this--when Lisa Jackson, who at that time--she is not there \nanymore. She was Obama's pick and was the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I asked her the question on the \nrecord, live on TV in one of our committee hearings--I said: Let's \nassume that we pass legislation and that we impose the cost of $300 to \n$400 billion on the American taxpayer. If that is the case and if they \ndid that, would that have the effect of reducing greenhouse gases \nworldwide? Her answer: No, it wouldn't, because the problem isn't in \nthe United States; the problem is in China and India and Mexico and \nother places.\n  Now, you could carry out that argument even further and say that \nthose people who want to do away with emissions and have cap and trade \nin the United States--that could cause it to have actually more, not \nless, emissions of CO2 because we would be chasing our \nmanufacturing base to countries that didn't have any requirements. So \nif you really believe it, then still it isn't true.\n  I would end with one more quote. Dr. Richard Lindzen of MIT, whom we \ntalked about 1 minute ago, was asked this question: Why is it that so \nmany of the bureaucrats, the very liberals who want government to be \ncontrolled from Washington, want our lives to be controlled from \nWashington, why is it that they are so concerned with carbon \nregulations? Richard Lindzen's answer was this: ``Controlling carbon is \na bureaucrat's dream. If you control carbon, you control life.''\n  It is unfortunate. There are a lot of people even in this body who \nbelieve we should have much more power in the Senate. I can assure you \nthat the problems we are facing now are problems because of too much \npower being concentrated in Washington, DC.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

From the residents of Smith Island, which is \nthe last inhabitable island in the Maryland part of the Chesapeake Bay, \nto those who enjoy fishing for rockfish in the bay, to its oysters, its \ncrabs, the over 11,000 miles of shoreline created by the Chesapeake \nBay, the 150 major rivers that feed into the Chesapeake Bay, and the $1 \ntrillion to the economy, the Chesapeake Bay is truly part of the life \nof those of us who are privileged to live in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed.\n  I have spoken about this bay many times because it is being \nthreatened. Over 30 years ago, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, along \nwith the EPA and other partners, entered into a Chesapeake Bay \nagreement.\n  This has grown to six States, including the Presiding Officer's State \nof West Virginia, and other governmental entities in the private \nsector. The Chesapeake Bay agreement has been revisited over time, and \nthe most recent effort to update this agreement was the draft submitted \nby the Obama administration on January 29 of this year. This draft \nagreement is what I wish to speak about with my colleagues.\n  The development of sound policies to restore the Chesapeake Bay has \nbeen a top priority of mine over the course of my career in Congress. I \nhave been fortunate to have great partners in Congress representing the \nBay States. Together we have worked to develop effective conservation \nand ecosystem restoration programs in the farm bill, the Water \nResources Development Act, the Clean Water Act, and elsewhere in law \nsupporting a variety of conservation and ecosystem approaches across \ndifferent sectors.\n  The Army Corps, USDA, and EPA are not the only Federal agencies doing \nimportant Chesapeake Bay work. NOAA, USGS, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service are also important Federal \npartners in the broader effort to restore the Bay.\n  President Obama's May 2009 Chesapeake Bay Executive order recognized \nboth the national interest in restoring the Chesapeake Bay and \nimproving Federal coordination of restoration efforts because of a \nwide-ranging involvement of different departments and agencies of the \nFederal Government. The coordination of seven jurisdictions, hundreds \nof local communities, seven cabinet-level Federal departments, and \nstakeholders of all stripes have necessitated the development of the \nChesapeake Bay agreement to affirm the conservation goals of everyone \ninvolved in this effort.\n  I wish to stress the importance of broad involvement of all \nstakeholders in the effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay. The \npopulations living and working in the bay watershed must realize we are \nall in this together. The major stakeholders in regard to our \nconservation action include farmers. Farming is not only a way of life \nin the Chesapeake Bay watershed, it is a desirable activity within the \nChesapeake Bay watershed for the future of the Chesapeake Bay. But \nthere are certain challenges as a result of farming as it relates to \nnitrogen in the bay and in the sediments.\n  Developers. We are proud of the fact people want to live in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed. We have seen a major increase in population. \nBut with that comes the challenge of storm runoff, and we have to do a \nbetter job of preventing storm runoff dumping pollution into the bay, \nand the municipalities which are responsible for the growth of \npopulations have to deal with how they treat wastewater, and the \nwastewater treatment plants need to be updated so we can have the \nmaximum results in removing the pollution which otherwise would end up \nthreatening the future of the bay.\n  The Chesapeake Bay agreement outlines a fairly comprehensive approach \nto continuing efforts to restore the bay which is dependent upon all \nstakeholders doing their part. The draft agreement is a good outline, \nbut there is room for improvement in the draft agreement as well. I \nhope that while the agreement is in this period of public comment, the \nfinal will be approved.\n  The Chesapeake Bay program partnership was formed in 1983, when the \nGovernors of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the Mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and \nthe EPA signed the first Chesapeake Bay agreement. For more than 30 \nyears these entities have remained committed to the goal of restoring \nthe Chesapeake Bay. As the science has determined and the interest in \nBay stewardship has broadened, this partnership has since expanded to \nbecome a basin-wide effort where all six States of the basin are now \nparty to the agreement.\n  Working together to achieve the various goals of the agreement is \nwhat will help ensure the Chesapeake Bay we will leave for our children \nis healthier tomorrow than it is today. The agreement does acknowledge \nthe partnership cannot address every goal in the agreement \ninstantaneously. Certainly some goals may take longer to realize than \nothers, but all the goals are achievable, and some I think should be \neven more ambitious. They are based upon best science. We think science \nneeds to judge what we can do as far as cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The agreement wisely suggests action be taken in a strategic and \ncost-effective manner. We want to make sure this is doable. We \nunderstand the burdens which can be caused. We want to make sure this \nis layered in a way which achieves best science results but does it in \nthe most cost-effective manner.\n  Of the principles laid out in the agreement, I wish to acknowledge \nthe partnership's commitment to transparency and consensus building. We \nwant all stakeholders involved in the process, and we want local \ninvolvement. We think local governments know how we can best achieve \nour results. The goals of the agreement deal with very sensitive issues \nsuch as natural land preservation, nutrient pollution reduction, and \nothers.\n  The process must be fair and open. The strategic development process \nand achieving the agreement's conservation goals must be devised in an \nall-inclusive manner which is open to the public so that all are \nincluded in the process.\n  There is a great deal of skepticism in certain communities about the \ngovernment's role and its actions to protect and restore the bay. I \nhave heard that skepticism from certain constituencies. I have learned \nthat having an open dialog with stakeholders, carefully explaining \nintentions, listening to concerns, and answering questions goes a long \nway toward building consensus and acceptance.\n  The agreement acknowledges the role the bay TMDL plays in achieving \nthe water quality goals of the bay. A majority of the waters of the \nChesapeake Bay are within the boundaries of the State of Maryland. \nThousands of Maryland watermen make their living on the bay. The \nproperty value and tourism draw of communities up and down the Eastern \nand Western Shores of Maryland, not to mention the Marylanders who swim \nand fish in the bay, all depend upon a healthy bay.\n  But there is no degree of action Maryland can take on its own, no \nmatter how drastic, which will improve the bay quality--not without the \nother five States and the District of Columbia in the watershed doing \ntheir part as well. The TMDL assures that all Bay States are \ncoordinated in their efforts to improve bay water quality. The \nagreement acknowledges the importance of the TMDL.\n  The TMDL gives us a level playing field so we can make sure all \nstakeholders in all geographical areas are treated fairly in achieving \nthe goals of reducing pollution in the bay. I support the fisheries \ngoal of the agreement. Restoring the iconic Maryland blue crab in the \nbay is important for so many reasons. The agreement sets the goal of \nmaintaining a population of 215 female adult crabs through 2025. Blue \ncrabs are a vital part of the food chain throughout the bay's ecosystem \nand\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nthey are at the heart of the Mid-Atlantic's multibillion dollar seafood \nindustry.\n  Restoration of native oyster habitat and replenishing the bay's \noyster population is critical from both an economic and water quality \nstandpoint. The agreement sets the goals of restoring native oyster \nhabitat and populations to the ten tributaries of the bay by 2025.\n  As I am sure the Presiding Officer is aware, our oyster population is \na fraction of historic levels. The oyster is not only an important cash \ncrop in the bay; it also acts as a filter to the pollution in the bay, \nrestoring bay water quality. Bay oysters are another important seafood \ncommodity for watermen making their living on the bay. Oysters are also \nimportant to improving water quality. Oysters are bivalve mollusks \nwhich play an important role in reducing nitrogen pollution in the bay.\n  Oyster populations had been in sharp decline due to the destruction \nof oyster beds along the seafloor of the bay. Habitat restoration \nefforts led by the Army Corps, the growth of oyster farming operations, \nand Virginia and Maryland's efforts are helping oysters rebound across \nthe bay, which is good for the economy and water quality of the bay.\n  The agreement's wildlife habitat and wetlands restoration goals are, \nin my opinion, too low. I would encourage the partnership to consider \nsetting more ambitious goals. Wetland restoration is critical to flood \nprotection and water quality improvement as well as providing important \nduck habitat and fish spawning habitat.\n  Reauthorizing the North American Wetland Conservation Act, which I am \na cosponsor of and was happy to see the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee recently report with unanimous support, will provide \nadditional financial and technical assistance to help achieve improved \nwetlands conservation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n  Programs such as the North American Wetland Conservation Act, the \nCorps' Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem Restoration Program, and the farm \nbill's Regional Conservation Partnership Program, along with numerous \nState efforts to restore wetlands and habitats across the six-State \nregion, are why I believe the agreement can do better.\n  I also believe the agreement's goals to improve fish passage along \nthe bay's rivers and tributaries could be more ambitious. The agreement \naims to open an additional 1,000 stream miles to fish passage. The \nrevisions to the Continuing Authorities Program in WRDA will help fund \ncritical dam removal projects around the watershed which will improve \nfish passage. If the decisions to remove dams and other barriers to \nfish passage are strategically made, this goal could be far exceeded, \nwhich is why I think the goal should be revised and be based upon the \nexecution of strategic fish passage projects. This would include \nimproving eel passage on the Conowingo Dam. I am pleased to know that \nthe dam's operators are aware of and interested in helping us devise \npractical solutions.\n  With respect to the agreement's goals on forest buffer and tree \ncanopy, I believe there is room for improvement in the goals the draft \nagreement sets. The agreement sets the goal of restoring 900 miles of \nriparian forest per year and expands the urban tree canopy by 2,400 \nacres by 2025. This seems to be low given the opportunity which exists \nto grow more trees in urban areas because of how desirable trees are to \nimproving the quality of life and character of urban communities and \nimportance of trees to reducing storm water runoff in urban areas.\n  The agreement sets the goal of protecting an additional 2 million \nacres of land throughout the watershed. This is critically important to \nstem poor land-use planning and sprawl while also establishing lands \nwhich serve as critical water quality improvement mechanisms.\n\n  One omission from this land conservation goal I think is important is \nto ensure public access to lands conserved by the State, local, and \nFederal Government. Public-preserved for the purpose of protecting \nhabitat and improving the ecosystem within the watershed is important, \nbut so is providing outdoor recreational access to the public. After \nall, ensuring public access to conservation lands and encouraging \npeople to experience these lands is critical to building the public's \nunderstanding of the environment and developing an appreciation for all \nconservation efforts happening around the watershed.\n  In Maryland, my colleague in the House, Congressman Sarbanes, has \nbeen very instrumental in the leadership of No Child Left Inside. By \nthis we mean the education of our children including getting outdoors \nto understand the importance of the Chesapeake Bay and understanding \nwhat they can do to help the bay. Access to these restoration \nprojects--by the public, by our students, by all--helps build the \nsupport base we need to get these programs moving forward and also \nunderstanding what we do here in the watershed and the importance it \nhas on the future of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Lastly, I wish to speak about a couple issues the agreement does not \naddress. Reducing the presence or improving the secure storage of toxic \nchemicals in use around the watershed is a growing problem. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, while the recent chemical spill in West \nVirginia was not in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the incident does \nhighlight the risk facilities such as the one which failed in \nCharleston pose to our great water bodies. In the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed there are dozens of chemical storage facilities and \nindustrial activities which use toxic chemicals on a regular basis. \nImproving the security and reducing the contamination risks from these \nfacilities should be a part of the Chesapeake Bay agreement.\n  The agreement also makes no mention of the single greatest threat to \nthe bay and the world over. Adapting to the effects of climate change \nshould also be part of the bay restoration plan. I talked about this \nearlier today, as many of the Senators who came to the floor to talk \nabout climate change: Rising sea levels pose threats to the hundreds of \nChesapeake Bay communities and millions of people who live in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed.\n  Aquatic acidification poses a long-term threat to all aquatic \nspecies, including blue crabs, oysters, rockfish, sturgeon, menhaden, \nand other hallmark species of the bay. If the fish and shellfish go, so \ndoes a way of life for many thousands of families around the bay.\n  Let's deal with these problems. We have a chance in the Chesapeake \nBay agreement to be more ambitious in dealing with acidification in our \nocean and in the bay. And we must adapt our water infrastructure to \nhandle the effects of more intense weather events in the bay region to \nreduce the water quality impacts of these events and to protect \nindividuals' property.\n  The agreement is an important step toward the restoration of the \nChesapeake Bay. Billions have been spent and progress has been made. \nAnd I wish to stress that we have made progress. We have done a lot of \ngood things in the Chesapeake Bay. But our resources are large and \nfragile and face unprecedented pressure, and it is going to continue to \ntake increased resources to restore and protect for future generations. \nSo the good news is we have made progress.\n\n  We can do much more. We can preserve the iconic Chesapeake Bay for \nfuture generations, so people, our children and grandchildren, can \nenjoy the fishing, crabbing, swimming, and the sheer beauty of the \nChesapeake Bay, and can benefit from its economic importance to our \nregion. We can do this for future generations.\n  Let's be more ambitious in the Chesapeake Bay agreement. Let's work \ntogether, use best science, and be practical. But let's be on a \nconstant path of improving the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1511-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1511-S1514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOMESTIC FUEL TAX\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. This morning I spoke on the floor and I talked about \nenergy. I talked about the need for a States\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nfirst, all-of-the-above approach to a comprehensive energy plan that \nwill not only produce more energy for our country but will get us to \nenergy independence or energy security within a very short period of \ntime and will also help with environmental stewardship and will help us \ndeploy the technology that will not only produce more energy--and do it \nin a dependable, cost effective way--but at the same time the same \ntechnology as we deploy it will help us produce that energy with better \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  That is the right kind of plan for America. We have legislation that \nI introduced along with my colleagues both on the Republican side of \nthe aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle to accomplish that plan, \nincluding a good friend of mine, a Senator from West Virginia, a \nDemocrat. I am a Republican, but we have been able to work together on \nlegislation that will empower hundreds of billions in private \ninvestment into the energy sector to produce more energy more cost-\neffectively, more independently, more efficiently, more reliably, and \nwith better environmental stewardship because it deploys the new \ntechnologies that not only will make a difference in this country, but \nwill be adopted by other countries around the globe.\n  That means lower-cost energy. That means more energy, and at the same \ntime better environmental stewardship. That is the right approach. That \nis the right approach to a comprehensive energy policy.\n  The fact is, we do not just have one bill to do what I am talking \nabout--not just one big, monolithic Federal approach--but rather we \nhave a whole series of bills that would create a step-by-step approach \nto a comprehensive energy plan for this Nation that would truly create \na States first, all-of-the-above approach. That would create more jobs \nand economic growth. It would create tax revenue to help address our \ndeficit and our debt without raising taxes through economic growth.\n  It would create more domestic energy, and more domestic energy means \nnational security, not being dependent on oil from the Middle East. \nThis country does not want to be dependent on oil from the Middle East \nand there is no reason that we should be. Together with our closest \nfriend and ally Canada, we can produce more than enough energy for our \nneeds. That means national security, and as I said, with the new \ntechnologies and better environmental stewardship.\n  As I said, I put forward legislation with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to accomplish just that. Again, this isn't one big, \ncomprehensive 1,000-page bill that you have to pass to understand what \nis in it. These are individual bills that are very understandable, that \nare common sense--legislation that includes approval of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. As I said this morning, the administration has been reviewing \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline for more than 5 years. This Congress can \napprove it, and it should.\n  It includes items such as the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act, which has \nalready been passed by the House. It includes a whole series of bills \nthat would help us to develop a strategic, comprehensive plan and goals \nto make sure we are producing more energy in this country on public \nlands both onshore and off.\n  The Empower States Act makes sure that States have a primary \nresponsibility for regulating hydraulic fracture. Hydraulic fracturing \nis enabling us to tap new areas of energy that we never thought we \nwould be able to develop.\n  Coal ash recycling legislation. Together with my good friend from the \ngreat State of West Virginia, we have a coal ash recycling bill. This \nbill not only will help us recycle coal ash for building materials, for \nbuilding roads, but it will also help make sure that when we landfill \ncoal ash, it is done with good environmental stewardship. That is a \nwin-win.\n  This is something the EPA is working on. They have to have a solution \nin place by the end of the year, and we have worked with the EPA to \nactually come up with something that is clear and understandable and \nworks, not only to make the landfill safer but to make sure we can \nrecycle coal ash in a way that reduces the cost of our roads and our \nbuildings. Again, just another commonsense example of what is in the \nDomestic Fuels Act.\n  The Domestic Fuels Act allows marketers, gas stations, to not only \nsell oil and gas products but actually makes it easier for them to sell \nrenewable fuel as well--ethanol, biofuels, hopefully hydrogen and other \nfuels of the future. It makes it easier for them to get permitted and \nto use the same equipment to sell a whole variety of different types of \nfuels. What does that mean? That means consumer choice. That means more \ncompetition to help bring down the price at the pump. Now this is the \nsame kind of comprehensive plan that we developed in my State of North \nDakota. We called our energy plan EmPower ND--EmPower North Dakota.\n\n  The idea was to unleash all of our energy resources, both traditional \nand renewable. Our State is now an energy powerhouse for the Nation. \nThe only State that produces more oil for this country now is Texas. We \nare closing in on a million barrels a day of oil, and producing it in \nnew ways with new techniques that people thought were not possible a \nfew years ago, and with a smaller footprint and better stewardship. \nThat is what the technology does.\n  When you create an environment where you empower the investment, that \ntechnology unleashes the energy and does it with better environmental \nstewardship. We did that as a State, and we can do it as a country. It \nbuilds on the very foundation of how our government works.\n  The States in our great country are the laboratories of democracy. \nWhat I am proposing is that we also make the States the laboratories of \nenergy development. We do that by giving them the primary role in how \nthey develop energy, how they develop their energy resources and how \nthose energy resources are regulated.\n  So whether it is oil or gas or nuclear or biofuels, hydro, wind, \nsolar, biomass or whatever else may be an area of strength for that \nState, they decide and they figure out how to develop it. Who will be \nmore concerned about good environmental stewardship than the people who \nlive right there and deal with it every single day?\n  It is a States first, all-of-the-above comprehensive plan for energy \ndevelopment for this country instead of the current approach, an \napproach where there is too much regulation, taxation, and restriction \nby big Federal policies. This one-size-fits-all approach is, in fact, \npreventing investment in energy development in this country.\n  I will give you the Keystone XL Pipeline as a great case in point. \nThere is $5.3 billion in investment and not one penny of Federal \nspending, but $5.3 billion that has been held on the sideline now for \nmore than 5 years. In 2011 the Chamber of Commerce put forward a study. \nThey cited hundreds of projects across the country totaling hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that were being held up that would create energy \nand jobs and economic activity for our country. If you think about it, \nyou cannot regulate it. The Federal Government cannot regulate our way \nto a solution--think about it--even if you put out regulations. If the \nObama administration could say, OK, only these kind of energies can be \nproduced and they have to be produced this way--even if that worked in \nthis country, what about the rest of the globe?\n  This is a global issue. So instead of holding up the development and \ndeployment of these new technologies with regulatory barriers, we need \nto empower that investment. As you empower investment and you produce \nenergy and you deploy new technologies, you get better environmental \nstewardship.\n  It doesn't happen in just this country. It will happen in other \ncountries too. Why? Because they will adopt the technology we develop. \nThat is how it works. When somebody develops a better technology, then \nother companies, other countries adopt it.\n  So let me contrast what is going on right now. One of the things I \nworked on both as a Governor and now here in the Senate is getting the \nKeystone XL Pipeline approved. It has been more than 5 years--more than \n5 years--and the administration still refuses to make a decision. That \nis defeat by delay, sidelining $5.3 billion of private investment that \nthe administration's own studies show will create jobs. The final \nenvironmental impact study produced by the Department of State said\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nthat the Keystone XL Pipeline project will create 42,000 jobs without \nspending a penny of Federal money. The $5.3 billion in private \ninvestment would create 42,000 jobs at a time when we need to get the \neconomy growing and creating jobs. It also will create hundreds of \nmillions in revenue that will address the deficit and the debt at the \nlocal, State, and Federal level. It will also create hundreds of \nmillions in revenue over many years at a time when we have deficit and \ndebt without raising taxes. It also strengthens national security.\n\n  There is no question when you go to the public and say: Do we want to \nget our oil from the Middle East or would we rather get our oil from \nright here in the United States and Canada, if we can produce it \nourselves and get it from Canada, is that what we want or do we want to \ncontinue to rely on the Middle East, obviously that is a pretty easy \nanswer, isn't it?\n  In a recent public poll performed last week, March 7, by the \nWashington Post and ABC, two-thirds of Americans support building the \nKeystone XL Pipeline and 22 percent oppose. After 5 years and study \nafter study, the administration still can't make a decision. Yet two-\nthirds of Americans know what we need to do. Two-thirds of the American \npeople say: Build the pipeline. What are you waiting for? Only 22 \npercent oppose it.\n  The final environmental impact--I believe it is either the fourth or \nfifth environmental impact study--done by the Obama administration came \nout and again it showed there was no significant environmental impact. \nThat was released at the end of January.\n  The inspector general's report that was released at the end of \nFebruary said there was no conflict of interest by the company hired to \ndo the environmental impact statement. Yet still we wait. There is \nstill no decision. So you wonder why. You look at our economy and you \nsay: Why isn't our economy growing faster? Why isn't our economy \nstronger? Why isn't unemployment going down? Why is there so much \ninvestment capital sidelined? Why aren't businesses growing? Why aren't \nsmall businesses growing? Why aren't small businesses across the \ncountry hiring people? Then we see regulations which are holding up \napprovals for more than 5 years. Maybe that is the answer.\n  America has always been the place where everybody came to do business \nbecause it was easier to do business. As a result our economy has \nalways been the greatest economy in the world. When we have a \ngovernment that can't even make a decision on a regulatory approval to \napprove a project billions of dollars after its own agency has come out \ntime and time and time again and said there is no reason not to go \nforward, maybe that is the problem.\n  Obviously the people of this country know that. That is why when you \ngo out and ask them a commonsense question, they give you a commonsense \nanswer: Build the pipeline. We listened to the arguments about how we \ncan't build the pipeline because of CO2 emissions because \nusing oil from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada, will create \nCO2.\n  The reality is--and as the environmental impact study done by the \nState Department clearly shows--you have more CO2 emissions \nwithout the pipeline than you do building it. How does that make sense? \nHow does it make sense to hold it up on the basis of CO2 \nemissions when you have more CO2 emissions without the \npipeline than with it?\n  Of course the net result is instead of having the energy come to the \nUnited States, it goes to China. And what do we do? We keep importing \noil from the Middle East.\n  What I am talking about is commonsense legislation. That was just one \nexample. I can give you others.\n  Earlier this year we passed a bill I put forward with other Members. \nIt is the BLM bill, Bureau of Land Management streamlining bill. It is \na simple, commonsense bill. It simply says BLM offices can work across \nState lines. For example, the BLM office in Miles City, MT, can work \nacross the State line in North Dakota. That just makes sense because we \nhave so much oil activity in our State. Not only can they work in our \nState, they can also work on the reservation.\n  We have the three affiliated tribes reservations: Mandan, Hidatsa, \nArikara. It is a very large reservation in our State with incredible \noil activity, but they have to get all these regulatory permits to \ndrill wells too, and the Bureau of Land Management could not keep up in \nour State or on the reservation. Now they can bring their people from \nother offices in to help.\n  When we look at this, it is not just about producing more energy, is \nit? That is a simple, commonsense act which we passed in both this \nChamber and the House. It is now law. It not only helps us produce more \nenergy in our States, such as North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and other \nplaces, but it also helps our reservations.\n  We now have activity on the three affiliated tribes' reservations. \nThey have tremendous employment and tremendous growth. They are getting \nrevenue from their oil wells that they can use for social programs to \nhelp needy families, to pay for education, and to use for roads and \nvital infrastructure.\n  Tomorrow--along with Senator Barrasso and Senator Enzi of Wyoming--we \nwill introduce another similar bill that makes it easier to build gas-\ngathering systems both on reservations and off. Instead of flaring off \ngas at the wellhead site, you are able to build gathering systems and \nget that gas to pipelines and get it to market and use it. Again, that \nis not just about producing more energy; that is an example of better \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  By putting these commonsense measures into place, we create economic \nactivity and more energy, but as I said from the outset, we get better \nenvironmental stewardship. I mentioned that the Domestic Energy and \nJobs Act is part of that comprehensive plan to have the States first \nall-of-the-above energy approach for our country; that legislation will \nhelp us produce more energy both onshore and offshore on our public \nlands.\n  Again, that is good for all the reasons I have identified but think \nabout it in this context too: By producing more energy on public lands, \nwe will also create more revenue for the Federal Government. Without \nraising taxes, we create more revenue for the Federal Government. That \nis important to address our deficit and our debt.\n  We have something else coming up that we are going to have to find a \nrevenue source for; that is, a highway bill. In September the highway \nbill expires, and we are going to have to have a highway bill. We want \na 5-year highway bill that is a very strong, well-funded highway bill \nto address the infrastructure needs in this country. Whether you talk \nto Republicans or Democrats in this Chamber, they will tell you we need \nto address infrastructure across this country.\n  In order to address infrastructure, we have to have a way to pay for \nit. How are we going to pay for it? How are we going to pay for that \nnext highway bill? Right now the trust fund doesn't have the money to \ndo it, so we are going to have to find a source. How about we tap into \nmore energy on our Federal lands onshore and offshore? Without raising \ntaxes, we have a revenue source so we can actually pass a 5-year \nhighway bill. That is a long-term revenue source that we can actually \nuse to fund the highway bill and address the infrastructure in this \ncountry.\n  It is about more than energy. This commonsense approach to building \nan energy plan for our country--and again it is not that big 1,000-\npage, one-size-fits-all Federal approach where everybody has to do the \nsame thing. It is a step-by-step process to build a comprehensive plan \nthat empowers the States to build on their strengths and make things \nhappen. We can do it. It has all of those benefits. As I mentioned \nearlier, it even comes down to our national security.\n  I will close on this point: Think about what is happening in Western \nEurope. We have a situation where Russia--President Putin has decided \nhe is going to invade Ukraine and he is going to take Crimea and put it \nunder Russian rule and maybe more. We will see. So what do we do? What \ndoes the European Union do?\n  One of the decisions the European Union has to address is the energy \nsituation. They are asking: What is the energy situation in Europe? \nRight now 30 percent of the natural gas the European Union utilizes \ncomes from Russia and half of that goes through Ukraine.\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nIt is a particularly acute issue for West Germany.\n  What do they do? Are they going to be willing to get tough with Putin \nwhen they are dependent on Russia for their natural gas for their \nenergy? What decision do they make?\n  The same thing for our country: What decisions do we make when we \ncontinue to get our oil from places such as the Middle East and \nVenezuela? We say no to getting oil from Canada and force our closest \nfriend and ally to turn to exporting that oil to China.\n  How do we deal with China? How are we dealing in that situation with \nour allies, such as Canada, that want to work with us, and how are we \ndealing with countries that have different interests than we do?\n  All of these things tie together to a good energy plan and a good \nenergy policy. We all want better environmental stewardship, but we \nwant solutions. The American people want solutions. They want \ncommonsense, real solutions to address these problems. We put forward \nan approach that can make a big difference for our country, and I call \non my colleagues to join with me and to work to put that in place for \nthe good of our country today and for future generations.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to honor and thank Shaun \nCarey, who is retiring from his position as Sparks city manager on \nApril 4, 2014.\n  After serving the city of Sparks for over 20 years, Sparks native \nShaun Carey leaves behind an impressive legacy of accomplishments. He \nplayed a major role in streamlining city services, in building Golden \nEagle Regional Park--one of the largest artificial turf sports \ncomplexes in the United States--and in turning an abandoned hole in the \nground into the Sparks Marina, a community gathering point and anchor \nfor further development. Mr. Carey has also helped lead city staff in \nrebranding Sparks as a premier event destination, hosting events in \n``downtown'' Victorian Square and throughout the city.\n  Shaun Carey grew up in Nevada, graduating from Sparks High School in \n1975 and receiving his civil engineering degree from the University of \nNevada, Reno shortly thereafter. Mr. Carey began his career in public \nservice in 1982 and worked as a civil engineer, traffic engineer, and \ncity engineer throughout the West before he returned to Sparks in 1992 \nto assume the position of public works director. He held this position \nfor 7 years, becoming assistant city manager in 1999. Just 1 year \nlater, in 2000, he was named City Manager.\n  Mr. Carey's training as an engineer reflected his desire to create \nsystems designed to improve citizens' lives. This background also \nexplains his longevity and success as a public servant; as he told the \nSparks Tribune, ``I got to do things I enjoyed. I got to be a part of \nbuilding communities and producing things that I found very \nrewarding.''\n  Geno Martini, the mayor of Sparks, spoke eloquently of Mr. Carey's \ncontributions to the Silver State, saying, ``I can't find a big-enough \nword to tell you how I feel about Shaun and the professionalism, \ndedication, and commitment he has shown for more than two decades . . . \n[He] has gotten things done, and is largely why so many residents are \nproud to call Sparks home.''\n  We thank Mr. Carey for proudly serving his hometown of Sparks and \nwish him, his wife Jane, and his sons Scott and Pat all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1514-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1514-S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, had I been here yesterday, I would have \nvoted for S. 1917, the Victims Protection Act of 2014. This important \nbill would increase protections for victims of sexual assault in the \nArmed Forces, while retaining commanders' authority to convene courts \nmartial.\n  Every allegation, every anecdote, and every instance of sexual \nassault in our military is unacceptable. An important debate has been \ntaking place in Congress and among our Armed Forces, and I am grateful \nthat we aren't sitting idly by while this problem claims more victims \nand threatens the integrity and effectiveness of our Nation's military.\n  We have heard from the victims, and we have recognized that change \nwas needed to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable. With \nthat knowledge, Congress included over 30 reforms in last year's \nnational defense authorization Act, NDAA, including removing the \nability of commanders to overturn jury convictions; requiring review of \ndecisions not to refer charges; criminalizing retaliation against \nvictims; and providing special victims' counsel to victims of sexual \nassault to support and assist them through all proceedings.\n  The Armed Forces have also instituted major reforms and worked hard \nto improve the reporting climate for victims. As a result, the Marine \nCorps, for example, has seen a large increase in sexual assault \nreporting since initiating a sexual assault prevention and response \ncampaign last year.\n  I supported the NDAA reforms as well as the measure the Senate passed \nyesterday. We should give these reforms the opportunity to work before \nenacting any change that would take the matter out of the chain of \ncommand. Some very strong voices agree.\n  First, according to a congressionally mandated independent panel that \nexamined the role of the commander reported definitively that it would \nbe a mistake to remove the chain of command's authority to convene \ncourts martial. That panel, called the Response Systems to Adult Sexual \nAssault Crimes Panel, also found that removing courts-martial authority \nwould not reduce the incidence of sexual assault, increase reporting of \nsexual assaults, improve the quality of prosecutions, increase the \nconviction rate, increase confidence among victims about the fairness \nof the military justice system, or reduce concerns about potential \nretaliation.\n  The independent panel also examined our allies' military justice \nsystems in Israel, the UK, Australia, and Canada for comparison and \nconcluded that none of the improvements they witnessed in the reporting \nof sexual assault in their militaries were connected to the role of the \ncommander. The panel also found that there was no evidence that \nremoving the commander from the decisionmaking process increased \nreporting of incidences of sexual assault.\n  Second, Vice Admiral DeRenzi, Judge Advocate General in the U.S. \nNavy, has spoken eloquently about the issue and underscored the \nessential role of the commander in solving the problem in testimony \nbefore SASC and before the Response Systems Panel. I encourage everyone \nto read her full testimony before these panels. In addition to urging \nCongress to retain commanders' authority, it details major reforms \nimplemented in the Navy in the past 3 years and demonstrates the Navy's \ncommitment to eradicating sexual assault from their ranks. I would like \nto highlight some of her statements for the record.\n  In her testimony, Admiral DeRenzi said:\n  ``Beyond the immeasurable toll on individual victims, sexual assault \nis an existential threat to our core values and directly impacts \noperational readiness and unit cohesion. This is rightfully recognized \nas a leadership issue, not merely a legal issue. Exemplifying this \ncommitment, the Navy implemented a multi-faceted, commander driven \napproach to address awareness and training, prevention, victim \nresponse, and accountability.''\n  ``Permanent, effective change must be implemented through our \ncommanders.''\n  ``Additionally, any legislation must retain the commander's authority \nover\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nhis or her Sailors. Commanders are responsible and accountable for the \nsafety, health and welfare of their people; commanders must have \nauthority commensurate with this responsibility, and that includes the \nauthority to maintain good order and discipline.''\n  My commitment to taking decisive action when necessary to ensure the \nsecurity and success of our men and women in uniform had me support the \nreforms in the most recent NDAA and support Senator McCaskill's bill. \nTaken together, these reforms meaningfully will change how our Armed \nForces address the scourge of military sexual assaults, but they do so \nin a way that recognizes the unique purpose of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice and ensures that our commanders have the tools they \nneed to facilitate that much needed, long-overdue change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1515-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING THOMAS EDWARD\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I was saddened to learn of the passing of \nThomas Edward ``Ed'' Braswell, Jr., and I offer my sincerest \ncondolences to his family. Two former chairmen of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Sam Nunn and John Warner, joined in expressing \ntheir gratitude for Mr. Braswell's exemplary service at a recent \ncommittee hearing.\n  Mr. Braswell joined the Armed Services Committee staff in 1953 and \nserved as staff director and chief counsel to the committee under the \nleadership of two of the titans of the Senate--Richard Russell and John \nStennis--for 23 years. Mr. Braswell served the committee from the \nbeginning of the Eisenhower Presidency to the end of Gerald Ford's, \nhelping see the committee through most of the Cold War and all of the \nVietnam war and its aftermath. As chief counsel to the committee, Mr. \nBraswell helped to write the first of our annual National Defense \nAuthorization Acts in 1962, and stayed on long enough to play a key \nrole in the next 14 NDAAs, helping start a tradition of legislative \naccomplishment that continues to this day.\n  The Armed Services Committee has been blessed over the years with a \nnumber of staff members who have served the committee for a period of \ndecades, dedicating their careers to the committee, the Congress, our \nnational security, and our men and women in uniform and their families. \nOur staffers work behind the scenes, providing us with the informed \nadvice that we need as we consider the myriad of national security \nissues facing the Department of Defense and the Congress. The long \nhours and large workloads required for such a career often require \nsignificant sacrifices by both our staffers and their families. Without \nthe advice and assistance of these committed public servants, the \nbusiness of the Senate could not be carried out.\n  Ed Braswell began his career by serving in the old Army Air Corps \nduring World War II. He went on to go to Harvard Law School and worked \nbriefly for the Department of Justice before joining the committee \nstaff. In addition to his hefty commitments in the U.S. Senate, Mr. \nBraswell also made time to give back to his community. He served as the \nchairman of the Alexandria Planning Commission for more than 30 years \nand was instrumental in many of the commission's historic preservation \nefforts.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing the mighty \ncontributions of our staff members, both past and present. It is the \nhard work and dedication of individuals like Ed Braswell who make our \nwork possible, and for that we are very grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1515-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2014 PARALYMPIANS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to recognize the impressive \naccomplishments of the New Hampshire athletes who will be representing \nthe United States this month in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, \nRussia.\n  These athletes are an inspiration to all of New Hampshire and \nathletes around the country. They have exhibited incredible dedication \nto their respective sports and have proven their remarkable abilities \nin competitions nationally and internationally. A selection to the U.S. \nParalympic team is a great honor and a fitting reward for their years \nof hard work and training.\n  With access to the unparalleled beauty and terrain of the White \nMountains, thousands of miles of trails, and nearly 1,000 lakes, \nGranite Staters are at home on the snow, on the ice and in the air.\n  New Hampshire is proud to acknowledge our State's Paralympians and is \nexcited to show the world their talents during the Sochi games.\n  Taylor Chace of Hampton Falls, NH will be competing in sled hockey. A \n3-time Paralympian, a member of the defending Paralympic gold medal \nsled hockey team and reigning top defenseman from the 2010 Paralympic \nGames, Taylor will hopefully help Team USA win the gold medal again.\n  Chris Devlin-Young of Bethlehem, NH will be competing in alpine \nskiing. As a five-time member of Team USA and 4-time Paralympic \nmedalist, we are excited to see Chris compete again on the Paralympic \nstage and hope that he can regain the podium in Sochi.\n  Tyler Walker of Franconia, NH will be competing in alpine skiing. We \nare rooting for Tyler who is representing Team USA for the third time, \nand are hopeful that his previous Paralympic experience and recent \nsuccesses at the World Cup and U.S. Paralympics Alpine Skiing National \nChampionships will translate into victory this year in Sochi.\n  Each member of the U.S. Paralympics team has overcome incredible \nchallenges and with their resolve, hard work and courage, they \nrepresent the best of our Nation.\n  It is my honor to congratulate these New Hampshire athletes.

Madam President, I wish to ask my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the distinguished public servant and deacon, Mayor \nWillie Davis, Jr. Mayor Davis began his tenure as Mayor in 1992, though \nevidence of his service begins much sooner. During the Korean Conflict, \nMayor Davis served the country he loved as a member of the United \nStates Army. He also happily served Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church \nas a diligent and hard-working deacon, treasurer, and Sunday school \nteacher for over 20 years.\n  Mayor Willie Davis, Jr. devoted his career to building up his city of \nFarmerville and continuing to expedite its economic development. During \nhis four terms as Mayor of Farmerville, Mayor Davis was instrumental in \nconstructing the Farmerville Recreation Center which now bears his \nname. He also helped to build new police and fire complexes and led the \nexpansion of ConAgra Poultry facilities into Farmerville.\n  Perhaps Mayor Davis' most memorable impression came from his \nrelationships with the constituents that he served, and even those that \nhe did not. Mayor Davis met no strangers; he was a mentor to many, an \nexample to others, and a friend to all. Mayor Davis' motto and the \nwords that he lived by, ``May the work I've done, speak for me,'' \nbecame more than just his campaign slogan. Let us remember his words as \nwe reflect on his life, the great works that filled it, and his impact \non Farmerville and the entire State of Louisiana.\n  Mayor Davis has been and continues to be an inspiration to all those \nwho have benefitted from his 16 year career as Mayor of Farmerville and \nhis decades of service to his church and community. It is with my \nheartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my colleagues to join me \nalong with Mayor Willie Davis Jr.'s family in recognizing the life and \nmany accomplishments of this incredible Mayor, mentor, and deacon, as \nwell as his lasting impact throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1515-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1515-S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               KCAM RADIO\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

Today I commend this \nremarkable achievement.\n  KCAM signed on the air March 27, 1964, the day of the magnitude 9.2 \nGood Friday Earthquake that devastated Anchorage and caused a tsunami \nthat wiped out Valdez and other coastal communities. The community of\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nGlennallen also felt the effects of the quake.\n  KCAM had not yet received Federal Communications Commission \npermission to broadcast, but since their tower was undamaged, the Civil \nDefense Authority asked the station to go live under Emergency Orders. \nThey signed on and kept residents, emergency workers, and those fleeing \nthe damaged areas up-to-date.\n  It was quite a beginning for a shoestring station that was founded \nfive decades ago by the late Vince Joy. In 2014, the station is still \ngoing strong with a state-of-the-art studio, reaching listeners \nthroughout the Copper River Valley via the airwaves and online \nstreaming.\n  Along the way, KCAM has earned awards from the Associated Press and \nwas named Inspirational Station of the Year by Skylight Network and \nSmall Market Station of the Year by Focus on the Family.\n  I want to extend my congratulations to the current crew at the \nstation, including president and manager Scott Yahr, program director \nMichelle Eastty, special projects manager Roger Bovee, and countless \nother staff and interns over the years who helped keep it going.\n  As part of their celebration, a newly released book commemorates 50 \nyears of uninterrupted operation by chronicling stories from listeners \nwho have been affected by the broadcasting and reprinting their photos. \nAnyone who has lived in a small town knows that a radio station is \noften at the center of the fabric of the community. Such is the case \nwith KCAM, which not only provides music, news, weather, sports, talk \nshows, and entertainment, but also sends personal messages and makes \ncommunity announcements.\n  I send my best wishes to my friends at KCAM Radio, the ``Voice of the \nCopper River Valley,'' as they observe their anniversary in April \n2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1516-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JEFF BAYLESS\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Jeff \nBayless. Jeff was a senior captain in the Anchorage Fire Department. He \nwas born and raised Alaskan, and lived his entire life bettering our \ngreat State. Jeff began his road to serve in 1986 when he became a \ncertified State of Alaska EMT. He then went on to complete paramedic \ntraining, and began serving with the Mat-Su Borough EMS and the Central \nMat-Su Fire Department.\n  In 1991, Jeff was hired by the Anchorage Fire Department. And in 1995 \nwhen the Fire Department Emergency Medical Services and Fire Operations \nmerged, Jeff made the move from paramedic to firefighter. In May of \n2005, Jeff's steadfast dedication was recognized when he was promoted \nto senior fire captain. He served at Fire Station 9 in South Anchorage \nand Fire Station 11 in Eagle River.\n  Although a hero in is chosen occupation, Jeff was also a champion in \nhis community. As a North Star Bible Camp board member, a youth \ninstructor, and with his involvement in the Alaska Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial Committee, he was a pillar of leadership and a stalwart \nexample of selfless service.\n  Jeff died after participating in a training activity on Friday March \n7, 2014. He will be sorely missed. His commitment to God, family, and \ncommunity will be felt for generations to come. Jeff Bayless is truly \nan Alaskan hero, and we mourn with his wife, Gail, his entire family, \nand his brothers and sisters in the Fire Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1516-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1516-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1516-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 4:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2019.

Res. 378\n\n       Whereas the recent unprovoked Russian military occupation \n     of the Crimea region of Ukraine, and further military threats \n     against additional Ukrainian territory, are an affront to \n     international norms and agreements and a threat to global \n     peace and security;\n       Whereas, under President Vladimir Putin, the Russian \n     Federation has a history of bullying neighboring countries in \n     an attempt to rebuild Russian dominance on its borders--often \n     under the guise of protecting Russian\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n     citizens--including forcibly seizing the South Ossetia and \n     Abkhazia regions of the independent Republic of Georgia in \n     2008;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation continues to illegally \n     occupy South Ossetia and Abkhazia and has erected fences \n     along administrative boundary lines and permanent military \n     bases in violation of the cease fire agreement negotiated \n     with the European Union;\n       Whereas, during 2013, then-President of Ukraine Viktor \n     Yanukovych faced similar Russian coercion to not sign a long-\n     negotiated Association Agreement with the European Union, \n     including threats to gas contracts, the supply of which the \n     Russian Federation turned off in 2006 and 2009;\n       Whereas, in November 2013, President Yanukovych abruptly \n     canceled plans to sign the Association Agreement, saying \n     Ukraine could not afford to sacrifice trade with the Russian \n     Federation as a result;\n       Whereas, for three ensuing months, hundreds of thousands of \n     protesters in Ukraine endured cold and government harassment \n     and violence to protest the decision and demand closer ties \n     to the West;\n       Whereas, on February 20, 2014, Ukrainian security forces, \n     including heavily armed snipers, fired on demonstrators in \n     Kyiv, leaving dozens dead and the people of Ukraine reeling \n     from the most lethal day of violence since the Soviet era, \n     and many of Yanukovych's political allies, including the \n     mayor of the Kyiv, resigned from his governing Party of \n     Regions to protest the bloodshed;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the Ukrainian parliament \n     found then-President Yanukovych unable to fulfill his duties, \n     exercised its constitutional powers to remove him from \n     office, and set an election for May 25, 2014, to select his \n     replacement;\n       Whereas, amid Ukraine's economic hardships, President \n     Yanukovych amassed a lavish secret estate that included a \n     private zoo, exotic gardens, numerous automobiles, and a tall \n     ship;\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2014, heavily armed soldiers \n     without identification or insignia began securing key \n     facilities in the Crimea, including its regional parliament \n     and two airports, and in the ensuing days encircled Ukrainian \n     military facilities and gained effective control of the \n     region;\n       Whereas the military forces are clearly Russian troops, and \n     on March 1, 2014, President Putin sought and received rubber \n     stamp parliamentary approval to use military force against \n     greater Ukraine, having argued that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation acted because of the ``threat of violence \n     from ultranationalists'';\n       Whereas there has been no credible evidence of serious \n     threats to Russian citizens in Crimea or elsewhere in \n     Ukraine, and the Russian Federation's military invasion has \n     been widely condemned internationally;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation, as a signatory to the 1994 \n     Budapest Memorandum, reaffirmed its commitment to Ukraine, to \n     respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing \n     borders of Ukraine, to refrain from the threat or use of \n     force against the territorial integrity or political \n     independence of Ukraine, to refrain from economic coercion to \n     subordinate Ukraine to Russia's interests, and to consult in \n     the event a situation arises that raises a question \n     concerning these commitments;\n       Whereas, in 1997, the Russian Federation and Ukraine signed \n     a friendship treaty, during which time Russian President \n     Boris Yeltsin said in Kyiv, ``We respect and honor the \n     territorial integrity of Ukraine.'';\n       Whereas the Russian Federation, as a participating state in \n     the Final Act of the Conference for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe in 1975 (Helsinki Final Act), committed to respect \n     the sovereign equality and individuality of other \n     participating states, including the right of every state to \n     territorial integrity and to freedom and political \n     independence, to refrain from the threat or use of force \n     against the territorial integrity or political independence \n     of any state, to regard as inviolable all one another's \n     frontiers as well as the frontiers of all states in Europe, \n     and to refrain from making each other's territory the object \n     of military occupation;\n       Whereas, under United Nations Charter Article 2, all \n     members shall settle international disputes by peaceful means \n     in a manner that international peace and security are not \n     endangered and refrain from the threat or use of force \n     against the territorial integrity or political independence \n     of any state;\n       Whereas President Putin himself wrote in 2013, ``Under \n     current international law, force is permitted only in self-\n     defense or by the decision of the Security Council. Anything \n     else is unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and \n     would constitute an act of aggression.'';\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Council stated that Russian \n     military action against Ukraine is a breach of international \n     law and contravenes the principles of the NATO-Russia Council \n     and the Partnership for Peace and that Russia must respect \n     its obligations under the United Nations Charter and \n     principles of the Organization for Security and Co-operation \n     in Europe (OSCE), on which peace and stability in Europe \n     rest;\n       Whereas leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, \n     the United Kingdom, and the United States and the presidents \n     of the European Council and the European Commission condemned \n     the Russian Federation's clear violation of Ukrainian \n     sovereignty and territorial integrity, in contravention of \n     the Russian Federation's obligations under the United Nations \n     Charter and its 1997 basing agreement with Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2014, President Barack Obama \n     stated that the United States is ``deeply concerned by \n     reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation \n     inside of Ukraine'' and that it ``would be a clear violation \n     of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and \n     sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international \n     law''; and\n       Whereas President Obama pledged that ``the United States \n     will stand with the international community in affirming that \n     there will be costs for any military intervention in \n     Ukraine'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the unprovoked and illegal Russian military \n     seizure of the Ukrainian Crimea and demands the immediate \n     withdrawal of Russian forces except as specifically allowed \n     for by treaty;\n       (2) demands the immediate release of besieged Ukrainian \n     security forces in Crimea, who have shown remarkable \n     restraint under threat;\n       (3) warns that failure to do so or any additional military \n     action against other areas of Ukraine will lead to swift and \n     significant consequences in the Russian Federation's \n     relations with the United States and those nations who share \n     our views;\n       (4) urges the President to use all appropriate economic \n     elements of United States national power, in coordination \n     with United States allies, including loan guarantees matched \n     with requirements of international financial institutions \n     regarding Ukrainian economic reforms and transparency, to \n     strengthen the Ukrainian economy and protect the \n     independence, sovereignty, and territorial and economic \n     integrity of Ukraine;\n       (5) urges the President to use appropriate economic and \n     diplomatic measures, including calibrated sanctions, against \n     those responsible for the illegal seizure of Crimea;\n       (6) urges the President to propose to G-8 nations to \n     suspend the Russian Federation, and to propose to our NATO \n     allies to suspend operation of the NATO-Russia Council and \n     suspend the Russian Federation's military and diplomatic \n     representation at NATO;\n       (7) condemns the economic coercion pursued by the Russian \n     Federation beginning in July 2013 against Ukraine, Moldova, \n     Lithuania, and other countries in the region in order to \n     obstruct closer ties between the European Union and the \n     countries of the Eastern Partnership and supports the people \n     of Ukraine in their desire to forge closer ties with Europe;\n       (8) supports assisting Ukraine and United States allies in \n     the region in gaining energy security in order to alleviate \n     their vulnerability to the Russian Federation's threats and \n     manipulations;\n       (9) expresses its continuing support for democratic allies \n     who regularly face aggression on their borders from the \n     Government of the Russian Federation and supports enhanced \n     security cooperation with, and security assistance to, states \n     in Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine;\n       (10) encourages governments in Europe to take similar and \n     coordinated actions to make it clear to the Government of the \n     Russian Federation that violating the territorial integrity \n     of sovereign nations will have swift and significant \n     consequences;\n       (11) calls for the immediate acceptance of a credible \n     international observer mission in Crimea and other parts of \n     the Ukraine;\n       (12) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     seriously engage with the Government of Ukraine in a \n     political dialogue on a political and diplomatic path that \n     respects Ukrainian sovereignty and the Crimea's complex \n     historic and ethnic makeup;\n       (13) supports the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to \n     bring to justice those responsible for the acts of violence \n     related to the anti-government protests that began on \n     November 21, 2013;\n       (14) supports the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to \n     recover and return to the Ukrainian state funds stolen by \n     former President Yanukovych, his family, and other current \n     and former members of the Government of Ukraine and elites; \n     and\n       (15) calls upon the leadership of the Federation \n     Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to reconsider \n     its decision to place World Cup 2018 matches in Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/11/senate-section/article/S1521-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1521-S1522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 379--CONGRATULATING THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY \n IFC/PANHELLENIC DANCE MARATHON (``THON'') ON ITS CONTINUED SUCCESS IN \n  SUPPORT OF THE FOUR DIAMONDS FUND AT PENN STATE HERSHEY CHILDREN'S \n                                HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following \nresolution;
