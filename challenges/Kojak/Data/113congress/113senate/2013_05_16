Mr. President, for months my Republican colleagues have \nargued the Obama administration has engaged in a coverup regarding the \ntragic events surrounding an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. \nThe administration provided Members of Congress with over 100 pages of \ne-mails--sent following that attack--during closed-door sessions. The \ne-mails proved there was simply no coverup.\n  Yet Republicans, with full knowledge of these e-mails, claimed the \nWhite House was hiding the truth. Yesterday, the administration \nreleased even more e-mails to the public. This is only the latest \neffort by the administration to ensure transparency for the media and \nthe public regarding this awful attack on Americans.\n  This new information came out for a number of reasons, not the least \nof which is that we know the press corps spent most of the past week \nchasing a story based on an e-mail that didn't exist. It was fabricated \nby a Republican aide and then reported as fact. It is a sad commentary \nthat Republicans are so dead set on embarrassing the President, the \nForeign Service, the CIA, and our military they would actually lie to a \nnews organization about the contents of an e-mail and let that news \norganization report their lies as facts.\n  The attack on Benghazi is an issue of life and death. We should be \nfocused on tracking down the terrorists who committed this act and \nbringing them to justice, not on smear politics and false scandals. I \nhope the media will realize they were fed a false bill of goods and be \nmore skeptical next time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3537-8", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3537-S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 6 short years ago the prospects for a \nbipartisan solution to America's broken immigration system seemed \nbleak. Despite support from congressional Democrats and a Republican \nPresident, an immigration reform proposal had been defeated on a \nprocedural vote. Let's say that again. Despite support from \ncongressional Democrats and a Republican President, we couldn't get \nenough Republicans in the Senate to move forward on a reform proposal. \nIt was defeated, I repeat, on a procedural vote in the Senate.\n  But one man, who was a long-time member of the Judiciary Committee \nand who had been chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees \nand Border Security for decades--Senator Ted Kennedy--reminded us all \nthe reform for which he had fought so hard would pass one day and that \nday could not be far off. This is what he said when that bill was \ndefeated:\n\n       America always finds a way to solve its problems, expand \n     its frontiers, and move closer to its ideals. It is not \n     always easy, but it is the American way. . . . I believe we \n     will soon succeed where we failed today, and that we will \n     enact the kind of comprehensive reform that our ideals and \n     our national security demand.\n\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n\n  Ted Kennedy said that in 2007. He always spoke from back here, and I \ncan still hear his booming voice, and I can hear him saying this. Our \nfriend Ted Kennedy was right, and I believe the time for commonsense \nimmigration reform has come. I am sorry Senator Kennedy is not alive to \nsee the widespread bipartisan support for the legislation being \nconsidered today in the Judiciary Committee, legislation that I will \nshortly bring before the full Senate. Senator Kennedy would be very \nsatisfied with the efforts of the Gang of 8--four Democrats and four \nRepublicans.\n  Even though Ted Kennedy was known as one of America's great \nprogressives, his legacy is that he worked with liberals, \nconservatives, Independents--he worked with everyone--to get work done. \nHe always was willing to set aside partisanship, and that is what the \nGang of 8 has done and that is why he would like this so much.\n  This Gang of 8 has addressed a critical issue facing our Nation, and \nhe would applaud the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nleadership of his long-time friend he served with on that committee \nfor, oh, it must be four decades. Kennedy and Leahy, they did a lot of \nwork together, and Senator Leahy has done so much in this committee--\nwork that he has done in the last several weeks to refine and perfect \nthe reasonable proposal of the Gang of 8.\n  So it is gratifying to see the momentum behind commonsense reforms \nthat will make our country safer and help 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants get right with the law. Although neither Republicans nor \nDemocrats will support each and every proposal or aspect of this \nlegislation, it is reassuring to see the diverse coalition that has \nformed in support of real reform, commonsense reform--reform that \nimproves our dysfunctional legal immigration system, reform that \ncontinues to secure our borders, reform that requires 11 million \nundocumented people to pass a criminal background check, and pay fines \nand taxes to start on the path to earn their citizenship. We can't do \nthis piecemeal, and we can't do it without a pathway to earning \ncitizenship.\n  The thorough and open process underway in the Judiciary Committee is \nexemplary of how the Senate should work. So far the committee has \nconsidered 62 amendments to the original proposal, some from Democrats \nand some from Republicans. In fact, the committee has adopted 12 \nRepublican amendments, including measures to strengthen the border and \nimprove our legal immigration system.\n  The Senate completed work on important water resource legislation \nyesterday--a lot is going on in the Senate--and we are now going to \nbegin consideration of a crucial piece of legislation dealing with \nagriculture. I commend and applaud the chairman of that committee \nDebbie Stabenow. She is a very good legislator. They got the bill out \nof that committee in a very quick fashion. So I repeat, I admire what \nshe has done. She also has a new ranking member there, Thad Cochran \nfrom Mississippi, who is a fine man and a good legislator.\n  As I have said, as soon as it is ready, I am going to bring that \nimmigration legislation to the floor. We are going to start on the farm \nbill Monday, and I am going to bring the immigration bill to the floor \nregardless of whether we have completed action on the farm bill. \nAlthough immigration is a complex and controversial issue that deserves \nample time for thoughtful debate and consideration, it is also too \nimportant to delay action any longer.\n  As a Senator from Nevada and whose father-in-law was born in Russia \nand immigrated to the United States, I have witnessed firsthand the \nheartbreak of our broken immigration system. I see the heartbreak it \nhas caused for immigrants and their families. So this issue is very \npersonal to me, as I have just indicated, and it is very personal to \nevery immigrant family striving to build a better life in America. That \nis why they came here.\n  The time has come for permanent solutions--solutions that are tough \nbut fair, solutions that fix our broken legal immigration system, \nsolutions that punish unscrupulous employers that exploit immigrants \nand drag down wages for every worker in America, solutions that pull 11 \nmillion people out of the shadows so they can pay taxes, learn English, \nand get right with the law, solutions that put them on the path to \ncitizenship so they can contribute fully to their communities and to \nthis country.\n  I will do everything in my power to have this bill become law. I am \nconfident the time is right. As Senator Kennedy put it, the kind of \ncomprehensive reform that our ideals and our national security demand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3538-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nRepublican leader finishes his time and a quorum call is made, that the \ntime during the quorum be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           IRS Investigation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last night the President took an \nimportant symbolic step in accepting the resignation of acting IRS \nCommissioner Miller. I had called for this resignation on Monday, when \nwe learned Mr. Miller signed his name to one, if not more, letters that \nwe now know couldn't possibly have been truthful--couldn't possibly \nhave been truthful. But let us be clear: This symbolic step was just \nthat, symbolic.\n  What Americans want right now is answers about what happened at the \nIRS, why it wasn't disclosed earlier, who is ultimately accountable for \nthis behavior, and assurances this kind of thing isn't going to go on \nat the IRS or anywhere else in the Federal Government because the \nallegations of ideological targeting only continue to multiply. This is \ncontinuing to multiply.\n  This morning I would like to focus on just one of those incidents. It \nis the case of a group called the National Organization for Marriage. \nLast May Senator Hatch, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, \nsent a letter to the IRS inquiring about reports that someone--\nsomeone--at the IRS had leaked confidential donor information from \nNOM--the National Organization for Marriage--to an advocacy group whose \npolitical goals were in direct conflict with its own.\n  NOM has since released documents suggesting that this information \ncame from one source--from within the IRS itself.\n  All this took place, by the way, in the middle of a national \npolitical campaign. Significantly, one of the NOM donors whose name was \nleaked was none other than Mitt Romney.\n  And what about the group it was leaked to?\n  It was headed by a guy who was named a national co-chair of the Obama \ncampaign, and who published the confidential donor information on the \nwebsite of the organization he ran, an organization opposed to the \ngoals of NOM.\n  So here is another situation that, at the very least, clearly merits \ninvestigation.\n  There are allegations here that someone at the IRS committed a very \nserious crime that had the effect of chilling the speech of a political \norganization that happened to be on the wrong side of the current \nadministration.\n  Yet, a year later, Senator Hatch has yet to hear anything back from \nthe\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nIRS. And, according to the folks at NOM, neither have they.\n  Last year the people at NOM said they brought their concerns about \nthis potentially illegal activity to the IRS and the Justice \nDepartment. They say they even hired a forensic specialist to prove \nthat the document that was leaked had originated at the IRS.\n  According to NOM, the forensics guy knew the document came from the \nIRS because it bore a watermark distinctive to the agency. And they say \nthey had to hire him--get this--because the IRS asked NOM if they had \nleaked the confidential information themselves. So they say they \nprovided evidence to show they had not leaked it themselves, and then \nearlier this year they asked the IRS to release all the information \nabout their complaint, which had apparently reached a dead end at the \nIRS. And here is what they say they've gotten back: crickets.\n  They say they have not heard a thing from the IRS or the DOJ about \nthis potentially illegal breach of their confidential donor \ninformation--even as they have poured significant resources of their \nown into the investigation, and, according to them, seen some of their \nsupporters scared off.\n  Think about that: the IRS has not had the time to respond to this \ngroup, or the Finance Committee--a full year after their confidential \ndonor information appears to have been leaked, from inside the IRS, to \none of NOM's ideological opponents.\n  But when the liberal group ProPublica requested confidential \ninformation about conservative groups, the IRS got back to those folks \nwith the information they wanted in about two weeks.\n  This is exactly the kind of thing I have been warning about for more \nthan a year. Here is a group with an agenda that runs counter to that \nof the administration. Somebody over at the IRS gets a hold of their \ndonor lists. And leaks it to their opponents.\n  Why? So anybody who thinks about supporting them thinks twice. This \nis what government intimidation and harassment looks like. It is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  The idea that you have got to move heaven and earth to get somebody \nin the Federal Government to lift a finger to get to the bottom of it \nis an outrage. This is the kind of thing that people should be tripping \nover themselves to resolve. Yet Senator Hatch is still waiting on a \nresponse to a letter he sent about it to the IRS commissioner--last \nMay!\n  No one should be intimidated by the government into shutting up as \npart of our political process.\n  That is why the Republican members of the Finance Committee are \nsending a letter today to Treasury's Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration requesting investigation into this very issue.\n  Because, without this sort of inquiry, we may never have confirmed \nthe inappropriate harassment of conservative groups that was going on \nat the IRS for two years.\n  Apparently, this is the only way to get this administration to take \nresponsibility for its actions.\n  We are determined to do that, because there is a very dangerous \nprecedent being set here. I will say it again: Americans, be they \nconservative or liberal, should be free to participate in the political \nprocess without fear of harassment or intimidation from their own \ngovernment.\n  I would also like to note that, last month, the Secretary of Energy \nnominee, Dr. Ernest Moniz, was cleared by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee with robust bipartisan support. The full Senate \nwill likely vote on his nomination today.\n  A number of my colleagues and I are optimistic about Dr. Moniz's \npragmatic approach to solving America's energy challenges.\n  In particular, I look forward to working with him on finding a \nsustainable, long-term solution for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion \nPlant--a facility that benefits our country, its community, and the \nmany dedicated workers who work there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the nomination of Dr. Ernest Moniz to head \nthe Department of Energy is now the pending business in the Senate. I \nwould like to discuss the nomination. I note my friend and colleague \nSenator Murkowski is here. Both of us will take a short amount of time \nto discuss Dr. Moniz's qualifications.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nnomination of Dr. Ernest Moniz to serve as the Secretary of Energy. Dr. \nMoniz is smart about energy policy, he is savvy about how the \nDepartment of Energy operates, and he is solution-oriented, which is \nwhat Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee saw when he was before our committee to consider \nhis nomination.\n  I am going to talk about why I believe Dr. Moniz is well qualified to \nspearhead our efforts to evolve our country's energy system, to \nincrease domestic sources, emit less carbon, and to bolster our \neconomy. First, though, I would like to talk for a few minutes about \nthe job Dr. Moniz will be stepping into once he is confirmed.\n  Right now the Energy Department is at the center of issues that are \nhugely consequential to our economy and the environment. They are how \nto manage the newly accessible reserves of natural gas, combating \nclimate change, and making our economy more efficient. Certainly front \nand center is how, on a bipartisan approach, we can support the \ndevelopment of new energy technology. I believe our country needs that \nkind of energy to transition to a lower carbon economy. It is built on \nthree pillars: strong economic growth, shrinking our carbon footprint, \nand spurring energy innovation.\n  What is unique about this moment is that now, on the issue of energy, \nour country is truly in a position of strength. Historically, lawmakers \nhave avoided energy issues until there was a short-term crisis. Usually \nthat crisis is a spike in the price of gasoline. Then, as we know, \nthere is a big hue and cry to pass a ``comprehensive energy bill,'' and \nit ends up being ``comprehensive'' and still lasts a relatively short \nperiod of time, maybe a year and a half or 2 years, until there is \nanother hue and cry to pass yet one more comprehensive bill.\n  Right now, the Congress and the executive branch--the Energy \nDepartment--are in a rare position, a position where we can make policy \nat a time when our country does not face those kinds of short-term \ncalamities. I say that in no way minimizing the extraordinary challenge \nof climate change. In my view that is a potential catastrophe that \nneeds real and immediate action, and it is something that cannot be \nducked or ignored.\n  On energy, however, the usual calculus has been flipped on its head. \nNew technologies have located potentially huge supplies of natural gas \nas well as new oil reserves. At the same time, thanks to a combination \nof improved efficiency, increased renewable power generation, and a \nrise of affordable natural gas supplies, our carbon emissions actually \nfell recently. A decade ago no one dreamed of either of those facts.\n\n  One of the most immediate issues that will face Dr. Moniz, if he is \nconfirmed, is the question of how our country can maximize the benefits \nof unconventional shale gas. Abundant, low-cost natural gas provides \nour country right now with a competitive, economic advantage. The \nreality is all over the world others want our gas. Our competitors in \nEurope and Asia--where the costs are four or five times as high as our \nmanufacturers--want what we have.\n  I think it is obvious that this is also a national security \nadvantage. We will be able to rely on our own energy resources instead \nof sources which come from unstable parts of the world that certainly \ndon't wish the United States well.\n  I was encouraged by the commitment Dr. Moniz made to me to use the \nbest, most recent data to look at questions, such as how building \nnatural gas export terminals is going to affect the areas adjacent to \nthose facilities as well as the larger American economy.\n  From my experience of working with Dr. Moniz, I think he is more than \nup to the big challenges our country faces as we deal with this \nhistoric transition in our energy sector. He knows how the Department \nworks from the inside, and he knows it because he actually has \nexperience there.\n  With his background as a well-respected scientist, I am confident Dr. \nMoniz is going to use the best science and most current data in \nconsidering key policy issues. He has shown he will\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\ntake an independent, data-driven approach as a professor of MIT and \ndirector of that university's energy initiative. They have led numerous \ncutting-edge studies on a range of energy issues.\n  In one sense the Department of Energy ought to be called the \ndepartment of innovation. One of the bright lights there is the \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, what is called ARPA-E, which funds \nresearch with the potential to produce major breakthroughs in energy \ntechnology. It was authorized in 2005, and it was Dr. Moniz's \npredecessor, Secretary Steven Chu, who oversaw the first project there \nand, to his credit, he was an important champion for that agency in its \nearly days.\n  One of the dozens of efforts that was supported by ARPA-E, for \nexample, is a project at the University of North Dakota which aims to \nreduce water usage of powerplants. According to the Department of \nEnergy, the university is testing an air-cooled absorbent liquid that \nretains and releases moisture to cool powerplants that could result in \nefficient power production with minimal water loss.\n  I think it would be fair to say we could put together a pretty \nimpressive filibuster if any one of us wanted to describe the various \ntypes of research going on or the research funded by the Department. \nThey are leading research in a number of areas our country needs to \nwork on if we are to achieve that objective I have staked out, and that \nis to secure a lower carbon economy.\n  As far as energy efficiency, the lowest cost way to reduce energy use \nand cut emissions is going to be a big part of the Department's mission \nin the next 4 years. Our committee is moving ahead in that area, \nstarting with yet another bipartisan bill, the Shaheen-Portman \nlegislation that, in my view, is the standard bearer now for energy-\nefficient legislation. We passed it out of the committee with broad \nbipartisan support, and I hope it will come to the floor of the Senate \nvery soon.\n  The Department is also doing important work on carbon capture, carbon \nsequestration, and utilization--trapping emissions from fossil fuel \noperations and storing them underground to reduce the impacts to our \nclimate. The chair of our Public Lands, Forests, and Mining \nSubcommittee--my friend Senator Manchin--has a great interest in this \nparticular area, and Dr. Moniz, to his credit, has said this is an area \nwhich deserves a significant amount of attention.\n  DOE research has also helped show that natural gas and renewables are \nnot mutually exclusive. This country does not have to choose between \nthe two. In fact, natural gas plants, in my view, make great partners \nfor intermittent renewables such as wind and solar because they can \nfire up and power down quickly. That is a very important part of our \nfuture energy agenda. We want to have more wind and solar. We know they \nare intermittent sources.\n  Some of the challenges, as the President of the Senate knows, are \nabout how to find innovative approaches to storage, and looking at \nnatural gas to help us get wind and solar into our baseload power \nstructure. So this is an important issue.\n  Renewables can also benefit natural gas. The Energy Department's \nPacific Northwest National Lab in Richland, WA--across the river from \nOregon--is going to soon test a project to use solar energy to make \nnatural gas plants 20 percent more efficient.\n  I am not going to pretend to know everything about engineering, but I \nthink it is worth noting that the New York Times said earlier this \nmonth the idea that is being explored in Richland, WA, would use \nconcentrated solar rays to heat natural gas and water to about 1,300 \ndegrees Fahrenheit and break open the natural gas and water molecules. \nThe result would create synthetic gas, which burns more efficiently \nthan natural gas alone. This would give us more energy for every \nmolecule of gas burned, which means lower costs and reduced greenhouse \ngas emissions. This is just one of many projects the Department is \nbacking. They are not sure which are going to ultimately pan out, but \nthe potential for breakthroughs--such as the one I have described--is \nexactly why it is so important for the Energy Department to have a \nbroad research portfolio.\n  Our country's competitors are not sitting back waiting for our \ncountry to do all of the world's innovation. China, Germany, and others \nare pouring resources into R to try and get an advantage. The fact \nthat we have our Energy Department on the front lines of this fight to \nshow the world how to innovate is a huge American asset.\n  A significant portion of the Energy Department's budget goes into an \noffice that is described as Environmental Management, which essentially \nmeans cleaning up America's radioactive nuclear waste. There are 17 \nactive sites the Department is currently cleaning up, including the \nHanford site in southeastern Washington. Whistleblowers and independent \nwatchdogs, such as the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, have \nidentified some troubling problems with how waste is stored in \nHanford--including the potential for hydrogen to build up and explode \nin several waste tanks. They have also flagged ongoing design issues \nwith the facility that will treat the site's nuclear waste--another \nmatter the Department of Energy must solve.\n\n  People who live near Hanford and depend on the Columbia River \nreceived some welcome assurances from Dr. Moniz. At the hearing, \nSenator Murkowski and I brought some of these issues up where Dr. Moniz \nsaid the status quo with respect to the Department of Energy on Hanford \nis not acceptable. I look forward to working with them on that long-\nterm solution.\n  Finally, I think it is fair to say Dr. Moniz--and it is appropriate \nto close with this--has a long track record of collaboration. That is \nwhy I mentioned early on he showed in his confirmation hearing--and he \nshowed Democrats and Republicans alike--that he is solution-oriented \nand collaborative on the difficult questions which are ahead. He brings \nthat scientific credibility, which I have outlined, with real-world \npolicy experience that is so important to managing a major Federal \nagency.\n  There has been bipartisan support expressed from my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for Dr. Moniz in a usually gridlocked Congress. \nI feel as though C-SPAN ought to put out a warning to viewers not to \nadjust their television because this really is how the Senate ought to \nbe working.\n  One of the reasons we had the bipartisan approach on energy issues I \nhave been discussing--and it was demonstrated again this morning in the \nenergy committee meeting--is because my friend and colleague Senator \nMurkowski consistently meets me at least halfway, and often more, on \nthese big issues. I thank the Senator from Alaska for that cooperation \non the Moniz nomination and many other matters. I look forward to \nSenator Murkowski's comments.\n  I see other colleagues here who may wish to speak at this time, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to follow \nmy friend and colleague Senator Wyden from Oregon, the chairman of the \nenergy committee, to speak today about the confirmation of Dr. Ernest \nMoniz to be our Nation's Secretary of Energy.\n  I think it is good when we are able to stand as the chairman and the \nranking member and come to terms of agreement so far as support for an \nindividual for a position such as Secretary of Energy. This is an \nimportant position within this administration. It is an important \nposition just from the perspective of how we move forward in this \ncountry while we deal with our energy issues and our energy future, \nwhich I think is where we get relatively enthusiastic about this \nnomination.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, my friend from Oregon, for his leadership in advancing the \nnomination to the finish line.\n  I also want to recognize and thank the members of our committee for \ntheir very thoughtful questions. When we had Dr. Moniz before the \ncommittee, it was perhaps one of the smoother confirmation hearings we \nhave had in quite some time.\n  I also thank the full Senate for working with us so we can fulfill \nour constitutional responsibility for advice and consent here today.\n  Before I speak to Dr. Moniz's qualifications--and I do think Senator \nWyden has addressed those very well--I wish to take a moment to discuss \nthe agency he will soon lead.\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n  The Department of Energy was created back in 1977. It was created \nfollowing the oil embargo which caused the gasoline shortages we saw \naround the country. The architects--those who put together the contours \nof DOE--were surveying a very different energy landscape than we face \ntoday.\n  Back in 1977, energy was viewed from the position of scarcity rather \nthan the abundance we recognize today. Those architects, as they \ndefined what a Department of Energy would look like and what it would \nhope to achieve, as well as the mission set there, had some pretty high \nhopes for what the Department would accomplish.\n  I think what we need to do is look back to that organic act which \nstates that DOE would ``promote the general welfare by assuring \ncoordinated and effective administration of Federal energy policy and \nprograms.'' That is pretty simple.\n  That same act goes on to list 18 different purposes, a few of which \nbear repeating. One of them is to assure, to the maximum extent \npractical, that the productive capacity of private enterprise shall be \nutilized in the development and achievement of the policy and purposes \nof the act.\n  Another one of those purposes is to provide for the cooperation of \nFederal, State, and local governments in the development and \nimplementation of national energy policies and programs.\n  A third purpose is to carry out the planning, coordination, support, \nand management of a balanced and comprehensive energy research and \ndevelopment program.\n  Looking back at DOE's creation is a reminder of how far we have come \nand yet how far we still have to go in achieving these various purposes \nthat were set out in that organic act.\n  Today the Department is a major department. It has a budget of more \nthan $25 billion each year. Thousands of scientists work on cutting-\nedge technologies at our national labs as they look for breakthroughs \nand manage our nuclear weapons programs.\n  Yet more than three decades later, it would be difficult to find many \nwho truly believe we have achieved this coordinated and effective \nadministration of Federal energy policy. In fact, we are going to have \nsome who would disagree as to whether we have developed a Federal \nenergy policy that adequately serves our national needs. Instead, we \nhave seen energy-related programs and initiatives that are fragmented \nand scattered throughout the Federal Government. Not enough money, in \nmy view, is getting to the bench for research and development, which is \na critical aspect of how we build out that energy policy. It is also a \ncritical component of how we move toward our energy future.\n  All too often it appears we have silos within the Department that \nstand in the way of progress. In recent years I have become concerned \nthat DOE is not clearly and unambiguously working to keep energy \nabundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure, principles that I \nthink go into defining a good, strong Federal energy policy. As I see \nit, DOE, in particular, must be a stronger voice in the councils of \nthis administration for energy supply. In light of several costly \nfailures, the Department must become a better steward of taxpayer \ndollars.\n\n  So all of these challenges, and more, will be inherited by our next \nSecretary of Energy. Along with the challenges, I think we also \nrecognize there are great opportunities within the energy sector. That \nis why I believe we will do well to place Dr. Ernie Moniz, who is \nclearly a man with talent and experience in both the laboratory and as \na public policymaker, to place him at the helm of this department.\n  Dr. Moniz has some pretty impressive credentials. He is a physicist, \nhaving graduated from Boston College before completing his Ph.D. at \nStanford. He served in the White House Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy and as an Under Secretary of the Department of Energy during the \nlate 1990s. For the vast majority of his career, he has also served as \nthe director of the MIT Energy Initiative. He has studied and written \nabout nuclear energy, natural gas, innovation--really any number of \ntopics with direct relevance for the future of our energy policy. So he \nhas both. He has the academic experience, most certainly, as we see at \nMIT and at Stanford, but he also has that practical application. My \ncolleague from Oregon described him as solution oriented, and I think \nthat is a very apt description. He is an impressive nominee.\n  In our meetings where it is nice and casual and relaxed and people \ncan have a pretty good conversation, I was very impressed with not only \nDr. Moniz's background and experience but how he views moving forward \nwithin the Department of Energy. There is a level of comfortable \nconfidence I found encouraging. He has shown he understands what his \njob requires, and because of that I believe he will be a capable \nSecretary. He is knowledgeable, he is competent, and he is refreshingly \ncandid, and I think that is an important part of it.\n  I kind of challenged him in the confirmation hearing before the \nEnergy Committee to keep that up: Don't be afraid to speak out, to be \nrefreshingly candid. I think that is good advice.\n  He also has proven the Senate's confirmation process can be navigated \nsuccessfully without undue delay, as long as questions are answered and \nconcerns raised by Members are taken seriously, and I think he did \nattempt to do that.\n  It is my hope that after his confirmation, Dr. Moniz will guide our \nNation's energy policy as the respected scientist he is and do so \nrigorously, robustly, free of preordained conclusions, and, again, not \nafraid to speak up or to speak his mind. His Department will benefit, \nand I think the country will as well.\n  As I have indicated in my comments, I think the Department of Energy \nneeds good, strong direction. It needs that leadership, and I believe \nDr. Moniz will provide both. That is why I am supporting his \nnomination, and I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in voting \nto confirm him later this afternoon.\n  I note my colleague from New Jersey is here. I have some comments I \nwish to make about the Arctic Council meeting, but I will certainly \ndefer to my friend from New Jersey for his comments this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nranking member for her courtesy. I intend to support this nominee for \nall of the reasons the distinguished chairman has said.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Menendez pertaining to the introduction of S. 980 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, while we are waiting for colleagues \nto come and join us on the floor to speak about the nomination of Dr. \nErnest Moniz to be Secretary for the Department of Energy, I thought I \nwould take a few moments and fill in my colleagues about a meeting I \njust returned from in Kiruna, Sweden. This was the Arctic Council \nministerial meeting.\n  The Arctic Council is comprised of the eight Arctic nations, of which \nthe United States is one by virtue of the State of Alaska, but not to \ndiminish the fact that we truly are an Arctic nation, and our role as \nsuch, involved with other Arctic neighbors, is a growing role and a \nrole the rest of the world is looking at with great interest and great \nanticipation as to how the United States is going to step forward into \nthis important arena.\n  This is the second Arctic Council meeting I have attended. I was in \nNuuk, Greenland, with Secretary Clinton and Secretary Salazar 2 years \nago. That was the first time the United States had sent a Cabinet \nmember, sent the Secretary of State to the Arctic Council, and it \ncaused great waves throughout the Arctic world and certainly gained the \nattention of nations around the world. The sentiment was the United \nStates is finally stepping up, the United States is moving forward, \nrecognizing its role as an Arctic nation. So it was exceedingly \nimportant that Secretary Kerry continued\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nthat good work of Secretary Clinton in leading the United States in its \nrole at this ministerial meeting.\n  I will tell you, Secretary Kerry has been very involved here in this \nbody as a Senator in his leadership on certain issues, specifically \nadvancing the Law of the Sea Treaty--ratification of that important \ntreaty--speaking out and being very forthright on the issue of climate \nchange. His leadership at the council meeting in Kiruna yesterday was \nclearly evidenced as he worked to bring the parties together in terms \nof an agreement to move forward with how we treat observers to the \nArctic Council. I commend Secretary Kerry for his leadership, certainly \nfor his initiative, in ensuring that the United States continues to \nhave a high profile and a growing profile.\n  Why is this important? Why do we need to not only be engaged but to \nstep up that engagement? Well, yesterday, the chairmanship of the \nArctic Council transferred from Sweden to Canada, so our neighbors to \nthe North will chair the Arctic Council for these next 2 years. In \n2015, the gavel of that chairmanship will pass from Canada to the \nUnited States, so we will be working to set the agenda, although it is \na very consensus-driven process. But we will clearly be in a leadership \nrole amongst the eight Arctic nations and those observer nations. It is \ncritically important that we are ready, that we be working toward \nassuming this leadership position.\n  In doing that, it is more than just attending meetings every other \nyear. It is the agreements that come out as a result of these \nministerials, these consensus initiatives that help to advance the \ndynamic in an evolving part of the world.\n  In Nuuk, the first-ever binding agreement of the parties was entered \ninto, and this was a search-and-rescue agreement. If there is an \nincident up in the Arctic--and the world up there knows very little in \nterms of boundaries and what happens with ice, but we recognize our \ninfrastructure is severely limited. So who is in charge? How do we work \ncooperatively, collaboratively with search and rescue? It was an \nexceedingly important initiative that was adopted 2 years ago.\n  Yesterday, in Kiruna, it was the adoption of the Agreement on \nCooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the \nArctic. There is a recognition that in the Arctic, where some 15 \npercent of the world's known oil and gas reserves are situated, there \nwill be activity. We are seeing it in Russia to our left-hand side; we \nare seeing it in Canada to our right-hand side. In the United States, \nas we all know, Shell attempted to begin exploration this year. There \nhave been previous exploration efforts up in the Beaufort and in the \nChukchi. Whether you are for or against oil development here in this \ncountry, the recognition is that within the Arctic nations there is \nactivity. There are ongoing efforts, whether it is through exploration \nor, hopefully, production that will move forward.\n  What we are trying to do within the Arctic Council and other entities \nis make sure that when that happens, we are prepared. So we are putting \nforward collaboration and collective agreements so there is an \nunderstanding that in the event--hopefully, a very unlikely event--\nsomething would ever happen, there is an understanding as to how all \nthe nations act, the level of preparation that moves forward.\n  There are incredibly important initiatives as we deal with an \nevolving Arctic. Think about the world up north there. Really \nunderstand what is happening. This is no longer an area that is locked \nin ice and snow, an area where we are not able to transit, an area \nwhere there is no human activity. The Arctic has clearly seen an \nopening, as we see the sea ice receding. We are seeing a level of \nactivity that is unprecedented. It is truly the last frontier--a new \nfrontier, so to speak.\n  Again, how we prepare for a world where there is more movement, where \nthere is more activity, is going to be a critical key to the success \nand the opportunity. We recognize the volume of shipping now coming \nthrough the Northwest Passage, coming from Russia on down through the \nBering Strait, through very narrow channels there out to Asia, down \ninto the Pacific. There is incredible movement. So how are we preparing \nourselves for an increased volume of shipping traffic? Do we have the \nnavigational aids we need? Do we have the ports and the infrastructure \nthat will be necessary? These are some of the initiatives that were \ndiscussed.\n  Obviously, when we think about an Arctic that is changing, a key \nfocus is on climate change and what is happening. We are seeing the \nimpact of climate change in the Arctic more noticeably than in other \nparts of the globe. So there is a great deal of science and research \nthat is going on that is necessary. How we collaborate, how we share \nthat with all of our other Arctic neighbors is going to be key.\n  How we map our resources, whether it is understanding the sea floor, \nwhether it is understanding the coastline, this is an area that--we use \nthe term ``frontier.'' When we go out into a new frontier, it is \nimportant to know what it is we are dealing with; how we can work \ncooperatively on things such as mapping; what we can do to ensure that \nas we see changes, as we see development, as we see increased economic \nactivity in the Arctic, that the indigenous people--the people who have \nbeen there for thousands of years, living a true subsistence \nlifestyle--that their lifestyle remains intact, that there can be a \nbalance and a harmony with their world and this changing scenery and \nlandscape in front of them.\n  This is a story that was conveyed to me several years ago. I was up \nin Barrow, which is, of course, the northernmost city in the United \nStates. Barrow is a relatively small community of several thousand \nindividuals. One afternoon there was a group of folks who were in town \nand they were all speaking German.\n  Somebody asked: Well, how did you get here? Where did you come from?\n  They did not see that many people getting off the Alaska Airlines \njet. The German tourists pointed to a cruise ship that was offshore. \nThey had lightered these German tourists into the community. Just a few \nyears back, a cruise ship in these waters was unheard of. What we are \nseeing now are cruises. We have a level of tourism that would never \nhave been anticipated. So how we prepare for all of this is a challenge \nfor us.\n  The work of the Arctic Council is again focusing on collaboration and \ncooperation in an area, in a zone of peace, as many would suggest. This \nis an important opportunity for us from a diplomacy perspective. Think \nabout how many hot spots we have in the world, how many places on this \nplanet where we are trying to put out fires that have been simmering or \nsmoldering for decades, for generations, for some, millennia. If we \nhave a part of the world where we can work together, what kind of a \nmessage, what kind of a symbol does that represent? So we have some \nenormous opportunities within the Arctic.\n  Part of my challenge--and I shared this with Secretary Kerry--is \nimpressing upon people in this country that we are an arctic nation. \nThe Presiding Officer hails from the State of Massachusetts. My \ncolleague and chairman of the Energy Committee comes from Oregon. I \nwould venture to say that most of the Senator's constituents do not \nview themselves as people of the Arctic, but we are. As 50 States, we \nare. So how we work together to make sure America's role as an arctic \nnation is represented is key.\n  I will conclude my remarks by noting that on Friday the White House \nreleased its Arctic strategy. This is a document to advance national \nsecurity interests, how we responsibly manage the Arctic ecosystem, how \nwe bolster international relationships--all very worthwhile goals. I \nthink we recognize that it is perhaps a little bit light on detail, but \nthe good news is that so many of our Federal agencies are working to \nhelp advance these goals.\n  What we need, in addition to a coordinated strategy, is a policy that \nis going to make sense from all of the different levels, whether it is \nhow we deal with the energy, how we deal with the human side, how we \ndeal with the security aspect of it. These are complicated issues, but \nit is an opportunity that is almost unprecedented to be able to take a \nblank page and be able to create opportunities, to be able to create \npolicies that really began with a level of collaboration and \ncooperation. This is what we are hoping to build not only\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nwith our Arctic neighbors but beyond that.\n  It was interesting to note the recognition of six nations that joined \nas observers: China, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. \nNo one would ever suggest these are Arctic nations, but the reason they \nwant to be engaged as observers is they recognize the importance of the \nArctic to the rest of the globe. They recognize the importance, whether \nfrom a shipping perspective, whether from an environmental perspective, \nwhether from just an opportunity for resources. There is a keen \nawareness of what is happening in the Arctic, that this is the place to \nbe right now.\n  So my urging to my colleagues is to pay attention to not only what is \nhappening in the Arctic but pay attention to how an increased role in \nthe Arctic impacts them and constituents in their States because \nwhether it is sending goods from one nation to another, this is an \nopportunity to allow for transit and commerce that has only been a \ndream. Whether it is how we access our energy resources in a way that \nis done responsibly, safe, and with an eye toward environmental \nstewardship, there are opportunities for us--challenges, yes, but \nopportunities for us as well.\n  So I will be talking much more about our role as an arctic nation, \nour responsibilities as an arctic nation, but I would ask that we start \nthinking about this: Where does Massachusetts, where does Oregon, where \ndo they fit in as part of an arctic nation?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich.) The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Dr. Ernest Moniz--a native son of Massachusetts--to be \nSecretary of Energy. In voting yes on his nomination, the Senate will \nconfirm someone who is extremely well qualified for the role of \nSecretary of Energy and someone who is proof positive that the American \ndream is alive and well.\n  Dr. Moniz is a son to first-generation immigrants to America, to Fall \nRiver, MA, a historic city on the south coast of Massachusetts rich \nwith a history in the textile and garment mills and now with a bright \nfuture in the innovation economy.\n  It was in Fall River that Dr. Moniz first developed his love of \nscience, both at home and in the Massachusetts public schools. With the \nhelp of scholarships from his father's labor union, Dr. Moniz was able \nto attend and receive his bachelor of science degree, summa cum laude \nin physics, from Boston College. From there, Dr. Moniz went on to do \neven greater work.\n  In Massachusetts, we are grateful for the decades of service he has \ngiven to one of the finest institutions not just in the Commonwealth \nbut in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology--otherwise \nknown as MIT--where he has been a faculty member since 1973. Dr. Moniz \nhas led many groundbreaking initiatives at MIT, including most recently \nserving as the funding director of the MIT Energy Initiative and \nleading the MIT Laboratory for Energy and the Environment. Through the \nMIT Energy Initiative, he has been at the forefront of \nmultidisciplinary technology and policy studies on the future of \nnuclear power, coal, nuclear fuel cycles, natural gas, and solar \nenergy. The initiative has spun out numerous startup companies from the \ncampus lab into the emerging and important clean energy economy.\n  In addition to his many years of service to the Commonwealth, Dr. \nMoniz also knows his way around this town, which I am sure will serve \nhim well in his new position. He served previously as Under Secretary \nof the Department of Energy and before that as Associate Director for \nScience in the Office of Science and Technology Policy for President \nClinton.\n  One of the biggest challenges he will undoubtedly face as Secretary \nis how to continue critical U.S. investments in emerging energy \ntechnologies, including fusion, in the face of a difficult budget \nclimate. While I recognize that, as Secretary, Dr. Moniz will need to \nrecuse himself from this particular issue, I strongly support continued \nDOE funding of the domestic fusion energy research program at MIT, the \nC-Mod Program, which has for years led in fusion science and is an \nincubator for the next generation of fusion scientists. Unless \nadditional action is taken by DOE, the C-Mod research facility at MIT \nwill be abruptly terminated, 130 fusion scientists, engineers, graduate \nstudents, and support personnel at MIT would also be terminated, and \nhundreds of millions of dollars invested in this program over the past \ngeneration will be lost.\n  Our Nation's domestic fusion program simply cannot withstand the \nproposed reductions without a severe negative impact to our fusion \nresearch and our scientific contributions to the international fusion \nresearch community. This shortsighted approach could eliminate the \nability of the United States to take a lead role in the development of \nthe next generation of energy research.\n  The Department of Energy has significant responsibilities that impact \nAmerica's economic energy, environmental, and security future. It is my \nstrong belief that Dr. Moniz has the ability, knowledge, experience, \nand vision to be an excellent Secretary of Energy for the people of the \nUnited States. I look forward to casting my vote to confirm this \nbrilliant scientist, dedicated public servant, and, yes, native son of \nMassachusetts.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  NLRB\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise to speak about the National Labor Relations Board. \nThis is a board and a set of issues we are going to be debating and \nhave begun to debate recently. It will be with us for a while, and it \nis an important debate we are having.\n  As the Senate considers the National Labor Relations Board member \nnominations, I think it is very instructive, and I would even say \nessential, to look back at the history of the Board and the National \nLabor Relations Act, the legislation that created the Board, to recall \nwhy this Board and the act are so important to our economy, our \nworkers, and our businesses.\n  The National Labor Relations Act played a key role in making the \nUnited States the prosperous Nation we are today. A properly \nfunctioning labor board and a revived, modernized National Labor \nRelations Act could be key players in a more prosperous future.\n  Congress passed the act in 1935 during the depths of the Great \nDepression. The National Labor Relations Board Act legitimized and gave \nworkers the right to join unions. It encouraged and promoted collective \nbargaining as a way to set wages and settle disputes over working \nconditions, and it led to a surge in union membership and \nrepresentation. It is worth remembering as well why the act was passed \nin the first place.\n  To quote section 1 of the act: ``The inequality of bargaining power \nbetween employees . . . and employers . . . substantially burdens and \naffects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business \ndepressions by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage \nearners.''\n  I am quoting in pertinent part the most significant words in that \npart of the act which are the flow of commerce, how important it is to \nsettle disputes so we can have a free-flowing commerce, and that \nworkers have the rights they are entitled to.\n  As I said, it was passed in 1935. The economy was reeling. One-fourth \nof the workforce was jobless. Millions of Americans were poor, hungry, \nand homeless. Balancing the bargaining power of employers and \nemployees, Congress hoped to restore the Nation to economic prosperity. \nGiving workers the right to organize and bargain collectively would \nallow them to stand up to corporate power and demand higher wages, \nthereby increasing their incomes and their purchasing power. That, in \nturn, would increase consumption and demand for goods, increasing \nproduction and, in fact, increasing employment.\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n  As former NLRB Chairman Wilma Liebman said: ``The law was enacted \nless as a favor to labor, than to save capitalism from itself.''\n  We know that before the New Deal, the Federal and State governments, \nthe courts, and the law had all been hostile to the collective rights \nof workers in their struggles against corporate power. For decades, \ngoing back to the late 1800s, the majority of production workers in \nAmerica's heavy industries had labored in harsh and often dangerous \nconditions for low wages, with little security. I know this from my own \nfamily's history, but I also know it from the history of my own region \nof northeastern Pennsylvania, the so-called hard coal or anthracite \nregion of Pennsylvania.\n  Stephen Crane, the great novelist, wrote about the coal mines right \naround the turn of the century. Actually, they are the coal mines of my \nhome county. He talked about all the ways a miner could lose his life \nin the coal mines. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord that part of Stephen Crane's essay about the coal mines.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The novelist Stephen Crane toured a mine near Scranton in \n     1894, just ten years before my father went to work in the \n     mines. He described the scene in McClure's Magazine:\n       The breakers squatted upon the hillsides and in the valley \n     like enormous preying monsters, eating of the sunshine, the \n     grass, the green leaves. The smoke from their nostrils had \n     ravaged the air of coolness and fragrance. All that remained \n     of vegetation looked dark, miserable, half-strangled. . . .\n       The [boys] . . . are not yet at the spanking period. One \n     continually wonders about their mothers, and if there are any \n     schoolhouses. But as for them, they are not concerned. When \n     they get time off, they go out on the culm heap and play \n     baseball . . . And before them always is the hope of one day \n     getting to be door-boys down in the mines; and, later, mule \n     boys; and yet later, laborers and helpers . . .\n       A guide then led Crane into the mine:\n       It was a journey that held a threat of endlessness. Then \n     suddenly the dropping platform slackened its speed. It began \n     to descend slowly and with caution. At last, with a crash and \n     a jar, it stopped. Before us stretched an inscrutable \n     darkness, a soundless place of tangible loneliness. Into the \n     nostrils came a subtly strong odor of powder-smoke, oil, wet \n     earth. The alarmed lungs began to lengthen their \n     respirations.\n       Our guide strode abruptly into the gloom. His lamp flared \n     shades of yellow and orange upon the walls of a tunnel that \n     led away from the foot of the shaft. Little points of coal \n     caught the light and shone like diamonds. . . .\n       The wonder of these avenues is the noise--the crash and \n     clatter of machinery as the elevator speeds upward with the \n     loaded cars and drops thunderingly with the empty ones. The \n     place resounds with the shouts of mule boys, and there can \n     always be heard the noise of approaching coal cars, beginning \n     in mild rumbles and then swelling down upon one in a tempest \n     of sound. In the air is the slow painful throb of the pumps \n     working at the water which collects in the depths. There is \n     booming and banging and crashing, until one wonders why the \n     tremendous walls are not wrenched by the force of this \n     uproar. And up and down the tunnel there is a riot of lights, \n     little orange points flickering and flashing. Miners stride \n     in swift and somber procession. But the meaning of it all is \n     in the deep bass rattle of a blast in some hidden part of the \n     mine. It is war. It is the most savage part of all in the \n     endless battle between man and nature. Sometimes their enemy \n     becomes exasperated and snuffs out ten, twenty, thirty lives. \n     Usually she remains calm, and takes one at a time with method \n     and precision. She need not hurry. She possesses eternity. \n     After a blast, the smoke, faintly luminous and silvery, \n     floats silently through the adjacent tunnels . . .\n       Great and mystically dreadful is the earth from the mine's \n     depth. Man is in the implacable grasp of nature. It has only \n     to tighten slightly, and he is crushed like a bug. His \n     loudest shriek of agony would be as impotent as his final \n     moan to bring help from that fair land that lies, like \n     Heaven, over his head. There is an insidious, silent enemy in \n     the gas. If the huge fanwheel on the top of the earth should \n     stop for a brief period, there is certain death. If a man \n     escapes the gas, the floods, the squeezes of falling rock, \n     the cars shooting through little tunnels, the precarious \n     elevators, the hundred perils, there usually comes to him an \n     attack of miner's asthma that slowly racks and shakes him \n     into the grave. Meanwhile, he gets $3 per day, and his \n     laborer $1.25.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. When unions sprang up to defend the rights of workers, \nthey were treated as illegal conspiracies, ruthlessly smashed by \ncompanies that either used violence or called on the police or military \nto defend their interests. The unions rarely made more than temporary \ngains.\n  When America began to industrialize in the 1800s, the relationship \nbetween workers and their bosses changed dramatically. Craft work by \nskilled employees was replaced by mass production with hundreds or even \nthousands of people working for a single, impersonal corporation. Giant \npowerful entities generally treated their workers like faceless, \nexpendable commodities--inputs into the production process, whose costs \nhad to be kept low in order to maximize profits in the incomes of \nrobber barons. That was certainly true in my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  The corporations amassed enormous wealth, but the employees were \nmostly left behind, with lives of misery and hardship. In Pittsburgh, \nfor example, the western corner of our State, a remarkable in-depth \nsociological study by the Russell Sage Foundation of the lives of \nworking families in the early 1900s found widespread grinding poverty \nand child labor, poor health and education, and astonishing levels of \nwork-related injury and illness. In Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh \nis located, with a million residents, more than 500 workers died in \nindustrial accidents in a single year, most of them in the steel mills. \nThe same was true in the coal mines.\n  To give you an example, in 1907, 1,516 workers were killed in the \ncoal mines of Pennsylvania. In over about a 98-year period, 31,047 \nknown fatalities happened in the coal mines of Pennsylvania.\n  If the United States today had a proportional number of occupational \nfatalities as they had in Pittsburgh when 500 workers died, the number \nwould be 150,000 workers today losing their lives on the job. Workers \nwere chewed up and discarded with no workers' compensation system and \nno hope of suing the corporation for negligence. The law of labor \nrelations was seriously unbalanced. Whereas business owners were able \nto act collectively, joining together in corporations to be treated as \na special kind of person under the law, while escaping individual \nliability for corporate acts, unions were sometimes treated as criminal \nconspiracies, their strikes were considered illegal restraints against \ntrade, and courts intervened to issue injunctions to hold unions liable \nfor the acts of their members.\n  When workers tried to form unions to defend themselves or to win a \nfair share of the profits, they were usually met by fierce resistance \nby employers, fueling anger and resentment, often leading to violence.\n  One of the most famous and, I should say, infamous tragedies involved \nCarnegie Steel, which for 10 years had a collective bargaining contract \nwith its skilled employees at the Homestead plant but decided in 1892, \nduring an economic depression, both to cut the employees' wages and to \ndestroy the union. I won't go into the whole story today; we don't have \ntime. Suffice it to say the union was crushed completely because of the \nactions of that steel company and then steel companies after it.\n  Move forward in history when demand for their products dried up in \nthe Great Depression. Many businesses cut both wages and hours, further \ndepressing workers' incomes and purchasing power.\n  In President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first year in office in 1933, he \npushed through Congress the National Industrial Recovery Act. One of \nits main purposes was to encourage companies to recognize their unions \nand to bargain with them. FDR and Labor Secretary Frances Perkins were \nconvinced that raising wages and thereby increasing consumer demand was \nessential to lift the economy and put people back to work.\n  Unfortunately, the entity the act created to encourage collective \nbargaining, the National Labor Board, as it was called at the time, had \nno power to compel compliance with the new law. Union membership \nsoared, but the companies continued to resist collective bargaining or \nrecognize the sham company unions they controlled, effectively \nbargaining with themselves rather than the real representatives of the \nworkers. Instead of an orderly, efficient act, or system, I should say, \nthe act produced chaos. The Supreme Court ruled that the act was beyond \nthe powers of Congress under the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  What happened then was Senator Robert Wagner of New York started\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nover and drafted the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. It passed \nquickly and survived a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court. \nThe new law required companies to recognize unions as the exclusive \nrepresentative of their employees when they could prove majority \nrepresentation. It gave the new board the authority to conduct \nelections and to order companies to bargain in good faith over wages \nand working conditions. It outlawed sham company-dominated unions, and \nit protected employees from violations by employers of their right to \njoin a union or to engage in strikes or other protected, concerted \nactivities such as hand billing or picketing.\n  The Board itself was given the power to require employers to hire \nback fired workers, to pay lost wages with interest, and to agree not \nto break the law in the future.\n  For a time, the new law worked. As Wilma Liebman, on the National \nLabor Relations Board for 14 years, said recently:\n\n       Over the next decades, millions of workers voted for union \n     representation in NLRB-conducted elections. And millions \n     achieved a middle class way of life through collective \n     bargaining and agreements that provided fair wages and \n     benefits in major industries of the economy.\n\n  At the peak of union power, 35 percent of workers were covered by \nunion contracts. They won higher wages, job security, and other \nbenefits. American family incomes grew by an average of 2.8 percent per \nyear from 1947 to 1973. Let me say that again. There was almost a 3-\npercent increase in family incomes from 1947 to 1973, with every sector \nof the economy seeing its income roughly doubled.\n  Due to a number of factors, union membership as a share of private \nsector employment has declined from that 35 percent to less than 7 \npercent today. We know that our history tells us not only is the act \nimportant for union members and for their families, but it is also very \nimportant for the middle class.\n  No one thinks the National Labor Relations Board by itself will be \nable to restore balance to America's incomes or restore purchasing \npower to the middle class. The Board itself can help make a difference, \nespecially if Congress repairs decades of damage to the rights of \nunions and employees to organize, bargain and, if necessary, to, \nin fact, strike. The Employee Free Choice Act would have been a good \nstart in that campaign of repair and restoration.\n\n  Tens of millions of Americans today are working at poverty wages. By \none estimate, 28 percent of workers are paid at a poverty-level wage or \nless. People who work hard for a living deserve a path to a decent \neconomic future. Workers today are better off than the average workers \nsurveyed in Pittsburgh 100 years ago, as I cited earlier, but their \nlives are getting harder every year. They are not sharing in our ever-\ngrowing national wealth.\n  I hope we can begin a process of reviving collective bargaining soon, \nbut first we must end the disgrace of leaving the Nation's most \nimportant labor relations agency without leadership. It is shameful if \nwe allow this to happen. The recent record of obstruction of \nnominations in the Senate is, in a word, unacceptable and should be \nunacceptable to every American. It is time to confirm the President's \nnominees to the National Labor Relations Board, to give certainty to \nworkers and to businesses as we continue to recover and create jobs.\n  As I leave, I would go back to the few short words I will read from \nthe opening Findings and Policies of the National Labor Relations Act:\n\n       Experience has proved that protection by law of the right \n     of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards \n     commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and \n     promotes the free flow of commerce by removing certain \n     recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                The IRS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday morning I called for the \nimmediate resignation of Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller in light \nof the IRS's admission that it targeted conservative groups for \ninappropriate scrutiny. While I was willing to give Mr. Miller and \nother IRS officials the benefit of the doubt until the facts were in, \nthe Treasury Inspector General report released on Tuesday has erased \nany doubts as to the severity of the misconduct and the blatant \nincompetence in dealing with the highest levels of the IRS.\n  I am pleased President Obama chose to heed the call that I made, and \nothers as well, by dismissing Mr. Miller last night. This is a \nnecessary step, but only a first step, toward restoring the credibility \nand the integrity of the IRS. This scandal is much larger than any one \nofficial within the IRS. Any government official who knew about the \nmisconduct within the IRS and decided not to make this information \npublic should be held accountable. No American taxpayer should ever \nhave to worry that a group they belong to or a view they espouse would \nsubject them to less favorable tax treatment by their government. Yet \nthe IG report has, unfortunately, confirmed this political profiling is \nexactly what happened.\n\n  The misconduct by the IRS is troubling for a host of reasons, but \nthere are two questions yet to be answered that I find particularly \ntroubling. First, how was the improper targeting of IRS agents allowed \nto continue for more than 18 months before it was finally brought to an \nend?\n  Secondly, how did the internal IRS process involve so many high-level \nIRS officials yet remain hidden from the public and from Congress for \nmore than 2 years?\n  Former Commissioner Miller was quoted yesterday as saying the IRS \nmisconduct was a result of two ``rogue'' employees in Cincinnati who \nwere ``overly aggressive.'' Yet we now know from the IG report the \nIRS's attempt to deal with the targeting of conservative groups went \nthrough numerous high-level IRS officials in Washington.\n  We know as early as March of 2010, IRS officials in Washington were \ninvolved in applying special scrutiny to tea party and other \napplications with conservative-sounding names. According to the IG \nreport, the head of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division and the IRS \nChief Counsel became aware of this targeting almost 2 years ago in the \nsummer of 2011.\n  Let's be clear: The scandal isn't simply a few rogue employees. The \nreal scandal is an entire bureaucratic structure within the IRS that \nallowed this targeting to go on for 18 months.\n  Behind me is the organizational chart from the IG report showing all \nthe offices that were involved in dealing with the improper targeting \nof conservative groups. As you can see, of the 12 offices on this \nchart, only two of these offices are based in Cincinnati. The other 10 \noffices are in Washington, DC. This particular office was the office--\nuntil just last night--Acting Commissioner Steven Miller held. But as \nyou can see, Mr. President, this is lifted directly from the IG's \nreport. This is an organizational chart that suggests the two offices \nin Cincinnati were a small part of a much bigger web of offices and \nindividuals who were involved.\n  This situation may have started with a few rogue employees in \nCincinnati, but the idea that somehow it was confined to that one small \npart of the IRS structure is simply untrue. It is also misleading to \nsuggest the IRS has been anything other than secretive and resistant to \ncalls for greater transparency when it comes to the agency's handling \nof conservative groups.\n  We now know then-Deputy Commissioner Miller was made aware of \ninappropriate targeting of conservative groups as early as May of 2012. \nYet for 1 year Mr. Miller did not bring this information to the \nattention of the public or Congress.\n  In June and August of 2012 I joined with fellow Republican Senators \non the Finance Committee in sending letters to the IRS regarding \nreports the IRS was requiring conservative 501(c)(4)s to disclose their \ndonors and expressing concerns the IRS may change regulations affecting \nthese groups in response\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\nto political pressures. The IRS responses to these letters did not \nacknowledge any special treatment of conservative groups.\n  In November Mr. Miller became the Acting IRS Commissioner, and in \nthis capacity he testified before the Senate Finance Committee \nregarding the issue of tax fraud and ID theft. He did not take that \nopportunity to make remarks or to comment on the subject of targeting \nconservative groups. Time and time again high-level IRS officials \ndeliberately avoided disclosing information regarding the targeting of \nconservative groups.\n  The American people deserve to know that action will be taken to \nensure the IRS will never participate in this kind of partisanship \nagain, and they deserve to know that leaders of such agencies will be \nheld accountable for such breaches of trust. These actions undermine \nthe confidence the American people have in the IRS to objectively and \ntransparently administer our Nation's tax laws.\n  These actions by the IRS are a continuation of a troubling trend from \nthe self-proclaimed most transparent administration in history. All of \nthese incidents are beginning to add up to a growing credibility gap \nbetween this administration under President Obama and the high standard \nof public service the American people deserve.\n  Now, thanks to ObamaCare, the IRS will be administering parts of the \nhealth care law. The IRS's power will grow as they become responsible \nfor determining whether Americans have satisfied the government mandate \nto have health insurance and whether the government will pay for part \nof that coverage through refundable tax credits.\n  As noted by the National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, ObamaCare is \n``the most extensive social benefit program the IRS has been asked to \nimplement in recent history.''\n  As I previously mentioned, this isn't the only ObamaCare-related \nscandal that has come to light this week. Over the weekend the \nWashington Post reported that Secretary of Health and Human Services \nKathleen Sebelius has been soliciting donations from health care \nexecutives to fund left-leaning organizations that are trying to work \nhand-in-hand with HHS to enroll individuals in ObamaCare exchanges.\n  If these reports are accurate, the actions taken by the Secretary \nrepresent a very serious conflict of interest. Companies and \norganizations should never be pressured for money because it sends the \nmessage that contributions are necessary to secure favorable regulatory \ndecisions, creating a pay-to-play environment.\n  Earlier this week David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President \nObama, said it isn't possible for the President to be aware of all \nthese problems in government because government is simply too big. It \nis mind-blowing to consider how large the Federal Government is and how \nthe one individual responsible for this $3.6 trillion entity can't even \nkeep tabs on all the activity. Perhaps this is exactly why we should be \nfocused on policies that shrink the size of government so it can be \nmore transparent and more accountable to citizens of this country.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall, in the seminal opinion McCulloch v. \nMaryland, wrote: ``The power to tax is the power to destroy.'' Those \nwords still ring true nearly 200 years later.\n  This administration is using one of its greatest powers--the power to \ntax--to destroy one of the people's strongest God-given rights, the \nright to free political speech. This isn't just an attack on certain \nconservative groups, it is an attack on all of our rights to assemble \nand to express free political speech without the fear of repercussion \nfrom our government. President Obama has a long way to go to restore \npublic confidence and to stop the growing credibility gap that so far \nhas plagued his second term.\n  I look forward to next Tuesday's oversight hearing in the Finance \nCommittee where I hope we can begin the process of reining in a \ngovernment agency that has run amuck.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               IRS Rules\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I have been watching today as \nvarious speakers have come to the floor. I want to join in the outrage \nabout what has happened at the IRS, the idea that the IRS would pick \nspecific groups and target them. In this case, apparently they used the \nname ``patriot'' and they searched through incoming applications for \n501(c)(4)s--and the term ``tea party''--and they were obviously \nfocusing on one side of the political spectrum. They should not have \ndone that.\n  There is no doubt that the people who are writing me, that people in \nAmerica have watched this and feel a sense of outrage. They should be \noutraged. They are outraged, and I am outraged.\n  One of the things we have to understand as a result of this is that \nthe IRS has tremendous power. It has the power to audit. It has the \npower to request information. It has the power to refer for criminal \nconduct. I think in many cases the IRS is probably more feared than the \nprosecutor's offices, which also have tremendous power. As many know, I \nhave had some real experience there, having been a Federal prosecutor, \nhaving been a State attorney general. That is power that should be used \nin a very careful way. You do not pick one part of the political \nspectrum and target people when you are entering a phase of a \nprosecution or an audit, as the IRS was doing. I think our President, \nwho is a lawyer, understands that. President Obama has called for the \nresignation of the top IRS official. That official has resigned. That \nis the right thing to do. Such action is inexcusable. No one disputes \nthat. More disciplinary action is likely. The FBI is investigating, and \nI hope they do a full, thorough, and complete investigation. Of course, \nas I said before, the IRS should not be targeting specific sides of the \npolitical spectrum.\n  But in thinking about this, there is another failure, and we should \ntalk about that at the same time. The IRS does not have clear rules for \nnonprofit groups and political activity. We need transparency about \nwhat is allowed and what is not allowed. Those rules should be applied \nto all groups across the board on all sides of the political spectrum. \nFront groups for huge amounts of campaign money are continually allowed \nto file false statements with the IRS and get away with it. Over and \nover again, they do this. This is wrong whether the group is liberal or \nconservative, Democratic or Republican. This is wrong across the board.\n  How does this happen? We know that lots of secretive groups want to \nfunnel cash to influence elections, to get their candidates elected. \nBut campaign finance rules are supposed to have transparency. How do \nthese groups, left or right, keep their money secret? They hide behind \nan organization that is listed with the IRS called a 501(c)(4). They \nask for permission under the IRS to be a 501(c)(4) status organization. \nThat is a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation regulated by the IRS.\n  These groups have one big hurdle to jump through. The 501(c)(4) has \nto be set up ``for the promotion of social welfare.'' In fact, the law \nsays it must be exclusively--the law Congress wrote says it must be \nexclusively for social welfare. That is the law Congress wrote. It \nseems pretty clear, doesn't it? It seems as though Congress was saying \nwhat it intended. But the IRS muddied the water by deciding \n``exclusively'' actually means ``primarily.'' ``Primarily engaged in \nsocial welfare activity'' means at least 51 percent of the time--not \n100 percent of the time, 51 percent of the time. This is baffling, and \nit is completely misguided.\n  To make it more confusing, the IRS regulations state that ``the \npromotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect \nparticipation, or intervention, in political campaigns on behalf or in \nopposition to any candidate for public office.'' To establish a \n501(c)(4) corporation, the organizers must file a form with the IRS \npledging that they do not plan to spend money\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nto influence elections. It appears that many of these groups have lied \non their applications for nonprofit status. It also appears that they \nare allowed to get away with it. That is corrupt, and it is also a \ncrime--and nothing appears to be done about it. That is a scandal right \nthere. As the IRS stands by, these groups, whatever their political \naffiliation, mock Federal tax laws.\n  The Center for Responsive Politics noted that in the 2012 election, \n501(c)(4) groups spent $254 million to support or oppose candidates. \nWhy would someone donate to a 501(c)(4) instead of giving money to the \nparties or to the campaigns of candidates they support? Simple--to \navoid disclosure. If someone gives $1,000 to a political campaign, that \nis required to be reported and the donor is known. It is out there. It \nis in the public. But if someone gives $1,000 to a 501(c)(4) that is \nimproperly engaging in political activity, the public remains in the \ndark. So if someone gives $1,000 to a 501(c)(4), nobody knows about it, \nbut it can go out under these rules and engage in political activity.\n  This secret money is a bipartisan outrage. They are seeking to \ninfluence elections, not promote social welfare. This has to change. I \nhave long argued that it must change. Since 2010 many of us have come \nto this floor calling for vitally needed reforms, demanding that we \nchange the way we do business. I believe that requires a constitutional \namendment overturning the disastrous Buckley and Citizens United \ndecisions by the Supreme Court, restoring to Congress and the States \nthe authority to regulate elections.\n  We have also pushed for the DISCLOSE Act. That legislation would have \ntaken the IRS out of the business of investigating these groups--a job \nit is failing to do anyway. It would have required open reporting with \nthe Federal Election Commission. The DISCLOSE Act doesn't ban any \ngroup, but it does say the American people have a right to know who is \ntrying to influence their vote, who is paying for all those ads on \ntelevision.\n  There is a saying in Washington from the Watergate era: ``Follow the \nmoney.'' That is what I am trying to do. Where does the money come from \nand where is the money going? Not a single Republican voted for the \nDISCLOSE Act--not one. In fact, they filibustered it, blocked it from \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Partisan bias and abuse by the IRS cannot be tolerated. President \nObama is not tolerating it. But Americans are also fed up with the \ndeception by shadowy groups that continue to drown our elections in \nanonymous cash. The fact that these secret political money groups also \nserve as tax breaks for extremely wealthy people adds insult to injury.\n  We need clear rules from the IRS. Exclusive means exclusive, in my \nbook. When the Congress says ``exclusive,'' it means exclusive, and we \nneed to enforce those rules equally on all applicants for tax-exempt \nstatus, every single one. If you are a charity or true social welfare \norganization, you should not pay taxes. There is no need to publicize \nyour donors. But if you are looking to influence Americans' votes and \nhow Americans vote, the voters should know who you are. There must be \ndisclosure at the very least.\n  We have to change the way we do business. The failure of IRS \nbureaucrats--billionaires writing political checks but hiding in the \nshadows and avoiding taxes--this has to change. The time has come to \nchange this.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am honored and privileged to stand here \ntoday and to say good words on behalf of Ernest Jay Moniz, also known \nas Dr. Moniz and Ernie Moniz. He is one of my favorite people from the \nworld of academia. I have in my hand a bio of him that I will read out \nloud. It is not very long, and it is worth listening to.\n  Dr. Ernest J. Moniz is the Cecil and Ida Green professor of physics \nand engineering systems at MIT. His research at MIT, where he has \nserved on the faculty since 1973, has focused on energy technology and \npolicy.\n  Dr. Moniz also serves as the director of MIT's Energy Initiative and \nthe MIT Laboratory for Energy and the Environment.\n  From 1997 until 2001, Dr. Moniz served as Under Secretary of the \nDepartment of Energy. Prior to that time, he served as Associate \nDirector for Science in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in \nthe Executive Office of the President from 1995 until 1997.\n  In addition to his work at MIT and the Department of Energy, Dr. \nMoniz has served on any number of boards and commissions, including the \nPresident's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology from 2009 \nuntil today, the Department of Defense Threat Reduction Advisory \nCommittee from 2010 until today, and on the Blue Ribbon Commission on \nAmerica's Nuclear Future from 2010 to 2012.\n  Dr. Moniz is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement \nof Science, the Humboldt Foundation, and the American Physical Society. \nIn 1998 he received the Seymour Cray HPCC Recognition Award for vision \nand leadership in advancing scientific simulation.\n  Dr. Moniz received a bachelor of science degree summa cum laude in \nphysics from Boston College and a doctorate in theoretical physics from \nStanford University.\n  I have been privileged to know this man for a number of years. Our \noldest son was an undergraduate in mechanical engineering at MIT and \ngraduated a few years ago.\n  I remember holding a field hearing at MIT--gosh, about a half dozen \nor so years ago--and Dr. Moniz was one of our witnesses. Among the \nthings I liked about him is that he was so approachable. We have all \nheard the term ``good guy.'' He is a really good guy.\n  Sometimes we think of somebody as a professor in an ivy tower and \nkind of out of touch, unable to communicate and connect with people. He \ncould not be more different from that caricature. He is a real person, \nnot to mention a very smart person. As a professor, he is able to \nexplain complex concepts of nuclear energy and clean coal so that even \nI can understand what he is saying.\n  He has a wonderful sense of humor. If you happen to be a young person \nor an older person, Democratic or Republican, he just works so well \nwith everybody. He is smart as a whip. He has a great way about him. He \nis approachable and has a very can-do attitude. I think the President \nmade a great choice.\n  I say to Ernie and his family, I appreciate his willingness to serve \nin a lot of capacities and his willingness now to serve in this \ncapacity. Hopefully, it will be good for him, his life, and his family. \nI think it certainly is going to be good for our country, so we \nappreciate that.\n  I say to my colleagues who have not had a chance to get to know him, \nI think everyone is going to like him a lot and enjoy working with him. \nI know I certainly have.\n  I also wish to discuss something I touched on earlier this week. I \nstood here just this week talking about the Swiss cheese we have in the \nexecutive branch of our Federal Government. There are too many \npositions that don't have someone confirmed for those positions.\n  In some cases, the administration has been derelict in terms of \nsending us nominations because they spend forever vetting nominations \nbecause they don't want to send someone to us who has a flaw or a \nblemish. As a result, I think they spend entirely too much time vetting \nnominees. In some cases, even when a nominee's name gets here, even if \nthey are really good and well qualified, we delay those nominations \nfurther. Whether it is a Democratic or Republican President, we put the \nnominees through--not torture but something pretty close to it.\n  We need good people to be willing to serve. When they step up and are \nwilling to serve, we need to process and vet those nominations. We need \nto scrub them hard, but at the end of the day we need to move them \nforward.\n  In the Environment and Public Works Committee, we took a small but \nimportant step with the President's nominee Regina McCarthy to be the \nAdministrator for the Environment Protection Agency. She is enormously\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\nwell qualified. She has already been confirmed by the Senate for the \nair pollution side for the EPA and has done a very nice job.\n  Although she has been nominated by a Democratic President, in the \npast she served with five Republican Governors. She is smart, hard-\nworking, she has great credentials, and she is approachable. She is \nsomebody who is able to understand and explain things. She will do a \ngreat job.\n  We have had a hard time being able to move her nomination out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Today we were joined by our \nRepublican colleagues. Unfortunately, none of them voted to report her \nnomination out of committee. We have reported her out on a straight \nparty-line vote.\n  My hope is that we will have an opportunity to do what we did a \nnumber of years ago--about 7 or 8 years ago. Mike Leavitt, the former \nGovernor of Utah, was nominated to be the head of EPA. There was some \ndelay in his nomination.\n  We actually had a big markup and business meeting scheduled to \nconsider his nomination, and the Democrats boycotted that meeting. We \nwaited a couple of weeks. At a followup meeting, the Democrats showed \nup, and we reported him out with Democratic support. Later, we voted \nfor his nomination. It was a big bipartisan vote. I think there were 70 \nor 80 votes in favor of his nomination.\n  My hope is that is what we will do with Gina McCarthy. She deserves a \nvote, and from my perspective she deserves a positive, affirmative \nvote.\n  We have Ernie Moniz coming our way later this afternoon in about 40 \nminutes. I hope my colleagues will join me and give him a big vote so \nwe can send him to work for our country one more time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is about Dr. Ernie Moniz's appointment to be \nSecretary of Energy. I put a hold on Dr. Moniz. It has nothing to do \nwith him. He is a wonderful fellow. He is an MIT professor. He has been \namply associated with the Department of Energy, including the MOX \nProgram. All of us in Georgia and South Carolina look forward to \nworking with him.\n  What we are upset about is the Obama administration's decision to \ntemporarily stop construction on the MOX facility. It is about 60 \npercent complete.\n  What is MOX? It is a program to take 34 metric tons of weapons-grade \nplutonium in excess of our defense needs and dispose of it by turning \nit into commercial-grade fuel. It is enough weapons-grade plutonium to \nmake 17,000 warheads.\n  In 2000 there was an agreement between the United States and Russia: \nThey would dispose of 34 metric tons and we would dispose of 34 metric \ntons. And we have been studying how to do that.\n  In 2010 the Federal Government--and the Obama administration--in the \nagreement with the Russians to move forward, said we would MOX the 34 \nmetric tons of weapons-grade plutonium. We were to turn it into mixed \noxide fuel to be used in commercial reactors, which was a technology \ndeployed in France, and that was the way forward.\n  To the administration's credit, we are finally moving forward. \nSenator Isakson, Senator Chambliss, and I went to the facility a couple \nof years ago and finally saw it moving forward. It is about 60 percent \nbuilt. Now, in the budget proposal of the President, they stopped \nconstruction to study an alternative. There is no other alternative. If \nthey try to turn it into vitrified glass material, that will take more \nmoney and more time than doing MOX, and it has not been proven to work \nthe way it is set up today.\n  At the end of the day, the problems we should be focusing on are the \ncost overruns of the MOX Program. It is about $2 billion over cost. I \nwould join with the administration to sit down with a contractor and \ntry to recoup that $2 billion to find a way forward and make it \naffordable.\n  There are statutes in place that require a $100 million fine to be \npaid to the State of South Carolina if we don't meet our disposition \ngoals. Last year we extended that statute by 2 years because we don't \nwant the fine money, we want the MOX Program. It is good for the \ncountry, and it is good for the world.\n  Now that we have stopped the study, our fear is that we are stopping \nand studying an alternative that doesn't exist, and it cannot be \ncheaper than $2 billion. There is no other way to do it. We have been \nstudying this for about 15 years, and we will be breaking the agreement \nwith the Russians. Other than that, we don't have a problem with what \nthey are doing.\n  What we want to do is sit down with the contractor and the \nadministration and lower the costs of the program but keep it moving \nforward. This administration has talked consistently about reducing \nnuclear proliferation and making the world safer from the use of \nnuclear materials. This is a program that started in the Clinton \nadministration--then Bush, and now Obama--that really would accomplish \nthat.\n  Thirty-four metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium--enough to make \n17,000 warheads--would be taken off the market forever. In this way, a \nsword becomes a plowshare by making commercial-grade fuel out of it. It \nis a good program, and we need to complete the program.\n  The reason we put a hold on the nominee for Secretary of Energy is to \nget everybody's attention. I have been talking with Dennis McDonough, \nand I have been talking with the administration. We hope we can resolve \nthis, but we are here to speak for Georgia and South Carolina.\n  We have a deal with the Federal Government. We agreed to take this 34 \nmetric tons of weapons-grade plutonium years ago with the understanding \nthat it would leave South Carolina and not affect the environment of \nSouth Carolina and Georgia in a permanent way.\n  We are very DOE-friendly in South Carolina and Georgia. The Savannah \nRiver site is right on the border. There are almost as many people from \nGeorgia working at the site as there are from South Carolina. My \ncolleagues from Georgia have been absolutely terrific.\n  At the end of the day we are going to be insistent that the Federal \nGovernment keep its commitment to the States of South Carolina and \nGeorgia and to the Russians. We are going to make sure we dispose of \nthis weapons-grade plutonium, and we are going to be more cost-\nconscious about it.\n  We are going to let Ernie Moniz become Secretary of Energy in 40 \nminutes. I will vote for him, but I will continue to slow down the \nprocess and make life incredibly miserable if we cannot find an \naccommodation that I think is fair. My State and the State of Georgia \nhave been good partners with the Federal Government and the Department \nof Energy on energy issues.\n  Several years ago, when I first became a Senator--I think it was in \n2002 or 2003--we agreed to leave some waste in the bottom of about 50 \ntanks that contained high-level waste material from the Cold War era \nfrom reactors at the Savannah River site used to make tritium to help \nfuel hydrogen bombs. By leaving a small amount in the bottom of the \ntank--the heel--and filling it with concrete, we were able to save $16 \nbillion in cleanup costs. Instead of scrapping it all out and sending \nit to Yucca Mountain, which never came about, we were able to leave a \nsmall amount that would not hurt the environment of South Carolina and \nGeorgia.\n  Now, in this budget they are reducing the tank closure by $106 \nmillion. We cannot do it that way. They cannot get us to help save \nmoney for the Federal Government and take on a reasonable risk--not \nmuch of a risk at all--and then short us. Whether it is a Republican or \nDemocratic administration, people are going to stop dealing with the \nFederal Government when it comes to nuclear materials if this is the \nway we are going to do business.\n  The people in Georgia and South Carolina have been very \naccommodating. We appreciate the Savannah River site. It is a wonderful \nDOE facility. We are proud of it, and we are proud of the employees. \nBut we are not going to be taken advantage of.\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\n  We are asking for the administration to sit down with us and others \nwho care about this to find a way to lower the cost of the MOX \nconstruction but continue forward with the construction so we can get \nthe MOX facility up and running. We need to honor our commitment to the \nRussians and get this weapons-grade plutonium off the market.\n  Count us in in terms of lowering costs; count us out when it comes to \nstopping the program in the middle and trying to find an alternative \nthat doesn't exist.\n  As to the tanks, the Federal Government is going to honor its \ncommitment to the people of South Carolina and Georgia to get these \ntanks closed up on time and on schedule. We have, again, saved $16 \nbillion over the life of the close-up plan for the tanks just by being \nreasonable.\n  When it comes to MOX, there were three facilities planned to take the \nweapons-grade plutonium and turn it into a commercial-grade fuel. We \nwere able to consolidate two of the facilities into one and save $2 \nbillion. I am all for saving money, but I am also all for keeping one's \nword.\n  To our friends in the administration, we will work with you when we \ncan, fight you when we must, but when it comes to this, I hope there \nwill be a lot of bipartisanship for the delegations of South Carolina \nand Georgia to make sure we honor the commitment entered into between \nthe Federal Government and the State of South Carolina that will affect \nour friends in Georgia and keep this program moving. We are not asking \nfor too much. As a matter of fact, we are insisting on the Federal \nGovernment holding up its end of the bargain because we have held up \nour end of the bargain.\n  To our friends in the administration, let's see if we can solve this \nproblem.\n  To my colleagues in this body, I hope I would have the good judgment \nand common sense to support the Members if anyone found themselves in \nthis position of trying to do something good for the Nation and have it \nget off the rail. I hope I would be willing to help the other side when \nit comes to something such as this.\n\n  It is very difficult to deal with these high-level waste issues, \nparticularly weapons-grade plutonium. When we find somebody who is \nwilling to be reasonable and helpful, the last thing that should be \ndone is to change the rules in the middle of the game.\n  With that, I will yield to Senator Isakson to just quickly ask him, \nfrom his point of view, does he see this as a fundamental breach of the \nagreement we have had for years, and what effect does he think it will \nhave on our nonproliferation agenda and how does it affect South \nCarolina and Georgia?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First of all, I wish to thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his leadership on this important issue, and I am proud to \njoin the senior Senator from Georgia Saxby Chambliss and, in effect, \njoin Sam Nunn, who is a former Senator from Georgia who, with Dick \nLugar, brought about the Nuclear Threat Initiative program which \nbrought about the treaty of 2000 which calls for the reduction by 68 \nmetric tons of nuclear materials.\n  I would answer the question of the Senator from South Carolina with \nanother question: Where else in the United States of America are there \ntwo States willing to accept plutonium, reprocess it into fuel rod for \ncommercial use, and do it safely and have dealt with nuclear materials \nfor over 50 years? That is Georgia and South Carolina.\n  The idea that we can fund a study to look for an alternative is \nlaughable. That is just merely a smokescreen for the current \nadministration's position.\n  The Senator is exactly right. Senator Chambliss and myself, along \nwith Senator Scott and Senator Graham, are happy to sit down with the \nadministration, look at the cost overrun on the MOX facility, and find \nways to find savings. But the dumbest economic decision in the world \nwould be to stop the process when we are half finished because then we \nhave wasted every dime that has already been spent, and we have to \nspend more money on an alternative that does not exist.\n  So I wish to add my support to the remarks of Senator Graham and my \nState's support to reprocess this weapons-grade plutonium into \nreprocessed materials that fuel powerplants and commercial \nopportunities. That is a good use. It is a good way to get rid of this \nnuclear material, and it is also a good way to keep it out of the hands \nof the terrorists. If we don't destroy it and it lays around in Russia \nor anywhere else, it is always suspected of being stolen or used in a \nway that none of us would ever want.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I can't thank Senator Isakson enough. Senator Scott has \nbeen with us at every step. But I want to let everybody in Georgia know \nthat when it comes to the Savannah River site, we have worked as a team \nfor years, and I just can't thank the Senator enough.\n  Senator Chambliss is one of the leading national security experts in \nthe Senate, and he has been intimately involved in the MOX program. My \nquestion for Senator Chambliss is, we have an agreement with the \nRussians; they will dispose of their 34 metric tons of excess \nplutonium--enough to create 17,000 warheads in Russia--and we have \nagreed to do the same. If we are seen to stop and not honor our \ncommitment, what reaction does the Senator from Georgia think the \nRussians would have, and is it smart to delay this program in the times \nin which we live?\n  I worry about the materials being compromised not so much in South \nCarolina and Georgia but very much in Russia. Could the Senator express \nhis thoughts about that?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as did my colleague from Georgia \nSenator Isakson, I wish to thank Senator Graham for his leadership on \nthis issue. He is right. We have been to the facility a number of times \nto examine what is going on there. There is great work being done by \nhighly trained, highly educated individuals to deal with one of the \nmost sensitive products we have in this country.\n  The Senator is exactly right that there are significant consequences \nfrom an international standpoint if the numbers in the President's \nbudget are allowed to stand. That is why we have had conversations with \na number of individuals currently at the Department of Energy and why \nwe had a conversation with Dr. Moniz in preparation for his \nconfirmation by this body. Those discussions have led to the fact that, \nas the Senator from Georgia says, we are willing--and we have their \nagreement that they are willing--to sit down with a contractor to talk \nabout the money. That is the real issue because we are talking about a \nbudget item and whether we can afford to do this. If we don't involve \nthe contractor, then obviously we can't get that number down to a \nmanageable number.\n  So, again, with the leadership of the Senator from South Carolina, we \nlook forward to working with Dr. Moniz and others with respect to \nsitting down with the contractor and coming to some resolution of the \nultimate budget number that is going to be needed.\n  With respect to Russia, the President met with President Medvedev in \n2010, and the two of them, in a press conference, talked about the MOX \nfacility and the agreement on MOX. Here we are 3 years later with this \nPresident submitting a budget number that, in fact, in effect starves \nthis program and would have the obvious intended result of eliminating \nthis program, thus breaking his word with President Medvedev in 2010 as \nwell as breaking the U.S. agreement with Russia. That has the potential \nto have very serious consequences on the international stage.\n  Also, abandoning the project would have severe economic impact to \nboth the State of Georgia and the State of South Carolina because of \nthe individuals who have been working there for now, as Senator Isakson \nsaid, 50 years.\n  It is also going to strand up to 64 metric tons of weapons-grade \nplutonium. Where else is it going to go? There is no place else for it \nto go. There is no State jumping up and down saying: Please bring your \nuranium and your plutonium to my State and we will deal with it. You \ncan transport it to my State. In fact, the exact opposite is happening.\n  It was intended that we would process this plutonium and it would \nultimately ship to Yucca Mountain, as Senator Graham alluded to. Now \nthe State of Nevada is saying no. They are throwing up their hands and \nsaying: We don't want that processed material in\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nour State because it is hazardous waste.\n  Well, what we are saying is, we are happy doing what we are doing \nbecause we have those trained, sophisticated professionals who know how \nto deal with this hazardous material. They do an outstanding job of it. \nWe have spent billions of dollars constructing the facilities to the \npoint where they are 40 percent away from being completed now. If we \njust accept the President's budget, then we will have wasted all of \nthat money and the construction phase of the buildings that are there. \nAlso, we are not going to have anywhere to put this 64 metric tons of \nhazardous material and weapons-grade plutonium.\n  So this stands to have economic impacts to our part of the country. \nIt stands to certainly create international issues with the Russians if \nwe break our agreement with them. Also, just as significantly, it \nleaves 64 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium outstanding, with \nnowhere to go, nowhere to store it.\n\n  The MOX project was designed to deal with a very sophisticated issue \nyears and years and years ago, and it just makes no sense whatsoever to \nstop in the middle of it now and say, well, we just don't have the \nmoney to take care of something that is as hazardous and potentially as \nlife-threatening as what this weapons-grade plutonium is.\n  We do need to spend our money wisely. We have to be careful. But \nthere are agreements we need to honor. There are certain aspects of \ngoverning that need to be done and need to be done in the right way, \nand this is simply one of those.\n  So with the continued leadership of Senator Graham and Senator \nIsakson and Senator Scott, I look forward to us sitting down with Dr. \nMoniz once he is confirmed--and we are all going to vote to confirm him \ntoday--because he has so much knowledge about this.\n  One thing we failed to mention is the fact that he is the guy who \nnegotiated the agreement. He is the guy the President is saying, well, \nwe know you went through some very difficult times in negotiating this \nwith the Russians, but the heck with your agreement, the heck with all \nthe work you did. Thank goodness his attitude is that he wants to work \nwith us.\n  We want to find a way forward. We look forward to his confirmation \nbeing completed, to sitting down with us and the contractor, and let's \nfigure out a way we can make this project the continued success it has \nbeen thus far, as well as moving forward.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Chambliss.\n  I believe Senator Reed wishes to be recognized for a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in morning \nbusiness after Senator Graham has completed his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Just to conclude, I wish to thank both of my colleagues. \nThey have been great partners on this issue and many others. We have \ntried to be good partners with the Federal Government. We are proud of \nthe Savannah River site and all that has been accomplished over the \nlast 50 years. Now we are moving into a new phase of trying to get rid \nof Cold War materials--34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium here, \nand in Russia, 60 percent completion of the MOX program.\n  As to the $2 billion overrun, that is not lost upon me as being a lot \nof money. That is a lot of money. But what I am telling my fellow \nMembers of the body, and the country as a whole, there is no way we can \nfind an alternative to MOX cheaper than that $2 billion. It is just not \npossible. We have been studying this forever, and in the agreement \nitself with the Russians, it specifically says MOX, and it prohibits us \nas a nation from burying the plutonium.\n  So this is the way forward. I promise the Members of the body and the \nadministration we will lower the cost overruns, I promise. This is a \ncomplicated scientific endeavor, but we will lower the cost overruns.\n  What we will not do is stop the program when it is 60 percent \ncomplete and study an alternative that has no possibility of coming \nabout scientifically and could never lower costs and interrupt the \ndisposition of this weapons-grade plutonium and breach the agreement \nwith the Russians. We will not be a party to that. We will keep \ntalking.\n  As to Mr. Moniz, he will be an outstanding Secretary of Energy. We \nlook forward to working with him.\n  I appreciate my colleagues coming down and joining me in this \ncolloquy and putting everything on the record about the Savannah River \nsite and MOX.\n  With that, I yield the floor to Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of my remarks, Senator Chambliss be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, July 1 is less than 7 weeks away, and unless \nwe act the interest rate on need-based student loans will rise from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent.\n  Student loan debt is second only to mortgage debt for American \nfamilies. Now is not the time to add to student loan debt by allowing \nthe interest rate on need-based student loans to double.\n  I have worked with Chairman Harkin, Leader Reid, and many of my \ncolleagues to develop a fully offset, 2-year extension of the current \nstudent loan interest rate. Instead of charging low- and moderate-\nincome students more for their student loans, the Student Loan \nAffordability Act will keep rates where they are while closing \nloopholes in the Federal Tax Code. We should take up this legislation \nand pass it without delay.\n  I know many of my colleagues, including myself, are working on longer \nterm solutions that more effectively reflect market rates--but my \nconcern is, frankly, that we will run up against this July 1 deadline \nand we will not have the long-term solution in place. We have to do \nsomething. That is why I urge us to pick up this legislation as quickly \nas possible.\n  Our first priority must be to reassure students and families that the \ninterest rate will not double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July \n1. We have to do that. Then we can work toward a longer term solution. \nWe also owe it to them to commit to a full and thoughtful process for \ndevising this longer term solution, to develop an approach that will \nset interest rates and terms and conditions on all student loans that \nwill be more reflective of market rates, but also more beneficial to \nstudents and their families who are borrowing this money.\n  Senator Durbin and I have put forward a long-term proposal that would \nset student loan interest rates based on the actual cost of operating \nthe program so the Federal Government would not be offering student \nloans at a profit.\n  There are other long-term proposals on the table. Some of them, such \nas the one reported out of the Education and the Workforce Committee in \nthe House today, could actually leave students worse off than they \nwould be if the rates were to double. We need to take the time to fully \nconsider comprehensive solutions to our student loan debt crisis--\nsolutions that will make college more affordable, not less so. Rather \nthan rushing to overhaul the Federal student loan program without fully \nconsidering the impact on students and college affordability, the \nStudent Loan Affordability Act will secure low interest rates until \nCongress can act on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. \nWithout swift congressional action, more than 7 million students will \nhave to pay an estimated additional $1,000 for each loan. These are the \nstudents who need the help the most.\n\n  Sixty percent of dependent subsidized loan borrowers come from \nfamilies with incomes of less than $60,000, while 80 percent of \nindependent subsidized loan borrowers come from families with incomes \nbelow $40,000.\n  Unlike Republican proposals that would balance the budget on the \nbacks of students by charging them higher interest rates or make \nstudents vulnerable to exorbitant interest rates in the future, this \nlegislation which we are\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\nproposing will help ensure that college remains within reach for \nstudents who rely on Federal loans to pay for their education. This \nlegislation is fully paid for.\n  Specifically, the pay-fors would be limiting the use of tax-deferred \nretirement accounts as a complicated estate planning tool, closing a \ncorporate offshore tax loophole by restricting ``earnings stripping'' \nby expatriated entities, and closing an oil-and-gas industry tax \nloophole by treating oil from tar sands the same as other petroleum \nproducts.\n  We should not be collecting additional revenue from students when we \ncan eliminate wasteful spending in the Tax Code, and we should not \nallow--not allow--the interest rate to double on July 1.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support, as the first step, the 2-year \nextension until we can truly come up with a thoughtful, comprehensive \napproach to long-term student lending in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Miller Resignation\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the resignation \nof Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller.\n  The request by President Obama and Mr. Miller's resignation is too \nlittle too late. This is just another example of the President \ncontinuing to search for a scapegoat for his own administration's \nmisdeeds.\n  The American people deserve trust, and this egregious abuse of power \ndemonstrates the worst fears of the American people that they cannot \ntrust their government.\n  It has been 2 years since these incidents were first reported, and \nwhile Members of Congress were led to believe no malfeasance occurred, \nthe details of the IG report were more shocking than we could have \nrealized, as many conservative groups were not only targeted for \nadditional reviews but were harassed as well. Moreover, in some cases, \ninformation was purposefully leaked by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  These actions are unacceptable, and while President Obama's reactions \nseem to be sincere, he has not yet demonstrated to the American people \nthat all of those responsible will be brought to justice. Above all, we \nhave to make sure this never happens again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support President Obama's \nnomination of Dr. Ernest J. Moniz to be the next Secretary of Energy. \nDr. Moniz has a solid and extensive background in the energy field and \nI believe will bring a balanced and practical perspective to our \nNation's energy policy. Dr. Moniz has significant familiarity with the \nDepartment of Energy and its issues, having served as Under Secretary \nduring the second Clinton administration. During the Obama \nadministration, he has served in a number of advisory positions, \nincluding as a member of the President's Council of Advisers on Science \nand Technology, the Department of Defense Threat Reduction Advisory \nCommittee, and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future.\n  The Committee on Armed Services, which I chair, has jurisdiction over \nboth the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, and Department's Environmental Management \nProgram. The NNSA is responsible for the management and security of the \nNation's nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactor \nprograms. The Environmental Management Program is responsible for \ncleanup of the environmental legacy from the Nation's nuclear weapons \ndevelopment and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. Combined, \nthese programs represent more than $16.7 billion of the Department of \nEnergy's $26.3 billion budget, or more than 63 percent.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Moniz and to \nhighlight several issues of importance to the State of Michigan and to \nthe Nation. I look forward to working with Dr. Moniz on these issues.\n  Among these issues is the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, FRIB, \nwhich will be the world's most powerful rare isotope accelerator and \nprovide cutting-edge research capabilities to study questions about the \nfundamental nature of matter. Applications of research discoveries from \nFRIB will assist development of new technologies in the fields of \nbiomedicine, environmental science, and national defense. Michigan \nState University, MSU, was selected in 2008 after an extensive \ncompetitive process, and the FRIB project plans and schedules have been \nthrough rigorous Federal review. As home of the National Science \nFoundation's National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, MSU has \nsolid and well-known expertise in the field of rare isotopes and \nnuclear physics, with the largest nuclear physics faculty in the Nation \nand a nuclear physics graduate program that ranks No. 1 in the United \nStates. MSU already produces 10 percent of the Nation's Ph.D.s in \nnuclear physics. In addition to expanding our knowledge of physics and \nthe life science, successful completion of FRIB also will enhance the \neducation of nuclear scientists and engineers needed to maintain U.S. \ncompetitiveness.\n  Another important issue to the State of Michigan and the Nation is \ncollaboration between Federal agencies, the private sector, and \nacademia on the development and transition of advanced ground vehicle \nand energy technologies. Collaboration in these areas is critical to \nleverage and maximize the value of the work being done in the Federal \nGovernment, in the private sector, and at our academic institutions \naround the country. The Advanced Vehicle Power Technology Alliance, \nAVPTA, is a partnership between the Department of Energy and the \nDepartment of the Army which was created to provide a mechanism for \nthis collaboration. A charter was signed between these two agencies in \nJuly 2011 establishing the mission of the AVPTA to ``leverage resources \nand research involving the commercial automotive and defense ground \nvehicle manufacturers to transition technologies into both the \ncommercial and military marketplaces and increase precompetitive \nresearch and development.''\n  Dr. Moniz is familiar with and supportive of these programs, and I \nlook forward to his Senate confirmation as Secretary of Energy. The \nDepartment of Energy has been effectively led by Dr. Steven Chu. Dr. \nMoniz will carry on that good work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe we have run out of those in the \nSenate who wish to speak. I would just like to state again that this is \na nominee who is supported by both Senator Murkowski and myself. This \nis a nominee who got an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  As I said earlier, I think he is an individual who is smart about \nenergy policy, he is savvy about how the Department of Energy operates \nand he is a solution-oriented person and Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee saw that in the \nconfirmation process.\n  There are huge challenges ahead of him at the Department of Energy, \nbut I think he is very qualified for this position. I would urge all \nSenators--Democrats and Republicans--to support the nominee.\n  I yield back all remaining time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Ernest J.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I am here today on the floor again to \nask that Senate Republicans stop blocking the next step in regular \norder and allow us to move to a bipartisan budget conference with the \nHouse of Representatives. We have waited long enough. In fact, we have \nnow waited 54 days, and it is time to get to work on a bipartisan \nbudget agreement.\n  The Senate Democrats see no reason for delay. We are very proud of \nour budget, which puts forward a strong, fair vision for getting \nAmericans back to work, tackling our long-term debt and deficit \nchallenges, and laying a strong foundation for the middle class in the \nfuture. It seems that some of our Republican colleagues in the Senate \nand House would rather wait now until the next crisis and see if they \ncan extract political concessions with the clock ticking--or maybe they \ndon't want to air the details of the unpopular House budget.\n  Either way, there is no excuse for putting the American people \nthrough another round of partisan brinkmanship. We have already seen \nthat that hurts our economy, and it causes Americans to question \nwhether their government is working for them.\n  Yesterday the House Republicans met to talk about what they are going \nto demand in exchange for not tanking our economy. Apparently they are \nconsidering a ``laundry list,'' including repealing ObamaCare--which \nthe House will vote on, by the way, for the 37th time today--and \nrestrictions on women's health choices.\n  House Republicans' practice of leveraging crises for their own gain \ndied with the Boehner rule, and no amount of wishing is going to bring \nit back. House Republicans may think brinkmanship helps them win \npolitical fights, but it does not help the American families and \ncommunities we are here to serve.\n  I urge our Republican colleagues in the Senate to take a step toward \na responsible bipartisan budget agreement and a step away from \ngoverning by crisis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the \ndesk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, all with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we want to \nproceed with this as well. We want a budget. It has been 4 years and it \nhas been far too long. What we want to avoid is a deal negotiated \nbehind closed doors, a backroom deal to raise the debt limit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify her request so that \nit not be in order for the Senate to consider a conference report that \nincludes reconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, the Senator's request is \nasking to disregard what the Senate did on those days--54 days ago--to \ngo through over 100 amendments and defeat those amendments time and \ntime again; to go to conference--not behind closed doors, I would add. \nA conference committee is a committee that is out in the public.\n  What is happening right now is closed-door agreements. What we are \nasking for is an open process where we are allowed to take the Senate-\npassed budget and the House-passed budget, go to conference, and find \nout where we can agree so we can put this behind us.\n  I object to the Senator's request and ask again for our unanimous \nconsent request to move to budget conference, as we do in regular \norder, which is what the Republicans have been demanding for a very \nlong time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Does the Senator from Utah object?\n  Mr. LEE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have gone 4 years without a budget, \nand the Democratic Senate did act this year and passed a budget. The \nHouse has also passed a budget, and it is a historic proposal. It \nbalances in 10 years, it does not raise taxes, and it increases \nspending every year by as much as 3 percent. It is the right way to go \nfor America, and it is the kind of budget we should be talking about.\n  Chairman Murray has indicated we should go through regular order. But \nunder regular order, what we should do is have the House budget at the \ndesk right now. It is a responsible budget. Under regular order, the \nHouse budget should be brought to the floor under section 305(b) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. Then we can have full debate on that budget \nwith 50 hours and the ability to offer amendments. I think this is what \nwe should be doing.\n  Instead, our Democratic colleagues and Senator Reid have offered \nconsent requests that short-circuit the regular order. Their request \nwould automatically bring the House budget off the calendar, replace it \nentirely with the Senate's own budget and assume it passes without a \nsingle minute of debate or without a single vote being taken. That is \nnot the regular order.\n  Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks \nSenator Inhofe be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object. I wish to respond to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. \n25, the House-passed budget resolution for fiscal year 2014.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what the\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nSenator is requesting us to do is to take up the House-passed budget. \nRemember, we have passed a Senate budget here. We had 50 hours of \ndebate, over 100 amendments were offered. We voted on all of them way \ninto the wee hours, 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, as everyone here \nwill rightly remember. He is asking us to disregard all that action in \nthe Senate, take up the House bill and have 50 hours more of debate, \nunlimited amendments, sitting here for weeks at a time again to go \nthrough all the amendments.\n  Madam President, that is a waste of taxpayer money and it is a waste \nof our time. We have done that work. It is time to go to conference.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding that a colloquy \nis in order between Senator Blumenthal and Senator Lee, but I ask \nunanimous consent that at the conclusion of that I be recognized and \nthat following my remarks the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I believe I was listed in \nthe queue a bit earlier than that, but I only have a 3- or 4-minute \nstatement. I do not mind trading off, but I, similar to others, was \ntold the time was right after the vote that I would be recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to amend my \nunanimous consent request to include the 3-minute remarks of the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. But reserving the right to object, \nis that before or after the remarks of the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be before the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3553-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3553-S3555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--S. RES. 133 and 134\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 133; that \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration; that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be made \nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nwish to point out that the incident that led to this resolution--the \nKermit Gosnell prosecution--indeed resulted in a successful \nprosecution. He was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder \nand one count of involuntary manslaughter. That case is closed. The \ncriminal justice system has done its part, and the three life sentences \nwithout the possibility of parole means that the interests there--the \nvery important public interests--will be served and he will never again \nharm women, infants or anyone else through his version of medical \npractice, that distorted and unfortunate betrayal of trust that he \ncalled a medical practice.\n  We need very much to focus on the kind of abuse of trust--unsanitary, \nabusive, unsafe medical practices--across this country, no matter what \nkind of procedure is involved, and that is the reason I think this \nresolution is too narrow in its focus on violations of the standard of \nmedical care when they occur in medical practice, which most certainly \nwas involved in the Gosnell case and involved, unfortunately, in \nthousands of cases across the country every year.\n  As Senators, we have a responsibility to focus on that betrayal of \ntrust and care when it occurs. That is the reason I have offered a \nresolution--S. Res. 134--to express the sense of the Senate that all \nincidents of abusive, unsanitary, illegal, unhealthful medical \npractices should be condemned and prevented, and the perpetrators \nshould be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, as Gosnell was.\n  There are, unfortunately, many instances already publicly disclosed \nof these abuses of standards, and one of them, for example, I cited on \nthe floor just very recently--last week. I remind my colleagues of the \nOklahoma dentist who exposed as many as 7,000 patients to the HIV and \nhepatitis B and C viruses through unsanitary practices. So far, 60 of \nhis patients have tested positive for these viruses. Those are 60 \npeople who trusted a health care provider in a position of authority to \nprovide safe, quality care. Those patients now face life-threatening \ndiseases. In Nevada, practitioners at an endoscopy center exposed \n40,000 patients to hepatitis C through their unsanitary practices, \nwhich went on for years. My resolution speaks to these kinds of \nabuses--unsafe, unsanitary practices--no matter what the medical \nprocedure involved may be. So I urge my colleagues to support my \nresolution, and I do object to the proposed resolution of the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. Res. 134, and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the \nBlumenthal amendment to the preamble, which is at the desk, be agreed \nto, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Connecticut?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Reserving the right to object, the kind of abuse, the kind \nof betrayal of trust described in the resolution proposed by my friend \nand my colleague from Connecticut is different in kind from that \ndescribed in my resolution. The kind of abuse involved in my resolution \ninvolves the intentional taking, the first-degree premeditated murder \nof a human life. I think that deserves its own consideration, and on \nthat basis I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may respond to my friend's remarks--and I \ncertainly not only sympathize with his motivation but also with the \nresult--I just think it is too narrow a result--to investigate one form \nof medical practice, no matter how egregious the violation of standard \nof care may be. In this instance, it involved murder. We can say it \nnow, no longer with the word ``alleged'' before murder, as we did last \nweek. It is now proven. It is heinous and unacceptable. But so are the \npractices that involve exposing patients to very severe illnesses; and, \nlikewise, the nursing home director in California who inappropriately \nadministered an antipsychotic medicine to residents simply for \nconvenience and which resulted in the death of one patient. Those kinds \nof practices may be equally egregious in the results and impact they \ncause, and my resolution would be broader and more inclusive and fairer \nnot only to those victims' families--and I want to express my sympathy \nto the families of those victims who were so deeply and irreparably \nharmed by Gosnell--but also with the families and victims of other \nkinds of medical malpractice and to respect the States that have an \nindependent responsibility to ensure adherence with those standards of \ncare and ought to have the ability to enforce their laws, which might \nbe impeded by the resolution that has been offered by my friend from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise to ask my colleagues once again to \njoin me in expressing the sense of the Senate that governments at all \nlevels have a compelling interest in preventing and punishing the \npractices of late-term abortions under unsafe, unsanitary, and illegal \ncircumstances.\n  It seems as though every day we find new evidence that this problem \nis much bigger than we could have feared previously. Earlier this week, \nof course, Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was convicted on \nthree counts of first-degree murder for severing the spines of newborn \ninfants, and one count of involuntary manslaughter for the death of a \npregnant mother who came to see Dr. Gosnell for care.\n  The shocking details of the Gosnell case have, despite the best \nefforts of\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\nthe mainstream media to cover it up, become national news. The abortion \nindustry has spun into action, trying to isolate and condemn Gosnell as \nan aberration. Planned Parenthood cited Gosnell's ``appalling crimes.'' \nNARAL called him a ``butcher.'' On this very floor last week, Gosnell's \nactions were decried by pro-choice Senators as ``reprehensible'' and \n``an outrage . . . a violation of everything we hold dear.''\n  But Kermit Gosnell has only been sentenced to life in prison and \ncondemned as a monster for doing things for which--had he done them \njust a few seconds earlier or a few centimeters in a different \ndirection--those same voices might have hailed him as a hero and not as \na monster.\n  Remember, President Obama himself, while serving in the State \nlegislature of Illinois, voted against legislation that would have \nprotected the civil and constitutional rights of infants--human \nbeings--born alive.\n  At a recent hearing in the Florida State Legislature, a Planned \nParenthood representative refused even to acknowledge that newborn \nbabies have the right to life. In recent weeks, undercover videos have \ncaught abortion clinics around the country casually offering to kill \ninfants born alive. Just this week, evidence emerged about similar \nabuses at a clinic in Texas.\n  This has nothing to do with health care or even with medical \nnegligence but with murder--a war on women and children waged under the \nguise of legitimate health care.\n  As much as we might want to agree that Kermit Gosnell is an \naberration, recent revelations, indeed, suggest otherwise. A mounting \nbody of evidence seems to suggest that at least among some late-term \nabortion providers and advocates, the immorality of infanticide may be \nan open question.\n  The abortion industry's defense of late-term abortion has always been \nbased on a rejection of innate human dignity. How could it be \notherwise? But as technology advances, their case for late-term \nabortion increasingly rejects medical science as well.\n  We now know as a scientific fact that unborn children, after about 20 \nweeks of development, can feel pain. We know Dr. Gosnell's victims \nsquirmed and cried before he severed their spinal cords, and we know \nthat every day medical technology progresses our abortion laws fall \nfurther behind the science.\n  It is a tragedy all on its own that even today our laws defining \nhuman life depend more on geography than biology. The unsettling \nquestion before us now is: Has an industry whose profits have always \ndepended on dehumanizing unborn children gone even further and \ndehumanized children born alive too?\n  The case of Kermit Gosnell, the undercover videos, and recent clinic \nscandals around the country all hint at a terrifying answer. Yet right \nnow we just don't know. My resolution would call on governments at all \nlevels to find out--to find out what the late-term abortion industry is \nup to and to take any appropriate and necessary measures to prevent and \npunish abusive, unsanitary, and illegal practices.\n  Some might say this resolution is a symbolic gesture, and I and \nothers have introduced more concrete legislation. Perhaps. But even so, \nsymbols are themselves important. It is important that the strong stand \nfor the weak; that we, in the world's greatest deliberative body, lend \nour voices to the voiceless; that we, representatives of the most \npowerful Nation on Earth, promise to protect the weakest, most \ninnocent, and most vulnerable among us and punish those who would do \nour children harm.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, I would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I wish to ask a question but will start by \nlaying a predicate and ask the Senator's views on that predicate.\n  I rise to support the resolution offered by Senator Lee calling upon \nthe Senate to investigate and hold hearings about the late-term \nabortion practices in this country.\n  This is especially important given the fact we are seeing allegations \nof similar conduct to that of Dr. Gosnell potentially being performed \nin other locations across the country. Indeed, there have been \nallegations of similar conduct in my hometown of Houston, TX, which I \nunderstand are being investigated by the local district attorney and \nother authorities and that need to be fully and thoroughly \ninvestigated.\n  The crimes committed by Dr. Gosnell are almost unspeakable. The harm \ninflicted to the mothers and to the babies who were born alive and had \ntheir lives willingly extinguished--unthinkable. The actions detailed \nin the grand jury report depict a house of horrors.\n\n  Knowing what we know now about what happened, everyone in this body \nshould be supporting conducting an investigation to make sure there are \nnot other Dr. Kermit Gosnells across this country. We need to make sure \nit is not happening to other unsuspecting mothers, that other newborn \nbabies are not being murdered as they were in Dr. Gosnell's clinic.\n  Specifically this resolution states:\n\n       Congress and States should gather information about and \n     correct abusive, unsanitary and illegal abortion practices \n     and the interstate referral of women and girls to facilities \n     engaged in dangerous or illegal second- or third-trimester \n     procedures.\n\n  This body should be concerned what referrals were made to Dr. Gosnell \nand who else might be performing these late-term abortions in such \nhorrific conditions.\n  This resolution goes on to say:\n\n       Congress has the responsibility to investigate and conduct \n     hearings on abortions performed near, at, or after viability \n     in the United States, public policies regarding such, and \n     evaluate the extent to which such abortions involve \n     violations of the natural right to life of infants who are \n     born alive or are capable of being born alive and therefore \n     are entitled to equal protection under the law.\n\n  In my judgment this is a resolution everyone should support. Everyone \nwho proclaims himself or herself to be a champion for women and \nchildren should enthusiastically support this resolution.\n  Many of these late-term abortion clinics serve under-privileged \npopulations. Anyone who proclaims himself a champion dedicated to \nhelping the most vulnerable should be supporting this resolution. The \nSenate has an obligation to conduct oversight.\n  Planned Parenthood, the Nation's largest abortion provider in 2001 \nperformed 333,964 abortions in the United States. From 2011 to 2012, \nPlanned Parenthood received 45 percent of its revenue from taxpayer-\nfunded sources. Almost half of its income comes from the taxpayer. This \nbody has an obligation to make sure there are not other Gosnell houses \nof horror practicing today.\n  The conditions described in the grand jury report shock the \nconscience. They describe how doctors and nurses worked without proper \nlicenses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Utah has expired.\n  Mr. CRUZ. My question to the Senator is, does he see how any Senator \nof good faith, given these facts, could oppose this resolution?\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent I be given 60 seconds to answer the \nquestion and then I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, in short, in response to the question from \nmy colleague from Texas, I do find it difficult to understand why \nanyone would oppose this resolution. I also find it difficult to \nunderstand how this can be put on the same plate--as serious as other \nkinds of abuses are, as serious as other acts of medical malpractice \nmay be, this one is different. This is about premeditated first degree \nmurder of the most defenseless, most vulnerable people in our society, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Again, I renew my objection. Let me say, my two \ncolleagues have made excellent closing arguments to the Gosnell jury. I \nwould expect that to be the case since they are two well-trained, \nexcellent lawyers. But the Gosnell case is over. It is done. He has \nbeen sentenced--or he will be shortly. These kinds of abuses ought to \narouse outrage wherever and whenever they occur. Anytime, anywhere a \ndoctor endangers a patient in violating standards of care, we ought to \ncondemn them. So I urge my colleagues to join\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nme in the outrage I feel about the dentist in Oklahoma or the endoscopy \ncenter in Nevada or the nursing home director in California. In any \ncase where prosecution is appropriate, an investigation should be done \nproperly by State authorities who have jurisdiction, and they should \ncondemn such practices. I ask them to join me in resolution S. 134.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, recognizing that he has other accommodations he has to \ndeal with. I ask unanimous consent I be granted up to 4 minutes to \nspeak after the Senator from Oklahoma completes his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, first of all, I think we, all of us, \nlate in the week, are on a timeline. I have a very significant piece of \nlegislation, S. 965, called the Iran Sanctions Implementation Act. I \nspent a long time on the floor yesterday talking about this. It \noccurred to me it is a little bit complicated. The longer we talk about \nit the more complicated it gets. I have shortened it. Let me make a \ncouple of brief comments about where we are today in relationship to \nIran and some of the other countries in the Middle East, and a solution \nto which everyone can agree to the problem that is there.\n  First of all, 70 percent of Iran's revenues come from their export of \noil. What we have done successfully is had some modest means of \nreducing that, so we have actually cut their amount of exports in half \nover the last 4 or 5 years from 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to \n1.25 million barrels of oil a day. That amounts to 70 percent of the \nresources, the revenue that Iran has.\n  What do they do with their revenue? First of all, we recognize \nsomething that people do not like to talk about; that is, our own \nintelligence says, and has said since 2007, by 2015 Iran will have a \nweapon and the delivery system for that weapon.\n  Our concern, of course, is that one of the things that happened in \nBarack Obama's first budget 4 years ago was, in addition to other \nthings regarding the military, they did away with the ground-based \ninterceptor in Poland which was designed specifically to take care of a \nmissile coming from the east and, of course, what we had there was the \nthreat from Iran. That is a threat.\n  The second thing they have, besides their nuclear buildup, is they \nare helping all the terrorist operations throughout the Middle East. We \nknow they are very significant in assisting Asad in his barbaric \nslaughter of over 70,000 of the Syrian people. They are able to do this \nbecause Iran earns $3 billion a month in oil revenue, 70 percent of \ntheir revenue. If Iran didn't have access to this money, its ability to \ninfluence the region would be either stopped or significantly \ncurtailed. In other words, Iran cannot pose this threat without their \noil revenues.\n  U.S. production is now 7 million barrels a day, which is 40 percent \nhigher--put the chart up, please--40 percent higher than in 2008. When \nwe look at the map, we can see back in the old days the oil belt was \nthe western part of the United States. Look at it now. It has all \nchanged. We have the Marcellus up there in Pennsylvania, which is now \nthe second largest employer in Pennsylvania. It is scattered \nthroughout.\n  The reason for this surge is because the use of horizontal drilling \nand hydraulic fracturing has allowed us to reach reserves, reach \nproduction we otherwise could not do.\n  Here is the interesting thing: We have grown by 40 percent in our \nproduction, and all 100 percent of it is on State or private land. None \nof it is on Federal land. In fact, during this boom we are in the \nmiddle of right now that is so productive to the economy of most of the \nStates, none of that came from the Federal Government. In fact, we had \na reduction during this time in production from Federal lands.\n  The Institute for Energy Research recently issued a report stating \nthat if we enacted policies that allowed aggressive development of all \nthis off-limits land that is there right now, it would generate $14 \ntrillion in economic activity, create 2.5 million jobs, and reduce the \ndeficit by $2.7 billion. Most of all, we could become totally \nindependent from having to import our energy from any other country.\n  This bill says if the President would, at his discretion--it would \nrequire the President to find some area where we can just increase our \nproduction from Federal lands 1.25 million barrels a day. That is just \na small, minuscule part of all the production we could have. For \nexample, in just this area, that would exceed 1.25 million barrels a \nday or this up here, in Alaska, or even offshore.\n  The Senator from Virginia is going to be speaking next. They have \nactually voted to go ahead and explore this off their shores. Any of \nthese places would do that.\n  Why do we say 1.25 million barrels a day? That is what Iran exports. \nThis is what would happen: If we were able to do that, that would be \n1.25 million barrels a day that we in the United States would no longer \nhave to import, which would open that up to those who are importing \nfrom Iran, and it would completely dry up 70 percent of their revenue. \nOf course, the rewards of that would be great for our country.\n  We are looking at one of these rare situations where everything is \ngood, everything that would come from this is beneficial. We could dry \nup their revenues that they are using right now to enhance their \nnuclear capability and to perform all these atrocious acts in the \nMiddle East. At the same time, we would be able to lessen our \ndependence and provide all of the benefits that come from the use of \nthis.\n  Eventually, we would like to be at a situation where we can do not \njust 1.25 million barrels a day but maybe 10 times that and become \ntotally independent. In the meantime, we are only talking about one \nvery small amount that we would be telling the President of the United \nStates he is going to have to allow us to explore so we can stop Iran \nfrom doing the things they are doing today.\n  I thank those who have allowed me to have a little bit of time today, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and wish him good \ntravels.\n  I rise briefly today to point out one more time some of the \nramifications of the policy I have repeatedly called stupidity on \nsteroids, which is our sequestration policy. Word came out earlier this \nweek from the Department of Defense that the Secretary, to meet his \nsequestration numbers, is going to have to furlough teachers in \nDepartment of Defense schools for 5 days and education support \npersonnel for 11 days.\n  Many of us on the floor of the Senate stand and praise our men and \nwomen who serve in the military, who defend our freedoms. I cannot \nthink of anything that is more of an antithesis to those words we say, \nthat we would praise their service, if we say: Yes, you go off and \ndefend our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan; meanwhile, your families and \nyour children cannot go to school.\n  What makes this particularly difficult to stomach at this point is \njust today, Blue Star Families--one of our Nation's best veterans \norganizations, veterans support group organizations--came out and said \nin a list of priorities for military families, No. 1, the impact of \ndeployments, repeated deployments on military families and particularly \nchildren; and, No. 2, military children education.\n  In my State and many other States, military families, particularly on \nbase, have a military DOD school. Those schools provide a valuable \nservice to those military families oftentimes who have their parents \ndeployed. In my mind, how can we stand on the floor of this Senate and \ncommend those men and women who serve and at the same\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\ntime say we support that service: We want to support you at home, but \nnot enough to not have your kids have to miss 5 days of school because \ntheir teachers are furloughed or providers of other support services \nfor educational personnel are furloughed for 11 days.\n  I am going to write Secretary Hagel, and I ask that all of my \ncolleagues join with me in this matter in urging that the furloughs of \nthese educators who educate the children of our military families be \nexempted from the process of sequestration.\n  While it begs the large question that the Nation confronts a $16 \ntrillion debt, I think most of us in this Chamber know that the only \nway we are going to get to a solution is if those of us on this side of \nthe aisle find a way to make smart and sensible reforms to our \nentitlement programs. Our colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle \nare going to have to work with us to find ways to generate additional \nrevenues; otherwise, we are going to keep coming back to the kinds of \ncuts we have seen in sequestration and in domestic discretionary.\n  We are on a current path that would take domestic discretionary \nspending from 16 percent of our Federal spending down to 4 percent. As \na business investor, I would never invest in a business that spent less \nthan 5 percent of its resources on its workforce and infrastructure.\n  So today I rise on the issue of making sure we actually honor those \nmilitary families of whom we speak so often and make sure their kids \nget to go to school next year and don't have to lose valuable \neducational time because their teachers are furloughed. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me on the letter to Secretary Hagel.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Texas for \nhis courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have been informed that the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services has become a private fundraiser to raise \nfunds from the very industry she regulates in order to implement \nObamaCare. This raises all sorts of troubling concerns. There is an \nappearance of impropriety and a conflict of interest. There is an \nappearance that there is basically a shakedown going on--extracting \nmoney from companies she regulates in order to implement the \nPresident's health care law. This is certainly unethical--representing \na conflict of interest--and possibly illegal. However, it has provided \nus a useful reminder about ObamaCare: that it represents one of the \nworst examples of crony capitalism that exist today. Unfortunately, \nthat is true of a number of the administration's policies, but let me \njust explain what I mean.\n  When the private enterprise and the government become so intertwined \nas to become mutually dependent, usually what that means is the people \nwho can hire the most lobbyists, the best lawyers, and others, compete \nunfairly for government benefits.\n  The concern is that since Secretary Sebelius is going to be the one \nwho doles out grants and other benefits under ObamaCare, there is the \nall-too-human temptation to favor those who have gotten you out of a \ncrack and done you a favor.\n  Let's review how ObamaCare is supposed to work in the first place. \nThe Federal Government is supposed to come up with its own definition \nof health insurance. What we own right now may not be good enough for \nthe government and its standard for health insurance. It is demanding \nthat private businesses offer their employees this Washington-approved \ninsurance or they get penalized.\n  It is also demanding that some Americans--many Americans--pay for \ncoverage they don't want, don't need, and may not be able to afford. \nThe best example of that is young adults--sometimes called the young \nand invincible--who may not think they need comprehensive health care \ninsurance. They may think, well, perhaps I need more of a catastrophic \npolicy or something else that will take care of me if things really \nturn bad. As a result of ObamaCare, these young people will be forced \nto buy coverage they don't need. Many of them don't want it and can't \nafford it.\n  They will literally see their insurance premiums skyrocket because of \na phenomenon known as age-banding. Age-banding is where older Americans \ncannot be charged more than three times what younger people can be \ncharged. We all know that as we age, we utilize more health care \nservices. Here again, younger Americans are being asked to subsidize \ntheir elders in ObamaCare.\n  One way to look at it is the Obama administration has decided that \nthe purchase of an expensive government-approved product sold by \ncertain private companies is a condition of American citizenship. For \nthose who are American citizens and live here, they have to buy it. If \nthey don't, they pay the penalty. That is one example of crony \ncapitalism.\n  Private companies are turning into de facto public utilities, and \nAmericans are forced to buy their products but only those products \napproved by the regulators here in Washington. It is the ultimate \nmarriage of big business and big government, and it is bad for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Now Secretary Sebelius has gone a step further. She is using her \nleverage and power as a regulator over private companies to force them \nto fund ObamaCare. We all see what is going on. Secretary Sebelius is \nmaking the health care industry an offer they cannot refuse. After all, \nher agency regulates those companies and has enormous influence over \ntheir business operations.\n  Indeed, ObamaCare has expanded Health and Human Services' regulatory \npower so much, we could say it essentially amounts to a government \ntakeover of one-sixth of the national economy. Anytime there is a \ndramatic increase in Federal regulation of bureaucratic authority, \nthere will also be a dramatic increase in crony capitalism.\n  Health and Human Services granted a series of waivers from \nObamaCare's annual limit requirements, which fostered the impression \nthat certain companies, labor unions, and other institutions were \ngetting preferential treatment. Why not treat all Americans the same \nrather than have the government pick winners and losers, with the \ntemptation to pick their friends and political supporters and give them \nspecial favors?\n  We saw this also in the government-run bailout of the Chrysler \nCorporation when the company's secured bondholders received less for \ntheir loans than the United Auto Workers pension fund.\n  For that matter, we also saw it in the notorious Solyndra project. \nPresident Obama's entire green agenda energy policy is based on the \nidea that the Federal Government should be playing venture capitalist \nwith taxpayer dollars. We all know that when Solyndra went bankrupt, \nthe administration favored private lenders over taxpayers, which was a \nviolation of the law.\n  But there are many other private companies that have received \ntaxpayer funding for political or ideological reasons, and that is why \nwe say that crony capitalism undermines public trust in government \nbecause not everybody is treated the same. The government--those in \npower--picks winners and losers, political favorites, friends, and \nfamily.\n\n  I have one final point. We learned about the Sebelius shakedown on \nthe same day we learned that the IRS has been deliberately targeting \nand harassing some organizations based on their political views.\n  As we all know, the IRS has a very important and key role in \nadministering some of the biggest parts of ObamaCare and thus will be \ncollecting massive amounts of new information about individual \nAmericans. That was always a bad idea, but now, after we have learned \nabout the abuses at the IRS, it sounds even more dangerous than ever. \nAfter what we have learned so far, how can Americans feel confident \nthat the IRS won't abuse these new powers after having abused its \ncurrent powers? Why should the American people believe what they have \nbeen told when they have been lied to time and time again about the \nIRS's activities?\n  Back in March 2012, the former IRS Commissioner categorically denied \nthat his agency was targeting certain political organizations. Now we \nknow that he was not only wrong, we also know they intentionally lied. \nWe also know that senior IRS officials--many\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nwho still have their jobs--learned of these abuses 2 years ago and \nnever corrected the record.\n  In short, if we ever needed another reason to get rid of ObamaCare \nand replace it with market-driven, patient-centered reform, the IRS has \nprovided us with one.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I remember--and I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer does too--an early morning in March when we completed our \nbudget deliberations. That was a couple of months ago. I remember the \noutcry about the Senate not following regular order in passing a \nbudget. On that March morning, we followed regular order. We passed a \nbudget. We took up lots of amendments. We spent hours on debate. We \nvoted on many amendments, and the Senate worked its will. Of course, \nthe House has also worked its will. It passed a budget that is \ndifferent from the Senate budget.\n  The next step in regular order is for the House and Senate to meet in \nwhat is called a conference to work out the differences between the \nHouse and the Senate so we can then have a budget for the country. That \nis how the regular process works.\n  I know for the last couple of years we have had budgets. We have had \nbudgets because of grand bargains that have been agreed to on debt \nextensions and things such as that, but there is now a cry to follow \nregular order. That is what we should do: Follow regular order. So the \nnext step is to go into a conference.\n  I must tell my colleagues, I don't quite understand why the \nRepublican leader is objecting to going to conference. He is trying to \nsay, We will go to conference if the Senate agrees with the House. No, \nwe don't go to conference because we agree with one body; we go to \nconference to work out our differences. So I am extremely disappointed \nthat those who are yelling the loudest about following regular order \nare now preventing us from using regular order.\n  We need to get to conference, and one of the reasons is so we can get \nrid of sequestration. Sequestration means across-the-board mindless \ncuts. It treats every priority in government the same. That is \nmindless. That is not what we should be doing. It is having a major \nimpact on the mission of many agencies in this country. They can't do \nwhat the public wants them to do because they don't have the budget \nsupport to do it. For an agency that is affected by sequestration, it \namounts to almost 10 percent of their budget, because they have to cram \nin savings over a short number of months. Also, it only affects some \nagencies, not all. Not all of the programs are affected by \nsequestration. But those discretionary programs that are affected are \nacross the board, without any discretion.\n  If the Presiding Officer ran into a tough economic time or someone we \nrepresent does and they lose some income, they look at their family \nbudget. They may have money put aside for rent or mortgage payments, \nmaybe some money put aside for a food budget for their family, and \nmaybe there is some money put aside to go to an Orioles-Red Sox game.\n  They are going to have to make some tough choices, but they are going \nto make choices based upon what is most important to their family. They \ncertainly are going to pay their rent payment or their mortgage payment \nto keep the roof over their family home.\n  So that is what we should be doing. We have to make decisions, and we \ncannot do these across-the-board cuts. It is hurting agencies. These \nare cuts on top of cuts on top of cuts.\n  Let me mention one group that will be particularly affected by that, \nand that is our Federal workforce. These are the people who are at NIH, \nthe talented scientists doing the research that is keeping us healthy. \nThey are finding the answers to the dread diseases in our society. \nThese are people who are standing guard on our border, keeping us safe. \nThese are people who do food inspections to make sure we have a healthy \nfood supply. These are people who help our seniors, to make sure they \nget the checks they need for their dignity in their older years. These \nare people who are working for the public.\n  What have we done to them? Three straight years of freezes, no \nincrease in their salaries. We are now looking at what we are going to \ndo with their benefit structure. On top of that, we have freezes on the \nnumber of employees; therefore, they are being asked to do more with \nless. And now we have furloughs, which is basically cuts--cuts in their \nsalary.\n  It is not the Federal payroll that causes the deficits we have today. \nAs the Presiding Officer and I know, it is the fact that we went to war \nin two countries, we cut taxes, we went through a recession. We have to \nanswer the way of getting out of this problem in a balanced approach. \nWe have already done the discretionary cuts to those agencies, and we \nare now affecting their ability to do their mission.\n  I want to mention some of the effects of sequestration on the \ncitizens of Maryland, whom I have the opportunity to represent in the \nSenate.\n  Maryland will lose approximately $14.4 million in funding for primary \nand secondary education. Twelve thousand fewer students will be served \nand approximately 30 fewer schools will receive funding. In Maryland, \nwe believe education is a top priority. That is how we compete. That is \nhow we invest in our future. We invest in our children.\n  Maryland will lose approximately $10 million in funds for about 120 \nteachers, aides, and staff who help our children with disabilities.\n  Around 770 fewer low-income students in Maryland will receive aid to \nhelp them finance the cost of college, and around 440 fewer students \nwill get work-study jobs that help them pay for college. These are \nprograms that Democrats and Republicans have fought for over the years \nto make sure they are funded. Now, in Maryland, we are going to have to \ncut back.\n  Head Start and Early Head Start services would be eliminated for \napproximately 800 children in Maryland, reducing access to critical \nearly education.\n  The list goes on and on and on.\n  Maryland would lose about $3 million in environmental funding to \nensure clean water and air quality, as well as prevent pollution from \npesticides and hazardous waste. We have worked hard to clean up the \nChesapeake Bay and provide a safe environment for our families. That is \nin jeopardy as a result of sequestration. In addition, Maryland could \nlose another $467,000 in grants for fish and wildlife protection.\n  In Maryland, there will be 46,000--tens of thousands--of civilians in \nthe Department of Defense who will be furloughed, reducing gross \npayroll by around $353.7 million in total in our State.\n  Maryland will lose about $317,000 in justice assistance grants. These \ngrants support law enforcement. We all talk about supporting law \nenforcement. These grants also support prosecution and courts, crime \nprevention and education, corrections and community corrections, drug \ntreatment and enforcement, and crime victim and witness initiatives.\n  Maryland will lose about $66,000 in funding for job search \nassistance, referral, and placement, meaning around 9,270 fewer people \nwill get the help and skills they need to find employment.\n  Madam President, 2,050 fewer children in Maryland will receive \nvaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, \nwhooping cough, influenza, and hepatitis B.\n  Maryland will lose approximately $551,000 in funds to help upgrade \nits ability to respond to public health threats, including infectious \ndiseases, natural disasters, and biological, chemical, nuclear, and \nradiological events.\n  Maryland will lose about $1.6 million in grants to help prevent and \ntreat substance abuse, resulting in around 2,500 fewer admissions to \nsubstance abuse programs.\n  Maryland health departments will lose about $595,000, resulting in \naround 14,900 fewer HIV tests.\n  Maryland could lose up to $124,000 in funds that provide services to \nvictims of domestic violence.\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n  My point is these are cuts that I do not think the public wants us to \ndo. In Congress, each of us says: Oh, we did not mean that. Well, it is \ntime for us to act. Democrats and Republicans, coming together in a \nbipartisan way, compromise. That is what our Founding Fathers \nenvisioned we would do--working together--so we have a balanced \napproach.\n  Just look at compulsory spending, mandatory spending. We can organize \nour health care delivery system in a more cost-effective way. Dealing \nwith individuals with high-cost interventions--we can save money \nthere--reduce hospital readmission rates. There are ways we can bring \ndown costs in a sensible way. Our troops are coming home from \nAfghanistan. We can reduce our military spending. We can certainly look \nat the $1.2 trillion we spend every year through the Tax Code--that is \non a yearly basis--tax expenditures. We can certainly close some of \nthose loopholes and get the badly needed revenues so we can deal with \nour budget in a balanced, responsible way.\n  Let's work together in a bipartisan fashion, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  One more thing it will do: Solving problems gives predictability, and \npeople will know what the rules are. They will know what our budget is, \nthey will know what our Tax Code is, and that unleashes our economy and \ncreates jobs, which helps the economy and helps balance our budget.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's take the next step. The next step is to \ngo to conference on the budget. Let's work out the differences between \nthe House and the Senate. Let's do what we are supposed to do in \nregular order.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to remove their objections, and let's \nget to a conference on the budget as soon as possible.\n  With that, I see my distinguished friend from Utah who is on the \nfloor. I always learn a lot when he speaks, so I am going to yield the \nfloor for my colleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on a matter that \ndeserves the attention of everyone in this Chamber.\n  By now we all know about what is going on at the Internal Revenue \nService. We have seen the report from the Treasury Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, TIGTA, indicating that between 2010 and 2012 \nthe IRS was targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt \nstatus for increased levels of scrutiny.\n  We have read the accounts of conservative groups that were asked \nimproper questions about their donors while some of their applications \nwere delayed for more than 3 years, even as applications for groups \nfriendly to the President and liberal causes were promptly approved.\n  We have heard the apologies from senior IRS officials and the \ncondemnations from the White House itself. While we know for a \ncertainty that this unacceptable behavior was going on at the IRS, \nthere is still much more we do not know.\n  For example, we still do not know why the targeting began or why only \nconservative groups were targeted by the IRS examiners.\n  We do not know the full extent to which senior officials at the IRS \nand Department of Treasury became aware of these practices, when they \nfound out, and what they did or did not do to put a stop to these \npractices.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we do not know why, when Members of \nCongress asked questions about these issues last year, and after senior \nofficials certainly knew of the problem--or problems--we were led to \nbelieve that no groups were being targeted.\n  Indeed, neither Congress nor the American people learned anything \nabout these activities from the responsible officials until they were \ntrapped and their hands were forced.\n  There are not words to describe what has gone on here. Some of us \nhave tried. Words such as ``unconscionable,'' ``unbelievable,'' and \n``Nixonian'' have been thrown around, rightfully, in my opinion.\n  But regardless of the words we use to describe it, this is easily the \nmost shocking and outrageous turn of events we have seen in Washington \nin some time--and that is saying something.\n  One thing I am glad to see is that these actions have, for the most \npart, been condemned by Members of both parties. In the end, I hope \nboth Republicans and Democrats will work together to address these \nissues.\n  I have said from the outset that it does not matter if a tax-exempt \ngroup is liberal, conservative, or moderate. It is an outrage that the \nIRS would single out any group based on its political beliefs. On that \npoint there is bipartisan agreement in Congress and throughout the \ncountry.\n  On the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus and I are \nundertaking a bipartisan investigation into this matter to find out \nexactly what happened and make sure this type of thing never happens \nagain.\n  I am happy to be working with Chairman Baucus on this effort, and I \nwant to assure my colleagues that we are going to get to the bottom of \nthis. We are going to find out just how far down the rabbit hole the \nIRS went in singling out groups based on their political beliefs. We \nare going to find out why the IRS ignored a bedrock rule of tax \nadministration: Treat similarly situated taxpayers similarly--always. \nWe are going to find out exactly who was responsible, and we are going \nto hold them accountable for their actions.\n\n  The IRS needs to come clean about what went on here. Chairman Baucus \nand I intend to make sure they do.\n  Sadly, while the targeting of conservative groups in the review \nprocess has gotten most of the attention thus far, there are other \nissues involving the IRS that are every bit as disconcerting.\n  There are news reports indicating that in 2012, the same IRS office \nimproperly disclosed confidential information about certain \nconservative groups to media organizations.\n  Last November, the journalist group ProPublica requested 501(c)(4) \napplications for 67 different nonprofits. Less than 2 weeks later, the \nIRS produced application documents submitted by 31 of the \norganizations. Included in this group of documents were the \napplications from nine conservative organizations that were still under \nconsideration by the IRS. ProPublica subsequently posted six of those \napplications in redacted form on the Internet and published articles \nanalyzing the information they obtained.\n  This is disturbing for at least three reasons. First and foremost, \nunder section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS is prohibited \nfrom disclosing applications for tax-exempt status that are still under \nreview. While the IRS is authorized, under section 6104, to release \napplication materials of groups that have already been granted tax-\nexempt status, pending applications are required by law to remain \nconfidential. This appears to be a pretty cut-and-dried violation of \nthe Internal Revenue Code, meaning that civil and criminal penalties \nmay apply.\n  Second, the IRS responded to ProPublica's request in just 13 days. \nThat seems extraordinarily swift, and it raises the question of how \nlong the IRS normally takes to respond to such document requests. I do \nnot want to prejudge anything, but I suspect it usually takes longer \nthan 13 days to hear back from the IRS. It certainly takes longer than \nthat for the IRS to respond to requests from Congress.\n  Finally, this revelation comes not too long after other allegations \nthat the IRS disclosed confidential information submitted by \nconservative nonprofits.\n  In the spring of 2012, activist groups and media outlets began \nposting confidential donor information regarding the National \nOrganization for Marriage, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, on the \nInternet. Such information is also required by law to be kept \nconfidential.\n  Although the IRS is authorized to release yearly forms filed by tax-\nexempt organizations, the law prohibits donor information from being \ndisclosed, and that is whether it is a conservative, moderate, or \nliberal organization. Yet National Organization for Marriage's \ndocuments that found their way online\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nin the middle of a Presidential election appeared to have come from the \nIRS. This was suspicious, to say the least.\n  That is why, in May of 2012, I sent a letter to the IRS Commissioner \nrequesting an investigation into whether the IRS publicly disclosed \nconfidential donor information about the National Organization for \nMarriage. To date, I have not received a substantive response.\n  So in addition to the revelations that the IRS was improperly \ntargeting conservative groups for scrutiny of their 501(c)(4) \napplications, we have these unanswered questions about the possible \nillegal disclosure of confidential information to media outlets and \nother organizations. This is another matter that needs to be resolved \nin order to restore the credibility of the IRS as a government agency.\n  That is why I, along with all the Republican members of the Senate \nFinance Committee, have submitted a letter to the Treasury Inspector \nGeneral asking that he look into these issues.\n  Among other things, our letter requests that TIGTA--that is the \nInspector General's organization--investigate to determine which \nemployees at the IRS were responsible for improperly disclosing \nconfidential documents to ProPublica and whether any actions have been \ntaken against them.\n  In addition, this letter asks for an investigation into whether the \nIRS followed its usual Freedom of Information Act procedures in its \nprompt response to ProPublica's document request.\n  Our letter asks TIGTA to determine whether the IRS ever undertook an \ninvestigation to determine if the agency was responsible for leaking \nthe National Organization for Marriage's donor information.\n  The American people have a right to expect government agencies to \nperform their functions in a neutral, unbiased manner. When any agency \nbreaks that trust, it undermines the credibility of the entire \ngovernment.\n  These are not matters that can simply be wished away by public \napologies and condemnations.\n  They cannot be covered up by a handful of resignations, and they are \nnot covered up by an apology. I hope the administration knows this. The \nonly way to fully address these issues and to fully restore the \ncredibility of the IRS is to have full accounting of the facts. In one \nway or another, we are going to learn all we can about the facts and \nwhat went on there. I hope we can do so with the full and complete \ncooperation of the administration.\n  Look, the IRS is the most powerful agency in government. Our \nliberties depend upon an impartial IRS. We know many of the employees \nof the IRS are represented by one of the toughest unions in this \ncountry. We can presume from that most of them are not Republicans. Be \nthat as it may, the Democrats I know whom I honor and respect are those \nwho keep their word, live within constraints, follow the rules, do what \nis right, and fight hard for their principles.\n  But the IRS is not a place where we should be doing anything but \nfighting hard for the principles of fair treatment of all U.S. \ncitizens. I would be decrying this if the IRS was doing this to liberal \norganizations. We do not expect it to ever do that, but I would surely \nbe decrying it. All I can say is that the very essence of liberty is \ninvolved with what the IRS does or is doing. If we cannot rely on the \nmost powerful agency in government to treat people fairly, then this \ncountry is in much greater trouble than many of us think it is. We know \nwe are in trouble. We know we are living beyond our means. We know we \nare not doing what is right in this country. We know Congress could do \na much better job than it is doing. That includes both Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is inexcusable for an agency with the power the IRS has \nto be involved in these types of shenanigans. It is chilling, \nabsolutely chilling to anybody who thinks about it, that this most \npowerful agency can basically come down on anybody for almost any \nreason if it is not honest.\n  We have to restore the trust and the honesty of the IRS. We have to \nbe able to rely on the IRS being fair, impartial, and in doing what is \nright. I think I speak for my colleagues on the Democratic side. Many \nof them are as outraged as I am about what went on here. It is not \nright. I think the American people fully understand that.\n  I appreciate those who are honest. I appreciate those who do abide by \ntheir ethical constraints. I appreciate those who are not political at \nthe IRS. There are many good people working there. I do not want them \nto be besmirched by the few. There might be a little bit more than a \nfew people who do not honor the ethical constraints that the IRS simply \nhas to live up to. Let's hope neither side will ever again use the IRS \nfor political purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor to follow \nup on the news that we have had on the IRS situation, which I know is \nconcerning to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, everyone. The \npower of government is real and the power of the IRS is very real. So \nanything involving an abuse of power in the IRS is going to concern \nAmericans irrespective of their political leanings.\n  Before I do, I just wish to comment on something that happened a few \nmoments ago at a press conference at the White House. I have tremendous \nrespect for the Office of the Presidency and for anyone who would hold \nthemselves out to hold the office. So I say this with the highest \nrespect.\n  I think the President today in his press conference potentially made \na mistake in an answer he gave. I would encourage the White House to \nclear it up as soon as possible. He was asked specifically if he or \nanyone in the White House knew about what was going on at the IRS \nbefore April 22 of this year.\n  The President's answer was that he did not know about the inspector \ngeneral's report until he read about it in the press. So I would submit \nto you he did not answer that question. I am not implying he did know \nabout it. I am just encouraging the White House and those there to \nclear this up as soon as possible.\n  It is kind of reminiscent of when Attorney General Holder would not \nanswer Senator Paul's question about whether American citizens could be \ntargeted in the homeland with a drone. That led--we all remember what \nit led to. It is a very simple and straightforward question. I would \nencourage the White House and the President to echo what Jay Carney \nsaid just a couple days ago, which is no one in the White House knew \nanything about it. I think it is important for the President to answer \nthat clearly; again, not because I am implying he did know, because I \nthink if they leave that out there, it creates questions that should \nnot be created. I hope they will do that. It is important.\n  I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate and the American \npeople a compilation of stories that have emerged since the initial \nquestion emerged. They are very troubling. They extend, quite frankly, \nbeyond the IRS, but I will begin with the IRS. Here is a report from \nthe Washington Examiner. The headline reads: ``IRS denied tax-exempt \nstatus to pro-lifers on behalf of Planned Parenthood.''\n  Let me read what it says inside. It says: ``In one case, the IRS \nwithheld approval of an application for tax exempt status for Coalition \nfor Life of Iowa.''\n  In a phone call that this reporter reported he had with one of the \nleaders--I am sorry. One of the leaders claimed that in a phone call he \nhad with the IRS on June 6 of 2009, ``the IRS agent `Ms. Richards' told \nthe group to send a letter to the IRS with the entire board's \nsignatures stating that, under perjury of the law, they do not picket/\nprotest or organize groups to picket or protest outside of Planned \nParenthood.''\n  They said that ``once the IRS received this letter, this application \nwould be approved.'' That is troubling if true. That is one report that \nis in the news.\n  Here is another one. This one comes from a very respected individual \nin the United States. His name is Franklin Graham. He is the son of the \nReverend Billy Graham. He claims the Billy Graham Evangelical \nAssociation and the family's international humanitarian organization \nSamaritan's Purse, the\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nIRS notified them in September that it was conducting a ``review'' of \ntheir activities for tax year 2010.\n  He goes on to say, by the way, that this review happened after Mr. \nGraham's organization published newspaper ads in North Carolina backing \na State constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. That is in \nthe news. That was from Politico. Again, I am just reporting what \ndifferent outlets are reporting.\n\n  This is another report that has been out there. I think I alluded to \nthis yesterday in my speech. This talks about how the same IRS office \nthat deliberately targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt \nstatus in the runup to the 2012 election released nine pending \nconfidential applications of conservative groups to ProPublica late \nlast year. I think this is actually ProPublica admitting that is where \nthey got the information.\n  This is in response to a request for the applications for 67 \ndifferent nonprofits last November. So this is an admission, basically, \nfrom ProPublica, which is in this not-for-profit investigative \nreporting group. They are admitting the source of these leaked \ndocuments was the IRS office in Cincinnati, the leaked documents of \nnine conservative groups.\n  So now it is no longer audits, it is cooperating with investigative \njournalists by provided them with information which is illegal to \nprovide them, confidential tax information. That is what this report \nsays from the organization that got the leak.\n  This is FOX News Latino. It reports that the former President of San \nAntonio tea party said they received a questionnaire with over 50 \nquestions, including inquiries into whom the group met with, where \ntheir meetings were held, who was in attendance, the subjects of \ninternal e-mails, et cetera.\n  This is in line with some of the other stories we have been hearing \naround the country. This was actually posted online. These are letters \ngoing back and forth between the Richmond tea party and the IRS. These \nare the actual online letters we pulled, with some information redacted \nfor privacy.\n  Some of the questions they were asked: Provide the following \ninformation for all events and programs you have conducted and \nparticipated in from October 22 to now.\n  They wanted copies of handouts provided to the audience. They wanted \nto know if there were any speeches or forums conducted in the event or \nprogram, provide detailed contents of the speeches or forums, the names \nof the speakers and panels, their credentials, the names of persons \nfrom your organization and the amount of time they spent on the event \nor the program. Indicate the percentage of time and resources you spent \non all of the events and programs in relation to your activity.\n  It goes on and on. This is page after page of information being asked \nof a citizen group by the IRS. Anyone who has gotten a letter from the \nIRS understands it is never a pleasant circumstance, unless there is a \nrefund check in that envelope. You go to the mailbox, open it, it says \nIRS, and no one likes that.\n  Just imagine this group of everyday citizens. These are not \nprofessional political activists. They do not have entire law firms at \ntheir disposal. These are just everyday Americans who are speaking out \nabout the principles of limited government and free enterprise. By the \nway, if they were speaking out in favor of big government, they still \nhave the same right not to be harassed by the IRS.\n  So I just want to bring the real face of this to bear, because this \nis not just a problem with an abuse of power in the IRS. Think about \nthe impact this has had on the lives of everyday Americans who one day \ndecided: I want to get involved in politics. I want to speak out. I \nwant to say something. They get hit with a letter such as this, this \nkind of questionnaire, which quite frankly what happens with a lot of \nthese people is they decide I am not going to do it. I am not going to \nget involved. I do not have the time for this. I do not need the \nhassle. Maybe that was the intent.\n  So we went over that for a moment. Here is something that is very \ntroubling. This is from USA Today. The USA Today headline: ``IRS \napproved liberal groups while Tea Party in limbo.'' Some of those \ngroups were approved in as little as 9 months. Bus for Progress in New \nJersey, a not-for-profit that uses red, white, and blue buses to drive \nprogressive change, Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, \nthey got their tax-exempt status just 9 months after a pretty simple \nand straightforward process.\n  Progress Florida in my own home State, similar experience. Again, \nthis is USA Today. I think this was their cover story yesterday, where \nit described the difference in how tea party groups are treated, in \ncomparison, that had words in their title such as ``progress'' or \n``progressive.''\n  Here is one more that actually shows this kind of behavior extends \nbeyond the Internal Revenue Service. This is from the Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, May 14. It talks about how public records \nproduced by EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, in response to a \nlawsuit filed by CEI under the Freedom of Information Act, show a \npattern of making it far more difficult for limited government groups, \nin particular those that argue for more freedom and less EPA, how it \nmakes it harder for them to get access to public records.\n  For example, green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, the Sierra Club, the Public Employees for Environmental \nResponsibility, Earth Justice, they had their fees waived in 75 out of \n82 cases.\n\n  Meanwhile, the EPA effectively or expressly denied CEI's request for \nfee waivers in 14 of its 15 requests--14 of its 15 requests. So that is \n93 percent of the time versus basically the alternative, which is what \nthey did to these other groups. Again, all a chain in a pattern of \nbehavior that I think is not anything any of us ever want to see. So \nfar I have not seen it, and I do not think we are going to, quite \nfrankly. I suspect we will not see a single Member of Congress come to \nthe floor of either Chamber and say this is acceptable behavior.\n  I wish to tie in the loop, though, because this is not just about \nthese agencies run amok. This is not just about a handful of people in \nthe IRS's Cincinnati office or somewhere else doing something wrong. \nThis is much deeper than that.\n  I talked about it yesterday, I will repeat it today; that is, the \nsense that this administration has pursued a real culture of \nintimidation in the political process, including the way it ran its \ncampaign. But I wish to take it one step further. What this should \nremind us of is the danger of government power. Let me stop there and \nremind everyone. We need government. No one here--I do not know any \nanarchists who serve in the U.S. Government, for the most part. All of \nus believe government has an important role to play in our country and \nthe national defense. By and large, we believe there needs to be a \nsafety net to help those who cannot help themselves, not as a way of \nlife but to help those who have fallen to stand and try again.\n  We think the government plays an important role in our laws. One of \nthe things that attracts people to the United States--for example, to \ndo business here--is that we have a legal system where property rights \nare going to be respected. So if one says they own a piece of property, \nit belongs to them. No one would necessarily dispute that. If they do, \nthey have to go to court. There are countries in the world where the \nowner of the property is whoever has the bigger guns or whoever has the \nbest connection to government. We take that for granted sometimes.\n  So there is a role for government to play. It is a very important \nrole. But the problem is that our Framers, the Founders of this Nation, \nhad a deep suspicion of government no matter who was running the \ngovernment. They rejected this notion that if we get very good people \nin government, we will have very good government.\n  Government has a role to play. But when government's powers extend \nbeyond its natural limits or its important limits, we start to have \nproblems such as these emerge. I bring this to the floor because this \nis exactly what we have been debating in so many instances, is \nexpanding the natural power of government beyond where it should be and \nallowing it to have jurisdiction and influence over areas of our life, \nwhere no matter who is in charge, Republican or Democrat, we may not \nlike the way it turns out.\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\n  We talked about the IRS for a moment. The IRS is going to be on the \nfrontlines of enforcing the health care law. This is the same agency of \ngovernment that has for the most part over the last few years, now by \nadmission of everyone involved, been abusing power--at least some of \ntheir employees have. I don't want to besmirch the entire agency. As \nSenator Hatch was saying a few minutes ago, there are very good people \nat work all throughout government who would never participate in this \nsort of behavior.\n  My point is that this is the agency that was targeting Americans \nbecause they were organizing themselves as conservatives. This is now \nthe agency that is going to be empowered with new powers it has never \nhad before--the power to force every American to either buy health \ninsurance or pay a fine, buy health insurance or pay a tax.\n  In the weeks to come, I am going to be outlining examples of why \ngiving government more power than it should have creates situations \nlike this--the potential for situations like this to occur. There was \nenormous wisdom in limiting the power of the Federal Government that \nour Framers had, enormous wisdom in that. That is why they specifically \nsaid: If this Constitution doesn't give the Federal Government this \npower, it doesn't have it. We sometimes forget that lesson from two \ncenturies later, but we shouldn't. That is an important limit.\n  I think we can have an honest debate about what role government \nshould be playing in our lives and in our economy. There could be an \nhonest debate about that because there is a role for government to \nplay. There is an important role for government to play in our country. \nIt can go too far, whether it is in the realm of civil liberties or \neconomic liberties. That is what I think the debate should be focused \non in the weeks to come, in addition to getting to the bottom of what \nhas happened here, understanding clearly what has happened here.\n  I am involved in another endeavor: immigration reform. One of the \nbiggest impediments to immigration reform that I am facing--that we are \nfacing--is this distrust of the Federal Government. It is the belief \nthat they are not going to enforce the law. No matter what we pass or \nwhat we put in place, they are not going to do it. We tried this 20 or \n30 years ago, and they didn't do it. That is unfortunate. I hope we can \novercome that. I believe we can because the truth is that the vast \nmajority of Americans--the vast majority of Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents--are willing to deal with the fact that we have 11 million \npeople living in this country illegally so long as we can ensure that \nthis problem never happens again in the future. They are willing to \ndeal with that. We have to win their confidence that, in fact, the \nmeasures we are going to take are going to prevent that from happening \nin the future. We are struggling because people have such a distrust of \nthe government's willingness or ability to enforce the law. You see it, \neven in that issue, rear its head.\n  I think it is important to remind ourselves that even if government \nis run by the best people with the best of intentions, it has a \ntendency to do these sorts of things. You see that at every level but \nparticularly at the Federal level where there are such enormous powers.\n  Anytime we come here and debate giving government a new power, a new \nagency, a new mandate, or a new jurisdiction, we should be cognizant of \nthe history of government power. We should be cognizant of what it has \nmeant throughout human history. We should remember why the Framers \nlimited that power to begin with--because they understood that power \ncould be abused.\n  In the weeks to come, I know that I, along with all my colleagues, \nwant to get to the bottom of this. We want to understand from the IRS' \nperspective who was involved in doing this, why this happened, and, \nmore importantly, what we can do now to make sure this never, ever \nhappens again, what we can do now to ensure that not just in the IRS \nbut across the government that a situation like this never happens \nagain so that no matter what your political persuasion may be, no \nAmerican ever feels afraid to speak out politically because they may \nwind up the target of governmental action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3561-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3561-S3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               INEQUALITY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the English translation of remarks made this morning by \nPope Francis, who addressed the new nonresident ambassadors to the Holy \nSee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n english language translation of pope francis' address for the new non-\nresident ambassadors to the holy see: kyrgyzstan, antigua and barbuda, \n                 luxembourg and botswana (16 May 2013)\n\n       Your Excellencies,\n       I am pleased to receive you for the presentation of the \n     Letters accrediting you as Ambassadors Extraordinary and \n     Plenipotentiary to the Holy See on the part of your \n     respective countries: Kytgyzstan, Antigua and Barbuda, the \n     Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and Botswana. The gracious words \n     which you have addressed to me, for which I thank you \n     heartily, have testified that the Heads of State of your \n     countries are concerned to develop relations of respect and \n     cooperation with the Holy See. I would ask you kindly to \n     convey to them my sentiments of gratitude and esteem, \n     together with the assurance of my prayers for them and their \n     fellow citizens.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, our human family is presently \n     experiencing something of a turning point in its own history, \n     if we consider the advances made in various areas. We can \n     only praise the positive achievements which contribute to the \n     authentic welfare of mankind, in fields such as those of \n     health, education and communications. At the same time, we \n     must also acknowledge that the majority of the men and women \n     of our time continue to live daily in situations of \n     insecurity, with dire consequences. Certain pathologies are \n     increasing, with their psychological consequences; fear and \n     desperation grip the hearts of many people, even in the so-\n     called rich countries; the joy of life is diminishing; \n     indecency and violence are on the rise; poverty is becoming \n     more and more evident. People have to struggle to live and, \n     frequently, to live in an undignified way. One cause of this \n     situation, in my opinion, is in our relationship with money, \n     and our acceptance of its power over ourselves and our \n     society. Consequently the financial crisis which we are \n     experiencing makes us forget that its ultimate origin is to \n     be found in a profound human crisis. In the denial of the \n     primacy of human beings! We have created new idols. The \n     worship of the golden calf of old (cf. Ex 32:15-34) has found \n     a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the \n     dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any \n     truly humane goal.\n       The worldwide financial and economic crisis seems to \n     highlight their distortions and above all the gravely \n     deficient human perspective, which reduces man to one of his \n     needs alone, namely, consumption. Worse yet, human beings \n     themselves are nowadays considered as consumer goods which \n     can be used and thrown away. We have begun a throw away \n     culture. This tendency is seen on the level of individuals \n     and whole societies; and it is being promoted! In \n     circumstances like these, solidarity, which is the treasure \n     of the poor, is often considered counterproductive, opposed \n     to the logic of finance and the economy. While the income of \n     a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority \n     is crumbling. This imbalance results from ideologies which \n     uphold the absolute autonomy of markets and financial \n     speculation, and thus deny the right of control to States, \n     which are themselves charged with providing for the common \n     good. A new, invisible and at times virtual, tyranny is \n     established, one which unilaterally and irremediably imposes \n     its own laws and rules. Moreover, indebtedness and credit \n     distance countries from their real economy and citizens from \n     their real buying power. Added to this, as if it were needed, \n     is widespread corruption and selfish fiscal evasion which \n     have taken on worldwide dimensions. The will to power and of \n     possession has become limitless.\n       Concealed behind this attitude is a rejection of ethics, a \n     rejection of God. Ethics, like solidarity, is a nuisance! It \n     is regarded as counterproductive: as something too human, \n     because it relativizes money and power; as a threat, because \n     it rejects manipulation and subjection of people: because \n     ethics leads to God, who is situated outside the categories \n     of the market. These financiers, economists and politicians \n     consider God to be unmanageable, unmanageable even dangerous, \n     because he calls man to his full realization and to \n     independence from any kind of slavery. Ethics--naturally, not \n     the ethics of ideology--makes it possible, in my view, to \n     create a balanced social order that is more humane. In this \n     sense, I encourage the financial experts and the political \n     leaders of your countries to consider the words of Saint\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\n     John Chrysostom: ``Not to share one's goods with the poor is \n     to rob them and to deprive them of life. It is not our goods \n     that we possess, but theirs'' (Homily on Lazarus, 1:6-PG 48, \n     992D),\n       Dear Ambassadors, there is a need for financial reform \n     along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an \n     economic reform to benefit everyone. This would nevertheless \n     require a courageous change of attitude on the part of \n     political leaders. I urge them to face this challenge with \n     determination and farsightedness, taking account, naturally, \n     of their particular situations. Money has to serve, not to \n     rule! The Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but the \n     Pope has the duty, in Christ's name, to remind the rich to \n     help the poor, to respect them, to promote them. The Pope \n     appeals for disinterested solidarity and for a return to \n     person-centred ethics in the world of finance and economics.\n       For her part, the Church always works for the integral \n     development of every person, In this sense, she reiterates \n     that the common good should not be simply an extra, simply a \n     conceptual scheme of inferior quality tacked onto political \n     programmes. The Church encourages those in power to be truly \n     at the service of the common good of their peoples. She urges \n     financial leaders to take account of ethics and solidarity. \n     And why should they not turn to God to draw inspiration from \n     his designs? in this way, a new political and economic \n     mindset would arise that would help to transform the absolute \n     dichotomy between the economic and social spheres into a \n     healthy symbiosis.\n       Finally, through you, I greet with affection the Pastors \n     and the faithful of the Catholic communities present in your \n     countries. I urge them to continue their courageous and \n     joyful witness of faith and fraternal love in accordance with \n     Christ's teaching. Let them not be afraid to offer their \n     contribution to the development of their countries, through \n     initiatives and attitudes inspired by the Sacred Scriptures! \n     And as you inaugurate your mission, I extend to you, dear \n     Ambassadors, my very best wishes, assuring you of the \n     assistance of the Roman Curia for the fulfilment of you \n     duties. To this end, upon you and your families, and also \n     upon your Embassy staff, I willingly invoke abundant divine \n     blessings.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I don't usually comment much on religious matters, but I \nwas very impressed by what the Pope had to say today. In his remarks \nPope Francis called for a revamping of the global financial system, a \nsystem which he pointed out benefits the few, values money over human \ndignity, and continues to widen the gap between the rich and everybody \nelse.\n  While acknowledging the advances modern society has made in health \ncare, education, technology, and other areas, the Pope expressed his \nconcern for the least amongst us. The Pope said:\n\n       We must also acknowledge that the majority of the men and \n     women of our time continue to live daily in situations of \n     insecurity, with dire consequences . . . fear and desperation \n     grip the hearts of many people, even in the so-called rich \n     countries; the joy of life is diminishing; indecency and \n     violence are on the rise; poverty is becoming more and more \n     evident. People have to struggle to live and, frequently, to \n     live in an undignified way.\n\n  The Pope went on to say this in his rather brief remarks:\n\n       One cause of this situation . . . is in our relationship \n     with money, and our acceptance of its power over ourselves \n     and our society . . . The worship of the golden calf of old \n     has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and \n     the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking \n     any truly humane goal.\n\n  The Pope continued:\n\n       The worldwide financial and economic crisis seems to \n     highlight their distortions and above all the gravely \n     deficient human perspective, which reduces man to one of his \n     needs alone, namely, consumption. Worse yet, human beings \n     themselves are nowadays considered as consumer goods which \n     can be used and thrown away. We have begun a throw away \n     culture.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Solidarity, which is the treasure of the poor, is often \n     considered counterproductive, opposed to the logic of finance \n     and the economy.\n\n  Further quoting the Pope, and I hope everybody listens to this:\n\n       While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, \n     that of the majority is crumbling.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is what the Pope said today:\n\n       While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, \n     that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results \n     from ideologies which uphold the absolute autonomy of markets \n     and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control \n     to States, which are themselves charged with providing for \n     the common good. A new, invisible and at times virtual, \n     tyranny is established, one which unilaterally and \n     irremediably imposes its own laws and rules. Moreover, \n     indebtedness and credit distance countries from their real \n     economy and citizens from their real buying power. Added to \n     this, as if it were needed, is widespread corruption and \n     selfish fiscal evasion, which have taken on worldwide \n     dimensions. The will to power and of possession has become \n     limitless.\n\n  This is from a speech Pope Francis made today. I think it is \nimportant that we listen to the Pope on this issue. Frankly, I have \nstrong disagreements with the Catholic Church on issues of women's \nrights, issues of gay rights, and a number of other issues. On this \nissue of what is happening economically around the world--the power of \nfinancial markets; the growing gap between the very rich and everyone \nelse; the need for government and for states around the world to step \nin and protect the dispossessed; the need to understand that money unto \nitself means nothing unless it is being used in a way that improves the \nlives of all people--that is a message coming from the Pope. It is a \nmessage worth thinking about and discussing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3562-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3562-S3563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THE IRS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. In the Senate, I hear a lot of criticism of government, \nsome of which is certainly justified. All of us, I would hope, are \ndeeply concerned, embarrassed, and disagree with what the IRS did in \nterms of picking out one political persuasion in terms of tax-exempt \nstatus. That is clearly wrong, unacceptable, and must be dealt with.\n  Many of my friends attack government day after day when government is \ntrying to do the right thing in protecting middle-class and working \nfamilies. There are some in the Congress, for example, who believe that \ngovernment programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nshould be significantly cut or that maybe government shouldn't even be \ninvolved in those areas. They believe these programs are \nunconstitutional.\n  If you were to eliminate Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, \nwhat would happen to tens of millions of people who rely on Social \nSecurity for their retirement, especially at a time when many private \npensions have been cut severely? If you make cuts or eliminate Medicare \nfor the old or you undo the Medicare system we know and turn it into \nthe system our friends in the House would like to have, what will \nhappen to elderly people when they get sick and need health care and \ndon't have the money in their own pockets to pay for that? I will tell \nyou what will happen.\n  This year alone, it is estimated that approximately 45,000 Americans \nwill die because they never made it to a doctor on time when they \nshould have made it. If you make major cuts in Medicare or do away with \nthe basic guarantees Medicare now provides, clearly the number of \npeople who will die will simply increase.\n  If you are 67 years of age and are diagnosed with cancer and Medicare \nis not there for you and you don't have a family who has money, what \nwill happen to you? Some of my Republican friends will say: Well, go to \ncharity. Charity is not going to be there to provide health care for \nmillions of people.\n  In terms of health care, what we must point out over and over again \nbecause many Americans don't understand it is that our Nation is the \nonly Nation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health \ncare to all people as a right of citizenship.\n  Today, although we hope that will change in the very near future, 50 \nmillion people have no health insurance. Many others have large \ndeductibles or copayments, which keep them from going to the doctor \nwhen they should.\n  We have invited the Ambassador from Denmark to join us in a town \nmeeting in Vermont on Saturday. He will explain to us how in Denmark, \namong many other countries throughout the world, they can provide \nhealth care to people that is virtually free from out-of-pocket \nexpenses and yet per capita end up spending substantially less than we \ndo. He will explain to us why the cost of their prescription drugs is \nsubstantially lower than it is in the United States.\n  In terms of education, this is at a time when in my State the average \ncollege graduate in Vermont leaves school some $28,000 in debt--roughly \nthe national average. This is at a time when hundreds of thousands of \nyoung people cannot afford to go to college, and we lose all of their \nintellectual capabilities and the genius they might provide\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nfor our society. In Denmark, college education is virtually free, \nincluding graduate school and medical school.\n  At a time when in our country millions of people are overworked and \nunderpaid; at a time when we work some of the longest hours of any \npeople in the industrialized world, when people in Vermont are working \nnot 40 hours a week but 50 hours a week, 60 hours a week; at a time \nwhen people are not working one job but two jobs, three jobs, trying to \ncobble together an income; at a time when some employers are hiring \npeople and providing zero vacation time or maybe, if one is lucky, a \nweek off, how does it happen that in countries such as Denmark people \nnot only get 5 weeks' guaranteed paid vacation, but they get another 11 \nvacation days?\n  In this country, we talk a lot about family values. However, if you \nare a working-class woman having a baby, you will get some maybe. If \nyou are working for a large enough employer, family medical leave may \nhave an impact and you may get some time off to have the baby, but you \ncan't stay home very long to take care of your newborn because you will \nnot have any money coming in. Millions of folks have a baby and go \nright back to work, putting the child back in childcare when they would \nprefer otherwise. How does it happen in countries such as Denmark that \nwomen get 4 weeks off, fully paid before they give birth, and then \nmonths off afterwards to stay home with the baby, not to mention three-\nquarters payment from the government for childcare, while we so poorly \nmanage that?\n\n  I think it is time we have a serious discussion about values, and \nthat discussion has to include whether we feel good about the fact that \nin this country so few have so much and so many have so little.\n  Do we feel comfortable with the growing imbalance in terms of income \nand wealth such that the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the wealth \nand the bottom 60 percent owns only 2.3 percent, and the gap between \nthe billionaire class and everybody else is growing wider?\n  As the Pope asked: Are we comfortable with a financial system where \nthe goal is not to invest in the productive economy but to make money \nfor itself, such that the top six financial institutions in this \ncountry have assets equivalent to some 70 percent of the GDP of the \nUnited States--some $9 trillion--and enormous political power?\n  This IRS business people are talking about on the floor of the Senate \nis related to the absurd campaign finance system we have where big \ncompanies can secretly put hundreds of millions of dollars into the \npolitical process. Are we comfortable with a political system where \npeople can make contributions in secret that end up in the political \nprocess and then end up on a 30-second ad on our TV--money coming from \nbillionaires who don't have to disclose their contributions?\n  So when we talk about values, it is important to assess who we are as \nAmericans and what we believe in. I believe most Americans believe we \nhave to do a lot better job at focusing on the needs of the declining \nand disappearing middle class; that we have to create millions of jobs \nso our young people do not have outrageously high levels of \nunemployment and older people who lose their jobs have nothing to go \nback to; that we have to address the issue of high childhood poverty; \nand we have to, in fact, make sure government works for all of the \npeople and not just the people on top.\n  I would just conclude by recommending to the Members and to the \nAmerican people they examine the remarks made this morning by Pope \nFrancis, which I think raise some very important issues. I think there \nis a lot to be learned from those remarks.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 50 years ago, in August 1963, Martin Luther \nKing wrote, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n  When a factory full of human beings collapses in Bangladesh, it \nmatters in Bucyrus and Boardman and Bellefontaine. When the concrete \nceiling of a shoe factory crumbles in Cambodia, it matters in Celina \nand Canton.\n  Earlier this month we observed Workers Memorial Day. We paused and \nremembered those Americans who had lost their lives on the job. We \nhonor their memories by passing laws to help ensure no other child \nwaits by the door for a mother or a father who will never return home \nfrom work.\n  Out of the ashes of the Triangle Shirt Waste Factory fire 100 years \nago in New York City, we fought and won workplace safety reforms that \nhave helped save countless lives decade after decade after decade in \nour country. Yet even though we have passed the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970, even though we have a National Labor Relations \nBoard, we still have a moral responsibility to be vocal about \nviolations to worker safety wherever it happens--whether it happens in \nCleveland, in Honolulu, or in Bangladesh.\n  We are interconnected with this world. Our economy is linked to the \nwomen and children--to the people--whose names we don't know, the \nworkers we don't know, who sew labels we all know in our shirts and in \nour sweaters. American and European retailers purchase some two-thirds \nof Bangladeshi garment production.\n  That is why, Mr. President, in the aftermath of the deadly Rana Plaza \ncollapse in Bangladesh and the Wing Star Shoes collapse outside of \nPhnom Penh, we might have expected outraged American companies to take \naction. That is not exactly what happened. Which member of this \nmultibillion-dollar industry will speak out for workers who face \nhazardous conditions for a minimum wage--in many cases of just $38 per \nmonth--making the clothes we wear in this country?\n  Today, Leader Reid, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Durbin of Illinois, Levin \nof Michigan, Leahy of Vermont, Murray of Washington State, Rockefeller \nof West Virginia, and I sent a letter to some of our leading American \nretailers. We are urging retailers such as Walmart to sign onto a \nlegally binding global accord to help ensure worker safety in \nBangladesh. We are asking a number of the largest retailers in America \nto sign onto this legally binding global accord to help ensure worker \nsafety in Bangladesh.\n  Remember, as Dr. King wrote some 50 years ago, injustice anywhere \nthreatens our ability to create a more just world. Signing this accord \nfrom our retailers is one step our leading retailers can take to help \nus usher in a new era of justice in this new century.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan).

Mr. President, I am back again to remind this body \nand the American people for what I think is perhaps the 32nd speech on \nthis subject that I have been giving weekly, that it is time, indeed it \nis well past time, for Congress to wake up to the disastrous effects of \nglobal climate change. The famous Mauna Loa Observatory has for the \nfirst time ever hit 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere. \nThat is an alarming benchmark to have hit.\n  What is happening? Over on the House side today they are repealing \nObamaCare for the 37th time. That is the level of seriousness in \nWashington right now. In particular, our oceans--the Presiding Officer \nrepresents the Bay State, I represent the Ocean State--our oceans face \nan unprecedented set of challenges that come from climate change as \nwell as from pollution and energy exploration and more.\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\n  We just have to look around to see it. We can look up to the far \nnorth and see that the Arctic ice is melting. Indeed, last summer sea \nice extant in the Arctic Ocean hit a record low.\n  If we go south to the tropic seas, we will see that live coral \ncoverage on Caribbean reefs is plummeting. It is down to less than 10 \npercent today. If we go to the top of the food chain, we will see \nmarine mammals so laden with PCBs, flame retardants, mercury, and other \nbioaccumulative pollutants that many of them are swimming toxic waste--\nliving, swimming toxic waste.\n  If we go to the very bottom of the food chain, we will see that the \npopulation of phytoplankton--some of our smallest ocean inhabitants and \nthe basic building block for the oceanic food chain--has dropped 40 \npercent during the 20th century.\n  If we go far away from where we are, we will reach the great Pacific \ngarbage patch, which is growing and swirling about the northern Pacific \nOcean.\n  Close to my home--and near the Presiding Officer's home--is \nNarragansett Bay, which is 4 degrees warmer in the winter than it was a \nfew decades ago.\n  Globally, the most threatening challenge, and the force behind many \nothers, is ocean acidification. Our oceans have absorbed more than 550 \nbillion tons of our carbon pollution. Try to wrap your head around a \nnumber that big. That is the carbon the ocean has absorbed from the \nexcess we have pumped into the atmosphere.\n  The result is pretty clear, and it is a matter of basic chemistry. \nThe oceans have become more acidic. Indeed, they have become 30 percent \nmore acidic. By the way, that is a measurement, not a theory.\n  By the end of this century, the increase could be as much as 160 \npercent more acidic. That makes life a lot harder for species such as \noysters, crabs, lobsters, corals, and even those plankton that comprise \nthe base of the food web.\n  Ocean temperatures are changing dramatically--also driven by carbon \npollution. Sea surface temperatures in 2012, from the Gulf of Maine to \nCape Hatteras, were the highest ever recorded in 150 years. By the way, \nthat is another measurement.\n  Fish stocks are shifting northward with some disappearing from U.S. \nwaters as they move farther offshore. As we know, when the temperature \nrises, water expands in volume. On top of that, fresh water pours out \nof Arctic snowpacks and ice sheets that are melting, and as a result \nsea levels are rising.\n  Tide gauges in Newport, RI, show an increase in average sea level of \n10 inches since 1930. That is a big deal when we in Rhode Island think \nof how devastating the great hurricane of 1938 was to our shores and \nwhat more would now befall us with 10 more inches of sea for such a \nstorm to throw at our shores.\n  At these tide gauges, measurements show not only the sea level rising \nbut the rate of sea level rise is increasing. This matches reports that \nsince 1990, the sea level has been rising faster than the rate \npredicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  I have said before: We will continue to take advantage of the ocean's \nbounty, as we should. We will trade, we will fish, and we will sail. We \nwill extract fuel and harness the wind. We will work our oceans. Navies \nand cruise ships, sailboats and supertankers will plow their surface. \nWe cannot undo this part of our relationship with the sea. What we can \nchange is what we do in return. For the first time we can become not \njust takers but caretakers of our oceans.\n  We are beginning to take some baby steps. Last week, the Senate voted \n67 to 32 to authorize a national endowment for the oceans, coasts, and \nGreat Lakes, which is a funding stream for research, restoration, and \nprotection of our marine and coastal resources. I hope that before long \nwe can find a way to fund it by working with all of my colleagues. The \nfamous ocean explorer Bob Ballard has described as ``a major problem . \n. . the disconnect between the importance of oceans and the meager \nfunds we as a nation invest to not only understand their complexity, \nbut become responsible stewards of the bounty they represent.''\n  This endowment--if we can get it over the remaining legislative \nhurdles and get it funded--will help us become more responsible \nstewards of that bounty. It will help us better respond to oilspills, \nit will help coastal States protect or relocate coastal infrastructure, \nand it will help our fisheries and marine industries take part in \neconomically important conservation efforts.\n  I sincerely appreciate the support shown for this amendment by \ncolleagues from every region of the country and both sides of the \naisle. Protecting the oceans upon which our communities and our economy \ndepend is neither a Democratic nor a Republican objective, and there \nought to be a great deal of agreement on the need to meet these \nchallenges.\n  We also see that agreement in the bipartisan Senate Oceans Caucus, \nwhich works to increase awareness of and find common ground on issues \nfacing the oceans and coasts.\n  My fellow cochair Senator Murkowski, honorary cochair Senator Mark \nBegich, Senator Mark Wicker, and all of our partners are working to \nstop illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. We are working to \nclean up marine debris and collect baseline scientific data so we can \nmake policy-informed decisions. This is important work. It demonstrates \nthe good both parties can accomplish when we come together. I look \nforward to getting it done, but it is not enough. Until we address what \nis causing our oceans to change so drastically, until we protect our \nplanet from carbon pollution unprecedented in human history, we are \ndoing little more than putting Band-Aids on a gaping and growing wound.\n\n  I want to push back on the idea that so many of us seem to have \naccepted, that we cannot do anything serious on carbon pollution. In \nfact, we can. The tools to do it lie right around us, if only we would \npick them up and go to work.\n  Very simply, here is my case: Pricing carbon is necessary. Make big \ncarbon polluters pay a fee to the American people to cover the cost of \ndumping their waste into our atmosphere and oceans--a cost they now \npush off on to the rest of us--and return that fee to the American \npeople.\n  At present, however, political conditions in Congress do not allow us \nto price carbon. It is necessary. Political conditions do not allow us \nto do it, so we must change those political conditions.\n  Changing the political conditions will require three actions: No. 1, \nthere has to be a regulatory threat to the polluters. No. 2, there must \nbe a political threat to the deniers here in the Senate and in \nCongress. No. 3, those of us who wish to limit carbon pollution must \ngather the armies that are on our side.\n  Let me go through those steps. First, as long as the polluters and \ntheir allies control Congress, legislative action is unlikely. That \nmeans we have to rely on the executive branch for regulatory action--\nvery strong regulatory action that will change the equation for the \npolluters. That is the test. Will it change the equation for the \npolluters?\n  The status quo is a win for the polluters. They pollute for free. \nChange that balance, and it will not take them long to come to \nCongress. Why? Because regulatory action puts costs directly on the \npolluters but creates no revenues for them. A carbon pollution fee, now \nthat creates revenues. A portion of that could offset their costs of \ntransitioning to a green economy.\n  If that is the choice they have--regulation with no revenues or a fee \nthey can get revenues from--it becomes in their interest to strike a \ndeal in Congress. This regulatory step in the executive branch will, \nhowever, require an awakening at the White House.\n  Second, to create a meaningful political threat, the advocates out \nthere for our climate and our oceans will need to employ all of the \nsophisticated political tools the polluters use--all the political \nartillery of the post-Citizens United world.\n  There is an expression that you should not bring a knife to a \ngunfight. Right now climate advocates bring not even a knife but a \nfeather to this gunfight. It is no wonder we lose. When deniers in \nCongress see real artillery coming on the political field against them, \nsome will rethink.\n  Third, and last, is gathering the armies. There is astonishingly wide \nsupport for action on climate. Obviously environmental groups support \nthis, as\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nwell as the green energy and investment industry, our national security \nofficials, property casualty insurers and reinsurers, young people--\nsuch as the growing college movement for coal divestment--faith groups, \nmany utilities, celebrities, hunting, fishing, outdoor, conservation \ngroups, retailers, such as Apple, Coca-Cola and Nike, labor groups, \nmayors, local officials, and the public. The public is with us, and the \npolls show that.\n  The problem: Most of this support is latent and unorganized. None of \nthese groups feel they can carry this battle on their own; yet if they \nchoose to unite, create an allied command, assemble these various \ndivisions and join in on a strategy that deploys them all effectively \ninto action, that latent strength becomes potent strength, and that is \na game changer.\n  When the polluting industry is looking down the barrel of a \nregulatory gun, when their political allies are fearful of a strongly \nbacked political operation--backed also by the American people--when \nmobilized and motivated forces from a wide swath of the economy and \nmultiple sectors are all active, the political landscape then shifts \ndramatically and a price on carbon is achievable.\n  I propose to the American people, to those who believe it is time to \nwake up and take action, to fend off devastating changes to our oceans \nand our climate: Let us be not faint of heart. Let us have the strength \nof our convictions and get to work and get this done. We can do it. The \ntools to do it already lie all around us. This can all take place quite \nrapidly. Let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3565-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE WHAYNE SUPPLY COMPANY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Whayne \nSupply Company, a leader in Kentucky businesses and one of the Nation's \noldest and largest Caterpillar dealerships, for reaching the milestone \nof 100 years in operation. That is a full century of serving the needs \nof Kentucky's construction, mining, agriculture, and industrial \nmarkets; a full century of employing Kentuckians; and a full century of \nexpanding opportunity across the Commonwealth.\n  Whayne Supply Company was founded in 1913 by Mr. Roy C. Whayne, Sr. \nAt the time of the firm's founding, he was its sole employee, and the \nbusiness consisted of selling light engines, pumps, wheelbarrows, and \nbicycles. In 1925, the company began its long and continued association \nwith Caterpillar, one of the world's largest manufacturers of \nconstruction and mining equipment. Today Whayne is also the dealer for \nThomas Built Buses, Challenger, Lexion, Trail King, Mirenco, Sullair, \nAllmand, and other lines of construction, industrial, mining, paving, \nand agricultural equipment.\n  Today Whayne is consistently ranked as one of the country's top \nCaterpillar dealerships. It also provides customers with an extensive \nparts inventory and broad service capabilities. Whayne Supply Company \nis currently owned by Monty Boyd, who became president of Whayne Supply \nin 2005 after working for the company in various roles for 25 years. \nUnder Mr. Boyd's leadership, Whayne has grown to employ over 1,300 \npeople and operate 15 facilities across Kentucky and southern Indiana.\n  Whayne's home office is in Louisville, and it operates other branches \nin Ashland, Bowling Green, Corbin, Dry Ridge, Elizabethtown, Hazard, \nHopkinsville, Lexington, Owensboro, Paducah, Pikeville, and Somerset, \nas well as in Evansville, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, IN.\n  The Whayne Supply Company intends to mark its 100th anniversary \nthroughout 2013 by recognizing its employees and customers and holding \na series of community service projects. With the company's ties to all \nregions of the State, I am sure many Kentuckians will have occasion to \nnote this anniversary and reflect on Whayne Supply's century of \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in \ncommending the Whayne Supply Company for 100 years of operations and \nsaluting them for their commitment to the people of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3565-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3565-S3566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a very important event \nthat will be occurring this Sunday and Monday: 85 World War II veterans \nfrom Montana will take part in the fourth Big Sky Honor Flight and come \nto Washington, DC, to visit their monument--the WWII Memorial.\n  Their trip is hosted by the Big Sky Honor Flight Program. The mission \nis to recognize American veterans for their sacrifices and achievements \nby flying them to Washington, DC, to see their memorials at no cost. \nThe program, which has already flown more than 250 Montana veterans to \nvisit the memorials, is generously funded by businesses, student \ngroups, and folks all across Montana.\n  These veterans come from all parts of our great State, and while they \nare in Washington, they will see the WWII Memorial and other monuments \nand enjoy a banquet honoring their service to the country.\n  This is a special 2 days for this group of heroes, but it is also a \ntime to give thanks for courage and sacrifice of all our veterans and \nservice members. It is a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by \nthose who fought on the frontlines in Europe and the Pacific, on the \nbattlefields of Korea, in the jungles of Vietnam, the deserts of Iraq, \nand those who are currently fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan. \nWe must not forget their sacrifices.\n  I am so pleased I will be able to meet with these courageous \nMontanans. I ask the Senate to join me in welcoming these heroes to our \nNation's Capital this weekend. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n       Douglas M Alexander, Woodrow W Archer, Ralph W Arnold, Tim \n     M Babcock, Peter E Bakken, Norman F Balko, Burl E Baty, Henry \n     F Beckman, Harold M Brown, Charles L Bullis, Lester E Crouse, \n     Stuart Ellison, Frederick L Ernst, Thomas E Francis, Merle M \n     Green, Francis W Grove.\n       Harry P Hayden, Bernard J Heetderks, Paul L Hickman, Joseph \n     Hucke, Maurice C Knutson, John C Kindelman, Leonard E Kuffel, \n     Donald M Lilienthal, Harry M Merlak, John L Mulford, Antone F \n     O'Dea, Lewis A Paschke, Billy M Paul, Oscar S Peterson, \n     Charles F Petranek, Hardy J Pugliano, Charles F Romee, \n     Raymond R Rumfelt, Paul T Ringling.\n       Dorothy K Roeder, Lester T Rutledge, Frank J Schledorn, \n     William K Schultz, Maurice W Shoemaker, Duane Steinke, Robert \n     L Stewart, Ralph W Stodden, John W Todd, Lawrence F Thomas, \n     Kenneth Torgrimson, John D Walsh, Roman T Wuertz, George J \n     Wright, Mike N Steiner, Harry H Knodel, Audrey Manuel.\n       Stanley R Kniepkamp, Leo F Staat, Frank P Scotten, Dean H \n     Elliott, Joseph H Cook, Donald F David, Robert L Tillery, \n     Bishop S Everingham, Oliver R Germann, Paul Hafner, Robert \n     Barnhart, Leonard E Gissler, Thomas W Huff, Leo H Drain, \n     Rolland Karlin, Doris A Adolph, Alfred J Adolph, Vernon L \n     Phillips.\n       Colin F Glasgow, Leroy Bourque, John P Dillon, Bryon N \n     Manley, Sebastian Messer, Raymond A Grossman, Ben J Raisland, \n     Robert J O'Connell, Alfred J Falcon, Vernon E Locke, George \n     Schuyler, Robert Kovash, Donald R Anderson, Robert G Orlando, \n     Earl K Warne.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, as a proud co-sponsor of S. Res. 140, I \nwas delighted by the Senate's unanimous passage this week of \nlegislation commemorating the dedication and sacrifice made by Federal, \nState and local law enforcement officers who have been killed or \ninjured in the line of duty.\n  As our Nation celebrates National Police Week, I wish to honor five \nheroes who gave their lives in service to the people of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2012. Like 120 other law enforcement \nofficers across the U.S., they died in the line of duty, joining the \nranks of the 21,465 officers who have similarly given their lives since \n1791.\n  This week we honor Trooper First Class Blake T. Coble, Police Officer \nBradley Michael Fox, Police Officer Moses Walker Jr., Police Officer \nBrian J. Lorenzo and Patrolman Avery Freeman. Additionally we honor \ntheir families who must bear the profound absence of their loved ones.\n  On behalf of all Pennsylvanians I extend my condolences to the \nfamilies and friends of these heroes. We mourn the loss of these \nremarkable men and women who represented the best of their communities \nand whose memory will serve as an inspiration for future generations.\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3566-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, in Arkansas, our law enforcement history \nruns deep. Take my hometown of Fort Smith, for example, where the U.S. \nMarshals Service played an integral part in shaping the city's unique \nrole in our country's westward expansion. Many people in the area today \nfind their family roots trace back to a U.S. Marshal.\n  From an early age we were taught about Judge Isaac Parker's efforts \nto bring order to Indian Territory, and great lawmen such as Deputy \nU.S. Marshal Bass Reeves helped lay the foundation that highlighted \nFort Smith's chapter in the history of the U.S. Marshals Service. We \nhave a lot to be thankful for as we honor these brave men and women as \npart of National Police Week.\n  May 15 marks Peace Officers Memorial Day. Each May during National \nPolice Week we honor the men and women who died in the line of duty by \nadding their names to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  This year 321 names will be added to the memorial including Arkansas \nDepartment of Correction SGT Barbara Ester, who died in January 2012, \nand former Johnson County Sheriff John Hall Powers who was shot and \nkilled while trying to stop a bank robbery in 1902.\n  The tradition of courageous public service is carried on today by the \nmen and women who keep communities across the country safe 24 hours a \nday. They truly are on the front lines, walking some of the toughest \nbeats in America, and keeping our streets safe.\n  More brave men and women opt to follow their lead in a career in law \nenforcement every day. I recently had the honor of handing out diplomas \nto graduates of the Black River Technical College Law Enforcement \nTraining Academy in Pocahontas, AR. Graduates of this program follow \ndifferent tracks in police work such as crime scene investigation, \ncriminal training and police training with hands-on instruction and the \ncurrently available resources to allow for the best work possible. The \nprogram produced a great group of graduates who are excited to use the \nskills they learned in the field.\n  We recognize, not only during this week, but all year long, the \ndevotion of the 900,000 law enforcement officers who put their lives on \nthe line every day to make our communities safer.\n  Law enforcement faces unique challenges today and we are working to \nprovide the best tools and training to prepare these men and women for \nunpredictable situations. As our world changes, so do the threats we \nface. The key to being equipped for these unexpected events is to \nprepare for these emerging threats. That is why a lot of law \nenforcement training today focuses on domestic terrorism. Look no \nfurther than the Boston Police Department that became the first line of \ndefense against terrorism during the Boston Marathon bombing.\n  In order to keep our communities safe, we are challenged to develop \nthe newest training techniques and prepare for a wide range of \nincidents. We have great resources in Arkansas that provide our \nofficers with advanced training.\n  I thank the law enforcement officers in Arkansas and across the \ncountry who dedicate their lives to protecting our children and \ncommunities and seek to bring criminals to justice. These heroes come \nto our rescue when we need help and I am committed to providing them \nwith the tools and the resources they need to fulfill their \nresponsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3566-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EDENTON, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay homage to the beautiful \nTown of Edenton, NC. I join its citizens, its friends, and city and \nState leaders in celebrating their historic 300th anniversary. \nOriginally known as the Town on Queen Anne's Creek, Edenton was renamed \nafter the death of the first man appointed by the Crown as ``full'' \nGovernor of North Carolina, Charles Eden, in 1722.\n  The first Colonial Capital until 1743, Edenton citizens were widely \nknown for their steadfast values and dedication to a free society. \nEdenton's Penelope Barker was the first woman to organize a political \nevent in the colonies when she gathered women from the region to a \npetition to King George opposing taxation. The son of Edenton's James \nIredell, Sr., was nominated by President George Washington to serve on \nthe first U.S. Supreme Court, and was confirmed the very next day at \nonly 38-years-old. Edentonian Hugh Williamson signed the U.S. \nConstitution and effectively argued for the inclusion of the Bill of \nRights. Edentonians have long been a proud community committed to our \nNation's founding principles.\n  The Chowan County Courthouse in Edenton is not only North Carolina's \noldest courthouse, but also the State's oldest government building. It \nis still in use today. The impressive building, of southern Georgian \narchitecture, was built in 1767 on a plot of land first surveyed in \n1712. Today, it is recognized as a National Historic Landmark. One of \nthe signers of the Declaration of Independence, Joseph Hewes, a long-\ntime Edenton resident, was instrumental in making the courthouse a \nreality.\n  Thanks to the Town of Edenton, Chowan County, the Edenton Historical \nCommission, Chowan County Tourism Development Authority and many \ncitizen leaders, the town's treasured historic sites remain healthy and \npreserved. These treasures not only serve to teach us about our \nNation's rich heritage, but they also boost our economy and attract \npeople interested in our Nation's history from around the world. These \ninclude the 1767 Courthouse, the Barker House, the Roanoke River \nLighthouse, Edenton Cotton Mill, the Cupola House, and the second \noldest church building in North Carolina, Saint Paul's Episcopal \nChurch.\n  Because of the community's tireless efforts to preserve its heritage \nand promote the arts and culture, I doubt anyone visiting Edenton today \nwould be surprised to learn that it received the distinguished \nForbes.com award as one of America's Prettiest Towns.\n  I am proud to join the entire Edenton community in congratulating \nthem on this historic occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3566-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3566-S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL BARBERO\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nservice of LTG Michael D. Barbero, the director of the Joint Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Organization, JIEDDO, who will retire from \nservice on May 17, 2013.\n  Lieutenant General Barbero has honorably served his country for more \nthan three decades. Since graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at \nWest Point in 1976 as an infantry officer, LTG Barbero has commanded \ntroops at every level. He is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nhaving served 4 years in Iraq over three separate tours. From 2003-\n2004, he served as the assistant division commander of the 4th Infantry \nDivision. He next served in Iraq as the deputy chief of staff, \nStrategic Operations at Multi-National Force-Iraq during ``the surge'' \nin 2007 and 2008. Immediately prior to his time as director of JIEDDO, \nhe was deployed in Iraq for a final time from 2009-2011. During this \ndeployment, Lieutenant General Barbero was responsible for the \ntraining, equipping, and development of all Iraqi security forces and \nbuilding the ministerial capabilities of both the Ministries of \nInterior and Defense, while serving simultaneously as the commander of \nMulti-National Security and Transition Command-Iraq and the commander \nof the NATO Training Mission-Iraq. Among his many decorations, \nLieutenant General Barbero has been awarded the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star Medal.\n  As chairman of the Near Eastern and South Central Asian Affairs \nSubcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have worked \nclosely with LTG Barbero in an effort to stem the flow of IED precursor \nmaterials from Pakistan into Afghanistan. These homemade explosive, \nHME, materials pose the biggest threat to our service men and women and \nare responsible for far too many casualties. Under General Barbero's \nleadership, JIEDDO has made significant strides in working with various \ndepartments, the interagency, the intelligence community, and the \nGovernment of Pakistan, to\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\ncreate a whole-of-government approach to combat these dangers by not \nonly reducing the flow of HME, but also by helping to eliminate the \nenemy networks that seek to use these materials for the nefarious \npurposes of harming our troops, attacking civilian populations, and \nfurthering instability.\n  General Barbero has approached his work with a high degree of \ntransparency, integrity, and focus. Few missions are as important as \nJIEDDO's in working to defeat the IED as a weapon of strategic \ninfluence. Lieutenant General Barbero carried out that mission \nsuperbly. No one has done more or worked harder to find ways to counter \nthe threat posed by IEDs. I have especially appreciated his efforts to \nencourage others across government to do all they can in order to \nmaintain a level of preparedness to deal with this asymmetric threat. \nUnder his leadership, JIEDDO further improved its processes and control \nmeasures to make for a more effective and efficient organization that \nwill be a model for other leaders to emulate.\n  I have gotten to know LTG General Michael Barbero well during his \ntenure at JIEDDO. He is an inspiring leader, a fine example for his \nfellow servicemembers, and a fellow Pennsylvanian. I am proud to share \nin the celebration of Lieutenant General Barbero, his extraordinary \nleadership of JIEDDO, and his distinguished military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3567-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING KELOLAND TV\n\n   Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize KELOLAND \nTV's 60th anniversary. Opening their doors on May 19, 1953, KELOLAND \nbecame South Dakota's first television station. Over the past 60 years, \nKELOLAND has been a source for critical information and programming to \ncountless South Dakotans.\n  Providing timely news, weather, and sports across the rural and vast \nSouth Dakota plains is no simple task, but through hard work and \ndedication, KELOLAND has served South Dakota with continuous and \ncritical coverage of all the news of the day. Through challenging times \nin South Dakota, KELOLAND has been a mainstay for viewers in the region \nto turn to for up-to-date coverage of the events and happenings in \ntheir local communities. In October of 1954, KELOLAND offered its first \nlive programming, which led shortly after to KELOLAND offering the \nfirst live sporting event in February of 1957. On March 11, 1955, \n``Captain 11'' signed on for the first time. Little did they know that \n``Captain 11'' would become the longest continuous running children's \nprogram in the world. ``Captain 11'' ran for 42 years before signing \noff for the last time on December 28, 1996.\n  In September of 1968, KELOLAND added live color cameras. The year \n1997 was very busy for KELOLAND due to the September introduction of \nthe Live Doppler Network, which brought live weather radar pictures to \nSouth Dakota homes, and the December launch of Keloland.com, which gave \nSouth Dakotans the ability for the first time to check their local news \nonline. In 2011, KELOLAND made two more cutting-edge technology \nadvancements by creating their first mobile phone app, in February, \nfollowed by offering full high definition broadcasting in October.\n  KELOLAND has provided critical information for the State of South \nDakota for 60 years; however, its impact on the region and the \ncommunity it serves does not stop there. In the spring of 1998, a \nviolent tornado tore through the town of Spencer, and in an effort to \nhelp rebuild the Spencer community, KELOLAND organized a telethon to \nassist the victims of the tragedy. The telethon was a success and \nraised more than $1 million.\n  KELOLAND's commitment to excellence and to its service to the region \nhas not only been recognized by South Dakotans but also on a national \nstage. Along with winning 10 regional Emmy Awards, KELOLAND, in August \nof 2000, was awarded an Emmy for its outstanding public service.\n  KELOLAND's commitment to service to the State of South Dakota makes \nit an honor to congratulate them on their 60th anniversary of \nbroadcasts and wish them another 60 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3567-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING AL NEUHARTH\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life and \naccomplishments of Al Neuharth.\n  Al Neuharth was born in Eureka, SD, on March 22, 1924, where he spent \nhis childhood years. Al's passion for journalism was evident at a very \nyoung age when at 11 he began his first job working as a newspaper \ncarrier in his hometown. In high school, Al began writing for his \nschool newspaper and later became editor.\n  Soon after his graduation, Neuharth enlisted in the Army. Al \nhonorably served his country during World War II in the 86th Infantry \nDivision, under General Patton's 3rd Army. During his time in the \nservice, Neuharth was awarded the Bronze Star and the Combat \nInfantryman's Badge for his bravery.\n  After the war, Neuharth moved back to South Dakota, where he enrolled \nat the University of South Dakota. In 1950, he graduated with a degree \nin Journalism and upon graduation began working at the Associated Press \nin Sioux Falls, launching a historic career.\n  In 1953, Neuharth moved to Florida to work for the Miami Herald. \nAfter spending several years at the Herald, in 1960 Neuharth left to \nwork at the Detroit Free Press. In 1966, Neuharth launched a new paper \ncalled ``Today,'' which would later become ``Florida Today'' and \neventually grow into the USA TODAY which was published for the first \ntime on September 15, 1982. The USA TODAY would grow rapidly throughout \nthe country and in 2001 was the most widely read paper in the country.\n  Neuharth's career also included becoming the chairman and CEO of \nGannett Co., Inc., where he oversaw a drastic expansion of the \ncompany's holdings. In 1991, Neuharth founded Freedom Forum, a \nnonpartisan international foundation dedicated to free press, free \nspeech, and free spirit to all people. Freedom Forum funds and operates \nthe Newseum, a museum dedicated to the history and impact of \njournalism. In 1999, Neuharth was honored for his lifetime achievements \nby the National Press Foundation with the Distinguished Contributions \nto Journalism Award.\n  Al Neuharth passed away on April 19, 2013, at Cocoa Beach, FL, at the \nage of 89. He will be forever remembered for his impact on journalism \nand will always be one of South Dakota's favorite sons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3567-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3567-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3567-5", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3567-S3568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 356.

A bill to amend the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct to reauthorize the Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today, in honor of the 20th anniversary of \nInternational Migratory Bird Day on May 11, I am introducing the \nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. More than half of the bird \nspecies found in the U.S. migrate across our borders\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nand many of these spend our winter in Central and South America. This \nbill promotes international cooperation for long-term conservation, \neducation, research, monitoring, and habitat protection for more than \n350 species of neotropical migratory birds. Through its successful \ncompetitive, matching grant program, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nsupports public-private partnerships in countries mostly in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. Up to one quarter of the funds may be \nawarded for domestic projects.\n  This legislation aims to sustain healthy populations of migratory \nbirds that are not only beautiful to look at but help our farmers by \nconsuming billions of harmful insect and rodent pests each year, \nproviding pollination services, and dispersing seeds. Migratory birds \nface threats from pesticide pollution, deforestation, sprawl, and \ninvasive species that degrade their habitats in addition to the natural \nrisks of their extended flights. Birds are excellent indicators of the \nhealth of an ecosystem. As such, it is troubling that, according to the \nNational Audubon Society, half of all coastally migrating shorebirds, \nlike the Common Tern and Piping Plover, are experiencing dramatic \npopulation declines.\n  The Baltimore Oriole, the State bird of Maryland and one whose song \nbrightens all of the Northeastern U.S., has steadily declined in \npopulation despite being protected by Federal law under the Migratory \nBird Treaty Act of 1918 and the state of Maryland's Nongame and \nEndangered Species Conservation Act. Likewise, the iconic Red Knot \nbird, whose legendary 9,000 mile migration centers on a stopover in the \nMid-Atlantic states, is decreasing in population quickly. Threats to \nthese beloved Maryland birds are mainly due to habitat destruction and \ndeforestation, particularly in the Central and South American countries \nwhere the birds winter. In addition, international use of toxic \npesticides ingested by insects, which are then eaten by the birds, has \nsignificantly contributed to this decline. Conservation efforts in our \ncountry are essential, but investment in programs throughout the \nmigratory route of these and countless other migratory birds is \ncritical. This legislation accomplishes this goal.\n  The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has a proven track \nrecord of reversing habitat loss and advancing conservation strategies \nfor the broad range of neotropical birds that populate the United \nStates and the rest of the Western hemisphere. To date, the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service has administered these grants to support 422 \nprojects in more than 35 countries. The $46.5 million that this program \nhas provided in grants has leveraged $178.5 million from partners, \nalmost four additional dollars for every one spent. More than 3.25 \nmillion acres of quality bird habitat have benefitted. In addition, \nbirding is among the wildlife watching activities that generate jobs \nand income, approximately $2.7 billion annually, for the U.S. economy.\n  This legislation is cost-effective, budget-friendly, and has been a \nhighly successful federal program. This simple reauthorization bill \nwill make sure that this good work continues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD \n                   CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n       Section 10 of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 6109) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out this Act such sums as are necessary for each of \n     fiscal years 2014 through 2019.\n       ``(b) Use of Funds.--Of the amounts made available under \n     subsection (a) for each fiscal year, not less than 75 percent \n     shall be expended for projects carried out at a location \n     outside of the United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Boozman):\n  S. 970. A bill to amend the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to \nreauthorize grants for and require applied water supply research \nregarding the water resources research and technology institutes \nestablished under the Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Water Resources \nResearch Amendments Act. First authorized in 1964, the Water Resources \nResearch Act established 54 Water Resources Research Institutes at top \nland grant universities in each of the 50 States and the U.S. \nterritories. These institutes created a grant program and provided \nopportunities for applied water supply research. The bill I introduce \ntoday would reauthorize the grant program for the next 5 years and \nwould add a program focused on research and development of green \ninfrastructure.\n  Water and the availability thereof is a defining characteristic of \nU.S. landscape, culture, wealth, and security. Clean water is a \nrelatively rare and invaluable resource. Last year's funded projects \nincluded research into the impacts of climate change on water supply \nlakes, the development of better detection methods for pathogens in \ndrinking water, and the impacts of drought on farm supply chains. In my \nown State, some of the tools we use for restoration of the Chesapeake \nBay were products of these same grants in previous years. WRRA \nResearchers across the Mid-Atlantic States have developed ways to keep \nthe Chesapeake waters cleaner through urban stormwater treatment, \nimproved roadway design, and eco-friendly poultry farming practices. \nWRRA-funded projects develop innovative and cost-effective solutions \nfor similar water resources issues across the country. Undoubtedly, \nfunding WRRA is an intelligent and necessary investment in the future \nof our water resources.\n  WRRA authorizes two types of annual grants. First, it supplies grants \nto each Water Resources Research Institute for research that fosters \nimprovements in water supply reliability, explores new ways to address \nwater problems, encourages dissemination of research to water managers \nand the public, and encourages the entry of new scientists, engineers \nand technicians into the water resources field. Second, WRRA authorizes \na national competitive grant program to address regional water issues. \nAll WRRA grants leverage non-federal dollars at a minimum ratio of 2 to \n1, but often far beyond that level, as high as 5 to 1.\n  The Water Resources Research Act was most recently reauthorized in \n2006, in PL 109-471. In that period, the program was authorized at \n$12,000,000 per year, providing $6,000,000 each to state and \ncompetitive project grants. Authorization for these grants expired in \nfiscal year 2011. Today's bill would reauthorize both grant programs \nfor an additional 5 years by providing $7,500,000 for institutional \ngrants and $1,500,000 for national competitive grants. This lower \nauthorization level reflects our efforts to adjust for present fiscal \nlimitations. The proposed authorization maximizes the economic \nefficiency of the program without compromising its efficacy. An \nindependent review panel has judged that the Water Resources Research \nInstitutes command significant funding leverage for the modest amount \nof appropriations required to support it. Thus, we can be sure that we \nare supporting top-notch science while maximizing cost-effectiveness. \nMoreover, by funding this network of institutes we are investing in our \nfuture. The Water Resources Research Institutes are the country's \nsingle largest training program for water scientists, technicians, and \nengineers.\n  Today, floods, droughts, and water degradation issues pervade the \nnation. Simultaneously, water resources are increasingly critical for \nproduction of resources, economic stability, and the health and well-\nbeing of the citizenry. WRRA grants provide us with improved \nunderstanding of water-related issues and better technology to address \nthem. Nearly half a century after the Water Resources Research grant \nprogram was first put in place, this program is relevant, critical, and \ndeserving of our support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nexempt the conduct of silvicultural activities from national pollutant \ndischarge elimination system permitting requirements; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the \nSilviculture Regulatory Consistency Act with my colleague Senator \nCrapo. This legislation would end the legal uncertainty facing the \ntimber industry by enacting legislation to preserve the Environmental \nProtection Agency's 37-year old policy treating forest roads as non-\npoint sources under the Clean Water Act.\n  For 37 years, the EPA has maintained that forest roads are non-point \nsources. Furthermore, in March of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court \noverturned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on forest roads, \nupholding EPA's authority to regulate forest roads as nonpoint sources \nunder the Clean Water Act. Various studies show that if the EPA were to \nchange their decades-long position and require Federal, State, county, \ntribal and private forest road owners to obtain a point source permit, \nthe cost could reach billions of dollars and cost thousands of jobs. \nThe Pacific Northwest needs more jobs in the woods. The way to do that \nis to get the timber cut up and to stop litigating questions that have \nalready been answered.\n  In the 112th Congress, Senator Crapo and I introduced similar \nlegislation on forest roads. The legislation we introduce today is \ndifferent in only two respects. First, the bill includes new language \nto prevent forest roads from being otherwise regulated by the EPA. This \nlanguage is needed because in its March 2013 decision, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt upheld the EPA's authority to regulate forest roads as non-point \nsources, and therefore not require mandatory point source permits; \nhowever, it did not address the Ninth Circuit's previous ruling that \nforest roads are point sources. As a result, the EPA must respond to \nthe Court's ruling that the EPA use its discretionary authority to \ndetermine whether or not to regulate forest roads as point sources. \nThis will inevitably result in further litigation over permits for \nforest roads.\n  Second, the bill we introduce today includes the language adopted \nlast year by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to \nclarify the list of forest activities the EPA will not regulate as \npoint sources. The Committee favorable reported the bill with this \naddition.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation upholds an existing EPA regulation. \nFurthermore, this legislation does not weaken the Clean Water Act. The \nClean Water Act remains in the same force as it has since it was \nenacted in 1972.\n  The introduction of this bill begins the legislative process. There \nwill be an opportunity for hearings, testimony provided by witnesses \nand Federal agencies, and public dialogue on this bill. It is my hope \nthat this legislation will provide the certainty that the timber \nindustry needs to increase jobs in the woods, get the timber cut up, \nand put an end to litigating the question of whether or not EPA has the \nauthority to regulate forest roads as non-point sources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TULE SPRINGS FOSSIL BEDS NATIONAL MONUMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1933, the Upper Las Vegas Wash has been valued by \n     scientists because of the significant paleontological \n     resources demonstrative of the Pleistocene Epoch that are \n     located in the area;\n       (2) in 2004, during the preparation of the Las Vegas Valley \n     Disposal Boundary Final Environmental Impact Statement, the \n     Bureau of Land Management identified sensitive biological, \n     cultural, and paleontological resources determined to be \n     worthy of more evaluation with respect to the protective \n     status of the resources;\n       (3) the Upper Las Vegas Wash contains thousands of \n     paleontological resources from the Pleistocene Epoch that are \n     preserved in a unique geological context that are of national \n     importance, including Columbian mammoth, ground sloth, \n     American lion, camels, and horse fossils;\n       (4) in addition to Joshua trees and several species of \n     cacti, the Las Vegas buckwheat, Merriam's bearpoppy, and the \n     Las Vegas bearpoppy are 3 unique and imperiled plants that \n     are supported in the harsh desert environment of Tule \n     Springs;\n       (5) the area provides important habitat for threatened \n     desert tortoise, endemic poppy bees, kit foxes, burrowing \n     owls, LeConte's thrasher, phainopepla, and a variety of \n     reptiles;\n       (6) in studies of the area conducted during the last \n     decade, the Bureau of Land Management and National Park \n     Service determined that the area likely contains the longest \n     continuous section of Pleistocene strata in the desert \n     southwest, which span multiple important global climate \n     cooling and warming episodes;\n       (7) the Upper Las Vegas Wash is significant to the culture \n     and history of the native and indigenous people of the area, \n     including the Southern Paiute Tribe;\n       (8) despite the findings of the studies and recommendations \n     for further assessment of the resources for appropriate \n     methods of protection--\n       (A) the area remains inadequately protected; and\n       (B) many irreplaceable fossil specimens in the area have \n     been lost to vandalism or theft; and\n       (9) designation of the Upper Las Vegas Wash site as a \n     National Monument would protect the unique fossil resources \n     of the area and the geological context of those resources for \n     present and future generations while allowing for public \n     education and continued scientific research opportunities.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Tule Springs \n

A bill to provide for enhanced embassy security, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise at this moment, as chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, outraged at the implication \nthat we in the Senate have not done enough to investigate what has \nhappened in Benghazi; that we have not investigated it thoroughly; that \nwe have not looked at the details, have not analyzed the information--\nclassified and unclassified--that has come before us.\n  The committee has held four hearings--four--on the attack on Special \nMission Benghazi. The very first hearing I chaired in January was on \nthis topic with Secretary Clinton. In fact, we postponed the nomination \nhearing of Senator Kerry so that Secretary Clinton could come before us \nand explain what happened and why, despite her medical condition at the \ntime.\n  Let's make that very clear. One of the very first things we did, \ndespite a pending nomination of a new Secretary, and the sitting \nSecretary's medical concerns, was to hold a hearing on this topic and \nair the facts. Prior to that, Chairman Kerry held a hearing of the \ncommittee on December 20 on the events that transpired in Benghazi with \nDeputy Secretaries Burns and Nides. There were also two classified \nbriefings in December specifically on the circumstances surrounding the \nattack. The December 13 briefing included a video of the attack with \nhigh level officials from State, the Joint Staff, Defense Department, \nthe FBI, and the intelligence community. They included Patrick Kennedy, \nUnder Secretary of State for Management at State; Matthew Olsen, \nDirector of the National Counterterrorism Center; Maj. Gen. Darryl \nRoberson, Vice Director of Operations at the Joint Staff; Gary Reid, \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations \nand Low Intensity Conflict; Jenny Ley, Deputy Assistant Director at the \nFBI.\n  On December 19, there was a high-level classified briefing with the \nAccountability Review Board with Ambassador Pickering and Admiral \nMullen.\n  At his nomination hearing in January, Secretary Kerry also fully \naddressed this issue and then again at the committee's annual budget \nhearing this past April. Last week, the nominee to be our new \nAmbassador to Libya, Deborah Kay Jones, testified before the full \ncommittee--another opportunity for my friends on the other side to ask \nquestions, to get the truth, not create their own truth for political \npurposes. That hearing was yet another opportunity to ask questions \nabout the security situation on the ground. Yet Republican \nparticipation was limited to just a handful of Members.\n  We have fully vetted this issue. We have held hearing after hearing. \nWe have, on both sides, had the opportunity to have our questions \nanswered. In fact, in total, between the House and the Senate, there \nhave been 11 hearings on Benghazi, 25,000 pages of documents released, \nand now a full e-mail history of the interagency process.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  Our focus now should not be on the work product of the CIA or State \non draft talking points we have seen in hundreds of e-mails released by \nthe White House yesterday; it should not be to score political points \nat the expense of the families of the four victims. It should be on \ndoing all we can to protect our personnel serving overseas and \nproviding the necessary oversight and legislative authority to carry \nout the Administrative Review Board's recommendations.\n  I would remind my friends and the American people that nothing has \nchanged. The facts remain the facts. They are the same today as they \nwere in September, in October, in November, in December, and in \nJanuary. It is the rhetoric and the political calculus that has \nchanged. In fact, the e-mails released by the White House further \ndemonstrate that point.\n  The original CIA-produced talking points, notably produced as the \nresult of a request by the House Intelligence Committee for media \ninterviews, clearly show that in the days immediately after the attack, \nthe intelligence community was not sure what exactly happened or who \nwas responsible. The points produced by the CIA said the agency's \nbelief the events in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the \nprotests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault \nagainst the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its \nannex. That point stays in the talking points from beginning to end of \nthe interagency process, with no debate, and is conveyed to the House \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Throughout the e-mail discussions, the agency makes clear their \ninformation is limited and that there is a lot they simply don't know. \nIn fact, the National Counterterrorism Center says in one e-mail:\n\n       At this point we are not aware of any actionable \n     intelligence that this attack was planned or imminent. The \n     intelligence community is combing through reporting from \n     before and after the attack to determine the full extent of \n     who was involved.\n\n  It became clear over time that this was, in fact, a calculated \nterrorist attack, but there was no political calculation involved in \nthe initial assessment.\n  So let's be honest about what is happening here. It is not about \ndoing all we can to find the truth and making sure it never happens \nagain; it is about political gamesmanship and finding someone to blame.\n  I remind my friends, and the American people, again, nothing has \nchanged. Some wish to make this a political issue to drive a purely \npolitical agenda. I believe our real focus, our honest focus, and what \nthe American people truly care about is the security of our missions \nand the safety of our personnel. That has been, and will remain, the \nclear focus of the Foreign Relations Committee going forward, and I \nhope we will have the support of our Republican colleagues.\n  In my view the Monday morning quarterbacking on this issue is \npolitically driven--a perspective shared by former Republican Defense \nSecretary Gates, who said on Sunday: ``Frankly, I think my decisions \nwould have been just as theirs were'' with regard to sending in Special \nForces teams or overflights by fighter aircraft based in Italy.\n  Former Secretary Gates said:\n\n       Without knowing what the environment is, without knowing \n     what the threat is, without having any intelligence in terms \n     of what is actually going on, on the ground, would have been \n     very dangerous.\n\n  So I think we have common interests. I have been working hard to \nensure full implementation of all 29 recommendations made by the \nAdministrative Review Board--recommendations to ensure that going \nforward we are providing adequate personnel and resources to meet local \nconditions at more than 280 facilities in over 180 countries around the \nworld, specifically where host nations are unable to provide adequate \nprotection to our diplomats. I call on our Republican colleagues to \njoin us in that effort.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation. I hope we will be able to count \non the support of all of our colleagues to enact this crucial, time-\nsensitive legislation without delay, without obstruction, and without \npolitical grandstanding.\n  The bill will provide authority to fund the Capital Security Cost \nSharing Program to permit us to move forward with construction at high-\nrisk, high-threat posts. This account was created following the U.S. \nEmbassy bombings in Kenya and in Tanzania, and at that time it would \nhave allowed us to construct 8 to 10 facilities per year. However, the \nway the Congress is funding it, it presently is funding for \nconstruction of just two to three facilities per year, despite the fact \nthat there are at least two dozen posts that fall into that high-risk, \nhigh-threat category. At that rate it will take us over 8 years to get \naround to construction at just the posts with the highest risk of \nattack.\n  The bill authorizes funding for Arabic language training and for a \nForeign Affairs Security Training Center to train diplomatic security \npersonnel. It provides contract authority to the State Department to \nallow it to award contracts on a best value basis rather than to the \nlowest bidder where conditions require enhanced levels of security. At \nthe administration's request, the bill will authorize disciplinary \naction in cases of unsatisfactory leadership by senior officials \nrelated to a security incident, which does not presently exist. This \nwill allow appropriate disciplinary action to be taken against any \nfuture officials in a circumstance such as Benghazi.\n  The bill requires planning to incorporate additional marine security \nguards at overseas facilities, and it requires extensive reporting on \nState's implementation of the Accountability Review Board's \nrecommendations on the designation of high-risk, high-threat posts.\n  I hope we can work together to do what has to be done to protect \nthose who serve this Nation abroad. If we want to address the problem, \nwe have an opportunity to do it. If we want to score political points, \nfine, but do not do it at the risk of American lives. Let's work \ntogether to fix the problem, not use it for political advantage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 983. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from \nenforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health \nCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health \n     Care Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted \n     that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, \n     seeking tax-exempt status.\n       (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the \n     agency's ability to implement and oversee the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and \n     the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-152).\n       (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal \n     Revenue Service abuses in relation to the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010, given that it is their \n     responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual \n     mandate.\n       (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, \n     and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the \n     Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the \n     Secretary, shall not implement or enforce any provisions of \n     or amendments made by the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152).\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3581-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 143--RECOGNIZING THE THREATS TO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS \nAND EXPRESSION AROUND THE WORLD AND REAFFIRMING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AS \n A PRIORITY IN THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE \n DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE ON THE OCCASION OF WORLD PRESS FREEDOM \n                           DAY ON MAY 3, 2013\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 143\n\n       Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, adopted at Paris December 10, \n     1948, states that ``everyone has the right to freedom of \n     opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold \n     opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and \n     impart information and ideas through any media and regardless \n     of frontiers'';\n       Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly \n     proclaimed May 3 of each year as World Press Freedom Day to \n     celebrate the fundamental principles of freedom of the press, \n     to evaluate freedom of the press around the world, to defend \n     the media from attacks on its independence, and to pay \n     tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the \n     exercise of their profession;\n       Whereas 2013 is the 20th anniversary of World Press Freedom \n     Day, which focuses on the theme ``Safe to Speak: Securing \n     Freedom of Expression in All Media'';\n       Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 note; Public Law 111-166), which was passed \n     by unanimous consent in the Senate and signed into law by \n     President Barack Obama in 2010, expanded the examination of \n     freedom of the press around the world in the annual human \n     rights report of the Department of State;\n       Whereas, according to Freedom House, the percentage of \n     people in the world who live in countries with a free media \n     environment fell to 14 percent in 2012, the lowest percentage \n     in more than a decade;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, 88 \n     journalists and 47 citizen journalists were killed in 2012 in \n     connection with their collection and dissemination of news \n     and information, an increase of 33 percent and 840 percent, \n     respectively, compared to 2011;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, the five \n     deadliest countries for journalists in 2012 were Syria, \n     Somalia, Pakistan, Mexico, and Brazil;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     593 journalists have been murdered since 1992 without the \n     perpetrators of those crimes facing punishment;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     the five countries with the highest number of unsolved \n     journalist murders since 2003 as a percentage of the \n     population of that country are Iraq, Somalia, Philippines, \n     Sri Lanka, and Colombia;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, 879 \n     journalists and 144 citizen journalists were arrested in \n     2012;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     there were a record 232 journalists in prison worldwide on \n     December 1, 2012;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, the five \n     countries in which the most journalists are imprisoned are \n     Turkey, China, Eritrea, Iran, and Syria;\n       Whereas the abuse of anti-terrorism and cybercrime laws to \n     incarcerate journalists and suppress freedom of the press \n     occurred on numerous occasions abroad in 2012;\n       Whereas freedom of the press is a key component of \n     democratic governance, the activism of civil society, and \n     socio-economic development;\n       Whereas, in the ongoing political transition of Burma, \n     notable progress was made in advancing freedom of the press \n     in 2012, although certain problems remain;

which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 144\n\n       Whereas, since the 1990s, an estimated 5,000,000 people \n     have died due to repeated cycles of conflict, lack of \n     governance, and atrocities in the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo, particularly those in North and South Kivu provinces, \n     and, since the beginning of 2012, more than 2,000,000 people \n     have been displaced;\n       Whereas the United Nations and humanitarian groups have \n     reported staggering rates of sexual violence indicating tens \n     of thousands of cases perpetrated by security forces of the \n     Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and non-\n     state armed groups, which continue to operate with nearly \n     total impunity;\n       Whereas human rights defenders in the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo have been subject to intimidation and attack;\n       Whereas the Democratic Republic of the Congo's wealth of \n     natural resources, including minerals, have been a key driver \n     of instability and violence;\n       Whereas the deeply flawed November 2011 presidential \n     election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo presented \n     significant political, economic, and social challenges, and \n     provincial and local elections still have not been conducted \n     despite plans to hold such elections in 2012;\n       Whereas the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains \n     subject to recurring conflict despite one of the world's \n     longest-running, largest, and most expensive international \n     peacekeeping operations and extensive bilateral and \n     multilateral efforts to address longstanding humanitarian \n     crises, forge lasting peace, and pursue security sector \n     reform and accountability;\n       Whereas members of civil society and political parties from \n     both the majority and the opposition in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo created the National Preparatory \n     Committee (Comite National Preparatoire or CNP) to lay the \n     groundwork for convening a national forum and dialogue with \n     the goal of putting an end to the multifaceted crisis that \n     afflicts the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       Whereas, on November 15, 2012, the United Nations Group of \n     Experts provided compelling evidence that the crisis in \n     eastern Congo had been fueled and exacerbated by regional \n     actors, including through provision of significant military \n     and logistical assistance and of operational and political \n     support to the armed group known as the M23;\n       Whereas the United Nations and United States Government \n     have imposed sanctions on the M23 and its leaders for human \n     rights atrocities including rape, massacres, and the \n     recruitment and physical and psychological torture of child \n     soldiers;\n       Whereas, on March 18, 2013, International Criminal Court \n     (ICC) indictee and leader of a faction of the M23 rebel \n     group, Bosco Ntaganda, turned himself in to the United States \n     Embassy in Kigali, asking to be transferred to the ICC in The \n     Hague, where he voluntary surrendered on March 22, 2013;\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army continues to perpetrate \n     attacks against civilian populations in affected areas of \n     northeastern Congo, creating widespread insecurity and \n     displacement;\n       Whereas the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and 9 \n     other countries on February 24, 2013, signed the Peace, \n     Security and Cooperation Framework that provides for a \n     comprehensive approach to the ongoing conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council adopted \n     Resolution 2098 on March 28, 2013, extending the mandate of \n     the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \n     (MONUSCO) and authorizing the creation of an intervention \n     brigade tasked with neutralizing armed groups; and\n       Whereas, on March 18, 2013, United Nations Secretary-\n     General Ban Ki-Moon appointed former President of Ireland and \n     High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to serve \n     as Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's \n     commitment and leadership to resolving the crisis in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo and his appointment of Mary \n     Robinson as United Nations Special Envoy to the Great Lakes;\n       (2) supports the commitments agreed to by the signatories \n     of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (in this resolution, \n     the ``Framework''), and encourages them to work closely with \n     the United Nations, the African Union, the International \n     Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the Southern African \n     Development Community, as guarantors of\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\n     the Framework, and the United Nations Special Envoy, MONUSCO, \n     and relevant international bodies and governments to develop, \n     implement, and enforce a comprehensive peace process for the \n     region;\n       (3) notes that the adoption of the Framework, the \n     appointment of Mary Robinson as United Nations Special Envoy \n     to the Great Lakes, and the expanded MONUSCO mandate provide \n     an opportunity to make meaningful and sustained progress \n     toward ending the recurrent cycles of violence in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially in eastern \n     Congo;\n       (4) urges the signatories of the Framework and the \n     international community to engage and consult with \n     representatives of the Government of the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo and civil society representatives engaged in the \n     ongoing effort to convene an inclusive national forum and \n     dialogue;\n       (5) urges the President to appoint a Special Envoy to the \n     Great Lakes in the near-term in order to represent the United \n     States in international and regional efforts to end the \n     conflict and secure sustainable peace, stability, and safety \n     for the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by--\n       (A) working with United Nations Special Envoy Mary Robinson \n     and the broader international community to promote a \n     transparent and inclusive process to implement the regional \n     and national commitments under the Framework, including the \n     development of clear benchmarks for progress and appropriate \n     follow-on measures;\n       (B) strengthening international efforts to mobilize and \n     support justice for victims and accountability for \n     perpetrators of sexual and gender based violence and other \n     human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       (C) expanding efforts to develop conflict-free and \n     responsible mining and supply chains for the region's vast \n     mineral resources, in coordination with other government, \n     private industry, and international and local organizations;\n       (D) coordinating with international and regional partners \n     to expand unhindered access to life-saving humanitarian \n     assistance to populations in need, particularly displaced \n     persons and conflict-affected communities;\n       (E) pressing for fulfillment of the commitment of the \n     Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well \n     as other regional actors, to ending the threat posed by the \n     M23, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the Democratic Forces \n     for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and other armed groups \n     in the Great Lakes region, and to facilitate enhanced \n     coordination of regional efforts to counter these groups; and\n       (F) mobilizing and facilitating United States and \n     international support for electoral reforms in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo, with the goal of encouraging free, \n     fair, and credible provincial and local elections in the \n     near-term, and presidential elections in 2016;\n       (6) calls on the President to support the creation of a \n     World Bank Fund for the Great Lakes Region, as part of a \n     coordinated international investment and development strategy \n     aimed at deepening regional economic integration and \n     stability and leveraging reform;\n       (7) calls on the President, in close coordination with \n     international and regional partners, to work with the \n     Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to develop \n     and implement recommendations to improve accountability for \n     serious violations of international humanitarian law and \n     human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \n     including by considering imposition of sanctions authorized \n     under section 1284 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239; 50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note);\n       (8) calls on governments of the Great Lakes region of \n     Africa to immediately halt and prevent any and all forms of \n     support to non-state armed groups, including support provided \n     by individuals independent of government policy;\n       (9) calls on all relevant nations, including destination \n     and transit countries, to increase cooperation on ending the \n     illicit trade in conflict minerals, wildlife, and wildlife \n     parts, which continues to fuel and fund violence and to \n     deprive citizens of economic opportunity in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo and the broader region;\n       (10) calls on the signatories of the Framework to cooperate \n     in the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for \n     violating international humanitarian law and for serious \n     human rights violations, including gender-based violence;\n       (11) calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo to engage in meaningful and inclusive electoral \n     reforms, prepare and hold impartially administered local and \n     provincial elections as soon as technically possible, \n     continue to participate in ongoing efforts to provide a \n     platform for inclusive dialogue within the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo to address critical internal political \n     issues, and strengthen processes of state institution \n     building;\n       (12) calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo, in coordination with the international community, \n     to undertake significant security sector reform, which is a \n     necessary component for lasting stability, and renewed \n     disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts \n     that ensure that any rebel troops, especially commanders, \n     responsible for human rights violations are held accountable \n     and not reintegrated into the Armed Forces of the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo (FARDC); and\n       (13) urges the Government of the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo to improve efforts to protect civilians from armed \n     groups, in cooperation with MONUSCO and the African Union's \n     Regional Cooperation Initiative on the LRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3582-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 145--PROMOTING MINORITY HEALTH AWARENESS AND \n SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH IN \n   APRIL 2013 TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE HEALTH DISPARITIES FACED BY \n   MINORITY POPULATIONS SUCH AS AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES, \n ASIANS, BLACKS OR AFRICAN AMERICANS, HISPANICS OR LATINOS, AND NATIVE \n                 HAWAIIANS AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDERS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Schatz) submitted the following \nresolution;

and\n       (3) are the largest single source of families providing \n     permanent homes for children transitioning from foster care \n     to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, \n     have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, \n     have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more \n     likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate \n     fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial \n     assistance and support services than foster caregivers;\n       Whereas recent studies show foster children enrolled in \n     Medicaid were prescribed antipsychotic medications at nearly \n     9 times the rate of other children receiving Medicaid;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability, with 65 percent of former foster \n     children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children who are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 26,200 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     annually without a legal permanent connection to an adult or \n     family;\n       Whereas the number of youth who age out of foster care has \n     increased during the past decade;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in \n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the \n     security and support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation during the past 3 decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96-272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), and the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34) provided new investments \n     and services to improve the outcomes of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas May 2013 is an appropriate month to designate as \n     ``National Foster Care Month'' to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare \n     workforce, foster parents, the advocacy community, and \n     mentors for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive \n     impact on the lives of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of May 2013 as ``National \n     Foster Care Month'';\n       (2) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n     the challenges that children face in the foster care system;\n       (3) encourages Congress to implement policies to improve \n     the lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (5) recognizes youth in foster care throughout the United \n     States for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience \n     while facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--\n       (A) support vulnerable families;\n       (B) invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) promote adoption in cases where reunification is not in \n     the best interests of the child;\n       (D) adequately serve children brought into the foster care \n     system; and\n       (E) facilitate the successful transition into adulthood for \n     children who ``age out'' of the foster care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/16/senate-section/article/S3584-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 148--DESIGNATING MAY 18, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL KIDS TO \n                              PARKS DAY''\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Portman, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following resolution;
