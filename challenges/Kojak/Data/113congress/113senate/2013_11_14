Mr. President, this great body, the Senate, has a unique \nability to work very quickly when cooperation is present. That is one \nof the many special things about this institution. Unfortunately, \ncooperation in the recent months has been very lacking.\n  Case in point: One Senator has delayed action for more than a month \non a bill to ensure the safety of custom medications mixed by \npharmacies for patients with unique health needs.\n  The reason that 97 Senators voted to move this legislation is because \n64 people died and 800 people were made very, very sick, with some of \nthem very sick. They had strokes and other medical issues because of \nthe irresponsibility and negligence of this company in Massachusetts.\n  A lawsuit was filed recently in Nevada where two young boys were \nallegedly impacted significantly as a result of this medication. It was \nreally bad medication.\n  Unless the entire U.S. Senate bends to that one Senator's wish, the \none who voted no--and the vote was 97 to 1--he will force this body to \njump through hoops and work through the next several days wasting time \nto finish the crucial drug safety bill, but we are going to finish that \nbill. This bill is important for our country, and I cannot let one \nSenator dictate what goes on in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8013-7", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, by now I am sure every Member in this \nChamber has received literally countless letters, emails, and phone \ncalls from the millions of Americans who have been hurt by ObamaCare.\n  I recently saw a press release from the senior Senator from \nCalifornia saying that she has heard from more than 30,000 constituents \nwho are facing skyrocketing costs or canceled plans.\n  Each story is unique. Each story is important. That is why this \nmorning Senate Republicans will share some of those stories to put a \nhuman face to those who have suffered as a result of the Democrats' \ndecision to force this law on our country.\n  I will start off with James Dodson, who is a constituent of mine from \nOwensboro. James has type 2 diabetes. He recently got a letter \ninforming him that his high-risk pool coverage would expire next month. \nHe says a replacement plan on the ObamaCare exchange will cause his \npremiums to spike from $676 to more than $1,000 a month.\n  Here is the question he asked me: ``Where [are] the savings the \nDemocrats . . . promised 3 years ago?''\n  James' story is another reminder of why it is time for Democrats to \nwork with us to repeal this law and start over with bipartisan reform. \nMy constituent James is counting on them, and so are millions of others \nacross the country who are suffering under this law.\n  I understand my friend from Texas has something he would like to \nshare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier this month I launched a Web site \nwhere my constituents in Texas could describe their experiences with \nObamaCare. As of this morning that site has received more than 500 \nsubmissions and the stories are simply maddening.\n  For example, Barry Linden of Brenham, TX, is currently waiting for an \norgan transplant, but because of ObamaCare his health insurance policy \nis being canceled, which could jeopardize his ability to access that \ntransplant.\n  As Mr. Linden writes, losing his health care plan ``is a potential \nlife-ending tragedy for me and my family. The forced dropping of my \nplan creates a variety of complications involving my transplant team \n[and] my medications.''\n  The ``most troubling'' thing, he adds, ``is that insurance will have \nto recertify my transplant.'' In other words, he will have to start all \nover.\n  Meanwhile, I also heard from another constituent in Lubbock, TX, \nwhose 13-year-old daughter has type 1 diabetes. She has had it since \nage 4. Her family had a health insurance policy when she was first \ndiagnosed and they have been happy with that policy. However, because \nof ObamaCare, they were recently notified that their daughter's health \ninsurance is being canceled in December.\n  Stories such as this are simply infuriating and unnecessary, but they \nshould strengthen our resolve to dismantle ObamaCare entirely and \nreplace it with patient-centered alternatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the news out of South Dakota is like it is \neverywhere else--it is all bad. It is cancellation notices and sticker \nshock that families, individuals, and small businesses are \nexperiencing.\n  This is a letter from a couple I received from my State. It says:\n\n       We got the letter. We just received a cancellation letter \n     from our health care provider . . . I am a self employed \n     plumber . . . We have had the same kind of health insurance \n     for years . . . It works for us, we are happy with it.\n       When our current plan expires in 2014 it will no longer be \n     available. We will have to get a new plan. We will be forced \n     to lower our deductible, carry insurance for pregnancy, \n     pediatric eye and dental care, etc. My wife is 50 years old, \n     I'm almost there. WE DON'T NEED COVERAGE FOR PREGNANCY OR \n     PEDIATRIC CARE!\n       We were told that our new policy will most likely cost us \n     over 100% more than what we pay now. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO \n     AFFORD IT. We will be without insurance and I guess we'll \n     have to pay the Obama tax and take our chances.\n       Obama said we could keep our plan . . . PERIOD!\n\n  This is another example from my State of cancellations and sticker \nshock, and that is the experience Americans are having today with \nObamaCare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, The Tennessean reported on Tuesday \nmorning in its headline that the State's largest underwriter is \nnotifying 66,000 clients that their policies don't meet ACA coverage \nrequirements. In other words, they are losing those policies.\n  I have a letter from a woman, Emilie, who lives in Middle Tennessee \nwho was 1 of 16,000 Tennesseans who are part of another plan called \nCoverTN. She is losing her policy.\n  She says:\n\n       I am a 39 year old single woman with a chronic illness, \n     Lupus. I worked my way through college.\n       As a person with a chronic illness that was deemed \n     ``uninsurable,'' the only way I was able to obtain health \n     insurance was through an employer based program called \n     CoverTN . . . Although some call it a minimal coverage plan, \n     it has been stellar AND affordable . . . I was excited to \n     hear about the Affordable Health Care Act. I was glad to hear \n     that ``uninsurables'' could no longer be denied coverage . . \n     . unfortunately [that] is NOT TRUE.\n       I cannot keep my current plan because it does not meet the \n     standards of coverage. This alone is a travesty. CoverTN has \n     been a lifeline.\n       With the discontinuation of CoverTN, I am being forced to \n     purchase a plan . . . that will increase [my costs] by a \n     staggering 410%. My out of pocket expense will increase by \n     more than $6,000.00 a year. Please help me understand how \n     this is ``affordable.''\n       I beg of you to continue the fight for those, like me, who \n     would only ask to be allowed to continue to have what we \n     already enjoy. A fair health insurance plan at a fair price.\n\n  That is from Emilie, who is a 39-year-old woman from Tennessee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if you like your health plan, you can \nkeep it. It is a nice sound bite, isn't it? It is also not true. My \nconstituents have learned that the very hard way.\n  A constituent from Perry, IA, wrote:\n\n       My husband and I are farmers. For nine years now we have \n     bought our own policy. We recently received our letter that \n     our plan was going away and effective Jan 1, 2014 it will be \n     updated to comply with the mandates of ObamaCare.\n       We did not get to keep our current policy. We did not get \n     to keep our lower rates. I now have to pay for coverage that \n     I do not want or will never use.\n       We are the small business owner that is trying to live the \n     American dream. I do not believe in large government that \n     wants to run my life.\n\n  This failed promise is hitting home but, more importantly, when the \nPresident promises something and doesn't keep that promise, it goes way \nbeyond a promise to hurt an individual. It goes to the lack of \ncredibility of all government. What we need to be doing in this country \nis building up credibility of government to strengthen our institutions \nof government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues on the floor today \nbecause, like many of them, my constituents are upset. Idahoans are \nfinding out that America's promise to the American people that ``if you \nliked your health care plan you could keep it'' simply was not true.\n  Over 100,000 Idahoans will find out that they cannot keep their \ncurrent plans. Idahoans such as Jennifer from Salmon, ID, are finding \nthis out the hard way. Jennifer is a working self-employed mother of \nthree whose current health care costs her family $375 a month. Now \nJennifer is being told that her current plan is no longer available \nunder the President's health care law and that the next available plan \nto her family will cost $900 per month with a $10,000 deductible. That \nplan will require Jennifer to spend $20,000 a year between premiums and \ndeductibles before she has benefit coverage.\n  This is Kelly, another hard-working mother who was promised \naffordable and successful health care coverage under ObamaCare.\n  Optimistic to enroll, Kelly and her husband looked to sign up, only \nto find the plans available to their family were unaffordable and thus \ninaccessible.\n  The health care law was sold on the premise that it would help \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nsuch as Kelly's--those struggling to get by month-to-month in our \nstifled economy--to obtain affordable, quality health insurance. \nInstead, Kelly and her husband are now considering taking the penalty \nfine for being uninsured under the new law as it is a more feasible \noption for their family at this time.\n  There are many more just like Kelly and Jennifer in Idaho and across \nthe country dealing with new hardships as a result of this law. The \nPresident needs to work with Congress to find reasonable solutions to \namend the many broken promises made about this law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Beth from Tribune, KS, is a single mother \nof a 3-year-old son with significant physical disabilities. Her son's \ninsurance is being canceled. To replace this policy with a similar \nplan, it is going to cost far more than the $750 monthly premium Beth \npays now.\n  She writes:\n\n       How can this be? My little boy needs health insurance. . . \n     . Now our insurance company is telling us this policy no \n     longer exists because it doesn't meet the government's \n     requirements and if we'd like to get another plan it's going \n     to cost even more for the same child . . .\n       We didn't change children . . . it's the same child!! This \n     doesn't make sense. We frequently visit multiple specialists. \n     We need this insurance. It baffles me as to why this is \n     happening. It's not rocket science . . . it's healthcare. \n     ObamaCare is affecting those that need it the most and NOT in \n     a good way . . . It's very stressful raising a child with \n     significant needs . . . I'd like to be concentrating on the \n     health and well-being of my son and not on stressing out over \n     health insurance.\n\n  For Beth and her son, we must repeal this law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, according to the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, my State of Mississippi will have the third highest \npremiums in the Nation as a result of the so-called Affordable Care \nAct. This is unacceptable for my State, and my colleagues can be sure I \nam hearing from my constituents about this.\n  For example, I heard from a married couple in Long Beach who own a \nsmall business. The private insurance plan they have offered to their \nemployees for over 20 years will suffer a 33-percent premium increase \non December 1. Their insurance specifically cited the ACA's mandated \ncoverage, fees, and taxes for the increased premiums. The couple will \ncontinue to insure their employees because if they were to discontinue \nthe coverage, their employees and families would suffer because they \nwould not be able to afford individual plans.\n  I also heard from a 58-year-old graphic designer from Madison, MS, \nstating that his insurance premiums will double at the beginning of the \nyear from $355 to $755. This gentleman is understandably angry about \nthis premium increase. He understands that his insurance will now cover \nmandated benefits such as maternity care and birth control--something \nhe will never use as a 58-year-old male.\n  I also heard from a 51-year-old disabled retired doctor and the \nfather of two high school students. Earlier this week, he was informed \nby his insurance provider that his family's premiums will skyrocket in \nJanuary. He says he discovered that the least expensive coverage for \nhis family will result in a 112-percent increase in his premiums.\n  After hours on healthcare.gov trying to enroll his family, a \nfirefighter, a father, and a husband discovered that the cheapest plan, \na bronze plan, will be too exorbitant a cost for him to pay. He will \nopt to pay the penalty, and he and his family will remain uninsured.\n  These are real Americans who are learning that the Affordable Care \nAct is less affordable and less accessible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we all know that over 5 million Americans \nhave lost their health care and can't keep the health care they wanted. \nThe untold tragedy is the millions and millions more who are being \npriced out of the market because of the increases in costs caused by \nObamaCare.\n  I will read an email from Rob and Jessica in Georgia that I think \ndepicts exactly what that tragedy is.\n\n       My husband lost a job in the recession. He could not find \n     work, so we started our own business and have grown it over \n     the last 3 years so that we are supporting ourselves with a \n     modest income. We lost all of our savings, in the process of \n     the recession, but we are proud from where we've come.\n       We are in our 40's, healthy and self-insured. We just \n     received a letter from our insurance company that our \n     insurance will be going up 244 percent, from $203 a month to \n     $495 a month. We can't believe that our government has made a \n     decision that is costing us, and everyone we talk to, \n     thousands of dollars. It is truly unbelievable. We have \n     worked so hard to get where we are. We cannot afford this \n     increase.\n\n  ObamaCare is pricing the average American out of health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the impact ObamaCare \nis already having on my constituents, likewise, as my colleague said, \nin my home State of Georgia.\n  One of my constituents, Jeanie from Twin City, GA, is a registered \nnurse in a small hospital. Her husband is a retired Navy officer who \nserved this country honorably for 20 years. They are on TRICARE, so \nJeanie didn't need her employer to pay for her health care. However, \nbecause of ObamaCare, Jeanie's employer is cutting her hours to less \nthan 30 hours a week, which means a drastic pay cut for her and her \nfamily. I fear this health care law will continue to force employers to \nreduce employee hours in order to avoid the unaffordable health care \ncosts.\n  Another constituent, Thomas from Columbus, told me about the problem \nhe is facing with his son. His son graduated from college, but as is \nthe case with so many his age, he has been unable to find a job in this \ntough economy. His son works hard to make ends meet and was lucky to \nfind a bartending position that would allow him to work full-time.\n  Service industry professionals, normally, as in the case of Thomas's \nson, do not receive benefits, so Thomas bought his son a catastrophic \ninsurance plan they could afford. Now it looks certain that this plan \nis not going to be acceptable under ObamaCare. His son will not qualify \nfor Medicaid, but will not be able to afford the premiums he will now \nhave to pay for this catastrophic policy.\n  Our economy is still recovering and Americans are still struggling. \nThomas and Jeanie are exactly the type of hardworking Americans that \nhealth care reform should be making life easier for and not harder.\n  It is time for the President and Democrats to join us in scrapping \nthis law and starting anew.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, a few weeks ago we opened our Web site to \nNebraskans so they could tell us what they were dealing with regarding \nObamaCare. I heard from a family in Grand Island, NE, and this is what \nthey said:\n\n       ObamaCare has made the prospect of getting sick very scary \n     at our house. Our monthly premium is set to go up from $578 \n     to $714. If that's not bad enough, our maximum out-of-pocket \n     will go from $5,000 to $12,700.\n\n  This family is facing a 24-percent increase in premiums and a \nwhopping 154-percent increase in their out-of-pocket maximum.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       That's not affordable; in fact, if a member of my family \n     were to get sick and need hospitalization, we'd be in major \n     financial trouble. Not only that, but we only qualify for a \n     $6 tax credit. It really feels as if those of us who work \n     hard, do the right thing, and set good examples for our \n     children are now being punished.\n\n  It is time to stand with the American people and actually fulfill our \npromises and repeal this law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, thousands of Mainers are receiving \nnotices that their health insurance is being canceled due to ObamaCare.\n  This past weekend I talked with Mark Pendergast, the owner of a small \nlandscaping company, who just found out that the premiums for his small \nbusiness plan will jump by 54 percent next year due to ObamaCare. He \ncan't\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\npay that and stay competitive, and his workers can't afford it either. \nTheir share of the premium will go up by $740 next year. Mark is \nworried they will simply drop their coverage and pay the fine instead.\n  Mark and his workers are not the only Mainers hurt by ObamaCare. Mrs. \nBeatrice Logan of Cape Elizabeth, ME, emailed me to express her deep \nconcern that her family is facing an increase in their deductible from \n$4,500 to $12,000. Moreover, she is being told that they may not be \nable to continue with the health care team at Boston's Children's \nHospital that has provided a lifetime of excellent care to her 19-year-\nold son who has cystic fibrosis.\n  Dave Eshelman of Falmouth told me that he and his wife are facing a \nmore than 90-percent increase in their premiums. Having to spend an \nadditional $5,000 a year for health insurance is no small matter to \nthem at a time when they are struggling to start a small business.\n  One of the major reasons I strongly opposed the Affordable Care Act \nwas that there was nothing ``affordable'' about it. I predicted it \nwould lead to fewer choices and higher insurance costs for middle \nincome families and small businesses.\n  Congress must work together to address the very real health care \nconcerns of the American people and the budget realities we face. \nRepealing ObamaCare's poorly crafted and misguided mandates and \nreplacing the law with a fiscally responsible reform bill that contains \ncosts and provides more choices is the best path forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, Gina Sell is a 29-year-old \nregistered nurse, a wife, a mother of two girls, and a lifelong \nWisconsin native. She and her husband Joe, a heating and air-\nconditioning technician, currently purchase health insurance on the \nindividual market.\n  Their best option under ObamaCare increases their monthly premium by \n$700 and their deductible by $12,000 per year. This is after an annual \nObamaCare subsidy of $48. Because they both work, Gina and Joe make too \nmuch money to obtain an adequate subsidy but not enough to afford \nhealth insurance.\n  So what can they do? Gina has looked for a full-time job that \nprovides health benefits, but those jobs are pretty scarce. Her only \noption may be to quit working altogether so they qualify for a larger \nsubsidy. Because of ObamaCare, Gina might lose a career she loves and \nAmerica might lose a much needed nurse.\n  In Gina's words: ``This scenario is life altering . . . My husband \nand I are at a loss for what we can do.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, many people supported President Obama's \nhealth care law based on his promises. Those words don't mean much now \nfor millions of people receiving cancellation notices from insurers for \ntheir current plans, paying prices higher than promised and losing work \nhours, wages, and in some cases jobs.\n  In Wyoming alone, there are over 2,600 people who are losing health \ncare coverage they like. I have received numerous letters from my \nconstituents illustrating the scope of this problem. Greta from Laramie \nis one of them. Greta is in graduate school and paying for tuition out-\nof-pocket. She had the university's student BlueCross BlueShield \ninsurance plan. In September, her husband and two daughters received \nnotice that their family insurance policy was gone. They were happy \nwith their coverage. Greta said their plan had very good coverage of \nmaternity and well-child visits, low deductibles, and an affordable \nmonthly premium. Her family can't afford a new health insurance plan \nwhich, according to her, ``costs more and gives me less.'' That is what \nwe are facing as a Nation: Health care plans we can no longer keep and \nbroken promises from the White House.\n  The President misinformed the American people when he said, ``If you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep it.'' Just last week, he said \nthe Democrats didn't do a good enough job crafting the law. To me, that \nsounds like a law that should have never been passed. We must continue \nto push for repeal of this law of broken promises and work on \nalternative solutions that really do what the people were promised.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Sonya and Jake, her husband, are from Troy, \nMO. She contacted us to tell me that when her husband quit his job a \nfew years ago to start his own business they, of course, when that \nhappened, lost their employer coverage, but they were able to check on \nhealth care coverage for the self-employed. They found what they \nthought was a really doable policy for them. They are young and they \nare healthy. They have six kids, but they are all pretty healthy. They \nwere paying $400 a month, with a $5,000 deductible and 100-percent \ncoverage after the $5,000. Their preventive care was already covered. \nBut, of course, their policy just got canceled because it did not meet \nthe ObamaCare guidelines. Their insurance company tells them that to \nget the same kind of coverage with the new guidelines, they are going \nto pay 125 percent more than they have been paying. Their insurance \nmore than doubled. Their plan may not have been good enough for the new \nguidelines, but it was good enough for them. When the government begins \nto tell people what they have to have, it almost always costs people \nmore.\n  Also, we are seeing the high-risk pool in our State and every State \ngo away. I am having all kinds of people saying their insurance is \ngoing to cost more, their deductible is higher, and many times the \ndoctor who has been part of their health care challenge right up until \nnow is no longer available to them. So much for ``if you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I think it is great that we have the \nopportunity to come to the floor today to talk about what our \nconstituents are telling us. We do not do that enough.\n  Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We had about 25,000 \nOhioans. At every one of these tele-townhalls, we do a poll asking what \nthe most important issue is. And of the tele-townhalls we have done, \nwhich is one a month, every single time it has been jobs and the \neconomy--until last night. Last night it was health care. That is \nbecause most of the questions I got were about health care coverage and \npeople concerned about losing it.\n  Let me read a letter from one of my constituents. It is indicative of \nwhat I am hearing all around the State. This is from Dean. He lives in \nSandusky, OH. He writes:\n\n       Ever since I lost my job in 2009 I have been purchasing my \n     own health care insurance. Last month I received a letter in \n     the mail stating that my plan is being cancelled due to the \n     ACA. I was told to look at plans on the exchange, which I did \n     and I found a comparable plan that is over twice the cost of \n     what I now have.\n       In addition, this is over half of my monthly pension. I \n     simply can't afford this. I have always been a responsible, \n     hard-working, self-dependent person. Now, due to the actions \n     of our government, for the first time in my life I will not \n     have any health insurance coverage. I am 59 years old and I \n     need this coverage. I am outraged to say the least. How can \n     our government do this to us? I will remember this come \n     election time. Please get rid of this insane law. This is \n     unacceptable.\n\n  Well, to Dean and to my other constituents, I agree with you. It is \nunacceptable. We should repeal the law--it does not make sense--and \nthen replace it with one that actually reduces the cost of health care \nand keep the promise the President made, which is that people can keep \nthe health care they have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the President has publicly promised all \nAmericans: If you like your plan, you can keep it. If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep that doctor. The only change, he said, you will \nsee is falling costs.\n  Well, Donna, a senior citizen from New Albany--senior citizens are \nnot supposed to be affected by this ObamaCare--received a letter \ntelling her that she and her husband could no longer keep their \nMedicare Advantage plan. It was terminated. So they found another \nplan--much higher cost, much higher premium, much higher deductible.\n  Cynthia from Lafayette, IN: I am self-employed and purchase health \ncare\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nprivately. I am a single parent with a mortgage payment and a child in \nhigh school. My plan was canceled, and I was given an estimate for a \nreplacement plan that is almost double what I am paying today.\n  Mr. President, you have not kept your promise to seniors. You have \nnot kept your promise to single working mothers. You have not kept your \npromise to families. You have not kept your promise to the people whom \nI represent. How can Americans trust that this government takeover will \nwork if you cannot keep your promises to the American people?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, in North Dakota we have a lot of farmers \nand we have a lot of ranchers. They are small businesspeople. They run \nsmall businesses. They are being hit very hard by ObamaCare like other \nsmall businesses across this country.\n  A rancher from Rhame contacted us. His name is Wayne. He ranches \nthere. Rhame is an area where we have a lot of cowboys, a tremendous \nrodeo. They compete nationally. They have great livestock herds there. \nHe writes and he says:\n\n       I'm not one to get too upset about things, but this deal \n     really has me mad. We got a letter a few weeks ago that said \n     they were dropping our policy. I paid my own insurance for \n     years and years. When I got that letter, it just hit me--\n     because somebody in Washington decided I was too stupid to \n     figure out if my policy was right for me or not.\n       I don't pay a lot of attention to politics, but usually \n     what gets decided in Washington doesn't slap you in the face \n     like this law has with me. I have gone on HealthCare.gov and \n     used the estimators they direct you to. I could be going from \n     a $2,500 deductible to something between $10,000 and $12,000, \n     the way it looks to me. This is going to cost me a lot more \n     for something I don't even want.\n\n  If I could, I would like to read another short story from a couple in \nGrand Folks who got ahold of us on the marriage penalty that ObamaCare \ncreates. She wrote:\n\n       My husband and I met with the primary health insurance \n     carrier in North Dakota and were told that our current \n     coverage under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act will \n     cost us at least another $400 more a month, and our \n     deductible will increase from $2,000 to $12,000. Because we \n     are married, we cannot choose individual plans, which would \n     be a lower deductible. In essence, we are being punished for \n     being married. We are looking at paying more than $1,500 a \n     month in health care because we are only 61 years old and not \n     eligible for Medicare for another 4 years--$18,000 a year for \n     health care!\n       We were told that part of the problem is the provisions in \n     the law which require us to choose a plan that has maternity \n     benefits. How does this make sense for seniors to be forced \n     to buy coverage that does not apply to them? We agree that \n     benefits shouldn't be denied to people, but it is not fair to \n     be forced to buy coverage that does not even apply.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nnearly 3,000 Nebraskans who have contacted my office with their \nconcerns about ObamaCare. Their stories are, unfortunately, not unique: \nskyrocketing premiums and cancellation of plans they were promised they \ncould keep.\n  Curt from Lincoln, NE, wrote to tell me he has seen his Blue Cross \nBlue Shield premiums rise a shocking 300 percent. David, a father \nliving in Omaha, is facing a potential total increase of $16,000 a year \nfor his family's coverage--$16,000. Another constituent from Bertrand, \nNE, will see his family's deductible more than double next year. He \nasked: ``How is this the Affordable Care Act?'' An apology now will not \nhelp the hard-working Nebraskans who have lost or who will soon lose \ntheir current coverage. One constituent wrote, ``Folks shouldn't need a \nsecond mortgage to pay for ObamaCare.'' I agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I go home every weekend to talk to \npeople. I was home last weekend for Veterans Day and was in the Target \nstore in Casper and ran into a small business owner of a small electric \ncompany he runs. He has about four people who work with him. He is \nsomebody on whom I have operated. He is a former patient of mine. He \ntold me he was one of those 4 million Americans who had gotten that \nletter that they had lost their insurance.\n  He said: The President promised this would be easier to use than \namazon.com. I can't get on. He said it would be cheaper than your cell \nphone bill. Well, that has not been the case. He said that the \nPresident said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. Clearly, \nthat is not the case. He said: What is wrong? What is wrong with this? \nHow can we fix it?\n  I got another letter from a rancher that I need to read. She is from \nNew Castle, WY. She says:\n\n       We are ranchers who buy our own health insurance. \n     Currently, we pay $650 a month for an 80/20 policy with a \n     $3,500 deductible. Our maximum family out-of-pocket is \n     $10,000 a year. We do not carry maternity insurance because \n     we have completed our family. I am 45 years old. I have had a \n     hysterectomy.\n       I recently called my insurance agent out of fear our policy \n     could be canceled. Well, he said it would be canceled at the \n     renewal time.\n\n  She said that he told her that their policy did not meet ObamaCare's \nrequirement because of maternity coverage and they would have to choose \na policy from the exchanges. Now, remember, she has had a hysterectomy. \nShe does not need or want or will ever use maternity coverage.\n  She said the insurance agent quoted her rates for a comparable policy \nat $1,300 to $1,600 per month. Remember, they are now paying $650. She \nsaid the insurance agent also told her they could take a bronze \npolicy--much less coverage than they currently have--for $900, which is \nstill $250 a month higher than they would have to pay, but the out-of-\npocket cost then was much higher, much more difficult for the family.\n  She said:\n\n       We are being forced out of a good policy, which we pay for \n     with hard-earned money and which we choose, into a dangerous \n     financial and health care situation with less coverage and \n     which puts my husband and I, who are proud of our \n     sustainability, onto what we consider the welfare rolls by \n     needing a government subsidy to afford a plan that we do not \n     want or need.\n\n  She said:\n\n       To say that we are angry is an understatement. Why is this \n     happening? Why can Obama force me into this? We feel \n     helpless. What are we supposed to do, just follow like sheep \n     until we are either bankrupt or welfare recipients?\n\n  This is not what President of the United States promised the American \npeople. It is not what every Democrat in this body who voted for this \nhealth care law promised the American people. The American people \ndeserve better. They deserve to be able to get the care they need from \na doctor they choose at lower costs. None of that has come true under \nthis health care law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the more my constituents learn about the \nadministration's so-called Affordable Care Act, the more it becomes \nclear that major changes should be considered.\n  I recently heard from a constituent who had learned from accessing \nthe Obama administration's enrollment Web site that the plan with the \nlowest cost available to him has a $7,000 yearly deductible, with a \n$12,000 out-of-pocket maximum and a premium of a little over $2,400 a \nmonth--nearly twice as much as he and his wife currently pay.\n  This family is just one example of millions of Americans who are \nsuffering from sticker shock because of the cost of insurance plans on \nthe President's new health insurance exchanges. The shock is made worse \nfor those who are being rejected by the plans they were told they could \nkeep but now cannot.\n  It is clear we need to urge the administration to consider going back \nto the drawing board. We should get together, too, here in the Senate \nand find common ground that makes better sense for the American people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, for the last 3 years we have heard \nPresident Obama and our friends on the left promise--no, guarantee--\nthat ObamaCare will help make health insurance more affordable. But day \nafter day we see costs going up for hard-working families all across \nour country--not merely the rich families, not only the 1 percent, but \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  Last week I heard from Natalie Geiger, a wife and a mother of three \nin\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nCharleston, SC, whose health insurance costs are seeing double-digit \nincreases.\n  These are the faces of real people impacted by ObamaCare. They are \nnot stats; they are not numbers; they don't get waivers. They are \ntaxpayers, middle-income taxpayers, and ObamaCare is forcing many to \nchoose between saving for college for these three little kids and \npaying for health care. They shouldn't have to choose.\n  ``ObamaCare'' and ``healthcare.gov'' are words that we now know are \nsynonymous with ``failure.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I would like to tell the story of a \nconstituent who emailed and is so representative of what thousands are \ngoing through in Arkansas.\n  Mark from Little Rock wrote to me after receiving his cancellation \nnotice. This is what he had to say:\n\n       I recently received a notice from Blue Cross-Blue Shield \n     that my individual health insurance policy will not be \n     renewed after 2014 due to ObamaCare. Although I am very happy \n     with this policy, I'm being forced out of it after 2014.\n       The alternative options under the Affordable Care Act are \n     not very affordable. The closest alternative plan will \n     increase my deductible 25% and increase my monthly premiums \n     300%. . . . from $285 a month to $850 a month.\n\n  Mark notes that his current plan is Blue Cross, which he describes as \nnot a ``bad apple'' provider, and that he will be required to pay for \nthe entire cost of this new plan out-of-pocket. These are all very \nserious problems with the program, and certainly Mark is not alone.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Kathleen \nStephan of Fletcher, NC, who wrote to describe her experience with the \nAffordable Care Act and the impact on her health care. I wish to read \nher letter versus paraphrasing it.\n\n       Dear Senator Burr: I recently received a notice from Blue \n     Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina that my health insurance \n     policy will be cancelled effective January 1, 2014 because it \n     does not meet all of the mandates under ObamaCare.\n       My current premium is $418 per month. The replacement \n     policy being recommended to me will cost $928 per month--a \n     122 percent increase, and I do not qualify for subsidies.\n       I have had continuous coverage with Blue Cross Blue Shield \n     for many years, and I like the plan I currently have.\n       I'm a 62 year old woman, and will not benefit from the \n     mandatory additions to my plan, such as maternity coverage, \n     newborn and pediatric care.\n       In the past, having continuous coverage provided a sense of \n     security that my rates could not be raised based on a change \n     in my health status.\n       I experienced such a change in 2012 when I was diagnosed \n     with breast cancer and underwent seven months of treatment.\n       Now my rates are more than doubling, and the security is \n     gone, not because of the change in my health, but because of \n     ObamaCare.\n       When President Obama was selling the Affordable Care Act to \n     the American people, he repeatedly promised that if you like \n     your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. \n     Period.\n       I'm writing to you today to tell you that I do like my plan \n     and I want to keep it. I'm asking for fairness for myself and \n     the estimated millions of other Americans who will have their \n     plans taken away by ObamaCare.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 Kathleen Stephan.\n\n  How do I answer Kathleen's letter?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, every one of us can stand here and tell \nthousands of stories. Mine will come from a gentleman by the name of \nClint W., who is a small business owner. He received notice that he \nwasn't grandfathered, was being cancelled as of the first of the year. \nHis premiums went from $320 to $1,200. His deductible went from $5,000 \nto $12,700. He says he can't afford it, and he canceled the policy so \nthat he could save money for future medical expenses, and he is going \nto stay canceled for as long as he possibly can.\n  What struck me about this--I didn't get a lot of letters from poor \npeople. I didn't get a lot of letters or contacts from rich people. My \ncontacts came from middle-class America, which is what this country is. \nWe are a middle-class country, by and large, with a small sliver of \nrich people at one end and some people who are deserving of our help at \nthe other end, but those who are primarily affected by this are the \nmiddle class of America.\n  My good friends on the other side tried to claim they are the party \nthat represents the middle class of America. I don't know whether they \nare getting the same letters we are, but if they are, they realize they \nhave done something horrible. They didn't do a plan to help the \ndisadvantaged, whom the Republican Party has always helped. What they \nhave done is a social experiment that is collectivism or socialism at \nits worst. It is obvious it is a failure. These things don't work.\n  The American people, over 200 years, built a very successful \ninsurance system and health care system in America. In 3 years this has \nbeen destroyed. There are 44 days left to make this work. If this isn't \ndone right, there is going to be a collapse on January 1 and the \nAmerican people are going to know exactly who caused it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. One of the things I have discussed is the impact ObamaCare \nis having on Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries. Obviously, being from \nFlorida, we have a significant number of Medicare beneficiaries and, in \nparticular, people who are under something called Medicare Advantage. \nThis is the only program in Medicare where seniors get to choose the \ntype of coverage they want and things of that nature. My mom is a \nMedicare Advantage patient.\n  I wish to read a letter I received from a constituent of mine named \nMichelle Hatley, who lives in Destin, FL, which is in northwest \nFlorida. This is a letter she received regarding her existing doctors. \nShe also received a letter from one of her providers that talks about \nthe changes that are happening. She sent this document attached to it. \nShe states:\n\n       Here is a copy of the letter that I received from White \n     Wilson Medical Group. As I indicated in our conversation, \n     Sacred Heart might also be affected. My Medicare Advantage \n     plan was the Medicare Completer through AARP and United \n     Health Care. I have multiple chronic conditions which require \n     treatment and consultation through several doctors. Three of \n     my doctors are with White Wilson and 3 are with Sacred Heart. \n     My rheumatologist, who directs my care for treatment of 2 \n     autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, is \n     with Sacred Heart and the only Rheumatologist in Destin. I am \n     also legally blind, so transport to another doctor out of \n     town is both difficult to arrange and expensive.\n       Of the plans that are available that will allow me to keep \n     my doctors, the annual out of pocket is significantly higher \n     as well as the co-payments and deductibles for patient \n     visits, prescription drugs, and inpatient care. My choice has \n     been reduced to finding ALL new doctors or enrolling in a \n     different Medicare Advantage plan, which will cost more.\n       I wanted the Senator to be aware that Medicare clients are \n     experiencing negative consequences from the ACA as well.\n\n  Since that time, after this experience, she has been able to find a \nplan that will help her avoid losing all six of her doctors, including \nher five specialists and the primary care physician. This is the catch: \nThe new plan's out-of-pocket costs are now going from the $4,000-to-\n$4,500 range up to an expected $5,900. It was a tough decision for her \nto make, but she ultimately decided to pay more money in order to keep \nseeing all of her doctors who have been treating her for the past 4 to \n6 years.\n  This is a real-life story of a Medicare Advantage recipient in this \ncountry whose out-of-pocket costs are going up because of ObamaCare. It \nis wrong. It is unfair. It should not stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to share \nmany stories I am receiving from my constituents about them receiving \ncancellations of policies they wanted to keep and higher premiums under \nthis law. Each story is very sad, and I feel badly for the people of my \nState and across this country who are suffering under this law. My \nconstituents are pleading for relief. This is only one example.\n  A small business owner from Peterborough, NH, who voted for President \nObama twice, told me that her family has a household income of $50,000 \nand their total health insurance will now cost over $19,000 for the \nyear, which is more than their mortgage. Their local hospital isn't \neven on the exchange. In New Hampshire we only have one insurer on the \nexchange and 10 of our 26 hospitals have been excluded from that \nexchange.\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n  This constituent from Peterborough wrote:\n\n       We are frustrated, afraid, and angry beyond words. . . . I \n     urge a postponement of implementation of the Affordable Care \n     Act while those with the power look harder at the average \n     American and come up with a better plan. Life shouldn't be \n     this hard.\n\n  Citizens from across New Hampshire and this country are crying out \nfor relief. I hope the President will listen to them and call a timeout \non this law so that we can come together and, rather than what was done \nin this Chamber--passing a partisan law--come together for bipartisan \nhealth care solutions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, it is hard to narrow down the best story to \ntell. In fact, they are all bad stories. They are all terrible stories. \nKansans are also struggling under the consequences of the passage of \nthe Affordable Care Act. It bothers me so many times it is suggested \nthat this is only a problem with implementation. The problem that \nAmericans and Kansans are facing today really is the crux, the \nunderlying basis for the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. This is \nnot only an implementation problem; it is not only a computer problem; \nit is the theory on which the Affordable Care Act was based.\n  An example I would like to describe to my colleagues in the Senate is \nfrom a constituent from Newton, KS, which is a city in the center of \nthe State. He writes:\n\n       We were notified by our health insurance carrier that our \n     premiums on our small business plan were to increase 24% on \n     our renewal date because of the coverage mandated by the ACA \n     starting in 2014.\n       As small business owners in our late 50s we have struggled \n     to find affordable health insurance for years. About 2 years \n     ago we were able to sign up for a plan offered to small \n     businesses through a well known carrier. It was not a \n     ``Cadillac'' plan since we each had a $5,000 deductible and \n     no coverage for maternity (didn't need), contraception \n     (didn't need), but it covered the things we wanted and \n     needed. Unfortunately, the premium increase is going to put \n     this plan in the unaffordable range again.\n       I have not yet been able to get on healthcare.gov. The few \n     times I've tried it has either been down or locked up during \n     access. As a business owner with employees and a lot of \n     responsibilities, the time I have to spend messing around \n     with a slow or non-responsive web site is limited and \n     personally expensive.\n\n  Our constituents need help, and the Affordable Care Act is why they \nneed help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. The President promised the American people that if you like \nyour doctor, you can keep him or her. He promised that if you like your \ninsurance, you can keep it. But he needs to tell Andy Mangione and his \nfamily why they can't keep their insurance. They had an individual \npolicy they were happy with. They paid $333 per month, and they are now \ngoing to be asked to pay $965 per month for things they don't want and \ndidn't choose to have. This isn't only about health care; this is about \nfreedom of choice. This is about whether one can choose what type of \ninsurance they want. The next question is, What is next? What choices \nwill be taken from us?\n  I am going to be signing up for ObamaCare. Yesterday I tried 15 \ntimes. I wasn't able to get beyond ``create an account'' because every \ntime I pushed ``create an account,'' nothing happened.\n  This is a real problem--5 million people without insurance. The \nPresident said: If you can keep your insurance, you should be allowed \nto. You can keep your doctor.\n  Something has to be done because the Mangione family is going to have \nto pay three times as much for an insurance policy they don't want. We \nare taking their freedom of choice away. I, for one, say enough is \nenough. Let's get rid of this. Let's give back freedom to the consumer. \nGive back freedom to Kentucky families. In Kentucky, 10 times more \nfamilies have been canceled than have actually accessed the Web site. \nSomething has to give.\n  Mr. President, if you said ``you can keep your doctor,'' come forward \nand tell us why we can't keep our doctor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, millions across this country are losing \ntheir health care, are losing their doctors because of ObamaCare. In \nTexas this past week the Austin American-Statesman reported that \nAustin's largest provider of cancer treatment won't participate in the \nhealth insurance plans offered through the marketplace set up by the \nAffordable Care Act. Indeed, they went on: ``ObamaCare looked like the \nsunshine on the horizon. And now it's a tornado,'' said one Austinite \nwho has breast cancer and is being treated at Texas Oncology.\n\n  In its upcoming issue, Texas Medicine, a publication from the Texas \nMedical Association, references a survey by the Medical Group \nManagement Association that says uncertainty has 40 percent of \nphysician practices across the country pondering their participation in \nmarketplace-based insurance plans.\n  But by reducing their risk, Texas Oncology is passing the burden on \nto some already stressed families, said Seth Winick, whose wife is \nbeing treated by Texas Oncology for breast cancer. Winick also said: \n``It's an unwelcome burden and could seriously affect thousands of \nfamilies who deal with cancer in our communities.''\n  If Winick's family is forced to pay out-of-network rates to treat his \nwife, the family will have to make some tough decisions. He says: ``We \nwill make the financial sacrifice necessary to purchase the best care \nwe can afford and we hope that it is enough.''\n  But Mr. Winick had nothing positive to say about the people and the \ncare provided at Texas Oncology. He also said:\n\n       Expanding health insurance coverage to people who don't \n     have it is a noble goal, but the impact that has on those of \n     us who do have it remains to be seen. Folks in the individual \n     market don't really know what is in store.\n\n  President Obama promised the American people: If you like your health \ncare plan, you can keep it. We now know that promise wasn't true. \nObamaCare isn't working and it is time to start over.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. As my colleagues have said, I think all of us have heard \nfrom hundreds of our constituents in the past week who have had their \ninsurance policies canceled or their insurance policies have been made \nunaffordable by the Affordable Care Act.\n  I wish to talk a minute about Greg and Linda. They live a couple \ndoors down from me. I heard from Greg earlier this week. Greg and Linda \nare in their late fifties, early sixties. They know at this stage in \nlife what kind of policy they need. They know what they do not need. \nThey had a premium of about $400 under their old policy. They paid \n$440, to be exact. The new plan they have been able to find that \nmatches most closely with what they had, after their other policy was \ncanceled, would cost them just over $1,000--$1,055 to be exact. How is \nthat affordable?\n  The President promised: If you like your plan, you can keep it. If \nyou like your doctor, you can keep him or her. Period. That has not \nbeen the case. The President needs to explain to Greg and Linda and to \nhundreds and thousands of other Arizonans who are losing their health \ncoverage how it is he said they could keep their coverage and now they \ncan't.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the President of the United States promised: \nIf you like your plan, you can keep it. We all know now that simply \nwasn't true. Though many of us have been saying this for years, many \nAmericans, including many in my State, are realizing the pain of the \nPresident's false statement.\n  Dave from Utah says: My company just dropped the good insurance plan \nwe have had for years due to ObamaCare. The Affordable Care Act is \ncosting me more money. I am barely able to keep my family out of \npoverty, and now health care is going to cost me even more. Please do \nsomething to change this.\n  Marcy from Utah says: We own a small business in Utah and we will be \nforced to cancel our insurance and ourselves go on ObamaCare.\n  We can start over with a new way to fix our health care system, but \nstarting\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nover doesn't necessarily have to mean starting from scratch. We should \ntake those lessons we have learned and we should build around the \nconcept of a market-driven, patient-centered health care system, one \nthat empowers individual Americans to choose their own health insurance \nbased on their own personal needs and based on their own preferences.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have two stories from South Carolina I \nwill quickly share with the body.\n  Scott, from Goose Creek, SC:\n\n       I am a college professor from Columbia, SC, at a private \n     university. We are up for our insurance open enrollment. I am \n     35 years old, a vegetarian, never smoked, ridiculously low \n     blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\n  Obviously, I have nothing in common with Scott.\n  Continuing Scott's story:\n\n       I noticed the following about my policy: My share of \n     premiums went up by 35 percent to 40 percent. In addition, my \n     actual policy changed. My deductible tripled from $250 to \n     $750. I cannot get regular monthly prescriptions at my \n     pharmacy now. I am sure there are other changes that I have \n     not examined closely enough to notice.\n\n  Thomas Dougall, from Elgin, SC: After submitting his personal \ninformation on healthcare.gov received a phone call from a Mr. Justin \nHadley, a North Carolina resident, who informed him that when he signed \nonto healthcare.gov, he received all of Mr. and Mrs. Dougall's personal \ninformation.\n  This is beginning to be a very famous case.\n  There are 572 people who have been enrolled in ObamaCare in the State \nof South Carolina.\n  ObamaCare care is not working, and I fear it will never work. The \nbest way to fix it is to repeal it and replace it with something that \nwill work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have received letters from constituents \nall over Utah who are scared, angry, and confused about the changes \nthey are facing under ObamaCare. I have heard countless stories from \nUtahns losing their coverage and who will be forced into more expensive \nplans, thanks to the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  One such story came from Kathy in Salt Lake City. I spoke briefly \nabout Kathy on the floor a few weeks ago. Kathy wrote to tell me how \nshe was notified by mail that her existing health care plan was no \nlonger going to be offered. Instead, she was presented with an \nObamaCare-compliant policy that will increase her deductible from \n$3,000 to $5,000, increase her copays for doctor visits by 30 percent, \nand increase her copays for prescription drugs as much as 50 percent.\n  As a result of these changes, Kathy's health care expenses will \nexceed her income. To quote Kathy:\n\n       The claim that only substandard policies were canceled is a \n     lie--the plan I was on was a good policy.\n\n  She does not trust the new healthcare.gov Web site and feels there is \nnot adequate security to protect her personal information. In her \nwords: ``I wouldn't touch the exchange with a 10-foot pole.''\n  She is not alone in feeling this way, which spells trouble for these \nnew health care exchanges and for the President's health care law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss higher premiums \nand deductibles facing Alaskans, despite President Obama's promise that \nhe will lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year. I \ncan assure you that families in Alaska that I have heard from are \nexperiencing just the opposite; significant, double digit increases in \ntheir premiums and they are not pleased with the President's failed \npromise to lower their healthcare costs.\n  I received a letter from a couple in Fairbanks, AK who is in the 55-\nplus age group and make ``decent'' but not significant incomes. They \nalso do not qualify for Federal subsidies. They say the new cost of \ntheir insurance is ``like another mortgage payment--over $1,500 per \nmonth with an increase from $5,000 to $6,350 for each deductible.'' By \nmy assessment, that's over $18,000 in premiums plus $6,350 for their \ninitial out-of-pocket expenses, which totals over $24,000 before any \nnon-routine checkups are covered. They say they would rather pay the \npenalty, and unfortunately, this couple is not alone in their thinking. \nIn Alaska, a State with the second highest premiums in the Nation \naccording to CMS' own data, many of my constituents will opt for the \npenalty rather than bankrupting themselves to pay for a health \ninsurance policy. It's not surprising that the letter ends by saying, \n``Not happy with the Affordable Care Act.'' I agree. And recent polls \nindicate that many Americans aren't happy with the Affordable Care Act.\n  Contrary to what we've been hearing about how higher premiums are \nactually making health insurance better or more affordable, that's just \nnot the case. Mr. President, this couple wants to contribute to \nsociety. They want to be responsible citizens. But they can't when \ntheir insurance premiums costs are like another mortgage payment. This \nis the harsh impact the Affordable Care Act is having on everyday \nAlaskans who are trying to do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have seen an array of my Republican \ncolleagues come to the floor, which is their right--and I am glad the \ngovernment is open so they can have their staff help them prepare their \nspeeches--but I have to say this is typical of the Republicans when it \ncomes to health care. All they do is criticize. Not one--not one \nbecause I monitored the speeches--gave one new idea of how to make sure \nour citizens are protected with the insurance they have or how to \ninsure the 48 million uninsured Americans--not one.\n  But this is the way the Republican Party has been for years. Let's \nlook at what happened when Medicare came to the Senate floor and to the \nHouse floor--Medicare, which is one of the most beloved programs. Sixty \npercent of Republicans in the Senate and 50 percent of House \nRepublicans voted against Medicare in 1965.\n  Representative Durward Hall, a Republican from Missouri, said:\n\n       We cannot stand idly by now, as the Nation is urged to \n     embark on an ill-conceived adventure in government medicine, \n     the end of which no one can see, and from which the patient \n     is certain to be the ultimate sufferer.\n\n  This is typical of Republicans through the generations. Every time we \nhave tried to expand health care they have opposed it and opposed it \nand tried to derail it.\n  Senator Milward Simpson, a Republican from Wyoming, said:\n\n       I am disturbed about the effect this legislation would have \n     upon our economy and upon our private insurance system.\n\n  That is what they said about Medicare, and they read horror stories. \nThey read horror stories about it.\n  Here is what the Republicans aren't saying. They are saying there is \na problem with the health care law that needs to be fixed, which is \nthat people who want to keep their substandard plans are having trouble \nkeeping their substandard plans. But President Obama has already said \nhe is going to fix that. There is legislation to fix that. We will fix \nit. But that is not good enough for our Republican friends. They want \nto tear it down, just like they wanted to tear down Medicare.\n  They have even wanted to tear down Medicare more recently. This isn't \nancient history, let's be clear. In 1995, Dick Armey, the Republican \nHouse majority leader, said that Medicare is ``a program I would have \nno part of in a free world.''\n  This is the Republican sentiment about health care being offered to \nour people. That same year, after leading an effort to raise premiums \nand costs for seniors, Newt Gingrich predicted that Medicare was \n``going to wither on the vine.''\n  We have tea partiers saying hands off my Medicare. OK. That is how \nout of touch the Republicans are with where the people are.\n  In 1996, Senate majority leader Bob Dole bragged:\n\n       I was there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare . \n     . . because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  Now Paul Ryan's budget ends Medicare as we know it.\n  So let's be clear. When you see almost the entire Republican caucus \ncome down and try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, this is not just\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\nstemming from today or yesterday or a glitch in the Web site or a \nproblem we have that we have to fix about people losing their \nsubstandard plans. If they want to keep them, we will figure out a way \nto help them fix that. But notice they never said anything about the \ngood things the Affordable Care Act is doing for millions of people.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, 3 million young adults are now \ninsured on their parents' plan. Yet they want to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act. What is going to happen to those 3 million young adults?\n  We have 71 million Americans getting free preventive care such as \ncheckups, birth control, and immunizations. There are 17 million kids \nwith preexisting conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, who can no \nlonger be denied coverage.\n  They want to talk about people who are having a problem. We are going \nto fix that. We think it is about 5 percent of the people, but even if \nit is 1 percent, we should fix it.\n  Yesterday we learned in the first month of the open enrollment \nperiod, 106,000, or 1.4 percent of consumers expected to sign up in the \nfirst year, have enrolled. If you look at Massachusetts during its \nfirst month--and I am sure the Chair is aware of this, being from New \nJersey, close to Massachusetts--only 0.3 percent, or 123 people, signed \nup for coverage out of the 36,000 who ultimately signed up in the first \nyear.\n  So let's be clear: We all wanted to see bigger numbers, but the \nAffordable Care Act numbers are four times better than what \nMassachusetts did in its first month. If you talk to the people in \nMassachusetts, they love their health care plan, and our plan is based \non their plan. By the way, the Massachusetts plan is a Republican plan.\n  Hundreds of thousands have started the enrollment process, and I am \none of them. I have created an account and I am going to go shopping \nand buy my plan. I am taking my time because I have some time--until \nDecember--and I wish to discuss it with my husband. We are going to \ndecide what is best for us and I am going to sign up. I think it was \nSecretary Sebelius who said this isn't like buying a toaster. This is a \ncommitment for 1 year and you have to take your time.\n  So don't come here and tear down the Affordable Care Act without \nhaving to put anything in its place and focus on one problem the \nPresident has said he is going to fix--and we are going to fix it. \nThings are going to pick up.\n  But I wish to tell you the great news about California. Just in the \nfirst 2 weeks of November, California's enrollment has doubled. Our \nstory is a truly good one. There is a huge amount of interest in \nCalifornia. People are enrolling. We do have a good Web site, which is \nimportant. People are finding affordable health care options.\n  At the end of the day, when the kinks are worked out, I believe the \nCalifornia experience will be repeated across the country to the \nbenefit of all our families.\n  So I will break down some of the numbers from California. We have the \nlargest State in the Union. I hate to say this to my friends here, but \nwe are always ahead of the curve.\n  During the month of October, 370,000 Californians began the process \nof signing up for private coverage or Medicaid through our health \ninsurance marketplace, Covered California--coveredCA.com. Of those, \nover 30,000 Californians enrolled in health exchange plans and over \n72,000 applied for Medicaid. So we are off to an excellent start in \nCalifornia. In October, there were more than 2.4 million unique visits \nto Covered California. In other words, this doesn't count people going \nback and back. These are unique visits. More than 249,000 calls were \nmade to Covered California call centers, and they have got it down to \njust a couple of minutes of wait time. To date, more than 17,000 \ncounselors, agents, county workers, and others have been certified to \noffer in-person assistance to Californians.\n  We have heard the horror stories from over there--one side of the \nstory--of people having a problem. We are going to fix the problem. I \nwill quote what Californians are saying.\n\n       I enrolled online on Monday! No website troubles! Took me \n     about 15 minutes! I'll be saving $628 a month after January \n     1st! So grateful!\n       Very short wait on the phone; helpful cheerful person to \n     talk to. This online app is very easy. Thank you!\n       The insurance package I am getting is more comprehensive \n     and way cheaper than the one I've had for the last 9 years. \n     Thank you for creating the marketplace and making the \n     information more accessible and understandable.\n       I find the new coverage provisions to be amazing compared \n     to what was out there before. Many of the plans are cheaper \n     than anything I've seen before and the one I chose has zero \n     deductible.\n       Simple, straightforward, and intuitive. I haven't had \n     health insurance since 1985, so this site has made it \n     unexpectedly easy to enroll. Thank you.\n\n  What we heard from the Republicans is from a group of people we are \ngoing to help who have substandard plans--they don't meet the standards \nof the Affordable Care Act; sometimes they are called junk plans--some \na little better than junk, many of them are not there when you need \nthem. I have to say, to come down here and echo that sentiment without \nsaying the good things which have been done is outrageous.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So we now know the history of the Republican Party. Sad \nto say, but they opposed Medicare when it went in. They tried to tear \nit down; they still are trying to tear it down in the Ryan budget. They \ncome down here, and they talk about a problem that exists that we are \ngoing to fix. They never said: The President is going to fix it. He may \nbe on the way to fixing it in moments here. But they ignore the fact \nthat the signups are ahead of where Massachusetts was at this time.\n  Sage McCollister from Castro Valley told me how the law is helping \nher family. She was able to get insurance for her 7-year-old daughter, \nLeah, who was born with an autoimmune disorder. Sage said that before \nthe Affordable Care Act was passed she applied to eight different \ncompanies to try to get insurance, but none were affordable. After the \nlaw went into effect, she was able to get insurance for Leah for $8 a \nmonth. Leah was able to get a procedure done to treat a spinal cord \nproblem that could have resulted in paralysis. Sage said that without \nthe Affordable Care Act, ``my family would be bankrupt and Leah \nwouldn't have gotten the health care she needs.''\n  ``Obamacare saved my family from financial ruin,'' said another \nconstituent, Janine Urbaniak Reid.\n  So let's be fair. To come down to the floor one after the other and \nshed light on one problem we are going to fix--that the President said \nhe was going to fix--and then say you are going to repeal the whole \nthing sounds just like their predecessors who said that Medicare was \nterrible and that Social Security was an awful idea. That is what this \nis about.\n  We are going to make history here. We are going to do the right \nthing. We are going to fix the problems, and there will be more because \nthat is what happens when we are tackling this big issue. But at the \nend of the day, we will be a better nation, a healthier nation. Our \nchildren will have a brighter future, and I stand with those who want \nprogress. We are not going to tear something down like they want to do \nand go right back to where we were before--with parents like these \nhaving to choose between feeding their families and giving their kids \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \ntelling the stories of people in California, which are not unlike the \nstories in Connecticut--an exchange that is working, a flood of people \nsigning up way above expectations from where we originally thought the \nnumbers would be. I thank her as well for pointing out what is the \nreality--which is that over 40 times Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate have voted to repeal the health care \nreform law. Even well over the last 5 years, using over and over this \nmantra of repeal and replace, they have offered absolutely no \nreplacement.\n  There is a story in one of the trade publications this morning saying \nthat the Republicans were just going to change their strategy. Instead \nof piling on repeal vote after repeal vote, they are now just going to \ncome down to the\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nfloor and use their committee chairmanships to simply criticize the \nlaw, and shelve, for the time being, their incessant efforts to try to \nrepeal the law entirely.\n  But make no mistake, that continues to be their intention. While they \nare going to come down to the floor of the Senate, as they did this \nmorning, and tell a handful of anecdotes about people who are \ndissatisfied with the law, their true intention is to get rid of the \nentire law and go back to a world in which 30 million people in this \ncountry had no access to insurance; that if you got sick, you would \nlose your insurance; a world in which insurance companies essentially \nset the rules of the game, to the disadvantage of providers and \npatients. That is what the agenda is here, to repeal the law and go \nback to the status quo, which is unacceptable--the highest number of \nuninsured citizens in the industrialized world, the most expensive \nhealth care system by a factor of two, compared to all of our G-20 \ncompetitors.\n  I get it that there are people who are unhappy, and the President is \ngoing to make an announcement later today which is going to set a path \nforward to try to fix one of the issues with the law with respect to \ncancelled policies. But I will share a couple of other stories about \nwhat the reality of the old system was.\n  Kyle is today about 11 years old, but when we first came into my \noffice he was an 8-year-old living with hemophilia. Kyle is an \namazingly brave young man who inspires courage in his parents. But Kyle \nhas to get three to four injections a week in order to treat his \nhemophilia, and each one of those injections costs $3,000.\n  His plan prior to health care reform had a feature in it that most \npeople didn't know was included in their health care plan. That was a \nlifetime cap on the amount of money his health insurance company would \npay for his care. Because Kyle was mounting up bills in the tens of \nthousands of dollars every week, his family was going to hit that cap \nvery quickly and then be on the hook for those $3,000 injections that \nKyle needs to take three to four times a week. That was going to \nbankrupt Kyle's family. They thank their lucky stars that we passed \nthis health care reform law, because now their insurance has to be real \ninsurance. It protects them against their lifetime exposure of high \nhealth care costs.\n  Think about the Burgers from Meriden, CT. Betty and her husband had \ninsurance their entire life, except for a 1-week period of time when \nBetty's husband switched jobs. During that 1-week period of time, their \nson was diagnosed with cancer, and because that was then a preexisting \ncondition, her husband's new insurance plan wouldn't cover their son's \ntreatment. Their story, unfortunately, can be told millions of times \nover across this country--because the Burgers went bankrupt. They lost \ntheir savings, they lost their house, and they lost everything as they \nmounted up huge bills to pay for their son's cancer treatments, just \nbecause he got diagnosed during a 1-week period of time in which their \nfamily had no health care insurance. That practice ends with the \nimplementation of this health care law. No sick person can be denied \ninsurance simply because of a preexisting condition, simply because a \ndiagnosis happened to happen during a small window of time in which \ntheir family didn't have insurance.\n  I get it that the road has been a little bumpy as we have implemented \nthis new health care system. But it is nothing compared to the bumps \nwhich have been encountered by millions of families across this country \nwho have been abused by a system which simply does not work.\n  If our biggest problem is that enough people who don't have insurance \naren't signing up quick enough for insurance, that is a problem I will \naccept because it is a problem we can fix. If all we are talking about \nhere is just the pace at which people are going from uninsured to \ninsured, then we can fix that. We can fix that because we know the \nproduct is good.\n  Senator Boxer talked about the Massachusetts experience, where during \nthe first month of their enrollment for the Massachusetts exchange only \n0.3 percent of the total signed up during that month. Why? Because \npeople take their time. This is not an easy decision, to sign up for \nhealth care. But in Connecticut, where we have an exchange which has \nbeen up and running and a Web site that is working, in the first month \nour number wasn't 0.3 percent. We enrolled nearly 10 percent of our \nexpected total in the first 30 days.\n  Here is what people say about their experience with Connecticut's \nexchange. One person said: This is a great resource for Connecticut \nresidents to apply for health coverage thanks to the health care law.\n  Another said: I chose Access Health because I have been denied in the \npast by other carriers before this law changed.\n  Another said: Thank you so much for this health care law. I haven't \nbeen insured in a decade. I am so, so thankful.\n  Another said: Thank you for this program. I lost my job a year ago \nand couldn't find anything that I can afford in health coverage before \nthis law passed.\n  Finally, another said: Thank you. This law is helpful and \nappreciated. God bless America, and thank you President Obama.\n  The President is going to make an announcement which will paint a \npath forward for the relatively small number of Americans--4 percent--\nwho get their insurance in the individual market, some of which have \nhad their plans canceled. But the solution with respect to the timing \nof enrollment is not to abandon the law, as is the real agenda of \npeople on this floor. The solution is to fix the problem so that, like \nin Connecticut, more people across this country can for the first time \nhave access to affordable quality health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Connecticut and \nCalifornia for coming to the floor.\n  We saw for the last hour Republican Senators come to floor and tell a \nnumber of stories about individuals and the difficulties they have run \ninto with health insurance. I don't dispute the facts they have brought \nto the floor, but I do dispute their characterization of what America \nfaces at this moment in time.\n  I supported the Affordable Care Act. I believe it was the right thing \nto do. I still believe it. I will tell you right off the bat--and most \nDemocrats and Republicans would agree on this point--it is off to a \nrocky start.\n  This Web site that was supposed to be ready October 1 we are told \nwill be ready by November 30. I hope it is, and the sooner the better. \nI am told it is improving by the day. That is good. Americans need \naccess to information about health insurance. And when they have that \naccess, they can do something--for many of them for the first time in \ntheir lives--go shopping for health insurance. There are a lot of \npeople who have never had that luxury. Some have never had health \ninsurance one day in their lives. Others have been given a ``take it or \nleave it'' situation, with a policy that may or may not be worth \nanything.\n  I listened carefully to the Republicans for a long time on the issue \nof health insurance. I have heard a lot of criticism, a lot of \ncomplaints. They want to defund ObamaCare. They want to delay the \nAffordable Care Act. They want to destroy it.\n  They do not have an alternative. ``We want to repair it and replace \nit.'' Then let's hear your proposal. We never heard one during the \ncourse of our debate on creating this law 3\\1/2\\ years ago. We kept \nwaiting for a Republican plan. The honest answer is they had none and \napparently they still do not.\n  The reason they do not is they fall back and say let the marketplace \ndecide. Many of us know the marketplace in health care personally. We \nknow a marketplace that has turned away 40 to 50 million people who are \nuninsured in America, people who still get sick, still go to the \nhospital, and whose bills are paid by everyone else.\n  The Republican Party is supposed to be the party of responsibility \nand rugged individualism. What about the responsibility we all have, if \nwe can afford it, to have health insurance and as a country to provide \nthe means for those who cannot afford it so they can have protection \ntoo. That to me is responsible. Trying to just stop this reform is \nirresponsible.\n  When you get into the specifics on the Affordable Care Act you never \nhear\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\na Republican Senator come to the floor and make a case against the \nspecifics. Do you know why? They cannot. Is there a Republican Senator \nwho will come to the floor and defend the right of a health insurance \ncompany to turn down a person or a family because of a preexisting \ncondition? That is the situation we faced when we passed the Affordable \nCare Act. Is there a family in America who does not have someone with a \npreexisting condition? Most families do. My family has in the past and \ndoes now too.\n  Preexisting conditions can range from the very serious to conditions \nwhich are chronic and manageable, from asthma and diabetes to cancer \nsurvivors. The list is long. The Affordable Care Act says you cannot \nturn down a person in America for health insurance because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  The Republicans say they want to repeal that. If they want to go back \nto the day where you can turn down a person because of a preexisting \ncondition, then have the courage to come to the floor and say it. They \nwill not.\n  The law also says you cannot limit the lifetime payout on a health \ninsurance policy. There were a lot of people who thought $100,000 was a \nlot of money for health care until they got into a serious situation. \nWe are one diagnosis, one serious disease, one accident away from \nmedical bills that would wipe out $100,000 in a day or two. So we put \nin the Affordable Care Act that there can be no upper lifetime limit \nwhen it comes to the payout under the health care insurance policy.\n  The Republicans say they want to repeal it. I challenge any \nRepublican Senator to come to the floor and explain that one.\n  Did you know as well that of the family policies sold in America, 60 \npercent of the family policies did not cover maternity benefits? We \nrequire the coverage of maternity benefits. Let me tell you, my wife \nand I are not in a situation where we are likely to ever use those \npersonally, but we happen to believe it is a good policy across America \nand it is family friendly across America to make sure policies cover \nmaternity. Those who talk about family values and love of family and \nlove of babies and children, why in the world would you not want to \ninclude that protection in all family policies? Spread the risk across \nthe population but make sure every family can afford to have prenatal \ncare for a healthy baby and a healthy mom when that blessed event \narrives. I am waiting for the first Republican to come to the floor and \nsay that is a bad idea too.\n  Incidentally, health insurance policies used to discriminate against \ncertain groups, particularly women. We said that is over. You cannot \ndiscriminate against women and treat them differently. You have to be \nfair in the allocation of this risk and you cannot use gender as a \nbasis for increasing the cost of a policy. The Republicans want to \nrepeal that. I am waiting for the first Republican Senator to come to \nthe floor and say health insurance policies, because of the free \nmarket, should be allowed to discriminate against women. That is a \nreality.\n  The other provision we provide in the Affordable Care Act, finally, \nis families with children coming out of college, looking for a job, can \nkeep their kids on their health insurance policies to the age of 26. We \ndo not know exactly how many are helped by this. Some estimate 300,000-\nplus young people still on their families' policies. Why is it a good \nthing? Because a lot of young people coming out of college do not find \na job right away, and some that do may not have a full-time job or \nbenefits. If you have ever been a mom or dad--and I have been in that \ncircumstance as a father, where I called my daughter and I said: \nJennifer, do you have health insurance? Dad, I don't need it; I am \nhealthy. Those are things that keep you up at night. The Affordable \nCare Act provides additional protection for these young Americans who \nare just starting out in life and trying to find a job. The Republicans \nwant to repeal it. I am waiting for the first Republican Senator to \ncome to the floor and make that case. Oh, we should make sure young \npeople in their twenties do not have health insurance. That is the \nresult if you repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  What about senior citizens? Medicare Part D provides prescription \ncoverage so senior citizens can stay healthy, independent, and strong \nfor as long as possible. The problem we had, of course, was something \ncalled the doughnut hole. It meant out-of-pocket expenses seniors had \nto pay for those prescriptions. We are closing and filling the doughnut \nhole so seniors are not giving up their life savings in order to have \nthe prescription drugs they need for a healthy life. They want to \nrepeal that. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I am waiting \nfor the first Republican Senator to come to the floor and say seniors \nought to pay more for the prescriptions they need under Medicare, \nbecause that is the result of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let me also say this. Life experience tells us several things. First, \npremiums on health insurance go up with some frequency. We are trying \nto slow down the rate of growth, but they have been going up for a long \ntime. In some markets, for example, when it comes to individual \npolicies people are buying, those have gone up rather dramatically, \nsometimes 15 percent a year for a long period of time. Second, in that \nmarket of individuals buying health insurance, 67 percent of those \npolicies are canceled every 2 years. Now they come to the floor and \ntell us stories about premiums going up and cancellations. Can I remind \nmy friends on the Republican side that has been going on for a long \ntime. Now they blame every cancellation on the Affordable Care Act. \nThey blame every premium increase on the Affordable Care Act. That is \njust not factual. It is not true.\n  Let me tell you about some mail I have received on the subject. Here \nis an email from a constituent in Illinois I would like to read. Here \nis what this constituent writes:\n\n       As a lifelong Republican I am absolutely appalled by the \n     extremists who have hijacked MY party! And I am thoroughly \n     ashamed of all the attempts to defund President Obama's \n     healthcare act.\n       Already, my medical costs have dropped due to early \n     provisions of the act--and if it passes [becomes law] it \n     appears I will be able to save $6,000 per year on the cost of \n     my premiums!\n       I realize that not everyone shares my enthusiasm for the \n     healthcare bill, but I would make two comments:\n       1. When the act is broken down into its component parts, \n     polls consistently show that the American people do agree \n     with the program.\n       2. All I'm asking is that we give it a fair trial--[give it \n     a fair chance]--say, two years. Of course it will need \n     tweaking and revising.\n       But if it doesn't work, it can be repealed then. Quite \n     frankly, obstructionists are a public embarrassment to those \n     of us who grew up with a different Republican party that \n     cared about people and was not madly trying to exclude as \n     many as possible through hateful bigotry and racism.\n       This is TOO IMPORTANT to let it fail! I stand with the \n     President and the Democratic Party on this issue and hope \n     that you will do everything in your power to see that the \n     Healthcare Act remains in force.\n\n  Take a look at what is going on around this country. There have been \nSenators from States who come to the floor, and I will use for example \nthe Senators from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, both of whom came to \nthe floor and called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Let's \ntake a look at the numbers. I believe, with a flawed startup, which I \nwill readily concede, in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, according to the \nWashington Post, 76,294 people have already submitted completed \napplications under the new health care law; 39,207 are eligible to \nenroll in the plan, and as of this date, 5,586 have selected a plan. \nKentucky is leading, on a per capita basis, many other States; some \nlarger, some smaller. Kentucky is leading while its two Senators come \nto the floor and rail against the very health care law the people of \nKentucky apparently need and want and are exercising their right to \nchoose.\n  I salute Governor Beshear in Kentucky. He stood and said: Get out of \nthe way. If you don't want to help Kentuckians to get good health care, \nget out of the way. We are going to give them a chance, and he is doing \nit. Other States, fighting the President and fighting Congress tooth \nand nail, they are not going to cooperate at all. We wonder why the \nstartup has been so slow. It has to be without that cooperation, it \nmakes it more difficult. I am not making any excuses for the Web site. \nIt has to be improved. It has to be better--and it will be.\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\n  Take a look at that experience in Massachusetts. The Senator from \nCalifornia talked about that earlier. During the first month of \nenrollment in Massachusetts, 123 people signed up--in the first 30 \ndays. By the end of the year, though, 36,000 had signed up. The number \nof uninsured young people went from 25 percent to 10 percent within 3 \nyears. Massachusetts today, because of the leadership of Gov. Mitt \nRomney and the cooperation of the Democratic legislature in that State, \nhas nearly universal health insurance coverage. However, the rollout \nwas not without some problems, just as ours. The current Governor, \nDeval Patrick, said there were a series of Web site problems. He also \nsaid the Web site was a work in progress for the first few years. There \nwere outages during peak times and problems searching for providers.\n  I recently met with a doctor from Boston. He is one of the best. He \nsaid people in Massachusetts cannot remember what it was like before, \nwhat it was like before people had health insurance. This doctor is an \noncologist. He deals with people who are diagnosed with cancer. He had \na 19-year-old woman come into his office before they had this version \nof the affordable health care act in the State of Massachusetts, and he \nsaid to her: We can cure you, but we have to really do this \naggressively. It is going to take chemo, going to take radiation, it is \ngoing to take surgery.\n  This 19-year-old woman said: Please, don't tell my parents. I cannot \nafford to pay for this. If they hear this, they are going to mortgage \ntheir home to pay for my medical care and I don't want them to do it.\n  The parents learned and the parents made the decision and they \nmortgaged their home and their daughter's life was saved. This \noncological doctor, this cancer doctor, said to me: Senator, I have \nnever run into another case like that since Massachusetts passed its \naffordable health care act, since people have basic insurance and basic \nprotection.\n  The life-and-death choices people make every single day should be \nfront and center here and not the political squabbles that have become \nthe trademark of this town. We have to understand that there are hard-\nworking people across America who have no health insurance. There are \nfamilies with people with preexisting conditions who cannot get a \ndecent policy. They are going to be given their chance. We will be a \nbetter America for it, and I say to the Republican critics: After this \nis in place, after thousands, maybe even millions of Americans have \nsigned up, you are not going to take it away. They are going to fight \nto keep it, and I am going to stand by them in that fight to make sure \nthey have supporters and champions on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield through the Chair for a couple of \nquestions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I see the Senator from Colorado is \nhere as well. It was so interesting to see Republican Senator after \nRepublican Senator come down here to focus on one of the problems we \nare having and are going to fix. Not one of them touched any of the \nissues my colleague spoke about or I spoke about or that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut did, which is the broad look at what we were facing \nwhen we passed the Affordable Care Act, the benefits that have gone \ninto place that are saving our families from bankruptcy and saving \nlives. I know my friend was very clear.\n  When the Senator said that to see this become all about politics is \nsomething that is so wrong--we all know there is a time for politics. \nThe Senator and I are into that. We understand that. There is a time \nand place.\n  There is also a time and place to put that aside and help our \nfamilies. I wished to ask my friend a couple of questions. Does he not \nremember, as I do, that years ago as we were facing a crisis in health \ncare in this Nation, before the Affordable Care Act, we found out from \nconstituents over and over that their insurance company would walk away \nfrom them just at the time they got sick?\n  They thought they had a policy, as some of our people think they have \ngood policies that do not meet the standards, but when they got sick--I \nremember constituents saying they get a call: You know, back 5 years \nago you didn't mention the fact that you once had high blood pressure. \nWe are sorry. We are canceling your policy.\n  Does my friend remember that? Does my friend remember learning, as I \ndid, with shock, that being a woman was a preexisting condition? For \nexample, if you were a victim of abuse as a woman, they said you were \ntoo much of a risk and they turned you away.\n  Does my friend remember just those two problems before we tackled the \nAffordable Care Act?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator, and responding through the Chair, \nthere was a time, as a Member of Congress and a Senator, this was a \nnormal request. People would call your office and say: I am at my wit's \nend. My health insurance company will not cover the problems my family \nfaces. Can you make a call to an insurance executive? And we have. \nAlmost to a person, Members of the House and Senate have done it, \ntrying to advocate to get them to open coverage under a health \ninsurance policy. That was the reality and, frankly, for many of these \nhealth insurance companies, any excuse would do. They would disqualify \npeople on preexisting conditions because as an adolescent the insured \nhad acne. Acne was deemed as a preexisting condition and subject to \ndisqualification.\n\n  I see the Senator from Colorado is on the floor, and I want to yield \ntime to him.\n  I thank my colleague from California for coming forward. I hope at \nsome point the Republicans--who are so adamant about repealing and \nending ObamaCare, as they call it, or the Affordable Care Act--would \nhave one good idea on their own about providing affordable health \ninsurance to the people across America. We all share that \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8024-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8024-S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I have to say what a joy it is to see the Presiding \nOfficer in that Chair, and welcome to the Senate.\n  I am here to talk about the Drug Quality and Security Act for a few \nminutes because at this moment of dysfunction in the Congress, we are \nat the brink of accomplishing something we have not been able to do for \nthe last 25 years--the last quarter of a century.\n  This bill, which we are about to send to the President, reforms our \ndrug distribution supply chain, making it more secure and safer for \nfamilies. It puts us on a path to electronic interoperable tracing at \nthe unit level for drugs.\n  It also raises the bar for wholesale distributors around the country \nand weeds out bad actors who find loopholes in the system to stockpile \ndrugs and create shortages. This bill cannot come soon enough.\n  Our Colorado pharmacies fill over 60 million prescriptions every \nsingle year, and the Coloradans who take these prescriptions, just like \npeople all over the country, expect their medicine to be safe. The sad \nfact is that given the current laws in place, we cannot guarantee this. \nPharmacists cannot determine with any certainty where a drug has been \nand whether it has been secured and safely stored on its way to a \npharmacy. Right now you can get more data from a barcode on a gallon of \nmilk than you can from one bottle of aspirin two aisles over in the \nstore.\n  The normal chain moves drugs from the manufacturer to a wholesaler to \na pharmacy. Under the current patchwork of State laws, drugs travel \nback and forth across State lines among repackagers, wholesalers, and \npharmacies with no real oversight by anybody.\n  The more times a drug goes back and forth and changes hands, the more \nopportunities criminals find to enter the system. In the last decade \nthis lack of oversight has created an enormous gray market in the \nUnited States of America. Companies can stockpile drugs that are in \nhigh demand and sell them later at dramatically higher prices.\n  Hospitals in Colorado are bombarded by daily calls and messages from \nvarious businesses around the country offering them drugs that are on \nthe FDA drug shortage list and unavailable through their contracted \nwholesaler.\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n  According to a recent study by Premier Alliance, which includes 30 \nColorado hospitals, sale prices of drugs that are in shortage are, on \naverage, 650 percent higher than the contracted prices. These hospitals \nhave absolutely no idea whether the businesses that are approaching \nthem are reputable and how they can have supply of these drugs that are \nin shortage.\n  Investigations into the gray market have shown that the current law \noffers a huge incentive to make outrageous profits at the expense of \npatients, whether through selling and reselling or counterfeiting or \ntainting drugs.\n  A little over a decade ago, criminals in Florida made $46 million by \ncounterfeiting 110,000 dosages of Epogen, a drug used to treat anemia--\na side effect of chemotherapy and dialysis. These criminals sold the \ncounterfeit drugs to pharmacies around the country. The FDA recovered \nless than 10 percent of the counterfeit product.\n  In 2009, nearly 130,000 vials of insulin, a temperature-sensitive \ndrug to treat diabetes, were stolen and later found across the country \nin a national pharmacy chain. The FDA--which had been notified that \npatients who used some of this insulin were reporting poor control over \ntheir insulin levels--was able to recover less than 2 percent of these \nstolen drugs.\n  A few years ago $75 million worth of drugs were stolen from an Eli \nLilly warehouse and later found in south Florida--becoming the largest \ndrug heist in the country's history.\n  Just this year the FDA notified the public about counterfeit Avastin, \na drug used to treat cancer, which was being sold from a licensed \nwholesaler in Tennessee.\n  These stories should scare any person in any State who takes a \nprescription. Fortunately, the practical compromise before us today \nwill give consumers and businesses around the country peace of mind.\n  Over the next decade, manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale \ndistributors, and pharmacies will form an electronic interoperable \nsystem to track and trace drugs at the unit level. The barcode on our \npill bottles will soon tell us who has actually handled the medicine we \ntake and give to our children.\n  Starting in 2015, the FDA will also know where every drug wholesaler \nis located across the country and begin to ensure that all wholesalers \nmeet a minimum national standard.\n  This legislation, after 25 years, is a model of what can be \naccomplished through hard work and pragmatism in the U.S. Congress. \nThis bipartisan effort has the support of business groups, such as \nPhRMA, GPhA, and BIO, as well as consumer groups, such as the Pew \nCharitable Trusts, and many others.\n  I cannot say enough about the leadership of Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Alexander in driving us to get consensus on this bill. \nTheir commitment to track and trace, as well as compounding, sets an \nexample that I wish could be replicated many times over.\n  I thank Senator Franken and Senator Roberts for their leadership on \nthe compounding part of this bill.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the relentless--and that is the only \nway to describe it--effort of Senator Richard Burr. He has been a true \nadvocate and outstanding partner with me and my staff. His tireless \nefforts, and that of his staff, helped us move this legislation into \nlaw.\n  While we are on that topic, and to close, I thank all of the staff \nwho have worked on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  I hope we have a strong show of support for this bill--as I know we \nwill--on the floor of the Senate so we can get it to the President's \ndesk. This bill will restore a sense of safety about our pharmaceutical \ndistribution chain.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Rohini Kosoglu, Senator Bennet; Anna Abram, Senator Burr; \n     Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, Senator Harkin; MarySumpter Lapinski, \n     Senator Alexander; Elizabeth Jungman, Senator Harkin; Grace \n     Stuntz, Senator Alexander; Nathan Brown, Senator Harkin; \n     Molly Fishman, Senator Bennet; Margaret Coulter, Senator \n     Burr; Pam Smith, Senator Harkin; David Cleary, Senator \n     Alexander; Hannah Katch, Senator Franken; Jennifer Boyer, \n     Senator Roberts.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize the Presiding Officer is not \nallowed to respond, but I want to add my words to those of the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado that I am delighted to see the \nSenator in the Chair. Again, as I did the other day, I welcome him to \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8025-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8025-S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. More than 12 years after the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, as we see our military presence in Afghanistan wind down, \nit is time to take a hard look at our counterterrorism policy. We need \nto consider which of our policies are working and which, while perhaps \nwell-intentioned when they were adopted in the highly charged weeks and \nmonths after 9/11, are not making us safer. There is ample evidence \nthat the status quo is unsustainable.\n  As recent revelations have made clear, we need a careful review of \nour surveillance activities. For example, this summer many Americans \nlearned for the first time that Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has \nfor years been secretly interpreted to authorize the collection of \nAmericans' phone records on an unprecedented scale.\n  Despite the massive privacy intrusion of this program, the executive \nbranch has not made the case that this program is uniquely valuable to \nprotecting our national security, and that is why I introduced the \nbipartisan USA FREEDOM Act with Congressman Sensenbrenner. We want to \nend this dragnet collection and place appropriate safeguards on a wide \nrange of government surveillance authorities.\n  We also must close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. In the \ncoming days the Senate will take up and debate the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. That act contains many \nprovisions that are central to our national security, and many of those \nprovisions will help our allies around the world.\n  Among the most important are provisions that would help make it \npossible to close the facility at Guantanamo. As long as Guantanamo \nremains open, it doesn't protect our national security. It serves as a \nrecruiting tool for terrorists, it needlessly siphons away critical \nnational security dollars, and discredits America's historic role as a \nglobal leader that defends human rights and the rule of law. As a \nUnited States Senator, I feel that this is not the face of America I \nwant the world to see.\n  Currently, 164 individuals remain detained at Guantanamo. Most of \nthem have been there for more than a decade. More than half--84--have \nbeen cleared for transfer to another country, but efforts to do so have \nstalled largely due to irrationally onerous restrictions imposed by \nCongress. These unnecessary and counterproductive hurdles have made it \nall but impossible to close Guantanamo, and they have also severely \ndamaged our credibility when we criticize other governments for their \nuse of indefinite detention. We used to be able to do that. Now they \nlook at us and say: How can you speak?\n  Provisions in the 2014 NDAA would ease these restrictions. While they \nare incremental, they would streamline procedures for transferring \ndetainees to other countries, and, where appropriate, allow them to be \ntransferred to the United States for trial or detention. These are \ncommon sense changes and they are necessary if we are serious about \nputting an end to what I believe is an ugly chapter in our history.\n  There are some who will come to the floor of this Chamber over the \nnext several days to tell us how dangerous and irresponsible it would \nbe to close Guantanamo. I would answer that the facts are simply not \nwith them. The bottom line is that Guantanamo hurts us; it does not \nhelp us.\n  Guantanamo does not make us safer. We are all committed--all of us in \nthis body--to protecting the national security of the United States and \nthe American people, but Guantanamo undermines those efforts. Our \nnational security and military leaders have concluded that keeping \nGuantanamo open is itself a risk to our national security.\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nThe facility continues to serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists. \nIt weakens our alliances with key international partners.\n  Guantanamo does not hold terrorists accountable. The military \ncommission system for trying these detainees does not work. Federal \ncourts have recently overturned two Guantanamo convictions in opinions \nthat will actually prevent the military commission prosecutors from \nbringing conspiracy and material charges against detainees--a fact \nacknowledged by the lead military prosecutor at Guantanamo.\n  These charges, however, can be pursued in Federal courts where our \nprosecutors have a strong track record of obtaining long prison \nsentences against those who seek to do us harm. Since \n9/11, Federal courts have convicted more than 500 terrorism-related \nsuspects, and they remain securely behind bars.\n  Guantanamo is also diverting scarce resources from critical national \nsecurity efforts at a time when the Department of Defense faces deep \nand ongoing cuts. Most Americans would be surprised to know how much it \ncosts to maintain Guantanamo. It costs about $450 million a year to \nhouse 164 individuals. That means we are spending about $2.7 million \nper detainee every year--every year--year in, year out, and some have \nbeen there for more than a decade.\n\n  In Federal prisons, it costs less than $80,000 a year to hold an \nindividual, compared to $2.7 million at Guantanamo. So $80,000 at our \nmost secure Federal prisons, which have housed hundreds of convicted \nterrorists for decades. There has never been an escape. And, despite \nthe fact the Pentagon rejected a request earlier this year to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars to overhaul the aging compound, House \nRepublicans included this spending in their version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  We can't get money for school lunches for our children, we can't get \nmoney for the Women, Infants, and Children Program, but we can continue \nto spend hundreds of millions of dollars more for Guantanamo. Our \npriorities as Americans are upside down.\n  The money squandered on this long-failed experiment would be better \nserved helping disabled veterans returning home from war and soldiers \npreparing to defend our Nation in the future. We don't have enough \nmoney to do that, but we have enough money to keep Guantanamo open. \nCome on. This waste must end.\n  Guantanamo has undermined our reputation as a champion of human \nrights. Countries that respect the rule of law and human rights do not \nlock away prisoners indefinitely without charge or trial. We condemn \nauthoritarian states that carry out such practices and we should not \ntolerate them ourselves, even for our worst enemies. We are a better \npeople than that.\n  The status quo at Guantanamo is untenable and I appreciate President \nObama's renewed vow to shutter this unnecessary, expensive, and \ncounterproductive prison. But in order for the President's plan to be \nsuccessful, Congress has to do its part.\n  We have to pass common sense provisions in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I thank Senator Levin for his leadership on this \nissue as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I stand \nsolidly with Senators Feinstein, Durbin, and others who have long \nrecognized that it is in our national security interest to close \nGuantanamo. It is the fiscally responsible thing to do, it is the \nmorally responsible thing to do, and, above all, it will actually make \nour country safer.\n  For over a decade, the indefinite detention of prisoners at \nGuantanamo has contradicted our most basic principles of justice, \ndegraded our international standing, and harmed our national security. \nIt is shameful we are still debating this issue. The status quo is \nunacceptable. Close Guantanamo.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8026-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the Drug Quality and Security Act, H.R. 3204. Getting this \nbill to where it is today--and I thank the leader for just making that \npossible, along with our minority leader--has been a long and sometimes \nvery difficult road, one on which I have been working for over a \ndecade--yes, 10 years.\n  This is an issue that hit far too close to home in Kansas. Several \nyears ago, a pharmacist in Kansas City, Robert Courtney, was found to \nbe diluting cancer drugs for his patients. Unfortunately, over 4,000 \npatients were affected before authorities could stop him. Senator Kit \nBond at that time and myself worked together to hold the first Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on pharmacy \ncompounding.\n  Since that time I have continued my interest in the compounding-\nrelated issues. Unfortunately, last September, over a year ago, the \ntragic meningitis outbreak began. This outbreak was the result of \ncontaminated compounded medications produced by the New England \nCompounding Center.\n  Of the 751 people who became ill, 64 people lost their lives. Many of \nthose who became ill are still suffering and have experienced painful \nrelapses in their condition. Unfortunately, that is not the only \noccurrence in the last 10 years. Without proper safeguards and clear \nauthority, I fear that these tragedies would only continue.\n  We acknowledged then that we had to buckle down and really get \nsomething done. Since that time, I have been working with my colleagues \nto draft the pending legislation before this body, the Drug Quality and \nSecurity Act, with the desire to protect patients and improve \nregulation of the pharmacy compounding industry.\n  I think that we have finally achieved what we all intended from the \nbeginning, which is a bipartisan, bicameral product that is supported \nby a majority of the stakeholder groups and a variety of those groups. \nThis legislation has the support of the pharmacists led by the National \nCommunity Pharmacists Association and the American Pharmacists \nAssociation. It has the support of the patient advocacy groups such as \nthe Cancer Leadership Council and of industry groups such as the \nPharmaceutical Distribution Security Alliance. In fact, this is quite a \nlong list. I will not take the Senate's time to go over that list. But \nI would ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record \nat this point in its entirety.\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Supporters of H.R. 3204--Drug Quality and Security Act\n\n       Abbvie (PDSA), Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Actavis \n     (PDSA), Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics, \n     American Medical Student Association, American Pharmacists \n     Association, American Public Health Association, American \n     Society for Radiation Oncology (CLC), American Society for \n     Reproductive Medicine, American Society of Clinical Oncology \n     (CLC), American Society of Health System Pharmacists, \n     American Women's Medical Association, AmerisourceBergen \n     (PDSA), Annie Appleseed Foundation.\n       Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, \n     AstraZeneca (PDSA), Bayer (PDSA), Biotechnology Industry \n     Organization (PDSA), Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (CLC), \n     Blue Ribbon Advocacy Alliance, Boehringer Ingelheim (PDSA), \n     Cancer Action Network (CLC), Cancer Leadership Council (CLC), \n     Cancer Support Community (CLC), CancerCare (CLC), CAPS--\n     Central Admixture Pharmacy Services, Cardinal Health, \n     Caregiver Action Network.\n       Center for Medical Consumers, Center for Science and \n     Democracy, Union of Concerned Scientists, Chamber of Commerce \n     of the United States of America, The Children's Cause for \n     Cancer Advocacy (CLC), Community Catalyst, Connecticut Center \n     for Patient Safety, Covectra, CreakyJoints.org, DSC/HC \n     (PDSA), EMD Serono, Federation of American Hospitals, Fight \n     Colorectal Cancer (CLC), Friends of Cancer Research, Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PDSA).\n       Genentech (PDSA), Global Healthy Living Foundation, Grifols \n     (PDSA), Healthcare Distribution Management Association (Big \n     Drug Wholesalers) (PDSA), HIDA (PDSA), Institute for Nurse \n     Practitioner Excellence, International Myeloma Foundation \n     (CLC), International Warehouse Logistics Association (PDSA), \n     Johnson and Johnson (PDSA), Kidney Cancer Association (CLC), \n     Eli Lilly (PDSA), The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (CLC), \n     LIVESTRONG Foundation (CLC).\n       Lymphoma Research Foundation (CLC), McKesson Corporation, \n     MD Support, Medline (PDSA), Men's Health Network, Merck \n     (PDSA), Mylan (PDSA), National Association of Chain Drug \n     Stores (PDSA), National Association of County and City Health \n     Officials, National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (CLC), \n     National Community Pharmacists Association (PDSA), National \n     Lung Cancer Partnership (CLC).\n       National Patient Advocate Foundation (CLC), North American \n     Menopause Society, Novartis (PDSA), Ovarian Cancer National \n     Alliance (CLC), Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (CLC), \n     Perrigo (PDSA), Pfizer (PDSA), Pharmaceutical Distribution \n     Security Alliance, Pharmedium, PhRMA (PDSA), Premier \n     Healthcare Alliance, Prevent Cancer Foundation (CLC), \n     Prostate Cancer Education and Support Network (CLC), Richie's \n     Specialty Pharmacy, Sarcoma Foundation of America (CLC), \n     Society for Women's Health Research, StopAfib.org, Susan G. \n     Komen Advocacy Alliance (CLC), Takeda (PDSA), Tennessee \n     Pharmacists Association, Terri Lewis, Meningitis Outbreak FB \n     Community Manager, The Pew Charitable Trusts, Trust for \n     America's Health, UPS (PDSA), Us TOO International (CLC), \n     Walgreens (PDSA).\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Title I of the Drug Quality and Security Act addresses \nthe oversight of compounding pharmacies, and Title II provides a \nmechanism for securing our pharmaceutical drug supply chain. Together, \nwe are making patients safer and ensuring that they can better trust \nthe drugs that they take.\n  This took a significant amount of time and effort. I especially thank \nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, Senators Burr, Bennett, and \nFranken for sticking with it. This is a true bipartisan effort. \nPersonally, I thank my staffer Jennifer Boyer for her determined \ndedication and the many hours of work to get this job done.\n  In September, with the leadership of Mr. Upton and Mr. Waxman in the \nother body, this legislation was passed by the House by a voice vote. I \nam hoping we can see a similar outcome in the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and encourage its swift passage \nand the signature by the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the Drug \nQuality and Security Act. This legislation does two things. First, it \nimproves the regulation of compounding pharmacies, and second, it \nstrengthens the security of our drug supply chain. This legislation has \nbeen in the works for quite a while and I am so pleased that the HELP \nCommittee came together on a bipartisan basis and put together \nlegislation that will truly save lives--across the country and in my \nhome State of Maryland.\n  This bill has been through regular order. We had multiple hearings in \nthe HELP committee, we had working groups, of which I was a member, and \nwe held a bipartisan markup. Our counterparts in the House did the \nsame. And here we are today. This bill has passed the House and it is \nmy hope that it will pass the Senate and be signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  Let me first talk about the Compounding Quality Title of the bill and \nwhy it is so important. Last year, our Nation was devastated by a \nmeningitis outbreak that sickened 751 people and killed 64 people. In \nMaryland, 26 people fell ill and 3 people died. As the HELP Committee \nlooked into this outbreak, we quickly learned two things. First, these \nillnesses and deaths were caused by contaminated compounded drugs from \nthe New England Compounding Center, NECC, located in Massachusetts. And \nsecond, these illnesses and deaths were entirely preventable.\n  Hospitals, doctors, and patients are increasingly relying upon \ncompounded drugs, which are supposed to be made on an individual basis \nto respond to a patient's unique health needs. For instance, if a \npatient is allergic to a certain ingredient in a drug, a compounding \npharmacy can make the drug without that ingredient. Or if a child needs \na smaller dosage strength, a compounding pharmacy can do that. Today, 1 \nto 3 percent of the U.S. prescription drug market is made up of \ncompounded drugs.\n  But the problem we have is twofold. The first problem is that where \nthere is need, there is greed. Compounded drugs are supposed to be made \non an individual basis for an individual patient and provided only with \na prescription from a doctor. What the HELP Committee learned was that \ncertain compounding facilities were blatantly and flagrantly violating \nthese rules. Not only was NECC mass producing drugs and dispensing them \nacross State lines without prescriptions, NECC also knowingly \ndisregarded sterility tests and prepared drugs in unsanitary \nconditions. And why? To make a profit.\n  The second problem is that our existing regulatory framework is \ninsufficient. NECC made drugs in unsanitary conditions, mass produced \ndrugs, and provided medicines without prescriptions. And our regulatory \nframework was ill-designed to catch problems and prevent the outbreak.\n  We cannot undo the tragedy caused by NECC's actions, but we can and \nmust find a way to prevent this from happening again, and that is where \nthis legislation comes into play. The bill before us makes two major \nchanges, which will help prevent another NECC-like tragedy. First, it \ngives the FDA the authority to regulate large-scale compounding \npharmacies. Compounders who wish to make large volumes of these drugs \nwill be regulated by FDA, will be required to register with FDA, will \nbe required to report adverse events to FDA, and will be subject to \nrisk-based inspections by FDA. Smaller traditional compounding \npharmacies will continue to be regulated by State boards of pharmacy.\n  Second, this legislation will ensure that patients and providers have \nbetter information about compounded drugs. The FDA will post online a \nlist of compounding facilities they regulate, detailed labeling will be \nrequired on compounded drugs, and false and misleading advertising will \nbe prohibited.\n  Let me now talk about the Drug Supply Chain Security Title of the \nbill. This deals with all drugs, not just compounded drugs. Today, we \nhave a patchwork of 50 different State laws that govern drug \ndistribution in our 50 different States. What this means is that if we \nbecome aware of a contaminated drug in our supply chain, there is no \nuniform way to track that drug back to its source and get it off the \nmarket quickly.\n  This bill will improve patient safety by replacing today's patchwork \nof product tracing laws with a strong, uniform standard that will \nultimately lead to an electronic, interoperable product tracing system \nfor the entire country. This is commonsense legislation that has been \nlong in the making.\n  These issues are particularly important to me, not only because \nensuring the safety of our Nation's drug supply is of the utmost \nimportance but also because I have the distinct honor of representing \nMaryland, which is home to the FDA.\n  The FDA is our Federal agency tasked with ensuring the safety of our\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nNation's drugs, through the more than 14,000 dedicated, talented, \nhardworking employees who work there. Fifty-five percent of FDA's \nemployees were furloughed during the recent government shutdown. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues why the \nwork that the FDA does is so important. If we want our drugs to be \nsafe, if we want our food to be safe, if we want our medical devices to \nbe safe, we cannot furlough our FDA staff and we cannot pursue cuts to \nFDA in coming years.\n  This bill was done the right way. We had hearings, markups, and \nworking groups in both the House and Senate and we had input from both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I want to thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking \nMember Alexander for all of their work to get us here. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, which will improve drug safety and \nsave lives.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it has now been about 1 year since the \nfungal meningitis outbreak last fall associated with the tainted \nsterile compounded drugs from the New England Compounding Center. This \nweek on the floor of the Senate, we have a bill that is, in many \nsenses, Congress's response to the lack of policy clarity that many \nhave suggested failed to prevent that tragedy.\n  As I have watched the Senators and their staff who have been working \non this bill over the past several months, I applaud the bipartisan \nmanner they have used in creating legislation that could help prevent \nsimilar tragedies in the future.\n  I am planning on voting for this legislation because I do think \nCongress needs to legislate. The courts have not been clear. However, I \nwant to note that, despite the strong bipartisan collaboration, this \nlegislation leaves some regulatory oversight concerns outstanding that \nI want to comment on and make clear today.\n  There has been a lot of concern that by reaffirming section 503(a) of \nthe Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, office use of compounded drugs is not \nrecognized as permissible compounding activity. Therefore, I want to \nmake clear that this legislation does not change current State law or \nauthority over the dispensing or distribution of medications by \npharmacists, compounded or manufactured, for a prescriber's \nadministration to or treatment of a patient within their practice.\n  Currently, the compounding and dispensing of prescription drugs for \nin-office administration by a prescriber to their patient is governed \nby State boards of pharmacy, and States have determined what is best \nfor their State regarding office use. In fact, more than 40 States have \npassed laws over the last 15 years related to current practices of \nusing compounded drugs in the office context.\n  The issue of office use, indeed all of pharmacy practice regulation, \nis best left to the States. So the omission of office use from 503(a) \nshould not signal to the FDA that it has the authority to encroach upon \nState authority to regulate office use.\n  In addition, there have been concerns whether the provisions within \nthe legislation that grant authority to the FDA to set up systems of \nprocedure for the direct communication between State boards of pharmacy \nand the FDA will give FDA more authority over compounded prescriptions \nshipped across State lines. I want to also take this opportunity to \nmake clear that these provisions within the legislation require \n``appropriate investigation'' on complaints and other issues that arise \nby the FDA and in no way provide some new expansive authority to the \nFDA to restrict interstate commerce or regulate intrastate commerce.\n  Finally, the legislation does not change the ability of \nophthalmologists to administer drugs in their office to individual \npatients for the purposes of reducing macular degeneration. Under this \nlegislation, physicians retain the ability to use compounding drugs in \ntheir office for their patients. This is a practice-of-medicine issue, \nso the art and science of medicine should not be impeded by the FDA.\n  I will continue to monitor the implementation of section 503(A) in \nconsultation with physicians, medical professionals, and pharmacy \nprofessionals. I also strongly encourage the FDA to ensure that these \nprovisions are not used to restrict office use and restrict interstate \nsales of compounded pharmaceuticals within all applicable laws and \nregulations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8029-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to the floor again to try to \nachieve what I think is a very simple and straightforward but important \nobjective: to get a clear up-or-down vote on a pure disclosure proposal \nI have. This proposal would say that the elections all of us make as \nMembers of the Senate and all of the House Members make with regard to \nhow our offices go to the ObamaCare exchange as mandated by statute do \nnot go through this end runaround of the OPM rule. That is simply \npublic information. How each office handles the situation is public \ninformation.\n  Whatever we believe about the Washington exemption from ObamaCare, \nwhatever we believe about that debate and that exemption and that \nsubsidy, it should be a no-brainer, not partisan debate, how each of us \nand how each of our offices handle whether this election is public \ninformation. Right now it is not. A lot of Members, including me, have \nexplained what they are doing, but certainly not all have, and that is \nnot public information. This amendment which I am proposing would \nsimply produce full disclosure and have that be public information.\n  I am open to any way to get a clear vote on that this calendar year, \nso I am completely flexible on how that happens--on this bill before \nus--and I would certainly like to expedite consideration and passage of \nthis bill; or an amendment on the Defense bill next week--that would be \nanother possibility; or a quick debate on my freestanding bill--that \nwould be a third possibility. None of those would take significant time \nin the Senate. In fact, all of those would expedite Senate business, \nincluding leading to the passage of the bill now on the Senate floor \nright now, today. So it would actually expedite the process and \nexpedite consideration.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 2024 be called up, that a Democratic side-by-side amendment be in \norder to be called up, and that those be the only amendments in order \nother than those currently pending; that both those amendments be \nsubject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption; I further ask \nthat there be a total of 2 hours of debate equally divided on both \namendments and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the Democratic amendment, followed by a \nvote on my amendment; that following the disposition of the amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have made statements over \nthe past many weeks about why I object to this. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor, again I am open to \nany reasonable way to get a simple\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nvote on a pure disclosure provision anytime this calendar year. In that \nspirit, I have an alternative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 3204, the compounding bill, be yielded back; that the \nSenate proceed to H.R. 3204; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed right now and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table; I further ask that the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1197, the Defense authorization bill; that my \namendment which is at the desk be called up and that a Democratic side-\nby-side amendment be in order to be called up; that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, those amendments remain in order and that both amendments be \nsubject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Louisiana \nhas been holding up things in the Senate for weeks. What he has now \nrequested of the Senate is that every other Senator take second fiddle \nto him. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, again, I am open to any reasonable path \nforward that would produce this one, simple, straightforward vote on \npure disclosure, information that I think should clearly be public \ninformation. So as a third alternative, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 1629 and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; I further ask consent that there be 60 minutes \nof debate divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote \non passage of the bill; and that a 60-affirmative vote threshold be \nrequired for passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor and wrapping up, I \ncontinue to find that very unfortunate and, frankly, really \nunreasonable. We, each of us as Members of the Senate, made an \nimportant election about how to handle this ObamaCare exemption issue. \nSome folks have classified a good part of their staff as not official \nstaff--magic wand, somehow. They work here, they get a paycheck, they \nare on government property, they do official business, but they are not \nofficial staff. This is a charade, and at a minimum I think the public \nshould know how each office and each Member is handling that situation. \nThat is the only thing my disclosure proposals, which I have been \nasking for a vote on, would require. That is the only thing I am asking \nfor a vote on this calendar year. I think offering these three \nunanimous consent routes to that is very reasonable and would also \nexpedite consideration of many other matters, including the bill on the \nSenate floor right now. It is unfortunate that that reasonable route \nforward was not chosen and blocked in multiple ways, but I will \ncertainly continue pursuing this important objective.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Madam President, I think the President did the right \nthing today. The whole idea of health insurance reform was to get \npeople into health insurance that do not have health insurance. The \nidea was not for those who had insurance, unless they wanted to improve \nthat insurance or they did not have the insurance they needed.\n  The idea, certainly, was not that if they had insurance they were \nsatisfied with, that they were not going to be able to keep that. That \nis what the President had said. That is what the President reaffirmed \ntoday. I think the President did the right thing.\n  Insurance is a very complicated subject. In all that we are hearing \nabout in the setting up of those different health insurance exchanges \nin each of the States, you are creating a new pool of people, both \nyoung and old, both sick and healthy, and you spread that health risk \nover a larger number of people. If it is a typical population of young \nand old, not just all old, and not just all sick, the more you can \nspread that health risk over an average population, the more you can \nbring down the cost of that health insurance. That is basically the \nprinciple of health insurance.\n  So, unless we can get the young and healthy people who need health \ninsurance--by the way, they may think they are invincible, but they may \nalso have an accident. Instead of them ending up in the emergency room \nat the time that they have the accident, or when they really get sick \nand they do not have health insurance, and they do not pay--guess who \npays. All the rest of us pay in our health insurance premiums.\n  So the whole idea is to reform this by getting as many of the 45 \nmillion people that do not have health insurance into the health \ninsurance system. That is what these 50 State insurance exchanges are \ndesigned to be. So the issue today did not directly affect that, but \nfor the fact that if those who have health insurance, and they say that \nthey are happy with it, but they are really not because it is a subpar \nhealth insurance policy--I call them dog policies. If they realize they \nhave a dog policy, then they see what they can really get in the \nexchange in a comprehensive policy that will cover maternity and all of \nthe other things, on top of the guarantees that an insurance company \ncannot cancel them, on top of the guarantees that if they had a \npreexisting condition, their insurance is not only not going to be \ncanceled but that they will, in fact, be able to get insurance.\n  What I have described--guess what it is. It is the Affordable Care \nAct. It is the ability to have health insurance when a big part of our \npopulation--45 million people in this country--has not been able to \nhave it.\n  The narrow little issue addressed today by the President was that \nsome people have health insurance that they like. They ought to be able \nto keep it. Some people who have health insurance don't realize how \nmuch better it could be with much more comprehensive coverage. Once \nthey see the difference, those folks who the President said today can \nkeep those subpar policies are going to want to go into the health \ninsurance exchange. That is what this is all about.\n  Unfortunately, this has become all balled up in politics. It is a \ncomplicated subject. Most of us don't even want to think about it. We \nwant to leave it to our insurance agent, someone who is skilled.\n  Now, as we are making our own individual choices, which we are able \nto do by going on a Web site and designing a policy for ourselves, we \nare empowering ourselves to have the health care coverage we want. In \nthe meantime, we have a lot of turmoil, a lot of strife, and a lot of \npolitics.\n  Give it some time. And this is a former insurance commissioner \nspeaking, and I know most of the tricks the insurance companies will \npull. But give it some time. Down the road, with the insurance \ncompanies I have seen, as I have talked with the CEOs, they want to \ncooperate because they realize this is good for their business as well \nbecause now they will be able to offer so\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nmany more policies to people who, in fact, do need that health \ncoverage. Give it a little time. It is going to work. There will be a \nfew twists and turns. We are not going to get rid of the politics \nbecause it is the nature of the beast these day, but give it a little \ntime and it will all work out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an \namendment I plan to introduce to the National Defense Authorization Act \nnext week. This is an amendment known as the bipartisan Military \nJustice Improvement Act.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their leadership \nin this effort. As we have said from the beginning, this is not a \nDemocrat nor a Republican idea. It is good, plain old common sense. It \nis the right idea necessary to protect the men and women who fight for \nour country and our values in uniform every single day. So I thank the \nbroad coalition of supporters for their leadership--former generals and \ncommanders, veterans, advocates--who are making their voices heard so \nthat they know these horrible crimes aren't going to happen to someone \nelse; that the justice system we build is one of which they are \ndeserving. They are urging Congress to use its responsibility of \noversight and accountability, to use their role head-on, by finally \ncreating an independent military justice system which gives survivors \nof these horrific acts of violence a fair shot at justice--a system \nfree of inherent bias and conflicts of interest that currently exists \nwithin the chain of command, that will enable survivors to come forward \nand to hold their perpetrators accountable.\n  The strong and growing bipartisan coalition of Senators, survivors, \nveterans, retired generals, commanding officers, and advocates is \nshowing this is not only free from partisan politics and ideology, but \nit is a promilitary piece of legislation which actually strengthens our \nmilitary readiness, strengthens unit cohesion, and strengthens good \norder and discipline.\n  This week began with all Americans saluting our veterans, honoring \nour solemn commitment to the brave men and women who join the Armed \nServices for all the right reasons: To serve our country, defend all \nthat we hold sacred, and make America's military the best the world has \never known.\n  These men and women put everything on the line to defend our country. \nEach time they are called to serve, they answer that call. But too \noften these brave men and women find themselves in the fight of their \nlives--not on some foreign battlefield in another place against an \nunknown enemy but within their own ranks, on this soil, among men and \nwomen with whom they serve. They are victims of horrific acts of sexual \nviolence.\n  Sexual assault in the military is not new, but it has been allowed to \nfester. It has been festering in the shadows for far too long, and when \nour commanders for the past 25 years have said there is zero tolerance \nfor sexual assault in the military, what they really meant was there is \nzero accountability--and that is the problem we are facing--going back \nto the Secretary of Defense under Dick Cheney in 1992. He uttered those \nwords: ``Zero accountability.'' Every Secretary of Defense has since \nthat time said ``zero accountability.'' But our system of justice in \nthe military is broken, and our commanders are the ones who hold all \nthe cards about whether these cases can go forward.\n  There are those who argue that moving these decisions to independent \nmilitary prosecutors will somehow undermine good order and discipline. \nIf you had 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, rape, and assault \nin the military last year alone, you do not have good order and \ndiscipline.\n  Our allies with whom we fight side by side in every conflict--Israel, \nthe UK, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany--have all already \nmade this decision to say serious crimes deserve the objective review \nof trained military prosecutors. They should not rest in the chain of \ncommand. They should not rest where bias is possible, where conflicts \nof interest are rampant. It should not be there because the scales of \njustice are blind. That is the whole point of the American justice \nsystem: Blind justice. Not tipped for the defendant, not tipped for the \nvictim. Blind, objective.\n  We have a Defense Department panel that is actually taking up \nevidence on this issue. They had a hearing. They asked members from our \nallies to come and testify about when they made this change. When you \ntook this decisionmaking out of the chain of command, what happened? \nDid you have a falling off of good order and discipline? They testified \nno. The director-general of the Australian Defense Force Legal Service, \nPaul Cronin, said that Australia had faced the same set of arguments \nfrom their military leaders in the past.\n\n       It's a bit like when we opened up to gays in the military \n     in the late 1980s. There was a lot of concern at the time \n     that there would be issues, but not surprisingly there \n     haven't been any.\n\n  There are those who argue that somehow our commanders would no longer \nbe accountable. Let me be clear about this. There is nothing in this \nbill that takes commanders off the hook. They are still responsible, \nsolely responsible, for maintaining good order and discipline, for \nsetting the command climate, for saying these rapes are not going to \nhappen on my watch and, if they do, victims can come forward and know \nthey will be protected. They are responsible for making sure there is \nno retaliation.\n  But you know what. Last year alone, of those 3,000 brave survivors \nwho did come forward and report what happened to them, 62 percent were \nretaliated against--62 percent. That means those command climates \nfailed to protect victims telling their commanders I have been raped; I \nhave been sexually assaulted; I have been brutalized, and justice has \nto be done.\n  What does retaliation look like? Commanders saying things such as: It \nis your own fault; you are to blame; you are the problem. If you report \nthis crime, I am going to write you up on drinking or adultery. Do you \nreally want your military career to end?\n  For so many victims, that is what happened; they are forced out of \nthe military. All they want to do is serve our country, some of our \nbest and brightest. We are losing them because justice is impossible \nfor them.\n  Some opponents say this reform will cost too much money. One estimate \nis that if you had enough lawyers to do all this legal work, it might \ncost you $113 million, $4,000 a victim. That is an absurd argument. Are \nyou really telling me it costs too much to prosecute rapists in the \nmilitary? Are you really telling me it costs too much to have enough \nlawyers to take these cases to trial? Are you really telling me it \ncosts too much to have a criminal justice system that honors the men \nand women who serve in this military? You cannot possibly be saying \nthat. You cannot possibly be saying that.\n  It is also an argument that makes no sense. Do you know how much it \ncosts our military to have 26,000 sexual assaults, rapes, and unwanted \nsexual contacts every year in our military? Do you know what that \ncosts? The RAND Corporation actually did an estimate. They said having \nthis kind of rampant sexual assault, rape in our military, cost the \nmilitary--because they lose so many of these good men and women there \nhave to be new people retrained--$3.6 billion last year alone. That is \nthe cost. That is a cost we should not be willing to pay.\n  Last argument. Our opponents say that commanders will actually move\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nmore cases forward that prosecutors wouldn't. That is not true because, \nagain, if you have 23,000 cases that are not being reported and you \ncreate an objective criminal justice system, you are going to have more \nreporting. With more reporting, you are going to have more cases going \nto trial, many more cases than any argument that there might be an \naggressive commander here or there. Many more cases will go to trial \nand end in conviction if you create an objective system.\n  Every single year the DOD does estimates; they estimate what is \nactually the incident rate of sexual assault in the military. Last year \nthey had confidential surveys men and women filled out. Based on that \nconfidential survey, they estimated there were 26,000 cases last year \nalone, sexual assault, rape, unwanted sexual contact. Of that number, \nonly 2,558--that is the 1 in 10--sought justice by filing unrestricted \nreports. Of those 2,500 cases, 300 went to trial. So you are really \ntalking about 1 in 100 cases end in justice. That is an abysmal record. \nWe owe so much more to the men and women who serve in our military, so \nmuch more to those who will even die for this country. A chain of \ncommand oriented system that produces only 302 convictions of 2,558 \nactionable reports is simply not holding enough alleged assailants \naccountable under any standard. One in one hundred cases ending in \nconviction is not good enough under any standard.\n  Further, an independent system will protect not just the rights of \nthe victim but an accused who may well be innocent, because when a \ncommander is the only decisionmaker and they may know the victim and \nthey may know the perpetrator or the accused and they have a reason to \ndeal with this case in a way that is reflective of his or her bias, \nwhat you are creating is an unjust system. Justice must be blind.\n  I have not come to this conclusion for this fundamentally needed \nreform lightly. But if you listen to the survivors, if you listen to \nwhat happened to them, where the breach in the system is, where the \nfailure of trust occurred, there is no possible reform that does not \ninclude taking it out of the chain of command.\n  What I would like to do, as my colleague Senator Grassley has just \njoined me on the floor--Senator Grassley is one of our greatest \nchampions on this bill. He has looked at this problem from the \nperspective of common sense. He has looked at this problem and said you \ncannot possibly have a system rife with bias and conflicts of interest \nand expect justice will be done. I am going to yield to my colleague \nwhen he is ready. He wants to address another issue.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Webster's dictionary defines the word \nsuccess as ``the correct or desired result of an attempt.'' I want to \ndiscuss the definition of the word success as we consider the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  On the day the bill was signed into law, President Obama said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Today we are affirming that essential truth, a truth every \n     generation is called to discover for itself, that we are not \n     a nation that scales back its aspirations.\n\n  Such grand words for where we are today on that piece of legislation. \nToday the success of the law that now bears his name, ObamaCare, is \ndefined in much more meager terms. Today success is when the folks at \nHealth and Human Services got up this morning, ObamaCare had not shut \ndown, and when the folks at HHS go to sleep tonight, their day will \nhave been a success if ObamaCare did not have to shut down.\n  Think of all that, think of all that we have been through to this \npoint after 4 years, the fight over the bill and the extreme \nlegislative means used to pass it through Congress. Then think about \nthe 2010 and 2012 elections. Think about the Supreme Court decision \nthat effectively repealed half of the law's coverage. Think of all the \nchanges made to the law through regulation to make sure ObamaCare \nlaunched. Think of the postponing of the employer mandate. Think of the \npostponing of lifetime limits. Think of the impact this law has had on \nour economy. It has had quite an impact on the economy--people losing \njobs, people losing health insurance they currently have, because if \nyou like what you have you may not be able to keep it. Let's talk about \nthat issue for a minute.\n  ``If you like what you have, you can keep it'' was the promise the \nPresident made to the American people on at least 36 separate \noccasions. It is a great sound bite. It is easy to say. It rolls easily \noff the tongue.\n  It is also not true. It was never true. It was obviously not true \nwhen the law was written. It was obviously not true when the first \nproposed regulation came out. This is what I said on the Senate floor \nSeptember 2010. Quoting myself:\n\n       Only in the District of Columbia could you get away with \n     telling the people if you like what you have you can keep it, \n     and then pass regulations 6 months later that do just the \n     opposite and figure that people are going to ignore it.\n\n  It is not that I have some magic crystal ball. Simple--we all knew \nit. The administration certainly knew the day would come when millions \nof people would receive cancellation notices of their insurance policy. \nNow my constituents clearly know it. I have heard from many Iowans who \nfound out the hard way that the President made a bunch of pie-in-the-\nsky promises that he knew he couldn't keep, constituents such as this \none from Perry, IA, saying:\n\n       My husband and I are farmers. For 9 years now we have \n     bought our own policy. To keep the costs affordable our plan \n     is a major medical plan with a very high deductible. We \n     recently received our letters that the plan was going away.\n       Effective January 1, 2014, it will be updated to comply \n     with the mandates of ObamaCare. To manage the risk of much \n     higher premiums, our insurance company is asking us to cancel \n     our current policy and sign on to a higher rate effective \n     December 1, 2013 or we could go to the government exchange.\n       We did not keep our current policy. We did not get to keep \n     our lower rates. I now have to pay for coverage that I do not \n     want or will never use. We are not low-income people that \n     might qualify for assistance. We are the small business owner \n     that is trying to live the American dream. I do not believe \n     in large government that wants to run my life.\n\n  Or a constituent living in Mason City, IA:\n\n       My wife and I are both 60 years old and I have been covered \n     by an excellent Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy for \n     several years. It is not through my employer. We selected the \n     plan because it had the features we wanted and needed . . . \n     our choice. And because we are healthy we have a preferred \n     premium rate. Yesterday we got a call from our agent \n     explaining that since our plan is not grandfathered, it will \n     need to be replaced at the end of 2014. The current plan has \n     a $5,000 deductible and the premium is $511 per month. The \n     best option going forward for us from Wellmark would cost \n     $955 per month--a modest 87 percent increase--and have a \n     $10,000 deductible.\n       And because we have been diligent and responsible in saving \n     for our upcoming retirement, we do not qualify for any \n     taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\n  These are just two of many letters, emails, and phone calls I have \nreceived from Iowans. Thousands have contacted me asking what can be \ndone now that we clearly see that what the President sold the American \npeople was a bag of Washington's best gift-wrapped hot air.\n  I ask the President, I ask my colleagues here in the Senate, to look \nat all we have been through as a country, all the grandiose talk about \nthe importance of this statute, and what we ultimately have is an \noptional Medicaid expansion with a glorified high-risk pool and a \ngovernment portal that makes the DMV look efficient.\n  Americans deserve better. They voted for better. But this \nadministration will somehow trudge ahead; keep the doors open; \nthousands of people enrolled instead of millions. They just released a \nnumber this week for the 36 States using the malfunctioning Federal \nexchange: fewer than 27,000 people. Including people who have not \nactually committed to purchase the plans--those who have put it in \ntheir shopping cart--less than 27,000 people. That is about 19 people \nper day per State. So the administration will limp along with this \npitiful signup process hoping to get people properly assigned to health \nplans.\n\n  If the assignment of individuals to plans fails miserably on January \n1, the administration will dig in and sort it out. If the risk pools \nare a disaster, the administration will use extraregulatory--by any \nmeans necessary--tools to keep this program afloat. Because for all the \ntalk of this\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\nbill being--as we saw and heard the Vice President on TV--a big \nexpletive deal, success is not defined in the desires of 2010 but in \nmaking sure ObamaCare exists in some form or fashion on January 20, \n2017.\n  We saw more of this digging in and sorting out on this very day when \nthe President spoke. Insurance companies sent 4 million cancellation \nnotices to comply with the President's law. They did it to comply with \nthe law. Let's be clear about it. In other words, these insurers read \nthe law, and then do you know what they did. They did what every \ncompany ought to do: Follow the law. Unfortunately for them, the \nPresident did what he has been doing for 3 years: He has taken out his \npencil and eraser and rewritten or delayed his law on the fly when it \nis not working.\n  So what does it now mean for insurers who were simply trying to \nfollow the law as written, as you would expect them to follow the law? \nLet me tell you what one insurance company had to say:\n\n       This means that the insurance companies have 32 days to \n     reprogram their computer system for policies, rates, and \n     eligibility, send notices to policyholders via US Mail, send \n     a very complex letter that describes just what the \n     differences are between specific policies and ObamaCare \n     compliant plans, ask the consumer for their decision--and \n     give them a reasonable time to make that decision--and then \n     enter those decisions back into their system without creating \n     massive billing, claim payments, and provider eligibility \n     list mistakes.\n\n  That was a quote from the consultant who was commenting on what the \nPresident did today by delaying or by making sure you could keep your \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So the only thing the President has accomplished with \nhis announcement today is that he is delaying his broken promise for \nanother year. I have to wonder: What will it take for him to admit his \nlaw is not working and at least call for a full delay?\n  Remember how all these big health insurance companies back in 2009 \ngot behind the President's program for nationalizing our health \ninsurance program. They put up a lot of money to sell it. Their \nlobbyists lobbied for it. What they ought to do is tell the American \npeople what a big mistake they made because they are getting stuck with \nit right now--as I just quoted from this consultant from an insurance \ncompany.\n  It is time for us to admit that ObamaCare has not achieved the \ncorrect or desired results of an attempt--in other words, the \ndefinition of success as I stated earlier in my remarks. It has not \nbeen a success by any measure, unless, of course, you lower your \nstandard to the point that the mere act of keeping the doors open is a \nsuccess. How sad is it that after all we have been through--and we have \nbeen through a lot. Maybe, just maybe, it is time to admit that the \nmassive restructuring has failed. It may be that partisanship has \nfailed. Perhaps it is time to sit down and consider commonsense, \nbipartisan steps we could take to lower costs and improve quality. \nPerhaps we could enact alternative reforms aimed at solving America's \nbiggest health care problems, such as revising the Tax Code to help \nindividuals who buy their own health insurance; allowing people to \npurchase health coverage across State lines and form risk pools in the \nindividual markets; expanding tax-free health savings accounts; making \nhealth care price and quality information more transparent; cracking \ndown on frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits; using high-risk pools \nto insure people with preexisting conditions; giving States more \nfreedom to improve Medicaid, such as Rhode Island got a few years ago \nand which seems to be a success; and using provider competition, \nconsumer choice to bring down costs in Medicare, throughout the health \ncare delivery system. The American people need to know this failed \nprogram is not the only answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for yielding to me. I forgot to say \nthat earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8033-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8033-S8035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILITARY JUSTICE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, my purpose in being here today is to \nsupport the Military Justice Improvement Act and the very urgent need \nto include its worthwhile and comprehensive provisions in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, either by way of \namendment or whatever measure may be appropriate, and to support the \nvery eloquent remarks made by the Senator from New York. She has been a \nsteadfast and strong advocate of necessary changes in the Military Code \nof Justice and has acted as chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee to approach this issue--a very \ndifficult issue--in strengthening the system of justice for our men and \nwomen in uniform with care and caution as well as vigor and bravery.\n  I know how different the views may be in this body among our \ncolleagues, and I have listened to people on both sides of this \nargument very carefully before reaching my own conclusion.\n  One statistic that strikes me as perhaps paramount in importance is \nthe gap between the number of victims, which is estimated to be close \nto 30,000, or perhaps more. We don't have a precise number, but the \nestimates from the military indicate that there are tens of thousands, \nand very likely more than 30,000. The number of reported cases is \naround 3,000, or perhaps 2,500, who have sought justice for sexual \nassault in the military. By the way, only about 300 go to trial every \nyear. At least that was the number for last year.\n  My view is that we must remove any concerns about undue command \ninfluence on the process so that more victims will seek justice. The \nonly way to deter this heinous, horrific crime is to encourage more \nreporting so there can be more prosecution and enable more deterrents \nthrough strong and swift justice. The goal is justice. The goal is not \nnecessarily punishment for its own sake but justice.\n  I have listened to my colleagues who feel that the act as written or \nas amended should keep prosecuting authority with the commander. I have \nlistened carefully to them, and I believe their sincerity and respect \nfor victims is unquestionable. This is not about who respects victims \nor cares for them the most, it is about what system will best seek \njustice and deter the epidemic--the spreading numbers of these horrific \ncrimes.\n  I have also listened to military professionals who have come before \nSenator Gillibrand's subcommittee, as well as the committee as a whole. \nI have questioned them repeatedly in public and in private, and I am \nconvinced beyond any doubt that they are as outraged and find this \ncrime as abhorrent and antithetical to their profession as anyone in \nthis body. Yet, for years and years, we have heard that the military \nhas zero tolerance. Their renewed vigor is welcomed but in my view has \nto be matched by reforms in the process which will make sure that that \ncommitment is real and realized in real life.\n  Most importantly, I have listened to the victims who have come, both \npublicly and privately, to the Armed Services Committee, where I serve, \nand have told their stories. They have told their stories also in \nwriting and in documentaries, such as ``The Invisible War''--a very \npowerful and compelling argument for reform.\n  I have listened to them as they have expressed to me that what \nmatters to them is the fear of retaliation and adverse effect on their \ncareers from the present structure of prosecuting authority. I believe \nthat prosecuting authority should be made the responsibility of an \nindependent, experienced, objective, and trained professional.\n  I recognize and I understand that there is immense power in the \npresent system given to any commander who sends men and women under his \npower potentially to give their lives for their country. Their argument \nand feeling is that they should hold the same power over punishment for \ncrimes that those men and women may commit under their command.\n  Good order and discipline, I recognize, is a profoundly important \ngoal, and a paramount, irreplaceable, and\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nundeniable goal. Good order and discipline is hardly well served by \nacts of sexual assault in the military, which is why those \nprofessionals say they have zero tolerance for this heinous crime. I \nhave listened to them about why they feel the present system should be \ncontinued.\n  We need a military justice system that works as well in Camp \nLeatherneck as it does in Camp Pendleton or Camp Lejeune, and we need a \njustice system that works well not just in one season or another, \npolitically, but in all seasons at all times for all men and women. I \nthink the approach best suited to reach that goal is the one that \nembodies legislation that has been introduced by the Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Gillibrand. Of course, in listening to all of those sources \nof insight and perspective on this issue, I have also utilized my own \nexperience as a prosecutor. I would say the most difficult decisions I \nmade as a U.S. Attorney prosecuting under Federal law, and as State \nattorney general, largely with civil authority, was whether to charge \nand what violations of law to charge, because, as a practical matter, \nthe charge can ruin a life, and often does. It can ruin a career, ruin \na family, and ruin an individual's standing in society. Even if that \nindividual is eventually found not guilty at trial, the charge stands \nforever. I found that the decision of whether to charge was often the \nmost difficult decision I had to make not only because of the \nconsequences to the individual, but the difficulty of making a decision \nabout whether a fact finder--whether a court or a jury--would conclude \nthat every element of the crime as charged was proved beyond a \nreasonable doubt. That is the responsibility of the jury or the judge, \ndepending on who is trying the case and who the fact finder is. There \nare instances where these decisions are air tight and easy, but in many \ncases, and most particularly in cases involving sexual assault, they \nare sometimes difficult to make. There is forensic evidence, there are \nmetrics, there are precise scientific measures, but there is also a \njudgment to be made about whom to believe when there are conflicting \nversions of an incident.\n\n  That is why I believe these decisions should be made by professionals \nwho have experience, who know how to prove cases, how to try them and \nhow to bring them to court, and who are capable of making decisions \nthat will not only be fair and objective but will be seen as fair and \nobjective, because in the criminal justice process often perception is \nas important as reality when it comes to a victim coming forward to put \nhis or her life on the line and complain, particularly in a system such \nas the military, but often in society in general. Sexual assault as a \ncrime in society is often underreported and underprosecuted because of \nthe fears, correctly and understandably, on the part of victims.\n  We have made progress in encouraging victims to come forward in \ncivilian life and in the military, but there is much more to be done. I \nbelieve the reforms offered by the Military Justice Improvement Act are \nimportant and essential to that goal.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act in title V has 14 specific \nrevisions to our military justice system that will help ensure a more \njust process and a more just outcome for cases involving sexual \nassault. These changes to our current system were drafted in a \nbipartisan manner that defines so often--in fact, almost uniformly--the \nwork of the Armed Services Committee under the leadership of Chairman \nLevin and Ranking Member Inhofe, and I wish to express my appreciation \nfor their leadership. Those reforms are important to ensure a crime \nvictim's rights are acknowledged under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice and that victims receive a special victims advocate, and that \nthose found guilty of sexual assault will receive a mandatory \ndischarge. These reforms, which were initially proposed by myself and \nothers, will help improve this system. They are a telling refutation of \nanyone who says, in testimony before our committee or otherwise, that \nthe UCMJ is serving its intended purpose of justice when it previously \ndealt with cases of military assault.\n  These reforms are necessary and necessary now, and I support them. \nYet, as I look at the totality of what is now contained in this bill, \nit seems insufficient. I am left with the conclusion--it is an uneasy \nconclusion but a very strong one--that we have not yet achieved what we \nneed to accomplish, namely, a system of justice that has the full \nconfidence and trust of victims and all parties, that has the \nconfidence and trust of survivors. They are indeed survivors. It is \nvital to encourage reporting of this crime and building the evidence \nthat is necessary for those trained and experienced prosecutors to \ndecide whether to pursue charges, against whom, and what kind of \ncharges.\n  I believe we can strike a balance and achieve justice and not only \nmaintain good order and discipline but, in fact, enhance them. I think, \nif this reform is adopted, future military commanders will thank the \nSenate and the Congress for enabling them to pursue what they know best \nprofessionally--what is their calling and their mission--which is to \nmake this Nation's national security and defense the best in the world, \nas it has always been. They are to be thanked, and we all thank them \nfor their commitment and their professionalism in the service of that \ngoal.\n  I am joined in supporting these reforms in the Military Justice \nImprovement Act by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \nService, which last month recommended that ``decisions to prosecute, to \ndetermine the kind of court martial to convene, to detail the judges \nand members of the court martial, and to decide the extent of the \npunishment, should be placed in the hands of military personnel with \nlegal expertise and experience and who are outside the chain of command \nof the victim and the accused.''\n\n  That is also the view of Jeh Johnson, the President's nominee to head \nthe Department of Homeland Security and former Pentagon general counsel \nwho was asked whether there are shortcomings in the military justice \nsystem, and he replied, ``I have recently come to the conclusion that \nthe answer to that question is yes.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Last year Secretary Panetta raised the initial disposition \n     authority for how these cases should be handled to the 06 \n     colonel captain level, and the problem, I believe, has become \n     so pervasive, the bad behavior is so pervasive, we need to \n     look at fundamental change in the military justice system \n     itself.\n\n  We are joined in this view also by the Vietnam Veterans of America, \nan organization that stands in favor of the Military Justice \nImprovement Act because ``far too many victims fail to report or choose \nrestricted reporting primarily for two reasons: Retaliation and total \nlack of faith in fair just treatment within the chain of command.''\n  So despite my deference to our military leaders and my respect for \nthem and my feeling that they are entitled to deference in issues that \naffect good order and discipline, I believe we have a responsibility in \nthis Congress to fix this system, to repair it and reform it, and do it \nin ways that vindicate the rights of victims, survivors, as well as the \naccused, to make sure we do justice. Our responsibility under article \nI, section 4, clause 14 of the Constitution is ``[t]o make Rules for \nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'' That is \nwhy the Uniform Code of Military Justice was adopted by Congress, and \nwe will be held rightfully responsible and accountable if we fail to \nact and make effective reforms and if we fail to put an end to sexual \nassault in the military.\n  Our military system has some of the most dedicated, our best and our \nbravest, of this generation, just as has been true in past generations. \nI am proud to say two of my sons currently serve in the military. We \nneed a system of justice that matches their excellence, that keeps \nfaith with their dedication and sense of duty, that is as fair and just \nas they are strong and capable in protecting this country. We owe our \nfreedom, we owe our own justice system in this country, and all of our \nrights and liberties to the defense they have provided decade after \ndecade, war after war, to this Nation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to come together--and I know they are working \non a bipartisan basis--to finish the work of reforming our system of \nmilitary justice. I look forward to the day of realizing a very simple \nideal--that every servicemember who is a survivor, a victim of sexual \nassault, is entitled to an independent arbiter and an objective \nprosecutor with the knowledge that the victim will be embraced and\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\nsupported by the system, and welcomed back into the ranks, even as they \nface the grueling and painful task of being involved in a prosecution. \nI look forward to the day also when any perpetrator knows, without \nquestion, that they will be separated from service and punished if they \nare found guilty. These ideals are as much engrained in our military as \nthe ideals of valor, honor, and tradition. These changes will help our \nbravest and finest members who contribute and put their lives on the \nline to reach those ideals. These changes are necessary and I look \nforward to accomplishing them, working with my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I am here because I serve on the \nconference committee that is charged with negotiating a bipartisan \nbudget deal. The Democrats have come to the table with a Senate-passed \nbudget. The Presiding Officer will remember the long all-night ordeal \nof that budget.\n  Our budget replaces the dumb and harmful sequester cuts with balanced \ndeficit reduction. If fact, you do not get much more balanced than the \nDemocratic program. It is half from spending cuts and half from closing \nloopholes in the Tax Code. Our proposal would add almost $2 trillion \nmore of deficit reduction to the $2.5 trillion we have already done so \nfar.\n  Let's look at what we have done so far. Of the $2.5 trillion in \ndeficit reduction to date, about $1.5 trillion has come from cuts in \nwhat we call discretionary spending; the spending that Congress \napproves each year that funds most government operations including our \nmilitary. This is the $1.5 trillion in cuts out of all of the $12.6 \ntrillion in spending.\n  We got another $600 billion in revenue, mostly from letting the Bush \ntax cuts expire for very high-income taxpayers. So this thin red line \nis the additional $600 billion in revenue compared to the existing \nrevenue of the country. As you will see, we have cut far more in \nspending than we have added in revenues going into this budget \ndiscussion.\n  The remainder of the $2.5 trillion comes from the interest savings \nthat are associated with those, just to make the numbers true up. This \ncircle is here to demonstrate that to date we have yet to touch one \ndime in the other big budget item, which is loophole spending in the \nTax Code.\n  This is a pretty good-sized chunk of annual spending, about 12 \npercent of the levels projected in 2010. The fiscal cliff bill that \nrestored the Clinton-era rates to families making over $450,000 added \nabout 2 percent to other revenue projections, to the loophole category \nwhich is worth at least $14 trillion, conceivably a lot more, because \nsome of the loopholes are so wide you do not even know what is going \nthrough them. The money just shows up in the Cayman Islands. We do not \nknow what we have lost. That remains totally untouched.\n  What we want to do is take just 7 percent, a tiny slice of this \nloophole revenue, and bring it back and use it for deficit reduction. \nThat touching the loophole nerve is what has brought the Republicans to \na screeching halt. In contrast to our exactly balanced approach--50 \npercent spending, 50 percent loopholes--Chairman Ryan's budget would \n100 percent go after the programs on which low-income and middle-class \nAmericans rely, without touching a single Tax Code giveaway--no balance \nat all.\n  But, of course, unbalanced is the Republican way in budgets. For \ninstance, the Republican budget changes Medicare into a voucher \nprogram. That is not very balanced. That is not what the American \npeople want. The Republican budget cuts nondefense discretionary \nspending to levels lower than anything the American public has ever \nseen since OMB started keeping track. That is an extreme budget and not \na balanced approach.\n  The Republican budget would set annual domestic spending levels below \n1962. If you think back to what America was like in 1962, there were no \nPell grants. So if any of the pages were thinking of someday getting a \nPell grant, that is gone. It did not exist in 1962. In 1962, 30 percent \nof American seniors lived in poverty. That is the level of spending the \nRepublican budget would take us back to.\n  The rhetoric has been just as unbalanced as the proposals. Speaker \nBoehner has said talk about raising revenue is over--over. We have not \neven started and he says it is over, zero percent out of loopholes. He \nsays the conversation is over. I do not think so. The conversation has \nnot even begun.\n  But true to the Speaker's rhetoric, the Republican budget puts the \nburden of deficit reduction back onto Americans who can least afford \nit, while preserving for corporations and for the people who get the \nbenefit of Tax Code giveaways every single dollar. In his conference \ncommittee opening remarks, Chairman Ryan said: If this conference \nbecomes an argument about taxes, we are not going to get anywhere.\n  Let's take a look at the so-called taxes in this loophole area that \nDemocrats would like to discuss. By the way, we get $975 billion out of \nthat, which is a slice slightly larger than this one and considerably \nsmaller than that one. So where do we get it from? We go to what I \nrefer to as the Republican treasure trove. We go to their Ali Baba's \ncave of treasure carved aside and saved for corporations and the rich.\n  We go to the tax earmarks and the special deals, the special \ninterests which year after year have been squirreled away into the Tax \nCode through their lobbyists and through their numbers. How big can Ali \nBaba's cave be? Seriously? How much money goes out the backdoor of the \nTax Code through these loopholes and deductions? I will show you.\n  This bar represents $1.13 trillion, which is the amount of revenue \ncollected by the government through the individual income sections of \nthe Tax Code. That is what goes into Uncle Sam's pocket from the Tax \nCode. Here is what goes out the backdoor in loopholes and deductions: \n$1.02 trillion. So for every $1 that actually gets collected under the \nindividual income tax, 90 cents goes out the backdoor through the \nloophole circle.\n  That is off-limits? Oh, I do not see why. It is a grand total every \nyear of more than $1 trillion. Do not tell me we cannot touch it at \nall. By the way, when you are talking budget numbers, you multiply by \n10. So $1 trillion over 10 years becomes $10 trillion. That is talking \nsome pretty serious money, to pretend, as Chairman Ryan said: If we are \ngoing to have an argument about taxes, we are not going to get \nanywhere. You are not even going to look at $10 trillion and not get \nanywhere?\n\n  On the corporate side, for every $1 in revenues the United States \ncollects, here it is, $242 billion that we actually collect, that goes \ninto Uncle Sam's pocket from corporate income tax revenue, here is what \ngoes out the bookdoor of the corporate Tax Code: $148 billion.\n  So like individual income, when it comes to corporate income, for \nevery $1 Uncle Sam actually gets in revenues through the Tax Code, 60 \ncents-plus goes out the bookdoor through loopholes and deductions and \nother tax gimmicks. So, again, we budget for 10 years. So $148 billion \nbecomes pretty close to $1.5 trillion. That is big bucks. If you add \nthe two together and do it for 10 years, which is what we do in the \nbudget world, and account for modest growth over those 10 years, we are \ntalking about $14 trillion.\n  We need to do $975 billion in deficit reduction out of loopholes from \na $14 trillion number. Do not tell me we cannot find it there. Of \ncourse, the $14 trillion does not even count the billions of dollars \nthat corporations and wealthy tax avoiders hide offshore. They do not \neven go through the gateway of the Tax Code and then out the backdoor.\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\nThey do not even get counted in the first instance. They go off to the \nCayman Islands, to tax havens, they get hidden in Swiss bank accounts, \nwho knows what, but they do not get subjected to American taxation.\n  By the way, that is pretty big business. Chairman Conrad, who was our \npredecessor chairman on the Budget Committee, used to have a slide he \nwould show that showed a picture of a rather bland-looking four- or \nfive-story building, the building in the Cayman Islands that did not \nlook like much, not very big. You could drive by it, you would not \nparticularly notice it. But he would point out in that little building \nover 18,000 companies claim to be doing business.\n  He would point out that the kind of business they were doing was \nmonkey business with the Tax Code because nobody could put 18,000 \nbusinesses in that little building. None of that stuff gets counted in \nthe $14 trillion, the stuff that goes through the front and then out \nthe backdoor.\n  So the spending--the earmarks--that gets done through the Tax Code is \na very big treasure trove. While much of this tax spending helps low-\nincome and middle-class families, too much of it goes to high-income \ntaxpayers who do not need it but who are clever and connected enough to \nget special deals, to get their tax earmarks into the Tax Code.\n  But, of course, the Republicans do not want us to look into their \ntreasure trove. Ali Baba's cave of tax tricks is where the juicy \nearmarks are for the special interests. If you remember back to the \nlast Presidential campaign, it became public that Mitt Romney had to \nfiddle his taxes in order to get his tax rate up to a 14-percent tax \nrate.\n  Some people gimmick their taxes to try to get their rates down. The \nrates for people such as Mitt Romney are so low to begin with that he \nhad to play tax games to get his rates up to 14 percent so he would not \nlook too bad as a Presidential candidate. Fourteen percent is a lower \ntax rate than a solitary hospital orderly pays. The guy who is walking \ndown the linoleum hallways of Rhode Island Hospital at 2 o'clock in the \nmorning delivering supplies pays a higher tax rate than that.\n  We cannot do anything about that? That is a tax question we cannot \ndiscuss? How do Romney and the hedge fund billionaires get away with \nthat? Look in Ali Baba's cave of tax treasures for the carried interest \nexception. If you want to know where ExxonMobil, which is one of the \nrichest and most profitable corporations in the history of the world, \ngets its hands into the American taxpayer's pockets and pulls out oil \nand gas subsidies, look for those Big Oil subsidies in Ali Baba's \ntreasure cave.\n  Do you want to know why Amazon, Boeing, Carnival Cruise Lines, Duke \nEnergy, PG, all companies making billions of dollars in profits per \nyear, pay effective tax rates well under 10 percent? Look at the $150 \nbillion in corporate tax giveaways there in Ali Baba's treasure cave.\n  Do you want to know how it is that corporate jets get special favored \ntax treatment compared to the commercial jets that ordinary mortals fly \naround in? Look at the accelerated corporate jet depreciation schedules \nin Ali Baba's tax treasure cave.\n  When the Speaker says that talk about raising revenue is over, look \nat what he is protecting? The Republican treasure trove of corporate \nand special interest earmarks heaped up like gold and jewels in the old \nillustrations in Ali Baba's cave of tax treasures.\n  We Democrats are knocking at that door. We are saying: Americans pay \nin deficit reduction $1.5 trillion already. We are offering another \n$975 billion on top of that.\n  We are saying that $600 billion came out of tax increases. What about \nloopholes?\n  Now we want to go into the cave. The Republicans are getting very \nanxious. The alarms are ringing at the special interests, and our \ncolleagues are rushing to the trenches to defend the special interests \nand to defend their cherished tax earmarks. That is why they want to \nkeep revenue--loophole closing--out of the debt and deficit discussion. \nThey know that once we start taking a real look into Ali Baba's cave, \nsome of that stuff will be impossible to defend to the American people.\n  It wasn't fair when it first went in, it has never been fair through \nits sordid history in the Tax Code, and it is not fair sitting in the \nTax Code now. These are things we should get rid of even if we didn't \nneed it for the debt and deficit. This is special interest crony \ncapitalism at its worst. We intend to have a look at it in these \ndiscussions.\n  If we listened in the Budget Committee, the Republicans said it \nplainly: Not a penny of tax loopholes can go for deficit reduction. \nThey have said they are willing to move the treasure around a little \nbit in Ali Baba's cave as long as it all still gets used for \ncorporations and the wealthy. That is not a guess; that is the way the \nRepublican budget is structured. Those are their budget numbers, all of \nit to lower tax rates for corporations and the rich. They are willing \nto spread the wealth around as long as it stays in the same hands.\n  We are at the gates of Ali Baba's cave, this special treasure trove \nof Tax Code special deals and earmarks for the rich and well connected. \nWe are at the place where the lobbyists wheel the sweet corporate tax \ndeals. We are knocking on the door of the $14 trillion in tax spending \nthat has been left completely untouched in the deficit reduction so \nfar. Our Republican colleagues are getting a little twitchy.\n  Come on, fellas. Out of nearly $14 trillion in tax spending and \nearmarks, can't we put just 7 percent of it toward the debt and the \ndeficit? Our proposal is to leave 93 percent of the treasure in the \ncave. That is not unreasonable. What is unreasonable, what is \nunbalanced is the Republican desire that not a nickel in loophole \nclosing can go toward our debt and deficit.\n  I could go through innumerable comments by our Republican colleagues \nwarning us about the dire danger of our debt and deficit, warning about \nthe terrible injustice to future generations, warning about the threat \nto our national security and to our national welfare; dire, serious \nwarnings about the epic nature of the danger of our debt and deficit \nand the importance of curing it. When we actually stack it up, it is \nless important to them than every loophole in the Tax Code.\n  My point is that people can't have it both ways. They can't be \ntelling the American people that the debt and the deficit is the No. 1 \nthreat to the well-being of our beloved country but is also less \nimportant than every deduction every lobbyist ever squirreled away for \nevery special interest in the Tax Code. Both of those cannot be true.\n  We must persevere to get into Ali Baba's cave of tax treasures in the \nloophole side of this equation. I hope very much that we will. I think \nthat is nothing more than reasonable, nothing more than balanced. \nIndeed, one could argue it is actually a lot less than balanced because \nwe only want 7 percent and we would be letting them keep 93 percent. We \nwould be doing far more on spending than we would on revenue and \nloopholes combined. It is not balanced in the even-steven sense of the \nword, but at least it is generally fair. The Republican proposal that \nit should be all spending and zero loopholes is what is unbalanced and \nwhat I object to.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the infamous Tailhook scandal in \n1991, every Secretary of Defense has proclaimed that our military has a \n``zero-tolerance'' policy for sexual harassment and sexual assault. \nZero tolerance is the policy our military should have, but in reality \nit doesn't. We\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nknow it doesn't because we have heard too many stories from women and \nmen in the military who have been attacked, assaulted, or raped by \ntheir peers in uniform or by their superiors. We have heard too many \nstories in which the assailants go unpunished. We have heard too many \nstories about commanding officers using their authority to set aside \ncourt-martial convictions or to decide simply not to have a trial at \nall. We have heard too many stories about survivors being drummed out \nof the service by misinformed diagnoses of mental illness or by a chain \nof command that ignores the assailant and instead turns around and \ncharges the survivor with bad behavior. We have heard too many stories \nabout survivors who are so disillusioned by this broken system that \nthey don't even bother to report these crimes. Instead, these men and \nwomen, warriors all, are forced to live in silence and with an unjust \nfeeling of shame.\n  We all agree that commanders are responsible for maintaining good \norder and discipline in their units. This includes creating an \natmosphere of dignity and respect for everyone under their command. \nCommanders must create an environment where sexual crimes do not occur. \nOur proposed changes to the military justice system do not absolve the \ncommander of these responsibilities. It is still their job to prevent \nthese crimes. But when these crimes do occur, survivors should have the \nability to seek justice, and the Gillibrand amendment will help the \nsurvivors do just that.\n\n  I am glad our civilian and military leaders have committed to helping \nthe survivors of sexual assault, punishing the predators and ending \nthese terrible injustices. When the service secretaries and chiefs tell \nme fixing the problem of sexual assault is a top priority for them, I \nbelieve them. I believe they care deeply about this problem. \nUnfortunately, incremental change has not been and is not good enough. \nCommanders bear the responsibility for creating a culture where these \ncrimes do not happen in the first place.\n  Congress must also do its part to ensure there is a system in place \nthat both holds people accountable and doles out punishment that \nactually serves as a deterrent against future sexual assaults. Over the \nyears, Congress has passed a variety of measures intended to fix these \nproblems, and we have many good provisions in both the House and Senate \nversions of the NDAA which we are considering. But I do not believe \nthese steps are enough. We must make a major change. We owe it to the \nmen and women who serve our country in uniform. We owe it to the \nfamilies and loved ones of those who serve because the trauma of sexual \nassault often extends beyond the trauma experienced by the survivor. We \nmust do all we can to provide an environment where those who put their \nlives on the line for our country each and every day are not sexually \nassaulted. And if they are, we must provide a fair system of justice \nwhere the survivor is heard and not ignored, is helped and not shunned. \nThat requires, I believe, vesting the decision about whether or not to \ngo to trial with an impartial experienced military lawyer and not with \nthe commander in the chain of command who has an inherent vested \ninterest in the case.\n  It is undeniable the current system does not work. According to the \nDepartment of Defense, there were an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted \nsexual contact in 2012. We have heard about trainers at Lackland Air \nForce Base repeatedly raping new enlistees. We have heard about \nincidents at the Service Academies, Aviano Air Force Base, Fort Greely, \nFort Hood, and too many other bases. It is undeniable that we have a \nproblem. The incremental steps we have taken are not enough.\n  The story of Marine 2nd Lt. Elle Helmer is just one example of this \nbroken system. She told her story in the documentary ``The Invisible \nWar,'' and it has also been reported elsewhere, including a CNN \ninterview and in the Houston Chronicle.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Houston \nChronicle article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Houston Chronicle, May 20, 2013]\n\n After Sex Assaults Inside Military, Women Are Victims Again of Legal \n                                 System\n\n                            (By Karisa King)\n\n       Marine 2nd Lt. Elle Helmer woke up on a cold floor, lost \n     and surrounded by darkness. Her body screamed with pain, her \n     underwear had been removed and she tasted blood in her mouth. \n     She could hear someone else in the room with her, breathing \n     slowly.\n       Memories from the past few hours flashed through her mind \n     as she crawled toward a doorway for light. On orders from her \n     command on March 16, 2006, Helmer had joined her fellow \n     officers for a St. Patrick's Day pub run, a night of bar-\n     hopping that ended across the street from the prestigious \n     Marine Barracks Washington, where she was in charge of public \n     affairs.\n       A major followed Helmer out of the last bar and summoned \n     the 25-year-old to his office. As soon as they entered the \n     office, he shut the door and kissed her. She pushed him away \n     and made it halfway out the door when he caught her arm and \n     yanked her back into the room so hard she tripped and went \n     flying forward.\n       The last thing she remembered was her head slamming into \n     his desk.\n\n\nPart 1: Sexual-assault victims in military unjustly stigmatized, booted \n                                  out\n\n       Emerging from the darkened office hours later, she noticed \n     she was wearing the major's green running shorts. She padded \n     barefoot down a hallway to her office, where she found \n     herself locked out. Two Marine guards found her outside the \n     door, crying and shaking. She was certain she'd been raped.\n       ``Call an ambulance,'' she kept telling them, a plea she \n     repeated to a captain and a colonel who arrived later.\n       Instead, the colonel warned that if she went to a hospital, \n     she would be prohibited from making a sworn accusation of \n     rape because she'd been drinking. She would be charged with \n     public intoxication and conduct unbecoming an officer, he \n     told her.\n       ``Dust yourself off. You're tough. You're from Colorado,'' \n     he said. ``Whatever happened, it's because boys and girls and \n     alcohol don't mix.''\n       It was her introduction to a military criminal justice \n     system that frequently grants impunity to offenders and \n     punishes victims--the outcome of a fiercely guarded power of \n     commanders who wield broad discretion over the handling of \n     sex crimes in their ranks, according to a San Antonio \n     Express-News investigation.\n\n\n                           Many drugged first\n\n       From the accounts of sexual assault survivors in every \n     branch of the military, a stark panorama emerges: Many \n     victims were drugged or forced to drink and were raped, \n     attacked as they slept, beaten unconscious and coerced into \n     sex by their superiors. They were strongly discouraged from \n     disclosing the crimes, or forced to report assaults to \n     commanders who are closely connected to the accused.\n       Few suspects face criminal punishment. Of 3,374 reports of \n     sexual assault last year involving 2,900 accused offenders, \n     only 302 went to courts-martial and 238 were convicted, the \n     Defense Department says.\n       Meanwhile, 286 offenders received nonjudicial or \n     administrative punishment or discharges, allowing them to \n     dodge a criminal mark on their record. In 70 cases, suspects \n     slated for possible courts-martial were allowed to quit their \n     jobs to avoid charges.\n       Prison sentences are rare. Only 177 perpetrators were \n     sentenced to confinement. But the most jarring statistic: \n     about half of all convicted sex offenders were not \n     automatically expelled from the armed services.\n       The military had only recommended discharge for convicted \n     offenders, but lawmakers cracked down this year and made \n     expulsions mandatory.\n\n\n                          Mishandling of case\n\n       For Helmer, the immediate response from her chain of \n     command foretold the mishandling of her case.\n       On the night she reported that she'd been raped, the \n     colonel at Marine Barracks Washington refused to grant her \n     medical help until she argued that her head injury demanded \n     immediate attention. He agreed to let her go, but only after \n     arranging for her to see a doctor he knew at National Naval \n     Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\n       ``Don't say anything else and come straight back,'' he told \n     her.\n       She was put into a car with a captain who was supposed to \n     drive her there. But she insisted he take her to a different \n     hospital at Andrews Air Force Base, where no one connected to \n     the colonel would be awaiting her arrival.\n       The attack in the major's office was a betrayal by a \n     superior she had trusted. But she eventually would regard the \n     response from her chain of command and the military justice \n     system as the biggest betrayal of all.\n       For all the public outrage sparked by sexual abuses at the \n     Navy Tailhook convention in 1991, the Army's Aberdeen Proving \n     Ground in 1996 and the Air Force Academy in 2003, the \n     military criminal justice system has failed to stem an \n     epidemic of sexual assaults, reaching an estimated 26,000 \n     last year.\n\n\n                        Basic training assaults\n\n       Against that backdrop last year came explosive details of \n     young recruits who were sexually assaulted by their basic \n     training instructors at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. So \n     far, the Air Force has identified 33 instructors suspected of \n     illicit conduct with 63 trainees.\n       An Air Force general's decision to throw out a jury \n     conviction of aggravated sexual\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\n     assault ignited an uproar on Capitol Hill. Lt. Col. James \n     Wilkerson, an F-16 pilot at Aviano Air Base in Italy, was \n     sentenced in November by a jury of officers to dismissal and \n     a year in jail for sexually assaulting a party guest as she \n     slept in a spare bedroom of his house.\n       But in February, Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, Wilkerson's \n     former commander, concluded the evidence was insufficient. \n     Against the recommendation of his staff attorney, Franklin \n     overturned the conviction, vacated the jury's sentence and \n     reinstated Wilkerson to full duty.\n       The case underscores the unchecked legal power of \n     commanders. Although they typically have no background or \n     training in the law and may not be impartial arbiters, senior \n     officers like Franklin who are endowed with ``convening \n     authority'' determine which cases go to trial, and they have \n     the ability to overturn verdicts and vacate sentences before \n     cases enter the appeals process.\n\n\n                            No reason at all\n\n       According to military law, commanders can dismiss verdicts \n     for any reason, or no reason at all.\n       For Kimberly Hanks, who testified she woke up as Wilkerson \n     was assaulting her, it was a lesson in the conflicts of \n     interest posed by the military justice system. Hanks, a 49-\n     year-old physician assistant from California, was a civilian \n     contractor at Aviano when she told military authorities she'd \n     been assaulted.\n       After the verdict, she discovered that Franklin and \n     Wilkerson had once flown together in Iraq and shared friends.\n       Even so, Franklin's decision to throw out the conviction \n     shocked her. ``I think the message is loud and clear. I think \n     it tells victims: Don't bother (to report),'' Hanks said.\n       Air Force officials said only five verdicts have been \n     overturned in sexual assault cases in the past five years.\n       In response to the case, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in \n     April proposed that commanders be stripped of their ability \n     to toss out trial convictions. But Hagel and military brass \n     oppose efforts to remove authority over sex crimes from \n     commanders. At the Senate hearing in March, top military \n     attorneys argued that sexual assault cases must remain within \n     the chain of command, and nothing less than the military's \n     ability to wage battle is at stake.\n       Kelly Smith had seen enough in her first three years in the \n     Army to know that soldiers who can't tough out physical pain \n     and personal difficulties--no matter how agonizing--are \n     viewed not only as troublemakers but as a danger to the \n     safety and cohesion of the unit.\n       That's why she had no intention of telling anyone in \n     February 2003 after she woke up in her bed at Fort Lewis, \n     Wash., as a man attempted to rape her. But Smith, whose \n     screams drove off her attacker, said she was forced to report \n     it to military authorities because Army guards identified the \n     man as he ran from her room.\n       Although her assailant admitted the attack, the case was \n     dropped without explanation, she said. She was sent to a \n     psychiatric unit for therapy. Days later, she was dismayed to \n     discover Army counselors sent her assailant to join the same \n     therapy group. She protested, but was told she was being \n     unreasonable.\n       ``I sat next to him in group therapy for a week,'' Smith \n     said. ``At that point, I shut down.''\n       While the soldier who assaulted her was allowed to retire, \n     Smith, who was a Korean code breaker, soon was diagnosed with \n     bipolar disorder, a pre-existing mental illness that prompted \n     the Army to kick her out.\n       ``I knew it would be the end of my career, and it was,'' \n     Smith said.\n\n\n                            Other priorities\n\n       For Elle Helmer, even those assigned to help her seemed to \n     have had other priorities.\n       She met the victim advocate assigned to her case at Malcolm \n     Grow Hospital at Andrews Air Force Base. The advocate arrived \n     with instructions to drive Helmer back to the Marine Barracks \n     because the colonel and executive officer wanted a word with \n     her.\n       Helmer was adamant that she wanted to make a statement at \n     Naval Criminal Investigative Services, which had jurisdiction \n     over crimes at the barracks. The advocate warned against it.\n       ``These cases never go anywhere,'' she told Helmer.\n       ``And she's the sexual response coordinator!'' Helmer now \n     says. ``It felt like walking backward in time.''\n       Eventually the advocate reluctantly took Helmer to NCIS to \n     make a statement.\n\n\n                              Up all night\n\n       It was roughly 8 a.m. and Helmer had been up all night. She \n     entered the NCIS offices, about two blocks from the barracks, \n     and learned the colonel and executive officer were there \n     waiting to speak with her. Again, Helmer refused. She tried \n     not to make eye contact with them as she walked past the \n     office where they waited.\n       She spent the morning in a conference room with five \n     investigators who questioned her credibility. In what seemed \n     like an endless cycle, she wrote out her statement, they \n     questioned her, and then asked her to rewrite the statement. \n     They decided to open an investigation but said they couldn't \n     accept her statement because she had been drinking the \n     previous night.\n       It wasn't until that afternoon that investigators arrived \n     at the barracks to collect evidence from the major's office. \n     By that time, the major had been left alone at the scene for \n     hours. Eyewitness statements show he was spotted making trips \n     back and forth from the office carrying cleaning supplies and \n     towels.\n       Helmer was taken back to the barracks to be interviewed by \n     the colonel. When she returned to work the following Monday, \n     he informed her that the Marine command had opened an \n     investigation against her for public intoxication and conduct \n     unbecoming an officer.\n       The NCIS investigation lasted three days. Investigators \n     closed Helmer's case on the grounds she could not recall any \n     sexual assault.\n       ``Her statements did not constitute an allegation of \n     criminal activity,'' the NCIS report stated.\n       Investigators held out the possibility of reopening the \n     case, depending on the results of the rape kit.\n       Military records show the major told a commander at the \n     barracks that he had no sexual contact with Helmer. He said \n     she came into the office, laid down on the floor and vomited. \n     He left the room to retrieve cleaning supplies, and when he \n     came back, she was gone.\n       Eyewitness statements contradict his account. Two Marines \n     who saw the major wearing green shorts and cleaning up vomit \n     had peeked through the partly open office door and reported \n     seeing a woman's bare leg sprawled on the floor.\n       ``This looks bad but I'll take care of the lieutenant,'' he \n     told them.\n       It wasn't until about two hours later that guards \n     encountered Helmer locked out of her office and wearing the \n     major's green shorts. The captain who took Helmer to the \n     hospital told investigators he went into the major's office \n     to retrieve Helmer's ID card and found the major asleep on \n     the couch, ``wearing a Saint Patrick's Day t-shirt and \n     nothing else.''\n\n\n                          No rape kit results\n\n       Helmer waited four months with no results from the rape \n     kit.\n       Frustrated by inaction, she told her command that she was \n     speaking to a reporter in Washington about her case. Although \n     nothing was published, she was fired from her job and charged \n     with conduct unbecoming an officer and fraternization.\n       She was dismissed from the Marines for unacceptable conduct \n     in January 2007 with a ``general under honorable conditions'' \n     discharge.\n       While she waited for her final dismissal papers, military \n     authorities told her the rape kit had been lost.\n       Ultimately, the major faced no criminal or administrative \n     punishment. He was allowed to remain in the Marines and later \n     received a promotion.\n       ``All they did was give him expertise in how the legal \n     system works,'' she said. ``Now he knows he can get away with \n     it.''\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, the Houston Chronicle article tells the \nfollowing account:\n  Lieutenant Helmer was stationed at Marine Barracks Washington in \n2006, just a few blocks from the Senate Chamber. One night, after she \nwas ordered to go bar hopping with her colleagues, a superior officer \ncalled her into his office and attacked her. She remembers him slamming \nher head into his desk, and then she blacked out. When she woke up she \nwas wearing her superior officer's shorts, and she knew she had been \nraped. Two guards found her outside crying and shaking. She asked a \ncolonel to call an ambulance and, instead, the colonel warned her she \nwould be charged with public intoxication and conduct unbecoming an \nofficer if she reported the attack. When Lieutenant Helmer finally made \nit to a military hospital, the sexual assault victim advocate warned \nher, ``These cases never go anywhere.''\n  Lieutenant Helmer pressed her case anyway. But after many months, \nhere is the only thing that happened. Lieutenant Helmer was charged \nwith fraternization and conduct unbecoming an officer, and the superior \nofficer who attacked her received no punishment. In fact, he was later \npromoted.\n  This story should outrage us all. This story shows that when sexual \nassault occurs, the current system does not work. It is time to make \nfundamental changes to how sexual assault cases are handled in the \nmilitary.\n  The amendment of Senator Gillibrand would be a big step in the right \ndirection. Her amendment would take the decision to go forward with a \ntrial out of the chain of command and place it in the hands of an \nexperienced military lawyer. This change would improve the judicial \nprocess by increasing transparency. It would also eliminate potential \nbias and conflict of interest because, unlike a commanding officer, the \nmilitary lawyer would be unconnected to either the survivor or the \naccused. Just the perception of such bias or conflict of interest could\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\ndiscourage a survivor from reporting a sexual assault and thereby allow \nthe attacker to prey on others again and again.\n  Many survivors of sexual assault tell us the main reason they do not \nreport these crimes is because they think nothing will happen. The \ncurrent process often does not work. It is unacceptable to allow this \nsituation to continue.\n  The problem of sexual assault is a scourge on our military for which \nthere is no silver bullet. But at the very least what we need is a \nmilitary justice system where a survivor feels confident that his or \nher case will be fairly examined and, if deemed to have sufficient \nevidence, be sent forward to trial.\n  Sexual assault in the military is something that most people don't \nwant to talk about. We don't want to think the men and women whose \nservice we honor on Veterans Day are being preyed upon by their \ncolleagues or, even worse, that they themselves may be sexual \npredators. There is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority \nof our military men and women serve our country valiantly and with \nhonor, and we should take care not to tarnish them with suspicion. In \nfact, we owe it to them to act.\n  It is for these reasons that I am a proud cosponsor of Senator \nGillibrand's Military Justice Improvement Act. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it, and to my colleagues who are opposed or undecided, I want \nto say again that keeping disposition authority within the chain of \ncommand has not worked. One of the arguments I have heard against \nmaking this change is that doing so would interfere with the \ncommander's ability to maintain good order and discipline. Good order \nand discipline should not rest upon a commander's ability to decide \nwhether or not to prosecute a sexual crime.\n  The time has come to make a significant change, and I believe this is \na change that needs to be made. I want to commend our colleague Senator \nKirsten Gillibrand for her tireless efforts and courageous leadership \nin this effort to help survivors of sexual assault in the military.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I had the privilege of listening to \nmy colleagues, Senator Hirono and Senator Blumenthal, who have been \naddressing this issue of sexual assault in the military. As both of \nthem said so persuasively and articulately, our military justice system \nis broken. The sense of trust that a man or woman serving in the \nmilitary today, who has been subjected to rape or sexual assault, has \nbeen broken--and not just between them and the assailants in their unit \nbut between them and their commanders. In fact, the trust that their \ncommander will have their back, that they will have these crimes \ninvestigated and the perpetrators brought to justice has been broken.\n  Even General Amos, Commandant of the Marines, said so. He said: I can \nsee why a female marine might not report a case of sexual assault. They \ndon't trust us. She doesn't trust the chain of command.\n  This is our challenge. We have to reform the system because these are \nsome of the best men and women in the world that make our military as \nstrong as it is. But we are subjecting them to not only these great \nacts of violence but then the second heartbreak, the second \nrevictimization of having a military justice system that does not have \ntheir back or they are convinced not to report these crimes because \njustice will not be done or nothing will be done or they will be \nretaliated against for reporting.\n  The No. 1 reason 23,000 cases last year went unreported was because \nvictims believed nothing would be done. They did not trust their chain \nof command to have these cases prosecuted. The second reason they \ndidn't report these cases was because they feared or witnessed \nretaliation. That is not surprising, because of the 3,000 brave \nsurvivors who did report their sexual assault or rape, 62 percent were \nretaliated against. That is a huge number.\n  There is a failure within our military--our military that has \npromised for 25 years zero tolerance for sexual assault and rape in the \nmilitary. As far as I am concerned, all we have had is zero \naccountability, because of those brave 3,000 survivors who did come \nforward and 62 percent were retaliated against means those commanders \nfailed to maintain a command climate where retaliation is not taking \nplace.\n  In our underlying bill we are going to fix that. We are going to make \nretaliation a crime, giving commanders more tools to go after \nperpetrators of retaliation. Retaliation has always been against good \norder and discipline. It has never been acceptable, but still it exists \nand too many victims do not come forward because they fear it.\n  So I wish to speak on behalf of these survivors, these advocates, \nthese champions, these leaders in reform. They can't be on the Senate \nfloor right this moment, but I can be here, and I can share their \nstories. I can tell what happened to them.\n  Sarah Plummer was raped as a young marine in 2003. She said:\n\n       I knew the military was notorious for mishandling rape \n     cases, so I didn't dare think anything good would come of \n     reporting the rape.\n       Having someone within your direct chain of command just \n     doesn't make any sense, it's like being raped by your brother \n     and having your dad decide the case.\n\n  Another survivor, Trina McDonald, at 17 enlisted in the Navy. She was \nstationed at a remote base in Alaska. Within 2 months, she was \nattacked, repeatedly drugged and raped by superior officers over the \ncourse of 9 months. Can you imagine that being your daughter? Can you \nimagine this young woman who literally wants to serve our country and \neven die for our country being repeatedly drugged and raped by her \nsupervisor?\n  She said:\n\n       At one point, my attackers threw me in the Bering Sea and \n     left me for dead in the hopes that they would silence me \n     forever. They made it very clear that they would kill me if I \n     ever spoke up or reported what they had done.\n\n  Thank God Trina McDonald survived, because as I read her testimony \nfrom the Senate floor, she is being heard in this debate.\n  Army SGT Rebekah Havrilla, who served in Afghanistan and was raped in \n2007, said reporting the crime to her commanding officer was \nunthinkable:\n\n       There was no way I was going to go to my commander. He made \n     it clear he didn't like women.\n\n  Listen to AIC Jessica Hinves, who was raped in 2009 by a coworker who \nbroke into her room at 3 a.m. She said:\n\n       Two days before the court hearing, his commander called me \n     on a conference at the JAG office, and he said that he didn't \n     believe that [the offender] acted like a gentleman, but there \n     wasn't reason to prosecute.\n\n  Breaking into someone's room, not being a gentleman. Obviously, that \ncommander does not understand that rape is a serious crime.\n\n       I was speechless. Legal had been telling me this is going \n     to go through court. We had the court date set for several \n     months. And two days before, his commander stopped it. I \n     later found out the commander had no legal education or \n     background, and he'd only been in command for four days.\n\n  Her rapist was given the award for Airman of the Quarter. She was \ntransferred to another base.\n  Many listening tonight may think this is just a crime against women, \nbut one of the most disturbing facts is that more than half of these \ncrimes are against men. It is not a gender issue. The crimes of rape \nand sexual assault are not of passion but are brutal crimes, crimes of \naggression, crimes of dominance, crimes of control. These are not cases \nof dates that have gone badly.\n  Blake Stephens, now 29, joined the Army in January of 2001, just 7 \nmonths after graduating from high school. The verbal and physical \nattacks started quickly, he says, and came from virtually every level \nof the chain of command. In one of the worst incidents, a group of men \ntackled him, shoved a soda bottle up his rectum, and threw him backward \noff an elevated platform onto the hood of a car.\n  When he reported the incident, Stephens said, his drill sergeant told \nhim, ``You're the problem. You're the reason this is happening,'' and \nrefused to take action. Blake said:\n\n       You just feel trapped. They basically tell you you're going \n     to have to keep working\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\n     with these people day after day, night after night. You don't \n     have a choice.\n\n  His assailants told him that once he deployed to Iraq, they would \nshoot him in the head. ``They told me they were going to have sex with \nme all of the time when we were there.''\n  If these stories aren't enough, please do listen to some retired \ngenerals, commanders, JAG officers, veterans who know from years of \nexperience that the status quo is an injustice to those who serve, and \nour approach is the right way forward.\n  This September, three retired generals gave their public support for \nour proposal, including LTG Claudia Kennedy, the first woman to achieve \nthe rank of three-star general in the U.S. Army; BG Lorree Sutton, \nformerly the highest ranking psychiatrist in the Army; BG David \nMcGinnis, who most recently served in the Pentagon as the Principal \nDeputy to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs.\n  Lieutenant General (retired) Kennedy wrote me:\n\n       Having served in leadership positions in the US Army, I \n     have concluded that if military leadership hasn't fixed this \n     problem in my lifetime, it's not going to be fixed without a \n     change to the status quo.\n       The imbalance of power and authority held by commanders in \n     dealing with sexual assaults must be corrected. There has to \n     be independent oversight over what is happening in these \n     cases.\n       Simply put, we must remove the conflicts of interest in the \n     current system. . . . The system in which a commander can \n     sweep his own crime or the crime of a decorated soldier or \n     friend under the rug, protect the guilty and protects serial \n     predators. And it harms our military readiness. . . .\n       Until leadership is held accountable, this won't be \n     corrected. To hold leadership accountable means there must be \n     independence and transparency in the system.\n       Permitting professionally trained prosecutors rather than \n     commanding officers to decide whether to take a sexual \n     assault case to trial is a measured first step toward such \n     accountability. . . . I have no doubt that command climate, \n     unit cohesion and readiness will be improved by [these] \n     changes.\n\n  BG (retired) Lorree Sutton also wrote to me, saying:\n\n       Failure to achieve these reforms would be a further tragedy \n     to an already sorrowful history of inattention and ineptitude \n     concerning military sexual assault.\n       In my view, achieving these essential reform measures must \n     be considered as a national security imperative, demanding \n     immediate action to prevent further damage to individual \n     health and well-being, vertical and horizontal trust within \n     units, military institutional reputation, operational mission \n     readiness and the civilian-military compact.\n       Far from ``stripping'' commanders of accountability, as \n     some detractors have suggested, these improvements will \n     remove the inherent conflict of interest that clouds the \n     perception and, all too often, the decision-making process \n     under the current system. Implementing these reforms will \n     actually support leaders to build and sustain unit cultures \n     marked by respect, good order and discipline.\n\n  BG (retired) David McGinnis, who also served as a Pentagon appointee, \nwrote this to me:\n\n       I fully support your efforts to stamp out sexual assault in \n     the United States military and believe that there is nothing \n     in [the Military Justice Improvement Act] that is \n     inconsistent with the responsibility or authority of command. \n     Protecting the victims of these abuses and restoring American \n     values to our military culture is long overdue.\n\n  Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Martha Rainville, the first woman in the \nhistory of the National Guard to serve as a State Adjunct General and \nserved in the military for 27 years, including 14 years in command \npositions, wrote:\n\n       As a former commander, endorsing a change that removes \n     certain authority from military commanders has been a tough \n     decision. It was driven by my conviction that our men and \n     women in uniform deserve to know, without doubt, that they \n     are valued and will be treated fairly with all due process \n     should they report an offense and seek help, or face being \n     accused of an offense.\n       When allegations of serious criminal conduct have been \n     made, the decision whether to prosecute should be made by a \n     trained legal professional. Fairness and justice require \n     sound judgment based on evidence and facts, independent of \n     pre-existing command relationships.\n\n  That is the crux of the problem. You have commanders who have biases. \nMaybe they don't want women in the military. Maybe they don't believe \ngay members should serve openly. Maybe they need or appreciate or like \nthe assailant more. Maybe the perpetrator has done great things in \nbattle. Maybe he is more experienced, more important. Maybe he is more \npopular.\n  Those biases color decisionmaking. Because when the decisionmaker \nactually weighs evidence, one of the fundamental pieces of evidence in \nthese cases is the testimony of the victim and the accused. If that \ncommander doesn't value the victim because she is new, he may not \nbelieve her when he sees the perpetrator is a family man with two kids, \na lovely wife: How could he possibly do that? He has been in Iraq five \ntimes. I don't believe her and I believe him. He has weighed the \nevidence through a colored lens.\n  That is not justice. That is not fairness. That is not what our \ndemocracy is based on. We believe in justice being blind. We believe in \nthe scales of justice not being weighed for the victim or the accused. \nJustice is blind. It is fair. It is impartial. It is objective.\n  If that decisionmaker is not even a trained lawyer, how do we hope \nthey are going to get it right, colored with biases, colored with self-\ninterest. No commander wants to say rape is happening under their \ncommand. That is a failure. It is a failure of military readiness. It \nis a failure of good order and discipline. It is a failure of good \ncommand climate. Why would they want to report their own failure? Many \ntimes they don't. That is why the deck is stacked against the victims \nof these crimes in too many cases.\n  We have had a recent ruling that I think is incredibly important.\n  The DOD for 50 years has had a panel called the DACOWITS panel. It is \na panel of advisers that have been asked by the Secretary of Defense, \nfor the past 50 years, to please tell him what policies and proposals \nare most important to protect and support women in the military. The \nwhole purpose of the committee is to look at this issue and say what is \nthe status of women in the military, how are they faring.\n  This panel actually has been studying sexual assault in the military \nfor decades. They have been focused on it, have had hearings on it, \nopining on it, giving recommendations for a very long time. They have \nlooked at this proposed recommendation, studied it, and they actually \nrecommended every piece of this legislation to be passed by this \nCongress. They have actually recommended the decisionmaking go outside \nthe chain of command. The vote for that proposal: 10 in favor, 6 \nabstained, none against. Of the 10 in favor, 9 out of 10 are all former \nmilitary, 5 of them senior officers. The one nonmilitary was a woman \nwho was head of the Women's Law Center. They want every aspect of this \nreform put into law. They are the experts. Even Secretary Hagel said he \nlooks at this group with great regard, with high authority. He regards \nthem as the preeminent advisory panel for women in the military.\n  We also have a lot of support from other retired members of the \nmilitary, Retired U.S. Army MG Dennis Laich, Retired Navy CAPT Lory \nManning, Former JAG officer and Congressman Patrick Murphy, and \nmilitary legal experts such as Diane Mazur and Rachel Natelson.\n  When the DACOWITS panel, the Defense Advisory Committee On Women In \nThe Services, voted in support of the measure, they say they believe \nthese are the reforms that will make the difference. They say they must \nimplement these reforms to make sure the status of women in the \nmilitary is protected. Secretary Hagel places a great premium on this \npanel.\n  We also have the support of leading veterans groups, veterans groups \nwho actually have served. They are veterans; they understand what \nhappens. ``We want to be clear, a vote for the Military Justice \nImprovement Act is a vote for our troops, and a vote for a stronger \nmilitary.'' We should listen to our veterans.\n  I think it is time we restore trust. The military has had 25 years to \ndeal with this problem. They have been saying zero tolerance for 25 \nyears. They keep saying: We got this. They keep saying: We can handle \nthis, just give us more time. If this happened to my son or daughter--\nhow much more time do you need? How many more thousands of victims are \ngoing to be raped and assaulted in the military and have no hope for \njustice? How many more good men and women are we going to lose to \nsexual assault and rape, who are retaliated against and pushed out, \nbeing told they are the problem? How much are we going to lose in terms \nof military readiness, in terms of unit cohesion, in terms of troop \nmorale, in terms of good order and discipline, to the scourge of sexual \nviolence in the military?\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n  I don't think we should wait another day. I don't think we should \nwait for another panel, another report, another study, another, \nanother, another, another. We have boxes of studies over the last 25 \nyears making recommendations. But until you create a transparent, \naccountable military justice system, you do not have a hope of solving \nthis problem. Until you give the decisionmaking authority to an actual \ntrained lawyer who is not biased, you don't have a hope.\n  All of our allies have done this, all of them. The ones we fight side \nby side with--Israel, UK, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, Germany--are \nallies. They said if it is a serious crime; let the decisionmaker be \nunbiased; let the decisionmaker be trained.\n  Did they have a fall-off of good order and discipline when they let \nthese decisions be made by trained prosecutors? They told us no.\n  When we tried to repeal don't ask, don't tell, military commanders \nsaid you cannot possibly do this; this will undermine good order and \ndiscipline. When we wanted women to be able to serve in the military, \nthey said you cannot possibly do that because of good order and \ndiscipline. When we integrated the armed services, commanders said you \ncannot possibly do this; it will undermine good order and discipline. \nWe did it. We did every single one of those reforms.\n  Congress had an action, elected leaders had a responsibility. We \nprovide oversight and accountability over the Department of Defense. It \nis an important relationship, and sometimes we may have an idea for \nreform that can make the difference, that can make our military \nstronger, that can utilize all of our best and brightest.\n  Don't ask, don't tell--we lost 10 percent of our foreign language \nspeakers because of that corrosive policy. How many thousands are we \ngoing to lose to sexual assault and rape in the military? How many? How \nmany good men and women? Losing one more is too many.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill. It is not a Democrat nor is \nit a Republican idea. It is a good idea. It is a commonsense reform. It \nmakes perfect sense when people learn about the issue and want a \nsolution. This is what this place is supposed to be about. It is \nsupposed to be people of good will coming together to solve problems, \nto make a difference.\n  We need leadership. We do not need followers, we need leaders. We \nneed people who will do that job and provide oversight over the \nDepartment of Defense, especially in an area where they failed so much. \nThis reform will make a difference, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here to join my \ncolleague Senator Gillibrand in expressing my concerns about how we \naddress sexual assault in the military.\n  For the past several years, we have all become increasingly aware of \nthe prevalence of sexual assault in our military. Personally, I know I \nshare the outrage of all Americans that one of our Nation's proudest \ninstitutions is afflicted by this level of criminal violence. In 1989, \nSecretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III established a policy of \nzero tolerance for sexual harassment and sexual assault. Two years \nlater, the Tailhook scandal happened at a convention attended by the \nSecretary and the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  On June 2, 1992, Secretary Garrett wrote a memo to his military \nleaders that said:\n\n       While each individual must be accountable for his or her \n     own actions, commanding officers have a unique responsibility \n     for leadership in ensuring appropriate behavior and attitudes \n     of those under their command.\n\n  In the end, the Tailhook scandal resulted in 90 victims--83 women and \n7 men--140 officers facing possible punishment and zero criminal \nprosecutions for incidents of assault. All of these events occurred \nunder the same zero tolerance policy that military leaders espouse \ntoday.\n  The Tailhook scandal was only the beginning of our awareness of the \nsilent crisis within the military. Since that time, there have been \nnumerous scandals in every service. Yet 20 years later we are not only \ntold that the system works but that the status quo, maintaining the \nchain of command on this issue, is vital to solving the problem. This, \nof course, ignores the reality of the sexual assault crisis.\n  In fact, according to the Department of Defense Sexual Assault \nPrevention and Response Office, 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact \nand sexual assault occurred in 2012, and that was an increase of 37 \npercent since 2010. Clearly, something must change and it must change \nnow.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Gillibrand, Boxer, Blumenthal, \nand Hirono, along with so many supporters on both sides of the aisle, \nthis issue is back at the forefront of our national debate. We now have \na historic opportunity not only to make additional meaningful \ncommonsense reforms to our military criminal justice system, but I \nthink the Defense authorization bill that we are going to take up \nbefore the end of this year, hopefully, has a number of very critical \nproposals to address sexual assault in our military, and I certainly \nsupport those. I was pleased those provisions got unanimous support \nwithin the committee. But I do not think we went far enough in that \nbill.\n  We also need to send a powerful message to the tens of thousands of \nvictims, many of whom have been suffering quietly for decades, that \nwhat happened to them in our military is unacceptable. In too many of \nthose cases it is criminal. And it will no longer be tolerated.\n  The Military Justice Improvement Act of 2013 addresses what victims \ntell us is the No. 1 problem in the current system. Victims decide not \nto report sexual assaults because they fear their commanding officers \nwill not take the issue seriously and they will be retaliated against \nor nothing will be done.\n  According to the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and \nResponse Office, 50 percent of female victims said they did not report \nthe crime because they believed nothing would be done with their \nreport. And 25 percent of women and 27 percent of men who received \nunwanted sexual contact indicated that the offender was actually \nsomeone in their own military chain of command.\n  Our legislation addresses the chain-of-command issue. It removes the \ndecision of whether to go to trial from the chain of command and puts \nit into the hands of experienced prosecutors. This is a straightforward \nchange. It is designed to promote transparency and accountability in \nthe prosecution of these crimes.\n  It would also ensure that impartial individuals specifically trained \nto handle these cases determine whether they move forward, which \npermanently eliminates the conflicts of interest that exist in the \ncurrent system. We need all victims to know that if they come forward, \ntheir cases will be handled fairly and impartially.\n  Several days ago in America, we celebrated Veterans Day. Many of us \nwent home to our home States to honor the men and women who, throughout \nour history, have served in our military. Our military's traditions of \nhonor and respect are too important to continue to be plagued by the \nissue of sexual assault. That is why I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Military Justice Improvement Act, because we strengthen our \nmilitary when victims of sexual assault have the confidence to come \nforward and report crimes, and when we remove fear and stigma from the \nprocess.

But as broken as the \nbudget process is, and as pessimistic as many people are, I remain \nhopeful about the possibility of reaching a compromise that can bring \nus back to some semblance of the regular order everyone claims to want.\n  If there ever were two Senators who could find a way through the \nmorass, it is Senator Mikulski and Senator Murray. And they should know \nthere are a great many of us, including some on the Republican side of \nthe aisle, who are 100 percent behind them. I encourage all Senators to \nread David Rogers' piece in Tuesday's edition of POLITICO, entitled \n``Barbara Mikulski's fight: Protecting appropriations''. It tells the \nstory, and in doing so, it pays tribute to Senator Mikulski.\n  I am not naive about the obstacles ahead, not the least of which is \nthe shortness of time. We need a top line number from the budget \nconferees by the end of next week if we are to complete appropriations \nbills by January 15 when the current continuing resolution expires.\n  There is no mystery about what needs to happen. There must be \ncompromise by both sides on two key issues--increasing revenues and \ndecreasing spending. There will not be agreement without both. But in \nthe absence of agreement, the operations and programs of every Federal \nagency will be drastically reduced by the combined effects of \nsequestration and a full year continuing resolution.\n  People will lose their jobs and programs will be cut deeply or \nterminated altogether. Infrastructure projects will be cancelled. The \nAmerican people will pay the price in far more ways than any one of us \ncan imagine.\n  I want to mention a few examples of the effects that a full year \ncontinuing resolution, at the level the House proposes, will have in \nlost jobs and canceled infrastructure projects in this country.\n  Under a full year continuing resolution, the National Science \nFoundation would receive $542 million less than the amount in the \nSenate bill. The funding included by the Senate would provide funding \nfor 1,500 more competitive grants and support 17,000 scientists, \ntechnicians and students. Under a CR, those jobs and that research \nwould not be possible.\n  The $500 million included in the Senate bill to fix thousands of \ndeteriorating and aging bridges around the country would disappear.\n  Under a CR, the Federal Aviation Administration would not receive the \n$559 million in the Senate bill to hire air traffic controllers needed \nto keep the skies safe. Instead, the FAA would be faced with having to \nimpose a hiring freeze and furlough air traffic controllers and \naviation safety inspectors.\n  Funding for agricultural research would receive nearly $242 million \nless than the levels included in the Senate bill and America's standing \nas the world leader in food production could be in jeopardy, because we \nsimply won't be able to compete with the $4.5 billion China spends on \nagricultural research annually.\n  The EPA's funding for clean and safe drinking water would face \nsignificant cuts, putting Americans' access to clean water at risk. It \nwould also mean 6,500 fewer American jobs.\n  These are just a few examples of how another long term continuing \nresolution will neglect the infrastructure needs of our Nation and \nprevent the creation of thousands of jobs.\n  I hope the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that put an end to the \nneedless shutdown will enable the budget conferees to reach agreement \non a top line funding level so Senate Appropriations Committee \nChairwoman Mikulski and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers \ncan help us get back to work and pass the bills needed to fund these \nessential services.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David Rogers' article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From POLITICO, Nov. 11, 2013]\n\n          Barbara Mikulski's Fight: Protecting Appropriations\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       It's not quite Wendy and the Lost Boys but it's getting \n     close.\n       Indeed, a year after taking power, Chairwoman Barbara Ann \n     Mikulski--or BAM as she's known in staff memos--is the \n     mother-older sister the Senate Appropriations Committee never \n     knew.\n       The longest-serving woman ever in Congress, and the first \n     to lead that old male haven, the Maryland Democrat brings a \n     style like none before her: cajoling, prodding, empowering \n     her members to get out on the Senate floor and fight. \n     Appropriations is her neighborhood just as East Baltimore was \n     when Mikulski began her rise as a community organizer in the \n     60's. Only now it's not a 16-lane highway through Fells Point \n     but sequestration in January that threatens her world.\n       The stakes are enormous.\n       If no budget deal is reached in the next month, Congress \n     will surrender to another round of automatic cuts in January \n     and risk leaving the government under no better than a \n     stopgap funding bill through the remainder of fiscal 2014. \n     That would be the third such 12 month CR arrangement in four \n     years--a true breaking point for Appropriations but also a \n     tempting tool for those seeking to frustrate President Barack \n     Obama's second term.\n       In the midst of this, Mikulski can be a terror: demanding, \n     self-centered to a point of fault. But she enjoys an \n     invaluable alliance with Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman \n     Patty Murray (D-Wash.) who also sits on Appropriations. And \n     at 77, it can seem that Mikulski's whole life has prepared \n     her for this moment: the grocer's daughter and product of \n     grassroots Catholic social activism matched against the new \n     grassroots anti-government forces of the Tea Party.\n       Obama checked the box of community organizer on his way to \n     the top. Mikulski lived it. She can paraphrase Jesuit \n     scholars but also pepper her floor speeches with ``Wow'' or \n     ``Oh, boy.'' And her politics remain greatly influenced by \n     the likes of the late Monsignor Geno Baroni, a civil rights \n     and community organizer who was a leader of the neighborhood \n     revival movement of the 60's and 70's.\n       ``He was always cooking up a pot of social glue and \n     developing social capital,'' Mikulski said in a 1994 speech \n     honoring Baroni's memory. Nearly 20 years later that might \n     describe too her own approach to Appropriations.\n       ``A little bit different,'' she laughs of the change she \n     has brought. ``Absolutely'' community organizing is part of \n     that.\n       ``My worst nightmare is that we get to like January 12th \n     and 13th and we don't have anything,'' she told POLITICO. \n     ``And we go to a year-long CR with sequester kicking in on \n     January 15th which is government at its worst. Government on \n     auto pilot and cuts across-the-board in that meat axe way.''\n       ``I know a lot about a lot, but I want to be able to \n     marshal the resources of my own committee to be able to get \n     out there and talk,'' she said. ``The chair of the \n     Appropriations Committee is more like head of the Joint \n     Chiefs. My twelve subcommittee chairman enjoy not only a \n     great deal of autonomy but they really are the ones that \n     drill down on their respective portfolios and know it in a \n     very granular way . . . Who better to tell the story than \n     those who know it the most?''\n       Beginning with the shutdown in October, the Mikulski style \n     has been to go to the Senate floor herself but then gin up \n     her colleagues to follow. This proved remarkably successful \n     last month, and after a meeting with her Democratic members \n     last week, she's doing the same now--this time focused on \n     sequestration and the perils of surrendering to a full-year \n     stopgap CR.\n       ``She wants us to be engaged with the same energy she \n     has,'' said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) ``It can be quite \n     effective. Instead of just her giving a speech, we follow and \n     say `Let me tell you specifics.' ''\n       ``It's a new day around here,'' said Sen. Mark Pryor (D-\n     Ark.). ``All the organization skills she can muster, we need \n     at this point.''\n       That organization begins with Murray. And the dynamic of \n     these two women--both rooted in Appropriations--is the most \n     intriguing of the battle ahead.\n       It is an alliance both new and old at once.\n       Mikulski took over the chairmanship of Appropriations in \n     December last year after the sudden death of Sen. Daniel \n     Inouye (D-Hawaii.) Weeks later, Murray took the gavel at \n     Budget, replacing North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad, the \n     committee's long time top Democrat and chairman who retired \n     at the end of the last Congress.\n       At one level, the 63-year-old Murray is junior to Mikulski. \n     At another, she has moved well ahead by taking on tasks in \n     the party leadership which the matriarchal Mikulski stepped \n     back from even as her Senate contemporary and old House mate, \n     Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) advanced.\n       For Reid, a veteran of Appropriations and now Majority \n     Leader, the emergence of this Mikulski-Murray alliance is a \n     huge asset as seen in last month's shutdown crisis.\n       It was popular in the press then to credit a bipartisan \n     coalition of women--led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)--with \n     driving the final outcome. But in fact, it was two women, \n     Mikulski and Murray, who took the opposite stand. And inside \n     the Democratic caucus, they proved pivotal for Reid in \n     holding firm against the Collins plan.\n       ``We liked the Collins effort . . . It had dignity. It had \n     intellectual rigor,'' Mikulski said looking back. But the \n     plan itself, which envisioned a CR through January 30, risked \n     disaster for Appropriations. It did nothing to\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n     stop sequestration and despite Collins' best intentions, left \n     the door open to what Mikulski feared would be simply another \n     eight month CR after that.\n       But take away gender, this Mikulski-Murray alliance is \n     really a return to past practice for the Senate.\n       For most of its history, under Republicans or Democrats, \n     the Senate Budget Committee has been led by chairs bred in \n     Appropriations. Think back to Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), \n     Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) or Judd Gregg (R-\n     N.H.).\n       In this context, the long tenure of Conrad, a product of \n     the Senate Finance Committee, was more the exception than the \n     rule--now restored by the arrival of Murray.\n       ``She actually understands what we do and what we need to \n     do to do our job,'' Mikulski said.\n       The flip side of this coin is that Mikulski must also help \n     Murray do her job on Budget. Time and again through Senate \n     history, budget resolution votes have been decided by \n     Appropriations members falling in line--or crossing the \n     aisle--in the name of moving ahead. If Murray gets a deal \n     with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), \n     Mikulski's support will be needed to sell it to the Senate.\n       Two very different pressure points are available to her.\n       First are the Republicans with whom Mikulski has worked on \n     Appropriations and have their own vested interests in a \n     budget deal. Second are Democratic liberals where Mikulski \n     can provide political cover on tough votes given her \n     progressive credentials and history alongside the late Sen. \n     Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).\n       Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on \n     Appropriations, was still a Democrat in the House in the 80's \n     when he and Mikulski served together on the Energy and \n     Commerce Committee. They came over together to the Senate in \n     1986 and are their own Mutt-and-Jeff pair, taking alternative \n     turns running the Commerce, Justice and Science subcommittee.\n       ``We've got a history,'' Shelby said. ``We both would like \n     a [topline] number being appropriators. When I was down at \n     the White House with the president, I told him the reason \n     we're here mainly is because we've had an appropriations \n     breakdown.''\n       Given Republican politics, Mikulski knows that Shelby can't \n     be as outspoken as she is for a budget deal. But she was \n     worked to enlist him and House Appropriations Committee \n     Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) to keep the pressure on for a \n     swift conclusion to the budget talks.\n       ``I asked him if he would encourage the timeline of sooner \n     rather than later,'' Mikulski said of Shelby. In the same \n     vein, she signed onto a recent letter with Rogers that urged \n     negotiators to have an answer by Thanksgiving--leaving time \n     for Appropriations to have an omnibus bill in place by early \n     January.\n       ``What [Rogers] and I share is sequester,'' Mikulski said. \n     ``If we go to sequester, we're cooked.''\n       But Ryan will want Democratic pain to get to a deal. And \n     the day may come when Mikulski has to choose between more \n     chaos for her committee or a compromise that entails savings \n     from sensitive areas like Medicare or federal workers.\n       ``I've got to see what's exhausted before I go down that \n     road,'' she says, quickly ducking any commitment. ``Do you \n     mean to tell me there is not one loophole [Republicans] are \n     willing to close?\n       ``I'm convinced that Patty can still have room for a deal . \n     . . I don't want to speculate on the array of things that she \n     has to take to the table. It's premature.''\n       Kennedy's memory is important here. Mikulski has no \n     pretensions of having the same status as her late friend. But \n     their history is rich, and just as Kennedy could be a swing \n     vote for the left, she may also have to play that role.\n       At the 1980 Democratic convention--having lost the \n     nomination battle to President Jimmy Carter--Kennedy tapped \n     Mikulski, then a young congresswoman, to introduce him before \n     his ``Dream Shall Never Die'' speech.\n       ``You know what: I kept the dress,'' Mikulski said. ``I \n     told him I would keep it until he was president. It became a \n     standard joke. I told him I looked at it longingly.''\n       ``And he said `Because you would like to see me as \n     president?''' Mikulski said. ``And I said, `No cause I want \n     to be able to fit into the damn thing.' ''\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, Congress is facing two \nfast-approaching budget deadlines: December 13 for a budget deal and \nJanuary 15 for a funding bill to avert another government shutdown. \nGiven the complexity of the issues, the brief window of opportunity, \nand the upcoming holiday season, meeting those deadlines will be a \nchallenge. But it is a challenge Congress must meet. If we don't get a \nbudget deal, we don't get a budget topline; we don't get any relief \nfrom sequestration; we can't write the 2014 appropriations bills, and \nwe default to a year-long CR. That is a nightmare scenario.\n  A long-term CR is the worst way to fund the government. It merely \nrecycles last year's funding levels to meet this year's funding \npriorities. That makes as much sense as using last year's canceled \nchecks to pay this year's bills.\n  The military construction Program is the poster child for everything \nthat is wrong with a CR. The 2014 Senate MILCON-VA bill includes $4.8 \nbillion for the construction of hundreds of new-start MilCon projects \nthroughout the United States. The 2013 bill--which sets the funding \nlevels for the CR--funded a totally different set of MILCON projects, \nand the funding does not align with the 2014 program.\n  For example, the Army needs $\\1/2\\ billion less for MILCON in 2014, \nand the Air Force needs $800 million more. A CR written at 2013 levels \nwould not reflect those requirements, meaning the Air Force would come \nup short while the Army would be awash in MILCON dollars it does not \nneed. This would be a devastating blow for the Air Force because it \ntook a pause in its MILCON Program last year. As a result, a CR at the \n2013 level would fund less than 30 percent of the 2014 Air Force MILCON \nProgram.\n  All of which could be moot because a CR also prohibits new starts. \nWithout relief from that provision, 96 percent of the major MILCON \nProgram would be on hold.\n  The MILCON bill funds mission-critical training and operational \nfacilities, schools, hospitals, troop and family housing, and myriad \nother programs crucial to the work and well-being of our service \nmembers and their families. The 2014 Senate bill funds more than 200 \nnew major MILCON projects in 39 States. And that does not include \noverseas MILCON or follow-on phases of ongoing projects.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans across the Nation go to work every \nday for contractors building MILCON projects. Government construction--\nwhether it be MILCON, VA hospitals and clinics, or Federal roads, \nhighways and bridges--is a major job generator. The Association of \nGeneral Contractors estimates that every $1 billion in nonresidential \nconstruction generates 28,500 jobs.\n  For the 2014 slate of major MILCON projects alone, that amounts to \nnearly 137,000 new jobs. Multiply that by the annual Federal Government \ninvestment in nationwide construction projects, and it is clear that a \nrobust government construction program is a wise economic investment on \nall fronts.\n  Even if the new-start prohibition were lifted, the 2014 sequester \nremains a threat to the military construction program. DOD estimates \nthat a second round of sequestration could cost the MILCON Program as \nmuch as $1 billion, of which about half would come from new major \nconstruction projects. Under another round of sequestration, project \ndeferrals or cancellations are almost guaranteed. The result would be a \ndisruption of the MILCON Program and possibly thousands of lost job \nopportunities.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I am well aware of the \nNation's precarious economic recovery. As an appropriator, I am equally \naware of the need to adequately fund both Defense and domestic \ngovernment programs.\n  The path to responsible government funding requires both revenue \nincreases, through such means as closing tax loopholes and sensible \nspending cuts. Spending cuts alone cannot close the gap without \ncrippling the economy.\n  Mr. President, Congress has a responsibility to govern. In the coming \nweeks, we must strive to achieve at minimum a 2-year budget deal, \ncancel sequestration for at least 2 years, and produce a governmentwide \nfunding bill--what is commonly known as an omnibus by January 15. With \nthe cooperation of all parties, that is an achievable goal. The \nAmerican people deserve--and expect--no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8043-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8043-S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFRICAN WILDLIFE POACHING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was not very long ago that it seemed as \nif the ivory trade was on the decline and that the survival of African \nelephants in the wild was assured. In recent years, we have seen that \nconfidence shattered, as thousands of these magnificent animals have \nbeen systematically killed for their tusks. Similarly, the rhinoceros, \nalready endangered, is now in great jeopardy due to the voracious \nappetite in China and elsewhere\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\nin Asia for concoctions manufactured from their horn which can fetch \nthousands of dollars per ounce.\n  Large-scale poaching of these and other wildlife species has become \nendemic in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that up to 17,000 \nAfrican elephants have been killed for their tusks since 2011, and just \nlast month poachers used cyanide to poison 300 elephants in Zimbabwe. \nIt was only a couple of years ago that we saw the extinction of the \nwestern black rhinoceros, another victim of rampant poaching. This \ndevastating slaughter should serve as a deafening wake-up call to the \nworld. It has implications that extend far beyond wildlife \nconservation.\n  The international ban on ivory sales enacted in 1989 had a positive, \nalbeit temporary impact on the protection of elephant and rhinoceros \npopulations, but it has since spawned a black market industry in \nwildlife and wildlife parts. As I mentioned, some of the market is in \ncarved ivory products and potions prized in Asia for their supposed \nmedicinal or other properties. But this illicit revenue is increasingly \nbeing used to fund violent extremist groups in the subcontinent. The \nprofits from this trade fuels trafficking in weapons, drugs, and \nhumans, as well as terrorism in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and \nbeyond.\n  Vermonters take pride in being well informed about international \naffairs, as well as on the impact that we as individuals have on the \nworld we live in. The people of my State know that many of the products \nwe buy, services we support, and actions we take have global \nimplications, positive and negative. That is why it was no surprise \nwhen more than 300 people gathered last month in the University of \nVermont's Ira Allen Chapel to view the National Geographic documentary \n``Battle for the Elephants'' and discuss the grave threat that poaching \nposes to the world's elephant population. The consensus was that while \nthe outlook is ominous, the fact that people are increasingly focused \non this crisis is reason for hope that these animals can be saved. \nVermont's own Laurel Neme, a renowned environment and wildlife policy \nexpert, noted that technological advancements, especially in regards to \ntracing the origins of illegal ivory, have made encouraging strides.\n  The United States has moral as well as strategic interests in \ncombatting trafficking in wildlife and wildlife products. As I have \nmentioned, it is not only decimating elephant and rhinoceros \npopulations it is also funding traffickers and terrorist groups. For \nthese reasons, the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign \nOperations, of which I am chairman, included $45 million for fiscal \nyear 2014 to combat wildlife poaching and trafficking, including by \ntraining and supporting African park rangers and other law enforcement \nofficials. The Obama administration has also recognized the need to \naddress this crisis more forcefully and is allocating additional \nresources.\n  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the African countries to \nprotect and conserve their wildlife populations. But they cannot do it \nalone. It is imperative that we work with them and other donor \ngovernments and organizations to martial the resources to combat the \nblack market trade in wildlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8044-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPREME COURT POLICE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAmerican hero who is also a proud and honored Kentuckian. Mr. John Wood \nof Glasgow, KY, will be honored this month for his service in uniform \nto our country. Mr. Wood served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1941 to \n1947, was present for the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and \nwas there at the Battle of Midway Island just months after America \nentered World War II.\n  After his military service, Mr. Wood settled in Glasgow, where he \nworked as a radio broadcast engineer from 1949 to 1990. He is a true \nlegend from the Greatest Generation who still has much to teach us \nyounger folks.\n  This November 18, Mr. Wood will be honored at Glasgow City Hall. \nAlso, local officials in Glasgow, Cave City, and Barren County will \njoin with local veterans' organizations in Kentucky to proclaim \nNovember 20 as ``John Wood Day'' in Barren County.

I cannot think of a \nbetter tribute to this fine man's service than to recognize him on his \nbirthday.\n  My fellow Kentuckians can turn out to see Mr. Wood when he serves as \nthe Grand Marshal for the Cave City Christmas Parade later this year, \nand also as a featured guest in the Glasgow Christmas Parade. These \nwill be wonderful community events to bring Kentuckians together to \nhonor John Wood's service and to say thank you to all veterans in the \nChristmas spirit.\n  I know I speak for my colleagues in the U.S. Senate when I express \ngratitude to Mr. John Wood for his service to our great Nation. \nKentucky is proud to have him in our midst.

Wood thought he saw something else \n     fall toward the small Hawaiian island where he was stationed \n     in 1942.\n       ``I saw something drop from the plane,'' Wood said. ``I \n     thought at first he had bailed out. A little closer you could \n     tell it wasn't the pilot. It was a silver bomb.''\n       It was just a few seconds later when the bombs fell in \n     unison toward the Marine Corps 6th Defense Battalion, \n     destroying plane hangars, power stations, and a cluster of \n     above-ground fuel tanks near Wood.\n       ``I got half nauseated from the smoke and all of those guns \n     being fired,'' Wood said. ``There were fuel tanks burning. \n     The island was just, almost, engulfed with smoke. And then \n     the planes dropped all their bombs.''\n       Wood, a former Lee County resident, manned a .50-caliber \n     machine gun--``They were airplane guns, but they had mounts \n     so they could rotate''--when the Imperial Japanese planes \n     began to fly toward and over Midway Atoll on June 4, 1942.\n       ``We could see them off in the distance,'' Wood said. ``Two \n     or three planes would go down, a plume of smoke behind them. \n     Off the shore away, you'd see a splash when one would go down \n     We were ordered to fire when they got in range.''\n       One plane, tilting from damage to its left tail, came into \n     close range near Wood, giving them a close encounter with the \n     pilot.\n       ``He was dressed up,'' Wood said. ``He had a white shirt \n     and black coat and black tie. The gloves, he had white gloves \n     on his hands. Every gun there on through the center of the \n     island opened up on him. He was shot down.''\n       The Battle of Midway, a decisive victory for the United \n     States and a turning point in the Pacific theater during \n     World War II, came just six months after the attacks on Pearl \n     Harbor--a battle Wood witnessed, rifle in hand.\n\n\n                IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO FOR A LIVELIHOOD\n\n       Wood, 92, was born in Montgomery County, near Troy. He grew \n     up in Lee County with his parents, John Lee Wood and Nancy \n     Phillips Wood, and two brothers, Malphus and Thomas.\n       ``My first school was the old McIver Street School, and \n     Edna St. Clair was my teacher,'' he said. ``When I was \n     finished over at McIver Street, I started over at the high \n     school and that was in 1934.''\n       Wood spent two years in the Civilian Conservation Corps--a \n     public-relief program meant to relieve families who faced \n     difficulties during the Great Depression--before enlisting in \n     the Marine Corps in 1941.\n       ``I really didn't have anything else to do at the time,'' \n     he said. ``At the time I enlisted, it was something to do for \n     a livelihood. And\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\n     I had a brother already in the Marine Corps.''\n       Wood joined the 4th Defense Battalion as a radio and radar \n     operator, traveling to Cuba, Panama, and along the west coast \n     of the United States. The day after his 21st birthday, aboard \n     the U.S.S. Henderson, Wood left San Diego and arrived at \n     Pearl Harbor on Dec. 1, 1941.\n       ``We were there a week when the Japanese attacked Pearl \n     Harbor and Hickam Field,'' he said.\n\n\n                              PEARL HARBOR\n\n       Wood was stationed two miles from the entrance of Pearl \n     Harbor at an unfinished Marine base. The battalion's rifles \n     were still crated up when Imperial planes began to fire.\n       ``We were still close enough to Pearl Harbor to see when \n     the Japanese planes began to attack,'' he said. ``In Hickam \n     Field we could see all the anti-aircraft fire being fired at \n     the planes down in the harbor area. All the smoke and anti-\n     aircraft fire burst around the planes.''\n       There were murmurs among the men about military maneuvers \n     or exercises that quickly evaporated when the first plane \n     burst into a fireball, streaking down, he said.\n       ``We got the call from the harbor that we were under \n     attack,'' Wood said. ``They tore the crates open, without any \n     regard if you got your own rifle. They gave us a bandolier \n     and told us to fire on anything that came into range. We got \n     our rifles but we weren't sure where we were going.''\n       Only one Japanese plane, possibly taking pictures, Wood \n     said, came near his group.\n       ``There was one Japanese plane that circled our camp area, \n     and he wasn't in range to be firing on,'' he said. ``But some \n     of the boys were firing rifles at it, and we did get a \n     machine gun, .50-caliber, and began firing at it, but the \n     plane was still too far away. It circled and went back in the \n     direction of Honolulu.''\n       There were no causalities or injures in the 4th battalion, \n     but more than 2,000 Americans lost their lives and another \n     1,000 were injured. Shots were fired over their heads, Wood \n     said, and they were forced into a nearby mess hall--a \n     military cafeteria--to avoid the gunfire.\n       ``It wasn't the Japanese,'' he said. ``It was our own \n     shells from some of our guns. We didn't know where it was \n     coming from . . . but I was lying there as close to the \n     ground as I could get and there was another boy lying eight \n     or 10 inches from my head. We both had our hands over our \n     heads, and finally they did quit firing and we just laid \n     there for a few seconds. We finally got the nerve to look up, \n     and we raised our heads at the same time. I looked at him, \n     and he looked at me. Neither of us spoke, but I noticed his \n     face was white as a sheet. I just wondered to myself if my \n     face was as white as his. That was my most uneasy moment of \n     it all.''\n       The next day, Wood listened to the declaration of war from \n     President Franklin Roosevelt and preparations began for his \n     15-month tour at Midway as part of the 6th Defense.\n       In 1943, he arrived home in Lee County sometime between 1 \n     or 2 p.m., and said simply his parents were glad to see him.\n       ``I was kinda glad to get back home, too,'' Wood said.\n       He left the military in April 1947, moved to Kentucky and \n     worked at a radio station for more than 40 years. He married \n     the late Glindoln and had three children.\n       Wood comes back to Central Carolina almost every summer for \n     a family reunion, he said.\n       This Veterans Day, Wood said he'll be attending a ceremony \n     and meeting with the Kentucky Bluegrass Chapter of the Pearl \n     Harbor Survivors Association.\n       ``I do think being at both of those two places, well, they \n     are important events in the military history of our \n     country,'' Wood said. ``I do feel a little bit of pride for \n     being at both of those events.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8045-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support for \nMs. Nina Pillard to be a U.S. district court judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Nina Pillard is an exemplary nominee who is more than qualified to \nserve on the Federal bench.\n  She has been a tenured professor of constitutional law at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center for 15 years and is a highly accomplished \nlitigator who has practiced law at every level of the court system, \nincluding the Supreme Court.\n  Nina Pillard's impressive professional background makes her superbly \nqualified to serve on the DC Circuit. Her sheer talent, legal prowess, \nand vast and varied professional career is a testament to her \nbrilliance.\n  She has argued nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and briefed \ndozens of others on significant constitutional questions such as gender \nequality, the Family Medical Leave Act, the right to a jury trial, and \nfree speech.\n  Over the course of her 25-year legal career, Ms. Pillard has argued \nand/or briefed landmark Supreme Court cases, including United States v. \nVirginia, where she successfully opened the doors of the Virginia \nMilitary Institute to female cadets.\n  Nina attended Harvard Law School, where she was editor of the Harvard \nLaw Review. She began her career as a clerk for the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for the Honorable Louis H. \nPollak and served as assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund. She then joined the office of the Solicitor General of \nthe United States, where she briefed and argued cases on behalf of the \nFederal Government before the Supreme Court. In 1998, she was named \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's \nOffice of Legal Counsel.\n  Nina is a board member for the American Arbitration Association and \nis an active reader for the American Bar Association Reading Committee, \nwhich evaluated the writings of Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito for \nthe Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. She also is a member of \nthe Georgetown Law Supreme Court Institute and serves on the Board of \nAcademic Advisors for the Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law. \nPreviously, she served as a member of the American Constitution Society \nand the Center for Transnational Legal Studies.\n  However, some of my colleagues are once again blocking another highly \nqualified and immensely talented woman. The filibuster of Caitlin \nHalligan, Patricia Millett, and the threatened filibuster of Nina \nPillard is history repeating itself.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that \nthe three remaining vacancies on the DC Circuit should be eliminated \nbecause the court's caseload is too low.\n  What they have failed to mention is that the DC Circuit Court \ncurrently has 8 active judges and 6 senior judges with an astonishing \ncaseload total of 1,479. This outrageous argument was made just over 7 \nmonths ago, when another highly qualified female nominee to the DC \nCircuit, and New Yorker, Caitlin Halligan, was filibustered.\n  It should also be noted that in the last 19 years, the Senate has \nconfirmed only one woman to this important court. Furthermore, the DC \nCircuit has only had five female judges during its entire 120-year \nhistory. In a country where women make up over half of the population, \nthat is a disgraceful statistic and one this body can take steps to \neliminate immediately.\n  It is absolutely necessary that the Senate confirm supremely \nqualified individuals such as Nina Pillard to serve on the Federal \njudiciary. Her experience is unmatched and her passion for the law is \nunquestioned. With a caseload as high as that of the DC Circuit, it is \nour responsibility in the Senate to act swiftly in confirming the \nPresident's nominees. We cannot continue nor can we afford to toss out \nhighly experienced individuals, particularly such accomplished women to \nserve in our Federal Judiciary because of political gamesmanship. The \ntime to act is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8045-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8045-S8046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMES ``BOB'' CURRIEO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service and \ncontributions to the State of Arizona and the Nation of James ``Bob'' \nCurrieo. Bob spent his life serving our country as a soldier; a leader \nin the veterans community; and, for the last 17 years in my office, a \nvalued advocate for constituents and veterans. Bob, 79 years young, \nretires this month.\n  Serving the residents of Arizona is one of the great pleasures of my \noffice. When my constituents request assistance in matters dealing with \nthe government, I try, as all my colleagues do, to move quickly to \nprovide a fair and effective path for them to seek redress. And, in \nthis regard, I have been lucky to have had a constituent-advocate of \nBob's experience and caliber.\n  The experience that Bob brought to his working with me was informed \nby 22 years of service in the U.S. Army, retiring with the rank of \nsergeant major. Following decorated service in the Korean war, a \nfortunate assignment to the U.S. Army Combat Surveillance School at \nFort Huachuca brought Bob to Sierra Vista and introduced him to a State \nthat he would\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nquickly come to love and consider home.\n  I first met him in 1982 while he was serving as the newly elected \nNational Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was \nthen, and remains today, a quiet but powerful force--a man whose soft-\nspoken words resonate among those around him. Despite his humble, \nmodest demeanor, his talent for leadership and dedication to our \nNation's veterans is immediately evident.\n  In 1984, Bob was invited by the State Department to join a U.S. \ndelegation as an observer of El Salvador's first election in 50 years. \nI was also on that trip, and remember a long discussion we had about \nveterans and politics, two of Bob's interests. In 1986, I asked him to \njoin my Arizona staff. Ever in demand, he departed for a period to \nserve as an executive in the VFW in Washington, DC, where I kept tabs \non him. In 1996, Bob was ready to return to Arizona and I leapt at the \nchance to have him back on my staff.\n  From that time until just recently, he devoted himself to helping me \nwork on behalf of veterans. On my many trips back home, as I checked in \nwith Fort Huachuca, Davis Monthan, and our veterans communities, I \nalways heard the same message, ``You are lucky to have a man like Bob \nCurrieo on your team.'' I wholeheartedly agree.\n  In the nearly 20 years that Bob served in my office, he opened more \nthan 8,000 cases. That is 8,000 servicemembers, veterans, military \nspouses and families who called out for help--calls that I am proud \nwere answered on my behalf by a man as capable and caring as Bob. I \nthank him for his contributions to my team, his wise counsel, and his \nunwavering friendship.\n  As the late Coach Abe Lemons once said, ``The trouble with retirement \nis that you never get a day off.'' I know that my friend Bob won't face \nthat dilemma--that he will remain active with the VFW and in his \ncommunity as he embarks on the next exciting chapter of his life. I \nwish Bob and his wife Cecilia a long and happy retirement--filled with \nmany joyful days and beautiful Tucson sunsets together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8046-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RESTORING THE 10TH AMENDMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, today I wish to express my support for the \nRestoring the 10th Amendment Act--S. 1643. This legislation, which I \nhave introduced with nine of my colleagues, represents an effort to \nensure that States' rights are protected against further Federal \nencroachment.\n  Ratified and signed into law on December 15, 1791, the 10th Amendment \nis integral to the system of checks and balances that our Founding \nFathers conceived. The Founders were right to be concerned that the \nFederal Government would seek to usurp powers belonging to the States. \nThey understood that limitless Federal power was a threat to the future \nof our democracy.\n  In The Federalist No. 45, James Madison notes the difference between \nFederal and State power. He describes the powers that the Constitution \ngrants to the Federal government as ``few and defined.'' He calls the \npowers left to the States as ``numerous and indefinite.''\n  Today, we can plainly see how wise our Founders were. As we enter \ninto the second term of the Obama administration, Federal regulatory \noverreach has become an intrusive part of everyday life in the United \nStates. From the President's sweeping health-care law to the extreme \nrulemaking of the Environmental Protection Agency, there is virtually \nno aspect of Americans' lives that escapes the creeping reach of \nFederal regulators.\n  The Restoring the 10th Amendment Act seeks to reverse this trend and \nto level the playing field by giving States a new tool to challenge \nFederal overreach. Specifically, it provides special standing in court \nfor State government officials to dispute inordinately sweeping \nregulations issued by Federal agencies. Any rule proposed by a Federal \nagency would be subject to constitutional challenges if certain State \nofficials determine that the rule infringes powers reserved to the \nStates under the 10th Amendment. In this way, the bill would reinforce \nthe safeguards in our existing system of constitutional checks and \nbalances.\n  Americans have the right to expect the members they elect to Congress \nto uphold the Constitution's founding principles. It is our \nresponsibility to ensure that the executive branch is held accountable \nfor any overreach of its constitutionally defined powers.\n  This bill recognizes that the 10th Amendment is as important today as \nit was on the date of its ratification. It would keep the executive \nbranch accountable and preserve the integrity of our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances. Senators Cochran, Grassley, Isakson, \nSessions, Roberts, Thune, Inhofe, Crapo, Risch, Enzi, and Cornyn have \njoined me as cosponsors.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the prompt passage of the \nRestoring the 10th Amendment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8046-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEW W. CRAMER\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ndedicated business man, public servant and friend for his exemplary \nservice in my home State of Utah. Lew Cramer will retire after a \ndistinguished career building international trade in Utah and \nsupporting exports for the United States.\n  Mr. Cramer began his career earning a bachelor's and law degree from \nBrigham Young University in Provo, UT. It was many years later that he \nreturned to co-found World Trade Center Utah, an organization which has \nbeen instrumental in Utah's economic success. Through the World Trade \nCenter, Mr. Cramer connects Utah firms with new business opportunities \naround the world. It is thanks to the efforts of hardworking men like \nMr. Cramer that, in this time of economic hardship, Utah is the only \nState in the Nation showing positive export growth year over year for \nthe past decade. With the pioneering spirit of a true Utahn, Mr. Cramer \nhas helped our companies take advantage of export opportunities \ncreating quality, stable jobs in Utah.\n  Before his time in Utah, Mr. Cramer spent many years in public \nservice. He served as Director General of the U.S. Commercial Service \nduring President George H.W. Bush's administration, directing the \nactivities of 1,400 commercial officers at more than 150 embassies \nworldwide, as well as in 65 offices throughout the United States. \nDuring the Reagan administration, he served as a White House fellow, a \nDeputy Assistant Commerce Secretary and as the Assistant Secretary of \nCommerce for International Trade.\n  Mr. Cramer has worked extensively in the global telecommunications \nand broadband sectors, including serving as vice president for MediaOne \nInternational and US WEST, where he was responsible for their \ninternational government and multilateral financial institution \nrelations and public policy for numerous wireless and broadband \ninvestments in more than 30 countries. Mr. Cramer shares his vast \nexperience through education. He has taught international business at \nGeorgetown University and the University of Southern California.\n  I would like to wish my friend the very best in his retirement and to \nprofoundly thank him for his exemplary record of service to Utah and to \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8046-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8046-S8047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF PROFESSORS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \ncongratulate the four national winners of the U.S. Professors of the \nYear Award. Since 1981 this program has recognized outstanding \nundergraduate instructors throughout the country. In addition to the \nnational winners, a State Professor of the Year was also recognized in \n36 States. This year, I am very proud to say that Colorado has the \nexceptional distinction of being home to two of the four national \nwinners: Ann Williams at the Metropolitan State University of Denver \nand Steven Pollock at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n  While the prestigious Professor of the Year Awards recognizes \nprofessors from diverse institutions and fields of study, this year's \nhonorees all share a strong commitment to the art of teaching and to \ntheir students. Recipients are proven innovators who drive their fields \nand their colleagues forward, through both their energy and their \nenthusiasm. These educators are shaping\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\nthe next generation of American leaders and should be recognized for \nthe critical role they play in moving our country forward.\n  I am especially proud to celebrate the two national winners from my \nState of Colorado. Ann Williams is a Professor of French at \nMetropolitan State University and is being recognized as the \nOutstanding Baccalaureate College Professor of the Year. The judges \nnoted her inspirational and innovative teaching of the French language \nand the cultures of French-speaking countries. She has served her \ncampus community through leadership in her department and institution, \nher State through participation with a task force on academic \nstandards, and her profession as an author and presenter on pedagogical \nissues, a textbook writer, a consultant to the Advanced Placement \nProgram, and winner of an award for one of the 10 best practices \ncourses in the country.\n  Steven Pollock, Professor of Physics at CU-Boulder, has been chosen \nas the Outstanding Doctoral and Research Universities Professor of the \nYear. He brings an enthusiasm to his research that stirs excitement for \nlearning in both his undergraduate and graduate students. His \ninnovative methods of teaching and student assessment have been widely \nadopted through materials he makes publically available, and he has \nfurther offered his time to help others integrate them in their \ncourses, fields, and institutional settings. He is also the developer \nof the highly regarded Student Learning Assistant Program, a mentor to \nundergraduate physics majors, and author of two popular Learning \nCompany video courses on physics.\n  Our success as a nation is in no small part due to the leadership and \npassion of professors like Ann Williams and Steven Pollock. These \neducators know that focusing on student achievement is critical to \nfostering the innovation and creativity necessary to make Colorado and \nour Nation a leader in 21st-century job creation. I wish all the \nwinners the very best in their endeavors.

A bill to require the Committee on Technology of the \nNational Science and Technology Council to develop and update a \nnational manufacturing competitiveness strategic plan, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to talk \nabout jobs, about manufacturing jobs, about the high-quality, high-\nskill wage jobs America needs for today and for the future.\n  Today I have introduced a bill which shows that dealing with our \nongoing challenges of supporting our manufacturing sector and growing \njobs in our manufacturing sector can have bipartisan solutions. Senator \nMark Kirk of Illinois joined me in introducing the American \nManufacturing Competitiveness Act, which has a simple but important \nobjective: to require the creation of a national manufacturing \nstrategy.\n  Today more than 12 million Americans are directly employed in \nmanufacturing. As I have said on the floor before as part of our \nManufacturing Jobs for America Initiative, manufacturing jobs are good \njobs. They are high-skilled jobs, they are high-wage jobs, they are \nhigh-benefit jobs, and they have a terrific secondary benefit in terms \nof the other support and service sector jobs that come along with \nmanufacturing jobs in a community.\n  We need to know the direction we are heading as a country as we try \nto support the growth of manufacturing. We have grown more than half a \nmillion manufacturing jobs in the last 3 years. That is an encouraging \nsign. We are one of the most productive in the output of our \nmanufacturing sector of all the countries in the world.\n  What we have lacked is a very coordinated strategy between the \nFederal Government, State governments, and the private sector to align \nall of our investments--our investments in research and development, \nour investments in new skills, our investments in infrastructure--to \nmake sure they are all heading in the right direction.\n  Do our competitors have national manufacturing strategies? \nAbsolutely. Germany, China, India, South Africa,\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nand Russia all have thoroughly developed, deeply researched, and \nprominently successful strategies for how to accelerate and sustain \nmanufacturing as a key part of their economies.\n  This bill would amend the America COMPETES Act. It would require \nevery 4 years that the Secretary of Commerce, advised by a board of 15 \ndifferent folks, pull together and think through, research, and then \ndeliver a national manufacturing strategy. This doesn't require new \nprograms. It doesn't even necessarily require new funding or new \nFederal expenditures. It only requires that we coordinate all the \ndifferent areas where the Federal Government is investing in supporting \nmanufacturing and where State and local governments are working in \npartnership with the private sector. This may be a small but vital step \ntoward giving the lift we need for our manufacturing sector to continue \nits sustained growth of the last few years.\n  Why is a manufacturing strategy essential? Because we have a couple \nof areas where, frankly, we are falling short--in infrastructure, in \naccess to capital, and in skills. Having a highly skilled manufacturing \nworkforce is one of the things we need to do if we are going to win the \nfight to regain our international prominence as the leading global \nmanufacturing country.\n  The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte, a global consulting firm, \nhave both independently concluded that there are as many as 600,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in America today that are unfilled because of a lack \nof a workforce with the relevant skills. The Society of Manufacturing \nEngineers estimates that number could increased to 3 million by 2015.\n  So a focus through a national strategy and through some facilitating \ninvestments and legislation by this body and the House and by enactment \nby the President and investments across-the-board could deal with these \nimportant skill gaps.\n  Why are there skill gaps in manufacturing? Many Americans have a \nmisconception about what manufacturing is like today. They have a \npicture in their heads of manufacturing from 10, 20, or 30 years ago \nwhen it required simple labor, when it required repeated routine tasks \nsuch as simply putting on a bolt or affixing a particular piece onto a \nvehicle, where there wasn't any teamwork, there wasn't any continuous \nimprovement required, and there weren't analytical skills required. \nThat was the manufacturing line of the past, not of today and certainly \nnot of the future. In fact, the skills required to be successful in \nmodern advanced manufacturing are quite different from what they were \n10, 20, or 30 years ago. Today one has to work as part of a team and be \nable to troubleshoot and problem-solve.\n  There are fewer people working on manufacturing lines, but they are \nhigher in productivity because the analytical skills they are bringing \nto the job are greater than they have ever been before. That is also \nwhy manufacturing can be a more satisfying career, a more rewarding \nplace to work than it was in the past, because it engages the whole \nhuman being. It engages the whole worker. It allows them to have \nownership of the quality of the finished product.\n  One of the lessons American automobile manufacturing learned in the \n1970s, 1980s, and 1990s as it faced the threat of higher quality auto \nmanufacturing elsewhere in the world was to not only retool the \nmanufacturing line but to empower the individual worker to be engaged \nin quality control.\n  Those of us here in the Senate who worked in the manufacturing \nindustry know what it meant to have gone through a process where we had \nto certify. You had to go through a searching auditing process to be \nable to demonstrate, if you were a component supplier or if you were \npart of a supply chain, that you were meeting world-class standards. In \nfact, the ISO 9000 system--the International Organization for \nStandardization--and its 9000 series audits that swept through the \ncountry over 20 years and ended up resulting in a higher quality of \nmanufacturing was just the first of a number of steps toward requiring \nthose who were working in manufacturing facilities to have a higher \nlevel of skills.\n  One of the ways in which we have an ongoing challenge is that \nmanufacturers--medium and small manufacturers with whom I visited up \nand down the State of Delaware--don't know the level of skills and the \nquality of skills of young people they wish to hire who may have just \nfinished high school or might have taken a certificate course with a \ncommunity college. We don't have a transportable, translatable \ncertificate for basic manufacturing skills.\n  One of the innovations of the IT industry was a whole series of \nskills certifications that allow someone to know, when they are hiring \na young person to do office support for IT or when they are hiring \nsomeone to be a network administrator, whether they have the practical \nskills they need to do that job and do it well. They can't guess that \nby where they went to high school or what courses they took at a \ncollege. We don't have a similar sort of reliable, transportable, \ntranslatable, manufacturing skill certification process. That may be a \npart of this national manufacturing strategy.\n  We certainly have heard from manufacturers large and small--not only \nin Delaware but around the country--about what they need, what would \nput a floor beneath their growth and would allow them to be globally \ncompetitive. No. 1 would be a stronger, skilled workforce; No. 2 would \nbe more access to capital; and No. 3 would be more and better access on \na fair basis to a global market and a global economy.\n  We have had a great first couple of weeks with the Manufacturing Jobs \nfor America Initiative. More than 25 Senators have contributed more \nthan 40 bills. Many of these are broad or bold or bipartisan bills that \ncontain the ideas that I think can sustain and grow manufacturing in \nthe United States going forward. It is a growing menu of bills--bills \nthat are bipartisan and that I believe not only need but deserve a vote \non the floor later in this Congress.\n  I am grateful to Senator Kirk for partnering with me in introducing \nthis bill today, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, and I \nam hopeful it will pick up more bipartisan sponsors in the days and \nweeks ahead. I also hope, working in partnership with the Manufacturing \nCaucus, ably led by Senator Stabenow and Senator Graham, we will begin \nto hammer out the bipartisan bills that will deserve a vote on this \nfloor and that will ultimately reach enactment through the Congress and \nby signature of our President. With that, we might well be able to \ndeliver on what we hear most often from our constituents: Help us grow \nhigh-quality jobs in this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. \n        Casey):\n  S. 1714. A bill to impose sanctions with respect to Syria, to expand \nexisting sanctions with respect to Syria, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the Syria \nSanctions Enhancement Act of 2013, which I am very proud to introduce \ntoday, with bipartisan support, joined by my colleagues Senators \nAyotte, Cornyn, and Casey. This bill is a comprehensive effort to \nupdate our existing system of sanctions and to reflect the reality that \nPresident Bashar al-Assad and his murderous regime continue to engage \nin a horrible civil war against the Syrian people.\n  This bill builds upon the longstanding U.S. sanctions regime against \nSyria begun in 2004 to deal with that government's policies supporting \nterrorism, continuing its occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of \nmass destruction and missile programs, and undermining U.S. and \ninternational efforts to stabilize Iraq. Following events in Syria \nbeginning in March of 2011, a series of executive orders have been \nissued to address the ongoing violence and human rights abuses that \nhave been supported and perpetrated relentlessly by the Assad regime. \nFortunately, Congress has come together on a bipartisan basis to \nsanction many people who are committing terrible atrocities. Now is the \ntime to add to those sanctions, to enhance and enforce them, and ensure \nthey encompass everyone who is enabling Assad to continue his massacres \nagainst his own people.\n  I have seen some of the effects of this cruel war in person. Earlier \nthis year, I traveled to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, with \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham, where I saw firsthand\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nhow the Assad regime has torn families and lives apart. I returned home \nfrom that trip convinced, along with my colleagues, that the United \nStates cannot stand idle while this war rages on and over 1 million \nSyrians are displaced from their country--a substantial part--the \nestimates are 30 percent of its entire population displaced from their \nhomes. I remain convinced the United States should take action not only \nwith sanctions but with more effective humanitarian relief. Sanctions \nare an effective way to cut off Assad's financing and therefore his \nsource of power. Humanitarian relief is necessary to aid the Syrian \npeople who have become refugees in such enormous numbers, even as we \npursue those sanctions.\n  Thankfully, most of the world has come together to denounce and \nisolate Assad for his horrible abuses. Appallingly, though, a few--most \nnotably Russian banks--finance Assad and enable his continued \natrocities.\n  In September, Senators Ayotte, Cornyn, Shaheen, and I urged the \nTreasury Department to sanction those Russian banks that are \nperpetrating war in Syria. They are enabling that war as well as the \natrocities it has spawned, and there is significant evidence that some \nRussian banks, including VTB, VEB, and Gazprombank, have given \nfinancial cover to Assad and may still be hiding his assets. This bill, \nthe Syria Sanctions Enhancement Act, would ensure that those actors do \nnot go unpunished. It would sanction financial institutions doing \nbusiness with Assad and his senior officials, and it would also provide \nfor a full accounting of all Assad's assets. If Assad is hiding money \nin Russian banks or elsewhere, we need to know where that money is, \nbecause it rightly belongs to the people of Syria, not to its murderous \ndictator.\n  But our actions against Assad must be wider in scope than simply the \nfinancial sector. Therefore, the Syria Sanctions Enhancement Act looks \nat all the perpetrators of horrific violence who empower Assad and it \ncreates sanctions against them. This bill codifies existing executive \norders that sanction senior Syrian officials and people who sell or \ninvest in the Syrian Government. It sanctions anyone who helps the \nAssad government develop weapons of mass destruction or provides them \nwith conventional weapons. They are responsible for the majority of \nkillings in Syria. They are complicit, and knowingly, purposefully--\nthey are not merely the enablers, they are the providers of those \nassets used by Assad against his own people.\n  We have seen how some unscrupulous arms dealers continue to provide \narms to the Assad regime that enable his killing. Just yesterday, I was \npleased to announce that the Defense Department will stop doing \nbusiness with Rosoboronexport, the arms dealer that is selling weapons \nto Assad. Think of it: The U.S. Government was financing, with U.S. \ntaxpayer money, purchases of helicopters for the Afghan Government, to \ngo to the Afghans with the knowledge that that same Russian export \nagency was selling weapons to Assad. It was stopped, but it is just one \nexample of a company that allows Assad to continue killing his own \npeople.\n  This bill also requires the President to submit a list of people \nresponsible for human rights abuses committed against the people of \nSyria. The President must submit a list of those culpable individuals \nwho should be held accountable for human rights abuses committed by \nAssad against his own people, and the bill will sanction anyone who has \nprovided goods, services or support to enable human rights abuses.\n  As my colleagues can see, this bill would do quite a few things, but \nthere are a number of important things it will not do. It will not \nprevent the United States from supporting the moderates who are \nfighting against the Assad regime, and it would not jeopardize our \nongoing efforts to destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile; rather, \nit creates a strategic framework to ensure that the prolonged \ndismantling of chemical weapons does not serve as a cover for the \ninternational community to ignore the brutal reality of these \nslaughters throughout Syria. The bill is carefully crafted to ensure \nthat the sanctions do not target the people of Syria themselves who are \njust trying to survive during a difficult time. That is why \nhumanitarian relief from this country is of such paramount importance.\n  Over the past few months, there has been a lot of debate over what \nthe United States should or should not do in Syria.\n  Over these past months, the debate has focused on military force and \nmany have been hesitant to use such military force in Syria. But that \ndoes not mean the United States can or should stand idle on the \nsidelines as hundreds of thousands of people are dying and the war \nthreatens to create a wider conflict in the Middle East. I think we can \nall agree, on both sides of the aisle, that we should be strengthening \nsanctions against the human rights abusers and supporters of Assad and \nhis military that is tirelessly, relentlessly, and purposefully \nmurdering his own people.\n  This bill is a bipartisan attempt to move forward around the common \nconcerns of helping the Syrian people. In the coming days, I look \nforward to a debate on this bill and the way forward in Syria as we \nconsider Iran's nuclear program and other important factors. There will \nbe a meeting in Geneva upcoming. I view this bill as a means of \nstrengthening our government's hand as we seek peace in Syria and seek \nto strengthen those forces in Syria that seek to protect their own \npeople.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important effort \nto ensure that the United States continues to stand up and speak out \nstrongly on the side of the people of Syria against a regime that is \nstriving solely and single-mindedly to keep itself in power at all \ncosts, in fact, whatever the cost in the slaughter and displacement of \nits own people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 1717. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \noversight of educational assistance provided under laws administered by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Servicemember \nEducation Reform and Vocational Act of 2013, SERVE. I am pleased \nSenator Chambliss joins me in introducing this bill. This bipartisan \nlegislation will improve the quality of education for our veterans and \nmilitary members.\n  To date, over one million veterans have taken advantage of the Post-\n9/11 GI Bill and $30 billion has been invested. Yet graduation rates \nremain a concern and the unemployment rate among veterans, especially \nyoung veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, remains higher \nthan the national average.\n  As the United States begins to draw down its forces after more than a \ndecade at war, it is more important than ever to demonstrate our \ncommitment to the brave men and women who have served and sacrificed to \nprotect our Nation. An important part of this commitment is ensuring \nour Nation's veterans are prepared for their transition from military \nservice to civilian life.\n  In Virginia, one in every nine individuals is a veteran, and we have \n27 installations across the State, making Virginia as connected to the \nmilitary as any State in the country.\n  As I have travelled throughout Virginia and have had the opportunity \nto meet with servicemembers, veterans, and their families, I have \nlistened to their concerns and ideas. These conversations have \nreinforced my commitment to fight persistent barriers to veterans' \nemployment, and ensure that veterans have access to quality education \nprograms that yield results.\n  For these reasons, it is our responsibility to ensure that the \nNation's investment in veteran education and training yields successful \nresults and gives these men and women the tools they need to succeed in \nthe workforce.\n  I am a strong believer that education is the best investment that any \ncountry can make to ensure the success of its citizens. This is why my \nfirst bill, the TROOP Talent Act, focused on assisting our \nservicemembers and veterans in their efforts to gain civilian \ncredentials and transition into the workforce.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the SERVE Act, is companion \nlegislation that will raise the bar on minimum standards that \neducational institutions\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nmust meet to ensure servicemembers are getting a quality education.\n  The bill will require institutions to disclose information such as \ngraduation rates, withdrawal policies, and program costs to students \nand ensure programs fully deliver what they advertise.\n  The bill will require institutions to provide access to academic and/\nor career counseling for military and veteran students in hopes of not \nonly improving their chances of graduating, but also helping prepare \nthem for future careers.\n  The bill will facilitate the use of VA and DoD educational benefits \nfor employment training programs by creating a 5-State pilot program. \nStates will be charged with developing best practices needed to ensure \nthat quality employment training, apprenticeship, and on-the-job \ntraining programs are available and accessible for beneficiaries of the \npost-9/11 GI Bill program.\n  The bill will require an annual report to relevant Senate and House \nCommittees with disaggregated information on which schools and programs \nveteran and military students are putting their educational benefits \ntoward.\n  Today's veterans have been referred to as ``the next Greatest \nGeneration.'' They answered the call to serve our Nation.\n  They have put it all on the line and invested heavily and personally \nin the future of our country. Let us do everything we can to capitalize \non their experience and character and prepare them for the challenges \nthey and our Nation will face in the future.\n  The SERVE Act will ensure that the educational benefits our veterans \nand military members earned are being spent on quality education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/14/senate-section/article/S8055-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 295--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF \n          OCTOBER 20, 2013 AS THE ``NATIONAL DAY ON WRITING''\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nBennet, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 296\n\n       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Pelican Island in \n     Florida;\n       Whereas, in 2013, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the premier \n     system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the world, \n     and has grown to approximately 150,000,000 acres, 561 \n     national wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management \n     districts in every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the United States, and these protected lands offer a variety \n     of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas, in 2013, 364 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and 303 units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, averaging \n     approximately 2,500,000 hunting visits and nearly 7,000,000 \n     fishing visits each year;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experienced \n     nearly 31,000,000 wildlife observation visits during fiscal \n     year 2013;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas, for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate nearly $5 in economic activity;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     nearly 47,000,000 visits each year, which generated more than \n     $2,400,000,000 and more than 35,000 jobs in local economies \n     during fiscal year 2011;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to \n     outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in \n     funds, which has enabled the purchase or lease of more than \n     5,500,000 acres of wetland habitat for waterfowl and numerous \n     other species in the National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the recovery of 386 threatened and endangered \n     species is supported on refuge lands;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas more than 38,000 volunteers and approximately 220 \n     national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute \n     more than 1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of more \n     than 700 full-time employees, and provide an important link \n     to local communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and one refuge \n     located within an hour drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the United States have \n     held festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek \n     stakeholder input on the implementation of ``Conserving the \n     Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', an update \n     to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife Service for \n     the future of the National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 13, 2013, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service;

consistent \n     with national security requirements, to begin work in \n     positions requiring additional security requirements, such as \n     a full-scope polygraph examination, pending satisfaction of \n     such additional requirements.\n       (e) Benchmarks.--For purposes of carrying out the \n     requirements of this section, the Secretary of Defense and \n     the Director of

government and the \n     private sector.\n       (2) The costs due to lost productivity in inefficiencies in \n     such transitions arising from personnel security clearance \n     matters.\n       (f) Comptroller General Review.--\n       (1) Review required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall carry out a review of the personnel \n     security process.\n       (2) Objective of review.--The objective of the review \n     required by paragraph (1) shall be to identify the following:\n       (A) Differences between the metrics used by the Department \n     of Defense, the Suitability and Security Clearance \n     Performance and Accountability Council, and the Office of\n\n[[Page

processes agencies have implemented for resolving \n     incomplete or subpar investigations, and the actions taken \n     against government employees and contractor personnel who \n     have demonstrated a consistent failure to abide by quality \n     assurance measures.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the \n     results of the review required by paragraph (1).\n       (g) Task Force on Records Access for Security
