Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                              Wasting Time\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a lot of people within the sound of my voice \nwill not understand what I speak about, which is having an emergency \nbrake or a parking brake on a car. It used to be standard procedure. \nPeople would pull out the emergency brake, and 99 percent of the time \npeople would remember to release it before they took off, but sometimes \npeople would forget and that car would still go forward, but it didn't \ngo forward very well. In fact, it would start smoking--``Oh, I forgot \nto turn that off.''\n  So emergency brakes, what do they have to do with us in the Senate? \nWhat it has to do with us is that it appears the Republicans in the \nSenate have intentionally left on the emergency brake. For everything \nwe try to do, it is similar to when we used to drive a car and have the \nemergency brake on. It doesn't move right. It moves very slowly.\n  Throughout President Obama's time in office, the Republican \nleadership in the Senate has done its best to keep the brakes engaged, \nslowing any effort to legislate on even the most bipartisan bills. We \nshould be passing legislation that strengthens our economy and protects \nworking families instead of wasting hundreds of hours--hundreds of \nhours--as we struggle to perform one of our most basic duties, \nconfirming Presidential nominees.\n  Last year, in response to unprecedented--I repeat, unprecedented--\nRepublican obstruction, the Senate was forced to change its rules to \nensure that some of the President's nominees received the up-or-down \nvote they deserve. I am so happy that change was made. It has allowed \nthe Senate to make substantial progress on one of its primary \nfunctions. Positions that were once vacant for months--even years--are \nnow staffed with qualified and competent public servants.\n  In spite of our having changed the rules, the Republicans are still \ncontinuing to try to slow everything down.\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nAgain, the brakes are on, and they only have one reason I can come up \nwith for doing this. It is not that they dislike the President's \nnominees; it is that they want to do everything they can to slow down \nhis administration, to make him look bad and to make Senate Democrats \nlook bad, because they believe that even though they are the cause of \nthe obstruction everybody will say: The Democrats control the Senate, \nwhy aren't they doing more?\n  We can't do more because they have put on the brakes, even though we \nchanged the rules and are moving through judges especially very \nquickly.\n  For the viewing audience, on a judge they can only stall for 1 hour, \nand they usually do. On circuit court judges they get 30 hours, and \nthey take up all of those 30 hours, even though they wind up voting for \nthe judge. On Cabinet nominations they get 30 hours. On subcabinet \nofficers they get 8 hours. That is in the rules. We changed some of the \nrules, but we didn't change that. In hindsight--we will have to wait \nand see. If they are going to continue this, we will have to take \nanother look at that. It is outrageous what they have done.\n  We have made substantial progress, as I have said, on one of our \nprimary functions. The Senate is continuing its progress confirming \nthese nominees in spite of the Republicans putting up roadblock after \nroadblock. Instead of seeing how their needless obstruction has hurt \nour country and working with us to confirm these vital nominations, the \nRepublican leadership has responded with what can only be described as \na temper tantrum, I guess. I don't know what else to call it. We have \nalready established that they are trying to do it to make us look bad \nand the President look bad, but think what it is doing and what it has \ndone to our country.\n  They are mad about a lot of things, I guess. The No. 1 thing they are \nmad about is Obama was reelected. Remember, Frank Luntz called a \nmeeting here 3 days after Obama was first elected. He said: We have two \nthings we are going to do--and all the Republican big shots were here--\nNo. 1, we are going to make sure Obama isn't reelected. That was a \nflop. No. 2, we are going to oppose everything the President wants, and \nthat is what they have done and continue to do.\n\n  I have said this before and I will say it again. The first Congress \nwe had a lot of Democrats--58, 59, and for a short period of time we \nhad 60--and we had some moderate Republicans with whom we could work, \nbut they are gone except Susan Collins. They are gone. So even though \nthat first Congress was extremely productive, the next two have been \nthwarted by the obstructionism we have encountered for everything we \nhave tried to do.\n  The Republican leader is obviously now resorting to a tactic that I \nguess they decided to do in the Frank Luntz meeting; that is, just \ntrying to run out the clock. As in a football game, if there is only 1 \nminute left to go, they say let's just run out the clock or a \nbasketball game or, as we saw over the last few weeks, a soccer game. \nStall it. We are ahead. It is tied. That is where we need to stay.\n  They are just trying to run out the clock. Instead of killing time on \nthe scoreboard, the Republican leader is using the cloture clock to \nkill the remaining 6 months of this Congress. They want just to go \naway, preventing nominees from getting confirmed and thwarting \nDemocrats from passing legislation that is good for the middle class.\n  Would it be good for the middle class to raise the minimum wage? Of \ncourse. It would be great. Would it be good for the American public to \nhave it so my daughter, for instance, if she does the same job your son \ndoes, that they get paid the same amount of money? They filibustered \nthat. They stopped that. How about student loans? Student loans are the \nhighest debt in America today--almost $1.3 trillion--and we tried to \nremedy that, make it better for students and of course their families \nwho are paying and have paid over the years for these large loans. \nFilibuster; extended unemployment benefits, filibuster.\n  So they are doing this to make the President look bad, make us look \nbad, but they are still running out the clock. That is what they are \ntrying to do.\n  Again, so people understand, we get cloture with a simple majority. \nThey can stall for many hours. As I said, circuit court judges get 30 \nhours, nominees for Cabinet posts get 30 hours, 8 hours for subcabinet, \nand only an hour on other judges. If we take a close look at how they \nhave utilized the time we have wasted--let's say the last 2 months the \nSenate has been in session--Senate Republicans have forced us to waste \nalmost 10 days, more than half the time we have been in session. They \nhave wasted 236 hours in order to slow the confirmation of President \nObama's nominations--236 hours. Of those 236 hours, Senate Republicans \nhave used 5 hours to actually come to the Senate floor and debate the \nqualifications of these nominees. The rest of the time we sit, as the \nviewing public sees, in these quorum calls, where we do nothing. For \nevery hour they have debated these nominations, the Senate Republicans \nhave wasted 46 hours just killing time. Mr. President, 5 hours out of \n236 hours is the time they have actually used.\n  To further highlight the absurdity of their obstruction, the \nRepublicans have voted overwhelmingly to confirm most all of these same \nnominees they have obstructed and filibustered. So far this year \nRepublicans have blocked immediate confirmation of 22 nominations they \nlater voted unanimously to confirm.\n  Why are they blocking these nominations they all support? They just \nwant to slow things down. They want everybody to look bad. They know \nthey are not in control--that is what the American public feels--even \nthough they have all of these rules they force procedural gimmicks we \nhave to work our way through. There is no other way to look at what \nRepublicans are doing. This is obstruction for obstruction's sake. The \nRepublican leader is desperate to keep this emergency brake on, hoping \nthat by slowing down every Senate process imaginable, he can run out \nthe remaining 6 months and damage Obama. The harm it does to our \ncountry, I guess, is not in their calculation. He is playing a very \ndangerous political game at the expense of this great country and of \ncourse the American taxpayer.\n  The Senate currently has a backlog of 131 nominees who have been \nlanguishing on the Senate calendar for an average of 281 days--281 \ndays. It is particularly outrageous that they are stopping us from \nconfirming noncontroversial career Foreign Service officers and \nambassadors.\n  What does this mean, a career Foreign Service officer? The Presiding \nOfficer has been in government a number of years. He has been Governor \nof one of the larger populated States in the country. He has been in \nthe U.S. Senate. The Presiding Officer has seen--I am convinced of \nthis--young men and women who decide they want to go into the Foreign \nService. They are the brightest of the brightest. They do extremely \nwell in school. They have these tests they have to pass, written and \noral. They speak and learn many different languages. They have been \nwaiting their whole career to be named an ambassador. It is a huge \nthing. It is like being selected to go to the Super Bowl or to be on \nthe Pro Bowl team. But when it comes time to get this position they \nhave worked for for their whole career, they are being held up.\n\n  These are ambassadors to places that need American diplomats. You \nneed a boss. Twenty, 25 percent of the ambassadorial spots in Africa \nthey have blocked. These are not political nominees. Most of them are \ncareer nominees. They are Republicans and Democrats. When these \nambassadors are chosen, they are not chosen based on their political \nparty. They are chosen on merit. We have places such as Honduras, \nQatar, Vietnam where we do not have ambassadors.\n  They are even blocking the Department of Defense, the Navy, the Air \nForce. They are at the mercy of the Republican leader's clock-killing \nobstruction. American interests abroad and the defense of our Nation \nare forced to take a back seat while Republican leadership hopes to \nmake political gains by running out this clock.\n  So after having returned from the Fourth of July--this country's \nbirthday--I urge Republicans to stop this needless obstruction. What is \nto be gained by needlessly grinding the Senate to a halt? The only \nthing I can see\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nis they think they are going to hurt President Obama, who they are so \nupset because he got reelected and reelected very easily.\n  I say to them, if you oppose a nominee, let's have a debate on the \nnomination and then vote. Do not delay a vote on a career Foreign \nService officer who has worked his or her entire life to become an \nambassador. Do not delay national security personnel who are needed to \nprotect our Nation. Do not delay key staff people at the Cabinet level \nfrom doing their work for the American people.\n  I do not expect Republicans to give their unanimous consent to every \nnominee on the calendar. Rather, Senate Democrats are asking that \nRepublicans legislate in good faith. Let's look at these. If there is \nsomething wrong with them, let's debate them. If nominees are deserving \nof their unanimous support--and most of them come out of the committees \nunanimously--why waste the Senate's time by blocking confirmation of \nthese individuals? There is no reason for doing that.\n  We have so much to address over the coming weeks. We are going to \nvote on the sportsmen's bill tonight. We have the highway bill, the \nemergency supplemental, manufacturing legislation. We are going to do \nsomething about the Hobby Lobby legislation we need to correct. There \nis so much we have to do. We have terrorism insurance. We have to do \nthat. The Export-Import Bank, we have to do that. But we are being \nstopped from doing all of that.\n  We have more than enough to keep us busy. That is an understatement. \nSo what we are doing, instead of doing the things necessary for the \nAmerican people, is we are being forced, because of the obstruction of \nthe Republicans, to sit here and struggle through a few nominations \nthat we can work out by spending 8 hours on this one, 4 hours on that \none, 30 hours on this one. It is really unfair to the American people.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the crisis at our border continues \nunabated. It is a crisis that should never ever have occurred. It \noccurred as a direct result of the failure of the leadership of the \nUnited States, the clarity of our message, and our willingness to \nenforce simple, plain immigration laws.\n  Last week, we reached the point where the President of the United \nStates--who is directly responsible for sending messages and effecting \npolicies that encourage the flow of immigration to the United States, \nannounced he would be asking Congress--us--to cooperate with him and \nprovide him with $2 billion in additional funds to deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis--a crisis, as I indicated, that was produced as a \nresult of his activities.\n  In the same breath at that moment when he asked for more money to \ntake care of the crisis, he announced he will deliberately and openly \ngo around the Congress of the United States and the Constitution and \nunilaterally change immigration law again through an executive policy.\n  The President said:\n\n       . . . today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of \n     our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress. \n     As a first step, I'm directing the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and the Attorney General [directing them] to move \n     available and appropriate resources from our interior to the \n     border.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       I have also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General \n     Holder to identify additional actions my administration can \n     take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do \n     what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our \n     immigration system as we can. I expect their recommendations \n     before the end of the summer and I intend to adopt those \n     recommendations without further delay.\n\n  The problem is that we have laws. Congress has established laws. The \nPresident wanted to change those laws, and Congress made a decision. \nThe decision was not to change those laws, and those laws remain in \neffect. As President of the United States of America, he has the \nhighest duty to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully \nexecuted.\n  Remember now, the President is the chief law enforcement officer in \nAmerica. The FBI answers to him, the Drug Enforcement Administration \nanswers to him, the Department of Justice--he appoints the top \nofficials, and they answer to him. So does Border Patrol, and so do \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers, immigration officers \nthroughout, and the Secretary of Homeland Security. It is his \nadministration, and he has used powers to go beyond--that I am aware \nof--what any President has used to basically declare: I will not \nenforce the laws passed by Congress. I am going to change those laws--I \ndon't have to change them; I am just going to direct my officers not to \ncarry them out, not to enforce them.\n  Another thing he said was that young people here would not be \ndeported. He invited a number of them to the White House. As a result, \nthe word got out in Central America particularly that if you come to \nthe United States as a young person--a parent could bring them or \nbrother and sister--and you get into the United States, you will not be \ndeported; you will be allowed to stay, and you could get a permiso--\nthat is, you would be released on bail into some family member's \ncustody and you could show up at some point in the future to have a \nhearing. I have heard it is maybe as many as 500 days before a hearing \noccurs. And who is going to go and look for these individuals when they \ndon't show up for court, as is continuously happening in high numbers, \nnot showing up for court?\n  So to me it is disturbing that we are in this situation. And make no \nmistake about it--$2 billion is a lot of money. We work hard around \nhere to try to pay for things we need to by saving money here and \nsaving money there, and now the President just sends over a message: I \nam going to demand $2 billion.\n  We have to take care of the children. We can't leave them in a \ncircumstance where they are not fed or taken care of or in a safe \ncondition. I guess we will have to find some money to do that. But the \nquestion is, How did it happen? Why did it happen? And $2 billion is \nmore than the general fund budget of the State of Alabama, which is \nwhere I am from. An extra $2 billion is a lot of money--extra money \nthis year. Why? Because in 2011 we had 6,000 unaccompanied children \napprehended at the border, and this year we are projected to have \n90,000. That is why the President says we need $2 billion more--because \nthe message got out, the word got out: You can come to America and, as \na young person, you won't be deported.\n  In fact--and Congress doesn't know it fully at this point, but, in \nfact, that is true. Young people coming to America unlawfully from \nCentral and South America, other than Mexico, are being allowed to \nstay, and it encourages more.\n  We have to have a lawful system of immigration, a system that serves \nthe national interests. A lawful system means one that is carried out \neffectively and efficiently. It is wrong and it is immoral to create a \nsystem in which there is no law, where laws are violated willy-nilly \nand nothing is ever done about it. That is not healthy at all for any \nnation, and I would submit clearly that any nation must maintain the \nintegrity of its borders. Failing to do so undermines the very \nsovereignty of that nation. No nation in the world that I am aware of \nmaintains open borders. If you are not going to maintain open borders, \nthen you have to set up standards for application and admission, and \nthen if you establish those standards, you have to carry them out \nfairly and objectively.\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\n  There are millions of people who have applied to come to America who \nare waiting in line, people with college degrees and relatives here, \nwho have applied lawfully and are waiting their turn. And how is it \nright, how can it be justified morally, religiously, as a matter of \npublic policy, as a matter of law that we just ignore them and let \npeople come through by the hundreds of thousands?\n  Indeed, it has been projected that unless something changes--and I \nthink it could change if we have leadership--unless changes occur, we \ncould have as many as 140,000 young people come next year. I guess that \nwould be $4 billion extra that would have to be funded next year to \ntake care of the costs. It is an unbelievable turn of events.\n  My staff and I did a time line months ago, before this crisis became \nso imminent, and we documented a series of actions in which the \nPresident of the United States has directed his agencies to conduct \ntheir operations in such a way that it undermines the laws of the \nUnited States. This is 39 pages.\n  One of the first ones--and I talked about it at the time and the \nramifications that would occur from it, and nobody paid much attention. \nBack in January of 2009 President Obama took office. He had talked to \nactivist groups throughout the country and he had made a promise to \nthem. Not long after he took office, immigration enforcement officers \nexecuted a raid--which they had been doing over a period of years and \nalways been able to do--on an engine machine shop in Bellingham, WA, \nand detained 28 illegal immigrants who were using fake Social Security \nnumbers and identity documents.\n  Shortly thereafter, pro-amnesty groups--these activist groups--\ncriticized the administration for enforcing the law. An unidentified \nofficial at the Department of Homeland Security was quoted in the \nWashington Times as saying this about the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity: ``The secretary is not happy and this is not her policy . . . \n'' Instead of enforcing the law, the Secretary investigated the ICE \nofficers, who were simply doing their jobs.\n  Esther Olavarria, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, said on a \nphone call with employers and pro-amnesty groups that ``we're not doing \nraids or audits under this administration.'' That was a huge \nabandonment of a normal and natural law enforcement procedure to create \na lawful system of immigration right out of the chute--a direct result, \nin my opinion, of promises made during the campaign, not for law \nenforcement reasons, not for the national interests of the United \nStates.\n  It goes on.\n  In January 2009 the Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, \ndelayed an E-Verify compliance deadline. She delayed the E-Verify \ndeadline a second time. She delayed the E-Verify a third time.\n  It goes on, page after page of activities in which they took steps to \nundermine law.\n  In June 2010 the Obama administration sued Arizona. The State was \ntrying to help enforce Federal immigration law, and they sued the State \nof Arizona. They sued any other State that attempted to do anything \nthat would enhance law enforcement.\n  In January 2010 the Obama administration ignored the dangerous \n``sanctuary cities'' policy. Amazingly, in this country we have cities \nthat are providing sanctuary to people who are illegally in the \ncountry. Law enforcement arrests someone who is here illegally, they \nconvict them of a crime--I was a Federal prosecutor for many years--\nthey hold them and then turn them over to the Federal law enforcement \nofficers for deportation. But then these cities refuse to do that. \nNothing was done about it, and this administration took no action--in \nfact, seemed to encourage it, frankly.\n  In March 2011, ICE Director John Morton issued the first of a series \nof memoranda systematically weakening their enforcement deportation \nprocedures, essentially implementing an ``administrative amnesty.'' He \nissued two more amnesty memos in July 2011.\n  In December 2011 reports surfaced that the Obama administration would \nreduce the National Guard at the border. President Bush had beefed up \nour enforcement and sent a pretty good message that we were getting \nserious about the border. We were making some progress when he was \ndoing that, but by December 2011 the Obama administration had begun to \nreduce the National Guard's presence, which has now been eliminated at \nthe border.\n  On June 15, 2012, President Obama bypassed Congress and in effect \nunilaterally implemented the DREAM Act--legislation that had twice or \nthree times been brought before this Congress and failed to pass--\ndealing with children who enter the country before the age of 16 and \nwho can prove how old they were when they entered, who can prove how \nlong they have been here. The legislation was poorly drafted, it was \nrejected by Congress on more than one occasion, and the President just \nsaid to his officers: Don't enforce it with regard to these young \npeople. Don't deport anybody you apprehend who claims they entered the \ncountry before they were age 16 or 17 or 18.\n  Who knows what year it would be.\n  This was really the beginning of the message to the people in Central \nAmerica particularly that young people weren't going to be deported--\nthe direct action that led to the crisis we have today--and I pointed \nthat out at the time and others did.\n  Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, wrote a letter \nlast May warning: We are seeing a surge of young people.\n  As I said, there are 39 pages with multiple actions on some of those \npages--actions that were taken by the President's staff and underlings \nthat undermined and weakened the ability of our immigration laws to be \ncarried out effectively, consistently, and fairly. It is a terrible \nthing, and now we have this crisis today.\n  According to a new report from the Los Angeles Times--which, I have \nto say, is probably one of the more knowledgeable papers, if not the \nmost knowledgeable paper in America concerning immigration issues. They \nissued a report that deportation of illegal immigrant youth has fallen \ndramatically under the current administration even as the flow of \nillegal youth into the United States has exponentially increased.\n  Just this weekend, they wrote this:\n\n       President Obama and his aides have repeatedly sought to \n     dispel the rumors driving thousands of children and teens \n     from Central America to cross the U.S. border each month with \n     the expectation they will be given a permiso and allowed to \n     stay.\n       But under the Obama administration, those reports have \n     proved increasingly true.\n\n  Data from the paper shows that the number of illegal youth from \nCentral America who were apprehended averaged around 4,000 per year \nover the last decade. So the newspaper points out that over the last \ndecade we have apprehended about 4,000 youth per year. Some reports \nsuggest that the number could reach 90,000 this year--an increase of \nmore than 2,000 percent. Yet since 2008 deportation of illegal youth \nhas dropped roughly 80 percent. So we have an 80 percent drop in the \ndeportation while we have seen a 2000 percent increase in the number \ncoming unlawfully. Does this not tell us something? Is this acceptable? \nIsn't this a guarantee that we will see more people attempt to come to \nAmerica unlawfully in the future? In May of last year, 2013, Chris \nCrane, the president of the ICE union, wrote a letter and he warned \nabout the increasing number of young people coming in as a result of \nthe President's unilateral imposition of rules to block enforcement of \nimmigration law with regard to young people. In October 2013 numbers \nwere already beginning to surge. That was obvious.\n\n  In January of this year, the Department of Homeland Security laid out \nproposals for bids for a contract to private companies that would \nhandle as many as 65,000 young people coming into the country \nunlawfully. So in January they were well aware of what was happening. \nWas any action taken in May of last year or October of last year or \nJanuary of this year to confront honestly what it was that was causing \nsuch an increase of immigration from our Latin American countries and \nCentral America, primarily? The answer is no. So now what we have is an \nemergency demand for $2 billion to deal with the crisis--just a sad \nevent, really. I wish it hadn't happened.\n  But you cannot play games with law enforcement. I spent too many \nyears as a federal prosecutor--almost 15, really. You have to have \nclarity of law. People have to understand it, and they have to believe \nthat if they violate the law they will be apprehended. So we have\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nthis bizarre event where noncitizens can come into the country in \nviolation of our laws, plain and simple, and they are given amnesty and \nforgiven and not prosecuted. But a citizen who doesn't pay a few \ndollars of our taxes or violates a speeding ticket or gets a DUI can go \nto jail. So how can this possibly be justified in any moral or legal \nsense? I just don't think it can.\n  The situation is so bad and so sad that we had Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Jeh Johnson before the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a \nmember, and I pressed him. He said: Well, we don't want young people \ncoming to America because it is dangerous. I said: ``What about it \nbeing a violation of the law?'' He sort of avoided that. I asked him \nagain and I pressed him. He finally said: Well, it would be against the \nlaw. But he didn't clearly state that if you come to the United States \nunlawfully you will be deported if you are apprehended. He didn't deny \nthat people who come to the country today--young people--if they are \nentering in they are given to HHS, they are released to the custody of \nsome adult relative that may show up or housed by the government and \neventually are unlikely to ever leave the country under their policies.\n  The moderator of ``Meet The Press'' pressed him about this. Mr. \nGregory said:\n\n       Critics say you are not stemming the tide fast enough. This \n     number's going to grow wherever it ends up. The bottom line \n     is what happens now? Are you prepared to deport these \n     children, young mothers. . . . Are you prepared to deport \n     them?\n\n  Isn't that a good question to the man that heads Homeland Security, \nwhose responsibility it is to enforce our immigration law?\n  Now, I will acknowledge I opposed Mr. Johnson's confirmation. I don't \nthink he had ever met an immigration officer in his life or a Border \nPatrol officer in his life and never had any experience in this. He was \nactive politically with counsel for Department of Defense, but he had \nno experience in these matters. So did Mr. Johnson give us straight \nanswers to this question? His answer was this:\n\n       Our message to those who come here illegally: Our border is \n     not open to illegal migration. And we are taking a number of \n     steps to address it, including turning people around faster. \n     We've already dramatically reduced the turnaround time, the \n     deportation time. For the adults we're asking this week for a \n     supplement for Congress, from Congress, to bring on \n     additional capacity. And we're cracking down on the smuggling \n     organizations.\n\n  Mr. Gregory said:\n\n       Do they need to be deported? Or I've seen some reporting \n     suggesting that more than half of them could end up staying \n     in the United States.\n\n  That is a plain question.\n  Secretary Johnson said:\n\n       The law requires that, when DHS identifies somebody as a \n     child, as an unaccompanied child, we turn them over to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services. But there is a \n     deportation proceeding that is commenced against the child. \n     Now that proceeding can take some time. And so we are looking \n     at options, added flexibility, to deal with the children in \n     particular, but in a humanitarian and fair way.\n\n  Mr. Gregory:\n\n       Well, I'm sorry. . . . I mean it sounds like a very careful \n     response. Are they going to be deported or not?\n\n  Secretary Johnson:\n\n       There is a deportation proceeding that is commenced against \n     illegal migrants, including children. We are looking at ways \n     to create additional options for dealing with the children in \n     particular, consistent with our laws and values.\n\n  Mr. Gregory: ``I'm trying to get an answer to, `Will most of them end \nup staying, in your judgment?' ''\n  Mr. Johnson:\n\n       I think we need to find more efficient effective ways to \n     turn this tide around, generally. And we've already begun to \n     do that.\n\n  Mr. Gregory:\n\n       But what does that mean? Are you saying it is impractical \n     to deport all of them who are here now?\n\n  Secretary Johnson, our chief law enforcement officer, still does not \nsay they will be deported.\n\n       I'm saying that we've already dramatically reduced the \n     turnaround time for adults and we are in the process of doing \n     that for the adults with the kids. We're looking at \n     additional options for the kids in particular.\n\n  Mr. Gregory:\n\n       To deport them or to settle them here in America? Is the \n     goal of the administration to settle as many of these kids in \n     America as possible? What about those who are here now? What \n     is the goal of the administration, to settle them in America \n     or deport them . . . ?\n\n  Secretary Johnson: ``There is a deportation proceeding pending \nagainst everyone who comes into the country illegally and apprehended \nat the border.''\n  Look, this is a top law enforcement officer. This is the top law \nenforcement officer with regard to immigration in America. He is the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and answers directly to the President of \nthe United States. He could not say: Do not come to America unlawfully. \nIt violates our laws. We cannot accept that. If you do so you will be \ndeported. If you bring children, you both are going to be deported. Why \ncouldn't he say that? He couldn't say it because they have had no \nserious policy to effectuate the law which is current law since he has \nbeen in office and before, really. They just don't want to say it. It \nis just stunning to me that you cannot have clarity and leadership in \nthe top people in our government, and I am concerned about it.\n  So this Congress is going to have to wrestle with how to participate \nin doing something positive about the unlawfulness at our border. I \nwish we had a partner in the chief law enforcement officer of America, \nthe President of the United States and his assistant, Secretary Jeh \nJohnson, but we do not. They have no intention of enforcing the law \neffectively and consistently. It demeans the respect this Nation should \nhave in the world. It undermines one of the most remarkable valuable \ncharacteristics of America, and that is our commitment to the rule of \nlaw. It is a direct affront to the rule of law. They directly undermine \nthe sovereignty of our Nation. If you don't control your border, you \ndon't control your sovereignty, and it is just wrong. It is not right. \nWe are not able to accept everybody that would like to come to \nAmerica--we just cannot.\n  We have the most generous immigration system in the world. We admit a \nmillion each year under lawful application processes. We admit another \n600,000-plus under the guest worker program to come and take jobs that \nwe need to put Americans in. Over half a million of these are not just \nfarm workers--only 20 percent of that 600,000-plus are farm workers. \nMost of them are taking jobs throughout the economy. At this point in \ntime with high unemployment and falling wages, this is not a policy \nthat serves our national interest. We just simply cannot do that. It \nmakes businesses happy. They like an overflow of workers that helps \nkeep wages lower, but it is not the right thing to be doing for working \nAmericans.\n  So as a nation we have a challenge, and Congress is going to have to \nassert itself. Congress passes laws. The President executes the laws. \nIt is his duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed, and they \nare not being faithfully executed. In fact, they are being eviscerated \nby policy after policy after policy.\n  One of the top immigration officials declared: ``If somebody gets \ninto America and passes the border, they are virtually unlikely ever to \nbe deported, adult or child.''\n  This is a direct result of the President's policies. We do not need \nto continue them. In the course of this crisis, I hope we will act with \nconcern for those young people who are here, but I hope we will use \nthis opportunity as a Congress to assert our legitimate rights as the \nlawmaking branch, and in a bipartisan way, the Republicans and \nDemocrats will defend and assert to the President that he must enforce \nthe laws that we, the Congress, pass. He does not get to on his own \nexecute alterations in the fundamental law of America.\n  There was an internal memorandum, I believe, and this internal \nmemorandum from the Department of Homeland Security said people with \nchildren were asked why they were coming. You have heard it said \nbecause there is more violence and crime in Central America this year \nthan last year. That is not so. They interviewed these people and what \ndid they tell them? According to this memorandum 95 percent of them \nsaid they came because they heard if they came to America with children \nthey would be able to stay and they would be given a permiso--in other \nwords, released on\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nbail--and they wouldn't have to come back for a hearing and they would \nbe in the country.\n  The stories are quite clear from the investigative officers that \npeople are crossing the border with children and they go right up to \nthe Border Patrol officers and turn themselves in. The Border Patrol \nofficers turn them over to Homeland Security, and Homeland Security \ndoesn't deport them. They set them up for some sort of trial or \nhearing, which may take up to 500 days. Then they find a place for them \nand they take care of them. It is just the kind of process that makes \nno sense for a serious Nation. That is all I am saying.\n  Why are we seeing this large number again? It is because they believe \nit works. And in fact it is working. In fact, young people who are \ncoming in with their parents or brothers or uncles or aunts are coming \ninto the country and both of them are staying. Nobody is really being \ndeported, and they don't intend to leave.\n  The President created this policy, and now it has caused a national \ncrisis. I hope we can do better. I hope in the course of the discussion \nwe can improve on our law and find some strength for the President and \nput some strength behind our law enforcement in America.\n  Chairman Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nHouse, has made a strong statement. He said he simply cannot provide \nmoney until we have clarity that we are going to be taking action in \nthis country that will keep this from happening in the future. We \ncertainly need to do that, and if we do, I am more optimistic than a \nlot of people.\n\n  I truly believe if we follow up aggressively and start promptly \nreporting people who come here illegally instead of talking about it \nand not releasing them on bail on permisos, the word will get out in \nCentral America just as it got out that they could come and stay. The \nmessage that will get out will tell them: Don't come here or you will \ntake a risk. You will lose your money, you will lose everything you \ninvested in this attempt, and you will be sent back. If we do that, the \nnumbers will start to fall, and we might be surprised how fast those \nnumbers would fall. It would be good for public policy and the rule of \nlaw.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, at a time when vital defense programs are \nthreatened due to a lack of funding, the Federal Government has wasted \nbillions of dollars attempting to procure new large information \ntechnology systems, consistently disregarding lessons learned from past \nfailures and well-established acquisition best practices.\n  Even with a current annual budget of $80 billion for information \ntechnology projects, the Federal Government struggles to make those \nsystems work. The American people can still remember the embarrassing \nfailure of healthcare.gov, the Obama administration's most recent \ninformation technology fiasco. What they may not realize is the Health \nand Human Services' healthcare.gov mess is not unique and is, in an \nimportant sense, merely business as usual in how the government, \nparticularly the Department of Defense, acquires large information \ntechnology systems.\n  The Pentagon is responsible for many of the most egregious cases of \nwasted taxpayer dollars when it comes to government information \ntechnology programs. Lack of planning for these acquisitions within the \nArmed Forces has made the adoption of new information technology \nsystems an expensive and risky endeavor. The Air Force's Expeditionary \nCombat Support System, or ECSS, is a prime example of how a system \ndesigned to save money can actually waste billions of taxpayer dollars \nwithout producing any usable capability.\n  Today the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a \nbipartisan report on the failed acquisition of the ECSS, a program that \nwas supposed to decrease costs and increase efficiencies by \nconsolidating the Air Force's hundreds of legacy logistic systems into \na single new system.\n  It is important to recognize that what happened with ECSS is not an \nisolated case of incompetence. Unfortunately, it is one of the many \nexamples that show how billions of dollars can be wasted if the \nintended acquisition is not started off right with a detailed plan that \nincludes clear, stable requirements and achievable milestones supported \nby realistic original cost estimates and reliable assessments of risk.\n  The subcommittee's report notes that the Air Force started the ECSS \nacquisition in 2004 with the goal of obtaining a single \n``transformational'' unified logistics and supply chain management \nsystem that would allow the Air Force to track all of its physical \nassets worldwide, from airplanes, to fuel, to spare parts. These types \nof computer platforms; that is, large business systems that companies \nuse to make their businesses operate more efficiently, are known as \nenterprise resource planning systems or ERPs. Basically, ECSS was \nsupposed to be an enterprise resource planning system that would have \ncombined all of the Air Force's global logistics and its associated \nsupply chain management activities under one streamlined management \ninformation technology system.\n  As the Department of Defense's overall strategy to become fully \nauditable hinges on how successfully it procures and integrates these \nsystems into its business enterprises, failures such as the ECSS are \nnot only costly to the taxpayer but also disastrous to the Department's \nlarger financial improvement efforts.\n  To keep costs down, the Air Force intended to build its new ERP \nsystem using already available commercial software instead of a \nsoftware system designed from scratch. That type of commercial \nsoftware, however, works best when the organization using it follows \nefficient business processes. In order to take advantage of the \ncommercial software that supported ECSS, the Air Force needed to \ndramatically change longstanding internal business processes that \nsupported how it managed global logistics and its associated supply \nchain.\n  That never happened. Unfortunately, the culture of resistance to \nchange in the Air Force made it difficult to make those changes. The \nAir Force needed strong leaders who could communicate not only the \ngoals of ECSS to end users and get their buy-in but also develop sound \nprogram management strategies to overcome resistance to change among \nthose lower level personnel. Ultimately, the leaders of the ECSS \nProgram did not effectively communicate with the end users. Without \ntheir buy-in, ECSS was doomed to fail before it even started.\n  Because the Air Force had not adequately planned what needed to be \ndone to procure ECSS effectively, it was easier for program managers to \norder changes in configuration that in effect customized the commercial \nsoftware on the fly rather than alter the Air Force's own culture. That \ncaused costs to skyrocket and delivery schedules to slip.\n  The Air Force's eagerness for expensive customization was especially \ntroubling given that as early as 2004, the Air Force identified the \nneed to avoid customizing the commercial software lest costs explode. \nBut in the end, it failed to heed its own advice. The subcommittee \nreport finds that the Air Force's customization of the commercial \nsoftware was a major root cause of ECSS's failure.\n  Such customization could have been avoided had the Air Force fully \nand timely implemented a congressionally mandated procedure for \nimproving its operations called business process reengineering. \nBusiness process reengineering, which is a proven private\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\nsector management approach, offers a structured way to introduce major \nnew changes into an organization to help it run more efficiently and \nensures that careful planning goes into every stage. Not infrequently, \nFortune 500 companies use business process reengineering to, for \nexample, restructure existing business units to work more efficiently, \npassing resulting savings on to consumers and to absorb effectively new \nbusiness units from companies they have acquired or merged with to \nmaintain overall competitiveness in the marketplace.\n  Had the Air Force actually used business process reengineering in \nconnection with the ECSS; that is, redesigned those business processes \nthat needed to be changed for the Air Force to absorb its commercial \noff-the-shelf software effectively, the risk identified in 2004 would \nhave been consciously addressed at each stage of the procurement, not \nessentially disregarded for 8 years.\n  In its 2004 risk assessment, the Air Force also identified a lack of \nstable program requirements as a risk to the program. That risk, too, \nwas not accounted for. From the beginning of the ECSS procurement, the \nAir Force failed to properly define and stabilize the program's \nrequirements, what the system would do, and how it would do it. Even \nthose who were going to use ECSS felt as though they were in the dark. \nIn 2008, 4 years later, a technician stated: ``My [number one] \ncomplaint is that E.C.S.S. has yet to identify . . . any time line [for \nwhen] we can expect to receive detailed information [or] requirements \nabout what E.C.S.S. will provide.'' This user's complaint reflects the \nlack of planning that went into the Air Force's attempt to procure \nECSS.\n  To this day, the Air Force still does not know how many legacy \nsystems it actually has on hand, let alone the number that ECSS was to \nreplace. The Air Force's lack of knowledge about its current \ninformation technology systems led to confusion when it tried to \nconstruct a replacement. That is why I offered an amendment to the \nNDAA--the National Defense Authorization Act--for fiscal year 2015 that \nwould require program personnel to have a proper understanding of \nexisting legacy systems and clear goals in connection with its efforts \nto procure new information technology systems, but more has to be done.\n  The subcommittee's report recommends the Department of Defense should \nalso start assessing how much BPR would need to be done--and how \nfeasibly it can be done--earlier in the acquisition lifecycle of these \nERPs. Also, investment review boards, which are critically important \ngovernance tools used in connection with the Department's efforts to \nprocure ERPs, should be integrated into the budgeting process when \nthese programs begin. That would help make sure that not only is BPR \nbeing implemented early and effectively but also that the large \ninformation technology system being procured lines up with the \nDepartment of Defense's broader efforts to modernize its business \nsystems. Collectively, these initiatives would help these programs \nstart off right and allow both the Department of Defense and Congress \nto conduct better oversight and hold leadership accountable for future \nfailures.\n  In this case no one within the Air Force and the Department of \nDefense has been held accountable for ECSS's appalling mismanagement. \nNo one has been fired and not a single government employee has been \nheld responsible for wasting over $1 billion in taxpayer funds. With \nsix program managers and five program executive officers over 8 years \nhaving transitioned in and out of the program, the Air Force has had \ntrouble determining who should be held responsible. On scores of other \nfailed programs, this of course is a study we are all familiar with. \nLet me repeat: Not a single government employee has been held \nresponsible for wasting over $1 billion--six program managers and five \nprogram executive officers over 8 years in and out of the program.\n  This is a chronic lack of accountability, and I think efforts in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act amendments to align the tenure of \nprogram managers with key decision points in the acquisition process is \nbadly needed. That provision would allow us to not only hold \naccountable those responsible for blunders such as ECSS but also to \nreward those involved with successful acquisition strategies.\n  The subcommittee's report details many leadership failures within the \nAir Force and the Department of Defense in the ECSS Program that should \nserve as a warning for current and future information technology \nacquisitions. Since 1995 the Government Accountability Office has \nplaced the Department of Defense business systems modernization \nefforts; that is, its efforts to replace its existing information \ntechnology systems to improve how the Department of Defense is managed, \non its high-risk list every year. It has been on that list for many of \nthe same reasons ECSS failed, including inadequate management controls \nto oversee how it acquires these large systems.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the Department of \nDefense ``has not fully defined and established business systems \nmodernization management controls.'' It further noted that these \nmanagement controls are ``vital to ensuring that [DOD] can effectively \nand efficiently manage an undertaking with the size, complexity, and \nsignificance of its business systems modernization and minimize the \nassociated risks.'' I challenge the new Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nwho acts as the Chief Management Officer, to work with the Government \nAccountability Office to get the Department of Defense's business \nsystems modernization efforts off the high-risk list, and I look \nforward to a plan from him on how he intends to do it.\n  Such a plan is clearly necessary, given the current difficulties the \nDepartment of Defense is facing in procuring major information \ntechnology programs. The Army has spent roughly $1.89 billion on its \nlogistics modernization programs. Yet just recently, in May of this \nyear, the Department of Defense inspector general reported that the \nArmy will most likely miss the congressionally mandated auditability \ndeadline in September of 2017 because it failed to properly implement \nthe BPR.\n  Additionally, the defense enterprise accounting and management \nsystem, or DEAMS, is a current Air Force acquisition effort that has \nreceived roughly $425 million in funding and is scheduled to receive \nbillions more. DEAMS has faced similar issues to those witnessed in the \nfailed ECSS procurement program. For instance, similar to ECSS, the Air \nForce has been frustrated by its inability to get the buy-in it needs \nfrom DEAMS' intended end users for them to change their business \nprocesses and allow for DEAMS integration into the Air Force.\n  According to a December 2013 Department of Defense internal report, \nend users at McConnell Air Force Base indicated that the training for \nthis program ``did not provide them with a real understanding of the \nsystem and its application to their day-to-day work process.'' Sound \nfamiliar? In this case, the Air Force and the Department of Defense are \nagain failing to properly procure and implement a program that is \ncrucial to its business operations and to the Air Force becoming fully \nauditable by 2017.\n  The Navy has also struggled with the procurement of large information \ntechnology as a program called Navy ERP illustrates. According to the \nDepartment of Defense's Deputy Chief Management Officer, these \nguidelines demand that program officers for information technology \nacquisitions effectively map out current legacy systems and business \nprocesses that need to be changed or retired and then lay out a new \nplan that would improve and transform the shortcomings of the old \nsystems. These ``as is'' and ``to be'' process maps help guide the DOD \ncomponents and agencies in how they procure large information \ntechnology systems.\n\n  But when the Department of Defense inspector general asked the \nprogram office for Navy ERP's process maps, disturbingly, the Navy said \nno such plan existed. This is particularly unsettling because the Under \nSecretary of the Navy at the time, who is now the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, certified that those plans were actually completed.\n  In addition to the lack of process maps, the Department of Defense \ninspector general found that Navy ERP could not be used to track and \naccount for the Navy's $416 billion in military equipment assets. That \nmeans the Navy's program would not even allow\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\nthe Navy to become fully auditable, as required by Congress, raising \nquestions about why the Navy would spend $870 million on a program that \nwould not even fulfill congressional mandates.\n  This lapse in oversight is unacceptable, which is why the \nsubcommittee's bipartisan report recommends that the Department of \nDefense review its internal policies to make sure information \ntechnology systems that receive BPR certifications on paper are \nactually implementing BPR in reality.\n  These certifications are required for a reason: They help \ndecisionmakers in the Department of Defense and Congress make informed \ndecisions on whether a given program is ready to go further in the \nacquisition process and whether taxpayer funds should be authorized and \nappropriated for that purpose.\n  As I mentioned earlier, information technology procurement is not \nonly a Department of Defense problem. In November of last year, in \nresponse to the disastrous healthcare.gov rollout, President Obama \nhimself said:\n\n       One of the things [the Federal Government] does not do well \n     is information technology procurement. This is kind of a \n     systematic problem that we have across the board.\n\n  I agree with him that information technology procurement in the \nFederal Government is in desperate need of reform. The White House's \nOffice of Management and Budget has expressed significant concerns \nabout 42 Federal information technology investments, totaling $2 \nbillion. According to the Government Accountability Office: ``despite \nspending hundreds of billions on I.T. since 2000, the federal \ngovernment has experienced failed I.T. projects and has achieved little \nof the productivity improvements that private industry has realized \nfrom I.T.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security's Secure Border Initiative \nProgram, or SBInet, was another notable major IT procurement failure. \nMy colleagues might remember SBInet as the high-tech surveillance \nprogram that, when it began in 2006, promised a single \n``transformational'' integrated security system for hundreds of miles \nof border protection on our southern border. Well, I remember SBInet as \na system that, according to the Government Accountability Office, cost \n$1.2 billion and was on a path to spend 564 percent more than its \ninitial cost estimates when it was canceled in 2010. Once again, ever-\nchanging requirements, a lack of internal management controls, and not \nreally understanding what we were trying to procure, how hard it would \nactually be, and planning effectively for those difficulties, led to \nthe Federal Government squandering over $1 billion with nothing to show \nfor it.\n  The Federal Government's incessant inability to procure major \ninformation technology systems is especially concerning since, in the \ncoming months, the Department of Defense will be selecting a contractor \nto develop a centralized military health care information technology \nsystem. That program is supposed to provide seamless sharing of health \ndata among the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and private \nsector providers. In light of the recent tragic consequences stemming \nfrom mismanagement at the Phoenix VA Health Care System and VA \nhospitals around the country, we cannot afford to further jeopardize \nveterans' health care because of information technology failures. Yet \nany serious effort to reform how care is delivered to our veterans will \nlargely turn on the effective delivery and integration of this system. \nWe need to put the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs on notice that we will monitor this program carefully \nthroughout its acquisition.\n  In closing, there is still much to be done at the Department of \nDefense and throughout the Federal Government to ensure the acquisition \nof large information technology programs is improved. If we do not want \nto repeat past failures, the Department of Defense's attempts to \nprocure large business IT systems must be supported by the right \nleadership, proper planning, and a workforce that is open to changing \n``business as usual'' in order to help make sure the Department \noperates more efficiently, effectively, and transparently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This Wednesday, it is reported President Obama will be \ntraveling to my State of Texas, but he will not visit the border \nbetween Texas and Mexico, the site of what he has himself called a \ngrowing humanitarian crisis. Instead, on his 2-day trip, he will fund-\nraise and apparently deliver remarks on the economy. It is a little \nironic, given the economic boom in Texas relative to the rest of the \ncountry, that the President would choose to come to Texas and to \nlecture us on what he thinks we should do about the economy, but my \nhope is he would come to learn from Texas and not just give another \nlecture.\n  Today, the White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, said the \nPresident was ``well aware'' of the crisis on the border. As the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, I recently visited McAllen, TX, \nmyself 1 week ago today, and it is heartbreaking to see these young \nchildren without their parents. It is difficult to hear the horrific \nstories about the journey these children made from their homes in \nCentral America through Mexico, dodging assault, kidnapping, various \nand other sundry crimes, and then finally making their way into the \nUnited States. So it is easy in one sense to see why the President \nmight prefer to stay away rather than to come, learn, and listen for \nhimself, particularly in light of the sad stories he is going to hear \nor he would hear if he decided to come.\n  But I think the problem speaks for itself when the President, who \nwould prefer to hang out with campaign donors and other political \nsupporters, would decide not to have any interaction with those who are \ndirectly affected by his failed policies--in this case the failed \nimmigration policies that led to a full-blown humanitarian crisis.\n  Instead of taking the easy way out, I wish the President would step \nup and lead--and he would learn, perhaps, something he did not already \nknow or that he thinks he knows and which is absolutely wrong. It is \npuzzling, and it is frustrating that the President of the United States \nchooses the path he apparently is going to take rather than one that \nwill help him solve problems.\n  We know the President last week stood in the Rose Garden in front of \nthe American people and at the same time he asked for money to help \naddress this problem--and it is reportedly on the order of $2 billion--\nin the very next breath he announced he is looking at expanding the \nvery same policies that have helped create this crisis, create the \nimpression there will be no consequences for coming to the country in \nviolation of our laws. It is disheartening, it is disappointing, and it \nis extremely dangerous.\n  This week, during his trip to Texas, it would take the President less \nthan 1 hour on Air Force One to visit the border and to see what I and \nso many of my colleagues have seen firsthand, a\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nvery sad situation that could have been prevented. But now that it has \nhappened, it needs to be addressed in a bipartisan way. He would see \nwhat I saw, which is children separated from their parents with no \ncertainty about the future, children who have endured unspeakable \nhardships and cruelty at the hands of some of the most vile thugs on \nthe planet, the cartels, who view them as a commodity as they do drugs \nand weapons. They view these children as a commodity, something to make \nmoney off of.\n  The Border Patrol in South Texas and along the border is doing a very \nprofessional job under very difficult circumstances, but they are \nsimply overwhelmed. Repeatedly, we will hear of the Border Patrol--law \nenforcement officers--basically having to divert their attention from \ndoing those law enforcement responsibilities and duties to basically \ntaking care of children, making sure they are fed, their medical \ncondition is being attended to, and they have a safe place to stay \nwhile going through the procedures there at the border.\n  I commend the Border Patrol and all of our Federal law enforcement \nagencies for making their resources and time stretch as far as possible \nfor these children while the Commander in Chief has decided to do \nsomething else.\n  I realize how controversial and polarizing this issue can be, but at \nleast in some respects it should take precedence over partisan politics \nand fundraisers.\n  What I don't understand is how the President can send us a bill for \n$2 billion--which he reportedly is going to do tomorrow, apparently \nasking us for some changes in the existing law--and then to simply be \nmissing in action when it comes to learning for himself the very facts \nthat are necessary for him to be able to make the case not only to \nCongress but to the American people for why both of those were \nnecessary.\n  President Obama evidently needs a wakeup call, and visiting the \nborder and learning firsthand about the severity and causes of this \nongoing crisis will be that wakeup call.\n  Again, I urge the President to visit the border this week during his \nfundraising trip to Texas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Supreme Court issued a ruling last \nweek that I wish to discuss for a few moments today. This decision \nmarks a very important development in the ongoing debate our country is \nengaged in on the subject of religious freedom.\n  In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court reported that the \ncontraception coverage mandate imposed by the Affordable Care Act on \nfamily-owned companies such as Hobby Lobby stores and Conestoga Wood \nSpecialties violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  These two companies are owned by individuals who have faith-based \nobjections to providing access to contraceptives that can terminate a \npregnancy.\n  While it is true some faith-based institutions object to the mandate \non religious grounds, their insurance companies which are covering them \nand their employees in that business are mandated to provide support \nfor contraception. It is also true, but not really distinguished and \nnoticed in the media, that there are a number of institutions which are \nsaying: You can't couch this under the umbrella of contraception, you \nhave to understand that what we are opposed to here is not all forms of \nbirth control.\n  Hobby Lobby has been clear to state that they fall under this \ncategory, although they oppose the morning-after pill and other \ncontraceptives that induce abortions.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling means employers such as Hobby Lobby or \nGrote Industries in my home State of Indiana--a family-run auto \nlighting company--will not be forced to take actions contrary to their \nreligious beliefs. I applaud this ruling issued by the Court because \nfreedom of religion is a core American principle guaranteed by our \nFirst Amendment, and through this decision the Court has affirmed that \nthe administration simply can't pick and choose when and how or whether \nto adhere to the Constitution.\n  While this ruling is a welcome positive step, it is important to note \nthat religious freedom is still under attack across this country. It is \nunder attack because the Court's ruling applies only to a very narrow \nrule, family-owned for-profit companies such as Hobby Lobby, when many \nfaith-based organizations, charities, hospitals, educational \ninstitutions are still required to facilitate insurance coverage that \nincludes contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs despite their \nreligious beliefs and despite their moral objections. Requiring these \nfaith-based institutions and businesses to betray the fundamental \ntenets of their beliefs is, I believe, unconstitutional, and the \nadministration's so-called accommodation is far from adequate in this \nfundamental breach of our First Amendment rights under our \nConstitution. Those impacted by this mandate are a large and diverse \ngroup that includes Indiana-based institutions such as Grace College in \nWinona Lake, IN, the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, and many \nother schools based on a religious foundation that find a moral and \nreligious objection.\n  Despite conscious objections and the University of Notre Dame's \nclearly outlined standards and values, Notre Dame was told by a Federal \nappeals court late last year that it must comply with the ObamaCare \nmandate, which they are appealing.\n  My alma mater, one of those institutions, Wheaton College, was told \nby the Supreme Court only last week that it doesn't have to abide by \nthe contraceptive coverage mandate until the judicial system determines \nwhether the administration's requirement is valid over religious \ninstitutions and other nonprofits.\n  Just an aside, it was surprising to read this morning in the Wall \nStreet Journal that--in fact, it was disappointing and highly unusual--\ndespite the Court explicitly stating its decision to grant Wheaton \nCollege a temporary injunction ``should not be construed as an \nexpression of the Court's views on the merits'' of Wheaton's case, \nhaving explicitly stated that, one Justice wrote a dissenting opinion \nin which she essentially decided on the merits of the Wheaton case \nherself. That is the first time, in my recollection. I don't follow \nevery decision of the Supreme Court, but I follow many of them--but it \nis surprising that a Justice would allow their ideological passion on a \nparticular issue to so mischaracterize the ruling of the Court that \nsimply provided for an injunction to give the time for the court system \nto make a ruling.\n  Nevertheless, that is not why I came to the floor this evening. I \nthought in terms of thinking through this issue and what I might say \nthat it appears to be ideological bias on the Court that raised its \nugly head here, and hopefully that will be retracted.\n  But whether it is Wheaton College, whether it is Notre Dame or Grace \nCollege or numerous other institutions, it is important to understand \nthat in many of these institutions a thread of faith, a stream of \nwater, runs through everything they do in those organizations, and \nparticularly in those schools of higher learning and those entities \nthat provide social services through the food banks, through dealing \nwith the homeless. The element of faith is important to their success, \nit is important to their results, and it is important to their beliefs.\n  Whether it is faith in learning as the central part of institutions \nsuch as Notre Dame, Wheaton College, or others, or whether it is a \nhomeless shelter in South Bend, IN--that is the combination of \nchurches, university, city, county, some Federal funding, some local \nfunding, and some volunteer funding--it is essential, as they have told \nme on one of my visits, that this ribbon of faith is essential to the \nsuccess of their program and to the rehabilitation of those who walk \nthrough the front door, often homeless, and leave months and years \nlater with the capabilities of full employment, gainful employment, and \nbecome homeowners instead of homeless.\n  Whether it is food banks or homeless shelters or other important \norganizations, so many of these are meeting needs of people across this \nNation. But these institutions are seeing this ribbon of faith and the \nfree exercise of religion constrained and restricted by this \nadministration's mandate under the Obama health care law.\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\n  What is at stake here is of extreme significance. Established in the \nfounding of our Nation and sustained for over 200 years, religious \nfreedom is at the very core of our system of government, and protection \nof religious liberty means all people of all faiths have the right to \nexercise their faith within the bounds of our justice system even if \ntheir belief seems to some as misguided or flawed or flatout wrong. But \nwhat is unique about America and what is guaranteed in our Constitution \nis that we do not have the right to dictate to those people how to \nexpress their faith so long as they are within the bounds of justice, \nhow to express their faith, live their faith, and employ their faith.\n  Taking that right away from faith-based institutions is flatout wrong \nand I believe a violation of the most precious amendment to the \nConstitution. Faith-based institutions should not have to facilitate \ninsurance coverage for products that are counter to their religious or \nmoral beliefs. To require them to betray the fundamental tenets of \ntheir beliefs and accept this violation of their First Amendment rights \nguaranteed by the Constitution is simply wrong.\n  In a joint statement released shortly after announcement of the Hobby \nLobby decision, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, president of the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, and Archbishop William Lori of \nBaltimore, chairman of the U.S. Bishops Ad Hoc Committee for Religious \nLiberty, said:\n\n       Now is the time to redouble our effort to build a culture \n     that fully respects religious freedom.\n\n  That is really what we are asking for. We are asking this \nadministration to respect those institutions' and those individuals' \nreligious freedom as guaranteed under our Constitution. Whether we \nagree with their tenets, whether we ideologically take a position in \nfavor or not in favor, it is their right and it is guaranteed.\n  I hope in the coming days the Supreme Court will strike down the \nadministration's mandate for all faith-based institutions and rescind \nthis unprecedented attack on religious freedom. While we await further \naction from the Court, now is the time for this body--the Senate--and \nall Americans of faith to stand for our country's longstanding right to \nthe freedom of religion. It was the father of our country, after all, \nGeorge Washington, who once said:\n\n       I have often expressed my sentiment, that every man, \n     conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable \n     to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be \n     protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates \n     of his own conscience.\n\n  We today know that reference to ``every man'' also includes every \nwoman and every human being, the right to be accountable to God alone \nfor their religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshipping the \nDeity according to the dictates of their own conscience--not the \ndictates of a Federal Government that says ``We know better,'' not the \ndictates of those who simply say ``We will interpret that liberty to \nour satisfaction to accomplish our purposes.'' As in Washington's \ntimes, we must defend these rights of conscience and preserve religious \nliberty for all Americans regardless of their choice of belief and \nexpression of their faith.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week Target stores announced that \nthey were going to initiate a new policy in their stores across the \ncountry. They were going to politely ask all of their consumers to \nrefrain from bringing guns inside their stores.\n  This is a picture of one of their customers bringing what appears to \nbe a semiautomatic rifle into a store in order to buy Oreos. Their \nstatement read like this:\n\n       As you have likely seen in the media, there has been debate \n     about whether guests in communities that permit ``open \n     carry'' should be allowed to bring firearms into Target \n     stores. Our approach has always been to follow local laws, \n     and of course we will continue to do so, but starting today \n     we will also respectfully request that guests not bring \n     firearms to Target--even in communities where it is permitted \n     by law.\n       We've listened carefully to the nuances of this debate and \n     respect the protected rights of everyone involved. . . . This \n     is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: \n     Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at \n     odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we \n     strive to create.\n\n  I am thankful that Target has taken this position. I am hopeful that \nother retail stores across the country will follow suit. My only point \nof disagreement is that there is any nuance to this debate. My only \npoint of contention is that there is anything complicated about whether \nthis is appropriate for workers across retail stores and restaurants in \nthe United States or the little kids who come in and shop there on a \nregular basis.\n  Here is what the NRA had to say about this. The NRA released a \nstatement that said:\n\n       Let's not mince words, not only is it rare, it is downright \n     weird and certainly not a practical way to normally go about \n     your business while being prepared to defend yourself--\n     talking about bringing firearms into stores--to those who are \n     not acquainted with the dubious practice of using public \n     displays of firearms as a means to draw attention to one's \n     self or one's cause, it can be down right scary. Using guns \n     really to draw attention to yourself in public not only \n     defies common sense, it shows a lack of consideration and \n     manners.\n\n  That was the NRA's position for a couple of days, until a handful of \nNRA members got upset and started tearing up their membership cards, \nand then the NRA's top lobbyist apologized for that statement and \neffectively withdrew it. Luckily, Target some weeks later changed their \npolicies.\n  That is weird. That is scary. That is inappropriate. It is this \npolicy which we have perpetuated by our inaction in this place that \nallows for the continued diffusion of weapons, many of which are \nmilitary grade such as the one displayed here that is leading to the \nspiraling rates of mass gun violence across this country.\n  We went for a stretch in January or February where there was a school \nshooting almost every other day that school was open. We expect now to \npick up the newspaper and read about another mass slaughter somewhere \nin this country, and we wonder why it is happening. There are guys \nbuying Oreos with an assault rifle strapped onto their shoulder, and \nthat debate is nuanced and complicated about whether we should allow \nit.\n  The gun lobby's position speaks to this mythology--that is \ncharitable, a lie to the cynics--that the only way to stop a bad guy \nwith a gun is a good guy with a gun. That is not what actually any of \nthe data tells us. The data tells us if you have a gun in your home, \nyou are much more likely to be the victim of a gunshot from that gun \nthan you are to ever use that on an assailant. If you are a woman, for \ninstance, you are five times more likely to die as a result of domestic \nviolence with a gun if it is in your home rather than if you are in a \nhome without a gun. Health Affairs came out with a study of 50 States. \nA longitudinal study of experience related to rates of gun violence and \nrates of gun ownership found that for every percentage increase of gun \nownership in a community, there is a percentage increase in gun \nviolence.\n  There have been 79 shootings in Walmarts in the last year--79 \nshootings in Walmarts, of all places, in the last year. I am glad \nTarget made the decision to take guns out of the workplace.\n\n  Senator Blumenthal will speak after me. Senator Blumenthal and I sent \na letter to Target asking them to make this change in policy, and I am \nglad they did.\n  It appears we will have debate this week on a piece of legislation \nthat will allow for individuals to bring more firearms onto public \nproperty throughout this country. It is not a debate about bringing \nfirearms into Target stores; it is a debate about bringing firearms \nonto public lands.\n  There is a perfectly legitimate debate to be had about bringing more \nlegal guns onto public property, but there is a more important debate \nthan that about taking illegal guns off of\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\nour city streets. If the Senate is going to spend a week debating a \nbill about gun policy, then we should be talking about getting rid of \nillegal guns. We should be talking about keeping guns out of the hands \nof criminals. We should be talking about stopping the epidemic of gun \nviolence across this country.\n  These are the numbers: 31,000 people are killed by guns every year, \n2,600 people are killed by guns every month, and 86 people are killed \nby guns every day. If we are going to be talking on the floor of the \nSenate about guns this week, we should be talking about how to stop \nanother Newtown, another Aurora, another bloody Chicago summer.\n  The bill we are being asked to debate this week is a gun bill that \ndoes nothing to stop the scourge of gun violence across our country, \nand I for one cannot vote for it. I cannot vote for it because there \nare not only families still grieving in Newtown, but every single day \nthere are families grieving across this country, such as the families \nassociated with a young man by the name of Michael Mayfield in \nBaltimore, MD. Michael was killed earlier this year. He was an \noutstanding student. He was passionate about being a member of the \nJunior ROTC. He was a gifted baseball star in Baltimore. The paramedics \nfound Michael shot in the head inside a vehicle in Northwest Baltimore \nand took him to a local hospital, where he died. He left his house at \nabout 6 o'clock, and somebody walked up to him on the street, shot him \nfour times in the head, and then fled on foot to an awaiting car up the \nstreet. He had been accepted to college, and he was due to start there \nthis fall, but instead of going to his graduation, his family and \nfriends--hundreds of them--went to his funeral.\n  Paul Lee was killed some weeks later in another school shooting at \nSeattle Pacific University. A delusional young man started shooting and \nkilled Paul, who was described as easygoing and energetic. A friend and \ndorm mate of his said he was adored by everyone and affectionate with \neverybody. He loved to dance. He was a member of Seattle Pacific \nUniversity's hip-hop club, and his friend said he would walk around his \ndorm doing the robot. At a makeshift memorial to him outside where his \nfuneral took place, one friend wrote, ``Keep dancing in heaven.''\n  Kristjan Ndoj, a 15-year-old from Connecticut, was out on his bike \none night. When the clock approached 8:45, two gunshots were fired from \na wooded area near his house and struck Kristjan in the head and leg, \ndropping him onto the driveway at Agawam Trail. He died 5 days later. \nPolice say the shooting may have involved trouble over a teenage girl.\n  The casualness of violence in this country and the idea that a \ndispute over a teenage girl would result in the death of a 15-year-old \nis directly connected to our casualness about guns in this country. If \nwe are so casual as to think someone needs to be armed when they go to \nbuy Oreos at a Target, it stands to reason that some kids may think \nthey can have a casualness about settling disputes with guns as well.\n  I will not be voting for cloture today because we are long overdue to \nmake a statement in the Senate about the tens of thousands of deaths \nhappening due to guns all across this country. Everyone has a role to \nplay in trying to stem this epidemic of violence. Target has a role to \nplay, and they stepped up last week by taking guns out of their stores. \nOur hospitals and our mental health professionals have a role to play. \nThis is not just about the number of guns out in our communities, this \nis also about getting resources to very troubled kids. This Congress \nhas a role to play as well. Our role is to have a debate about how we \ncan take guns out of the hands of criminals, take military-style \nassault weapons off the streets, and give real resources to people who \nwant to help these troubled individuals. That is the debate we should \nbe having on the floor of the Senate this week if we really want to \nhonor all of the voices of these victims.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nMurphy. He is my friend and partner on so many different issues but \nmost especially on measures to stop gun violence in this country--\ncommonsense, sensible measures he has championed so ably, and I have \nbeen very proud to work with him as a partner in spearheading this \nissue as well.\n  I wish to explain my reasons that I am unable to vote for the bill we \nare considering today, the bill that is presented for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed this afternoon. People in the United States have a \nSecond Amendment right to possess and use firearms. It is guaranteed by \nthe Constitution. And there are legitimate ways people can use firearms \nin this country--recreational and sometimes commercial. Those rights \nare guaranteed by the Constitution, and this measure, arguably, is in \nservice of those rights.\n  I cannot vote for a measure which makes owning or possessing or using \nguns more readily or easily useable when we have failed to act, and we \nhave failed to act, on commonsense, sensible measures that will stop \ngun violence.\n  I voted to achieve cloture on a measure very similar to this one \nbefore Sandy Hook and before the Senate failed to produce the necessary \n60 votes which were required to pass commonsense gun violence \nlegislation a year ago April.\n  I can see the legitimate reasons to vote for the Sportsmen's Bill and \nto support cloture but not when this body has failed in its fundamental \nobligation to make America safer and to rid it of gun violence. We have \nan obligation to take first things first and protect our children and \nadopt the kinds of commonsense measures--background checks, mental \nhealth initiatives, school safety, and a ban on illegal trafficking--\nthat are easily within reach and would be passed by a majority of this \nbody if presented for another vote and if a majority of Members voting \nwas sufficient rather than the 60 votes that is now our threshold.\n  I am reminded today of a victim of gun violence over this very \nweekend in the early morning of Sunday. A young woman in Bridgeport was \ngunned down by her ex-boyfriend, raging into her mother's house. First \nhe shot her mother's boyfriend and then turned his gun on her because \nshe had the audacity to end their relationship.\n  Her story puts a face on the reason I have offered a measure named \nafter Lori Jackson, another victim of gun violence, to impose \ncommonsense steps to take guns away from the people who are under \ntemporary restraining orders as well as permanent restraining orders. \nWhether that kind of measure would have worked in this case is \nirrelevant. Her death was unnecessary, preventable, tragic, and painful \nto her family, not to mention her mom, who was in the house at the time \nshe was gunned down and murdered.\n  Her death occurred within 75 minutes of another death in Bridgeport. \nOn the east side, Abraham ``A.B.'' Davidson, a 23-year-old young man, \nwas sitting on his house porch on Barnum Avenue in Bridgeport--gunned \ndown.\n  In the case of Kiromy Fontanez--the young woman who was shot by her \nex-boyfriend--the shooter, Jose Santiago, was apprehended almost \nimmediately and gave a confession. According to Bridgeport police, the \ncase is closed. The chief of the Bridgeport police, Chief Gaudett, had \nthis to say:\n\n       Three separate incidents, six people shot, two people dead. \n     I am very proud of the work that all of our officers do every \n     day, but especially last night. It was a really trying night \n     last night.\n\n  Chief Gaudett committed himself to begin a renewed effort against \ndomestic violence inspired by the death of this young woman, Kiromy \nFontanez.\n  In Connecticut we have already exceeded the number of domestic \nviolence deaths that occurred in all of last year. Her death was the \n10th in 2014 alone. Domestic violence takes a terrible, awful, \nunacceptable toll in lives and injuries, heartbreak and pain, and it is \nso avoidable and unnecessary.\n  We need to do more about domestic violence, but, as my colleague \nSenator Murphy has commented so well, the chances of death as a result \nof domestic violence are increased by five times when there is a gun in \nthe house. Guns and domestic violence are a dangerous toxic mix, and \nthat is the reason for our legislation, the Lori Jackson Domestic \nViolence Survivor Protection Act. The legislation we have offered takes \naway guns, stops purchases and ownership of guns when there are \nrestraining orders, when there is an objective reason to think there \nwill be\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nthis kind of threat of violence and rage and wrath.\n  The memory of these two people--who died just yesterday morning in \nthe early hours of the Sunday following Independence Day--should focus \nour attention again on what is important, what should be our priority, \nwhat should be our first steps when it comes to guns. That is to make \nAmerica safer.\n  Four months after the brutal murders in Sandy Hook, this body said no \nto the grieving Newtown families, to the people of Connecticut, and to \nthe vast majority of American people who continue to support \ncommonsense measures such as background checks. This body voted to \nprevent gun violence legislation from getting a final vote.\n  Today we will vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nsportsmen's bill. The fact that we are now considering this legislation \nto expand recreational shooting on Federal lands without addressing the \nscourge of gun violence is a stark reminder of the Congress's misplaced \npriorities and unfulfilled obligations.\n  I sympathize with what my great colleague Senator Hagan is trying to \ndo. If the legislation we are considering were part of a broader \nnational discussion and conversation about who should possess guns and \nhow we should keep them out of the hands of dangerous people--criminals \nand mentally troubled people who are dangerous to themselves or \nothers--it would be a different debate on the floor and the \nconsiderations for me would be different on this vote.\n\n  I spent last week going from town to town in Connecticut listening to \nconstituents who asked me, What are you doing in Washington? What I \nheard a lot was, What are you doing in Washington to stop gun violence? \nWhen will you bring back the measures to stop gun violence that are the \nlegacy and the lesson of Sandy Hook--a tragedy that still causes so \nmuch pain to so many people, thinking of those families, the 20 \nbeautiful children and brave educators whose lives were lost that day. \nI cannot go back to Connecticut and tell those people who asked me \nabout what we are doing about guns in America that what we have done is \nmade it easier for Americans to shoot at targets, made it easier for \nbig game trophy hunters to bring their polar bear rugs back from \nCanadian hunting grounds, and reduced regulations that govern shell \ncases. That is not my idea of where our priorities should be.\n  First things first. Let's stop gun violence. Let's at least take \nsteps to reduce its horrific toll of death and injury, its cost in \ndollars. Let's try to find that bipartisan ground on reducing domestic \nviolence or reaching out to people who need mental health treatment, \nand let's find common ground on making America safer. That common \nground serves our best instincts--what makes our Nation the greatest \nNation in the history of the world, a nation whose independence we \ncelebrated this weekend, with pride and joy, even as the terrible toll \nof gun violence continued in yesterday's early morning, over the \nweekend throughout America, where tens of thousands of deaths have \nfollowed the tragic, horrific, unspeakable tragedy of Sandy Hook.\n  I will vote against this legislation, against invoking cloture, with \nsadness and regret that that obligation and promise is as yet \nunfulfilled.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                       Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, in a few minutes the Senate will vote on \nwhether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act of 2014, a bill I introduced earlier this year with my \nfriend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski.\n  I am proud that by working alongside our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, we have crafted a package of 12 provisions that have broad \nbipartisan support. I will be back on the floor at a later time to give \na much more thorough, open, and indepth presentation on our bill, but I \nwish to take a couple of minutes to highlight a couple of the key \nprovisions.\n  One is to ensure that future generations do have an opportunity to \nenjoy our great outdoors as we do today. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act \nreauthorizes several landmark conservation programs, including the \nNorth American Wetlands Conservation Act, the Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.\n  Our bill also includes regulatory reforms and enhancements that will \nbenefit sportsmen and women across our country. For example, States \nwill be able to allocate a greater portion of the Federal Pittman-\nRobertson funding to create and maintain shooting ranges on public \nland. This is important because we are currently facing a shortage of \npublic shooting ranges across the country.\n  We will also enable hunters to purchase an electronic duck stamp. I \ncan personally vouch for the benefits of this provision. Our son-in-law \ncame to visit one year. My husband planned to take him duck hunting \ntoward the end of the season. Unfortunately, three different places had \nsold out of duck stamps. When my husband buys his duck stamp for the \nseason, he actually purchases extra ones, just in case family or \nfriends come to visit during duck season. Senator Wicker's electronic \nduck stamp provision will allow my husband and other hunters to \npurchase duck stamps online--this is 2014--instead of traveling from \npost office to post office in search of a duck stamp.\n  The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act will also help improve access for \nhunting and fishing on public lands and will require 1.5 percent, or \n$10 million, of annual Land and Water Conservation Fund money to be \nused to improve the access on our public lands.\n  It is important to note that we accomplish all of this without adding \nanything to the deficit. In fact, this act actually reduces the deficit \nby $5 million over the next 10 years.\n  I believe we have assembled a strong bill that is going to benefit \nthe anglers, the outdoor recreation enthusiasts, and the hunters in \nNorth Carolina and nationwide. I am proud to say this bipartisan act \nhas 45 cosponsors--18 Democrats, 26 Republicans, and one Independent. \nWe have cosponsors of all ideological backgrounds from every region of \nthe country.\n  The list of organizations supporting our bill is also long and \ndiverse. Over 40 organizations have endorsed the Bipartisan Sportsmen's \nAct, ranging from the National Shooting Sports Foundation to the \nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, to Ducks Unlimited.\n  Outdoor recreation activities are part of the fabric of so many \nStates, including North Carolina. From the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park in the west to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in the \neast, North Carolinians are passionate about the outdoors. Hunting, \nfishing, and hiking are a way of life, and many of these traditions \nhave been handed down through my own family.\n  I am glad the Senate will debate the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act. In \nputting our bill together, Senator Murkowski and I tried to pull the \nbest ideas from Members of both of our parties. However, I do recognize \nthat Members on both sides of the aisle have ideas for how to \nstrengthen this bill. It is my hope we can take up, debate, and vote on \nsportsmen's-related amendments this week. I encourage my colleagues who \nhave amendments to file them and come to the floor to discuss them.\n  In closing, this Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 is a balanced \nbipartisan plan that is endorsed by 40 stakeholders, and it is fiscally \nresponsible. I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the bill so we can start debating steps we can \ntake to benefit the more than 90 million sportsmen and women across the \ncountry.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Reforming Foster Care\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for many years I have been an advocate \nfor reforming the foster care system and making sure the government is \ndoing the best it can to protect and care for those who are abused, \nneglected, and particularly when they are removed from their families. \nThat is why Senator Landrieu of Louisiana and I started the Senate \nCaucus on Foster Youth. We wanted a forum to discuss policies and \npractices and to learn more about the challenges foster young people \nface. We want to make a\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\ndifference in the lives of vulnerable young people who don't have a \npermanent place to call home.\n  The caucus cannot function without the input and the insight from \nfoster young people. These young people are the experts on the foster \ncare system. They have been through it. They know the challenges. They \ntell us in this caucus what works and what needs to change. They share \nthe experiences and provide us with real-world stories about how our \npolicies truly affect them.\n  I wish to highlight the story of one particular person whom I have \nhad the privilege of getting to know. Amnoni Myers is an intern in my \noffice this summer. She is participating in the Congressional Coalition \non Adoption Institute's Foster Youth Internship Program. I wish to tell \nher story because it is important not to forget there are young people \nin this country such as Amnoni who don't have a permanent family or a \nplace to call home. Despite her circumstances, Amnoni has risen up and \nmade a better life for herself. So allow me to share her story.\n  Amnoni Myers, a native of Boston, became a ward of the State on the \nday she was born. She was abandoned at birth. When she was 6 months \nold, Amnoni's great aunt learned of Amnoni and her two other siblings \nand decided to take care of them by taking them into her home. She \nlived in her great aunt's care for 10 years. Even though she had a \nbetter family environment, life still presented her with many \nchallenges. Amnoni struggled with rejection and trauma at a very young \nage, resulting from different types of abuse.\n  At the age of 10, Amnoni was reunited with her biological mother \nbecause the State granted her temporary custody. Amnoni thought her \nlife was finally secure. Wouldn't we think so, being at home with our \nbirth mother? Her mother promised to care for her and never give her up \nagain. Unfortunately, after 2 short years, Amnoni's mother voluntarily \nreturned her and her siblings back to the State.\n  So at the age of 12, Amnoni was separated from her siblings and \nplaced with foster families until the age of 18. Although Amnoni and \nher brother were placed together for a short period of time, they were \nlater separated as Amnoni moved around in the system. During her time \nin foster care, she was moved several times, never experiencing \npermanency or stability. That is one of the things I learned through \nthe work of this caucus; that when we talk to people who are in foster \ncare, what do they want? They want permanency. They want a real mom and \ndad, and they would like to have a place to call home.\n  To Amnoni, foster parents seemed more interested in cash benefits for \nparenting rather than human investment. She experienced emotional and \nverbal abuse in places she stayed. She didn't know unconditional love. \nHer foster families didn't take the time to manage her trauma but \ninstead added to it.\n  One of the most difficult experiences Amnoni faced was aging out of \nthe foster care system, and aging out issues with these young people is \nexactly why Senator Landrieu and I established the caucus I have \nalready spoken about.\n  During the summer, while still in care, Amnoni entered an intense \ncollege preparation program that would determine if she was adequately \nprepared to enroll in a postsecondary institution. Already anxious \nabout the future of her success and if she would be able to handle the \nworkload of the program, she received a phone call from her social \nworker that afternoon. The bad news came that she was aging out. She \nwas told that her foster mother was no longer being paid for Amnoni's \nbed. Because the money was running out for her foster parents, Amnoni \nwas forced to leave the home immediately.\n\n  The shock and devastation of those words crushed Amnoni. She lived in \nthat home with that family for 3 years. She considered it a long-term \nliving situation. Amnoni returned to find her belongings packed in \ngarbage bags waiting for her at the door. That is a story our caucus \noften hears.\n  Amnoni aged out of the system in a way no person should have to \nexperience. She left a place she considered home, not knowing what her \nfuture would hold. She was on her own, shoved into independence with no \nfamily, support or a place to call home.\n  Amnoni's aging-out experience left her feeling shattered and \nconfused. She felt betrayed by both her foster mother, who claimed to \nlove her, and the child welfare system--in other words, the State she \nlived in--that claimed to protect her. While this experience quickly \ntaught Amnoni the value of independence, she would have preferred to \nhave a smoother transition into that independence.\n  When Amnoni left her so-called home at age 18, she was taken in by a \nformer mentor and her family. She resided there for 5 years. Living \nthere was a reminder that love, family, and support do exist.\n  In 2008 Amnoni learned she had post-traumatic stress disorder, \ndepression, and anxiety. These diagnoses led her to take a break from \nschool to gain control over these disruptions. Amnoni entered into a \nChristian residential program, Mercy Ministries, where she was able to \ngain a better understanding of herself. This experience motivated her \nto attend Gordon College, a Christian institution outside of Boston.\n  Today she is working in my office, sitting in this Chamber with me, \nlearning how government works. She is becoming an advocate for foster \nyouth who face the same experiences she faced.\n  Despite the challenges, Amnoni feels very fortunate. She has been \nable to attend college, graduate this year, and hopes to pursue a \nmeaningful career. Knowing that many children and youth do not have \nadequate support systems in their life to help them along their life \njourney, Amnoni pursued an education in social work and sociology.\n  Many people who have gone through similar experiences resort to other \npaths because of the lack of support and services. Many foster children \nage out of the system without supportive services in place to ensure \nhealthier lives. Thankfully, Amnoni has had a network of support to \nguide and direct her through difficult times.\n  Amnoni's experience has fueled her passion to advocate for those who \ndo not have a voice to fight for themselves. As Amnoni looks back on \nher life, she realizes her past does not have to determine her future. \nShe is on her way to becoming a monumental figure for those who have \nsuffered, giving youth across the country a voice and making a \ndifference in this world.\n  I appreciate her willingness to let me share her story. It is so \ntypical of so much that we hear in the caucus that Senator Landrieu and \nI formed. This young girl is a very brave woman. She knows we can learn \nfrom her. We will learn from her. We must do right by her and others in \nthe foster care system.\n  I hope my colleagues have a chance to say hello to Amnoni while she \nis here in Washington, DC, and take a minute to commend her for being \nan advocate for other youth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask to speak on the nomination that is \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4209-S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KRAUSE NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to speak just for a \ncouple moments--because we are limited in time to speak--about Cheryl \nAnn Krause who is the nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit.\n  I want to review her credentials, some of which the Members of the \nSenate are familiar with in preparing for the vote.\n  Cheryl Ann Krause is a graduate of the Stanford Law School. She got \nher juris doctorate degree with distinction in 1993. She graduated from \nthe University of Pennsylvania summa cum laude. Of course, I am \nespecially proud of that as a Pennsylvanian.\n  She has an extensive career both as a member of law firms in the \nprivate sector as well as a prosecutor. Before I get to that, I want to \nmention her clerkships.\n  She clerked in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for \nJudge Alex Kozinski. That was followed by a clerkship in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\n  Later she became a prosecutor, as I mentioned, in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of New York, where she worked for 5 \nyears. In that capacity as a prosecutor, she handled the investigation, \nprosecution, and appeals of domestic and international bank fraud, \nsecurities fraud, money laundering, and public corruption cases.\n  She has a broad and deep experience in the law, both on the civil and \ncriminal side of it. She is an excellent student, as you can tell from \nher academic credentials and her educational background. She has been a \nmember of so many organizations which would be directly relevant and \nconnected to her work as a judge. I will not read all of those today.\n  But I also want to say that Cheryl is someone I know. I know her to \nbe a person of character and integrity, someone who has not just broad \nexperience but the kind of integrity and judicial temperament that we \nwill want from a member of any Federal district court or, in this case, \nan appeals court.\n  Finally, I will mention something about her own family background. \nHer husband is Col. Bradford R. Everman, who currently serves as the \nOperations Group commander of the 177th Fighter Wing with the New \nJersey National Guard. He served, as well, as a fighter pilot in tours \nof duty the world over. So she has both her own credentials but also \nhas as a member of her family a real commitment to our country above \nand beyond her excellent work as a lawyer, as a scholar, as a lecturer, \nand, of course, as a prosecutor. So I could not say anything more today \nto recommend her to Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle \nwhen we have the vote to move her forward so she can become a circuit \ncourt judge on the U.S. Circuit Court for the Third Circuit, which, of \ncourse, includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware as States in \nthat circuit.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I voted in support of cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014. This is a \nprocedural vote to begin debate on this bill, which has been introduced \nby Senator Hagan of North Carolina and is cosponsored by 45 Senators, \nincluding 26 Republicans.\n  Senator Hagan's bill seeks to enhance opportunities for outdoor \nrecreation, including hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. It \nalso reauthorizes key conservation programs that support outdoor \nrecreation. It is no secret that I strongly support efforts to combat \nviolent gun crime and to reduce the high number of gun deaths and \ninjuries that occur each year, but I recognize the distinction between \nlegitimate hunting and target shooting activity, as opposed to \nirresponsible or criminal gun use. I believe there are ways to support \nthe former without undermining efforts to reduce the latter.\n  If, during debate on this bill, Senators try to add provisions to \nweaken the laws on the books when it comes to keeping our citizens safe \nfrom gun violence, I will strongly oppose those provisions, but for \npurposes of today's procedural vote, I support moving forward on this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4211-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4211-S4213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a number of topics to go over, and \nI will do this as briefly as I can because I know colleagues want to \nput forward a unanimous consent request.\n  In our work every day something happens, and I feel compelled to talk \nabout a few of these things. But before I begin my remarks, I wish to \nsend a message of condolence to all those parents who have lost their \nchildren to violence in our country, in the Middle East, and all over \nthe world. Children and all innocents must be protected in a truly \ncivilized world. We need to work toward that day, we have to pray for \nthat day, and it is going to take people who care in order to make that \nhappen.\n  When somebody said you have to walk and chew gum at the same time \nwhen you are a Senator, they were more than right. There are so many \nissues coming at us, and I am going to speak about a few of them.\n  I will start off with the crisis we face in the highway trust fund. I \nwish to call attention to a transportation government shutdown which \nwill happen in 25 days unless we save the highway trust fund. In August \nwe have a slowdown in payments to the States, and it is very serious. \nUnless Congress takes action, billions of dollars in transportation \nfunding to the States will be delayed or stopped.\n  I see Senator Corker is here and I know he is here on another topic, \nbut I thank him for his courage in working across the aisle and saying: \nWe need to pay for our roads and our bridges.\n  I see Senator Klobuchar is on the floor. She knows what it means when \na bridge collapses, for goodness sake. You have to be able to pay for \ncertain things in this country. We could argue about frills around the \nedges, but I don't think anyone would disagree with you if you went out \non the street and asked whether the United States of America should \nhave a grade A transportation system.\n  DOT, the Department of Transportation, sent out letters to all of our \nStates warning that the fund is in a dire situation and we have to act. \nIn 74 days the trust fund goes completely bankrupt if we don't come up \nwith the additional revenue. Here is where we are. In 85 days, we \nactually have to reauthorize the whole program, and in 25 days, the \npayments slow down.\n  Why is this happening? It is because Federal gas tax receipts that \nare paid into the trust fund have not kept pace with inflation or the \nrising cost of building our bridges and highways. There are thousands \nof businesses and millions of jobs at risk if we do not act, and that \nis why we have so many people supporting the reauthorization of the \ntrust fund and figuring out a way to pay for that.\n  We have the Chamber of Commerce, and they are aligned with the AFL-\nCIO. This is a rarity. Usually those groups are fighting each other, \nbut we have unanimity here: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Associated \nGeneral Contractors. As I said, the AFL-CIO. The Associated Equipment \nDistributors, the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, the \nNational Ready Mixed Concrete Association, the American Society of \nCivil Engineers, the International Unions of Operating Engineers.\n\n  We have 70,000 bridges in disrepair, which are called structurally \ndeficient. We have 50 percent of our highways which are not up to par. \nWhat are we doing? I can tell my colleagues what we are not doing. We \nare not doing our job.\n  Now, I can brag just for a minute. Senator Vitter and I were able to \nget a bill unanimously through the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--not one dissenting vote. I have to say to my colleagues who \nare listening, that committee is an object in the diversity we bring \nhere. We have Bernie Sanders. We have Jim Inhofe. We have Barbara \nBoxer. We have David Vitter. We have John Barrasso. We have Sheldon \nWhitehouse. We have Ben Cardin and we have Senator Fischer. So we have \na broad diversity. I have to mention Senator Sessions and Senator \nGillibrand and Senator Booker. This is a committee that represents the \nideological spectrum of the Senate.\n  I will tell my colleagues we passed a bill out for 6 years. We know \nit has to be paid for, but I think we were very reasonable in what we \nsaid. We said, look, this isn't the time for a giant new increase. We \nkept it at current levels of spending, plus inflation. God bless \nSenator Wyden and Senator Hatch. They are working on a plan to pay for \nthis bill. We have colleagues, as I mentioned, including Senator Murphy \nand Senator Corker, who came together and said: Look, the Chamber of \nCommerce makes a good point. We haven't raised the gas tax in a very \nlong time. If we do a few cents a year, we will be able to patch up \nthis trust fund--and more than patch it up--get it going for 6 years.\n  Today, leading groups representing bipartisan State and local \nofficials sent a letter urging Congressional leaders to find a fix for \nthe Highway Trust Fund and to pass a long-term surface transportation \nbill. The organizations include the National Governors Association, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, and \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  The Nation's surface transportation system is in a critical condition \nand significant funding is needed to simply maintain the current \nsystem. Nationwide there are 70,000 bridges that are structurally \ndeficient, and 50 percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good \ncondition.\n  Delaying a long-term bill just prolongs uncertainty. An extension \ninto 2015 would create another crisis, just before the next \nconstruction season. To allow the Trust Fund to become insolvent would \nbe unprecedented and further delay simply extends the uncertainty. We \nneed a long-term bill no later than December and a short-term\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\npatch for the Trust Fund now. Failure is not an option.\n  I will say this: The clock is ticking, however we look at it. One \nmore time: The clock is ticking. There are 25 days until a slowdown of \npayments to the States. In 25 days our States are going to be howling \nbecause they won't be able to pay for work that has already been done. \nThe way it works is they do the work and then we repay them for, in \nmany cases, 75 percent of the work; in some cases, 50 percent of the \nwork.\n  So I call on all of my colleagues: Let's set politics aside.\n\n\n                Supreme Court Decision on Birth Control\n\n  I wish to speak briefly about two other issues. One of them has to do \nwith the Supreme Court decision on birth control. I hope every woman in \nAmerica is paying attention to what this Court did. Five men, all \nRepublican appointees, basically said a corporation can put its \nreligion above all of its employees. It is just astounding.\n  I voted for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and I know why I \nvoted for it. It was a very important piece of legislation which said \nthat individuals can't have their freedom of religion stepped upon. It \ndidn't say corporations. So here we have a situation where one family \ndoesn't believe in birth control, and now they are telling every woman \nwho works there: Sorry, you are out of luck. It is really unbelievable. \nTo me, the Court siding with the corporation over the thousands of \npeople who work there is just shocking. What happened to individual \nfreedom here?\n  We are going to try our best to fix it.\n  Let's remember this: 99 percent of women have used birth control at \nsome point in their lifetime. Let me say that again: 99 percent of \nwomen have used birth control at some point in their lifetime, and 1.5 \nmillion women take birth control solely for a painful condition. Sixty \npercent of the women on birth control take it in part for painful and \ndifficult conditions.\n  So the Supreme Court, in an ideological, political decision, in my \nview, said to the women of America: Corporations are more important \nthan you.\n  We are going to try to fix this. We are going to do everything we \ncan. I hope we can reach across the aisle. I have hopes that we can, to \nfix this.\n\n\n                          Political Blame Game\n\n  Now I will conclude my remarks on another topic. The week we were \naway I was working in the State. I went to some highway projects. I \nwent to a national park. But all through the time I was working in the \nState, I was hearing a continuum of the blame game going toward our \nPresident.\n  Republicans blame President Obama for every single thing that \nhappens. Not enough jobs? They blame the President, even though since \nhis policies have been in place, we have had 52 straight months of job \ngrowth. Last month alone, 288,000 jobs were created. Remember, at the \nend of George Bush's time in office, we were bleeding 700,000 jobs a \nmonth. The unemployment rate has dropped from 10 percent to 6.1 \npercent, and we could be doing even better if Republicans hadn't \nblocked the President's jobs bills.\n  The Obama recovery even includes a record-breaking stock market which \nhelps everybody. Everybody has a 401(k), a retirement account. When the \nPresident took office, the Dow Jones average was under $8,000. Now it \nhas more than doubled, and the Dow hit 17,000 for the first time last \nweek. Yet and still the President is to blame for not enough jobs.\n  Deficits. Republicans blame the President, even though since he took \noffice, the deficit has been cut by more than half, and deficits would \nbe lower still if our friends on the other side stopped fighting with \nus when we try to close tax loopholes such as ending the tax policy \nthat rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas or passing more \nequitable income tax rules which would allow people such as Warren \nBuffett to pay the same effective tax rate as his secretary--not a bad \nidea--and would really help us. We would get rid of that deficit. \nRemember when Bill Clinton was President. We wound up not only not \nhaving a deficit, we had a surplus. When George Bush came in, he \nstarted a couple of wars, put them on the credit card; tax cuts to the \nrich, put that on the credit card, and we have been battling it ever \nsince.\n  Now we have an influx of immigrants from Central America. Republicans \nblame the President, even though it is House Republicans who are \nblocking immigration reform the Senate already passed in a bipartisan \nway which will greatly enhance border protections, spends tens of \nbillions of dollars on that, and sets out clear and fair rules for \nimmigrants. And they blame President Obama even though the guidelines \nfor how we treat unaccompanied immigrant children from countries such \nas Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, those guidelines were sent to \nand signed by George W. Bush.\n  Then we have the civil war in Iraq. Republicans blame President Obama \neven though he opposed the disastrous Iraq war. I have to say that \nSenator Paul is not in that category, and I appreciate that. For the \nmost part, Republicans blame President Obama, even though he opposed \nthe disastrous Iraq war which sowed the seeds for the sectarian warfare \nwe are seeing today. How proud I was to vote with then Senator Biden, \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and along with 74 of my \ncolleagues, we voted to say there ought to be a federation in Iraq--\nsemi-autonomous regions--the Kurds, the Shias, the Sunnis. Seventy-four \nof us voted for that, and the Bush administration laughed it off, \nincluding Condi Rice and Dick Cheney. We have them all on record. Now \nthis thing happens and who gets the blame? The President gets the blame \nfrom the Republicans.\n  How about Benghazi. We have heard about Benghazi. Republicans blame \nthe President and they continue to politicize this tragedy, even though \nunder President Obama's leadership the United States has captured the \nsuspected terrorist who is believed to be one of the masterminds behind \nthe killing of these four extremely brave Americans. Benghazi is a \ntragedy. It is not about a scandal.\n  Now, how about the release of Sergeant Bergdahl. Republicans cried \nfoul when the President got him released, even though many of them \nright in this Chamber--and they are on videotape--were calling for \nSergeant Bergdahl's release. And they also have insisted that no \nsoldier ever be left behind.\n  I have to say, it is just getting old. Republicans blame the \nPresident for everything, including issuing Executive orders. The \nSpeaker of the House is suing the President for abusing his Executive \npower. President Obama has issued the fewest Executive orders per year \nof any President since Grover Cleveland. It is just getting to be too \nmuch.\n  I wouldn't be surprised if the Republicans blame President Obama for \nAmerica's recent loss in the World Cup or even for their own six \nconsecutive losses in the annual congressional baseball game.\n  Enough. We all need to work together. Stop the finger pointing. The \npeople need us to work together, not to play the blame game. I am very \nhopeful that we will have a little introspection around here. It might \nbe a little too much to ask for. But I think if we did it--there are so \nmany good people here on both sides of the aisle, and if we just \ndecided once and for all to put politics aside--the President won \nelection twice. It wasn't even contested. So deal with it. Work with \nhim.\n  I have served with five Presidents--a couple of Republicans, several. \nI battled with them, didn't agree with them. I remember Ronald Reagan, \nif we beat him in the conversation, would say, OK, let's move on. So, \nyes, sometimes Democrats win; sometimes Republicans win. We have to \nwork together and move forward and solve the problems of this great \nNation because the people expect it of us.\n  I thank my colleagues very much, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2265\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I don't believe that foreign aid should go \nto countries that persecute Christians. I also don't believe that \nforeign aid should go to countries that host terrorists within their \ngovernment. I have had this belief for some time, but I have met with a \ngreat deal of resistance in the Senate.\n  Last week, in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I introduced an \namendment which said that any country that persecutes Christians by \nlaw--Pakistan has a Christian woman\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\nnamed Asia Bibi; she is on death row for the crime, some say, of \nblasphemy. Others say she never said a word. She is really on death row \nfor being a Christian. She has been there for 5 years. I say Pakistan \nshouldn't get any American money and that no taxpayer money should go \nto countries that are persecuting Christians.\n  In the Sudan, another country that receives money from the American \ntaxpayer, Meriam Ibrahim is on death row for the crime of changing \nreligion. She married a man who is a Christian. She is now being \ndetained. She tried to escape recently. She was redetained.\n  The only thing that is consistent about foreign aid is that it \ncontinues to flow, regardless of restriction, regardless of window \ndressing to say, Oh, if a country does this, we will take it back. It \nnever happens. Our foreign aid, our hard-earned American tax dollars \ncontinue to flow to these countries, no matter what their behavior is.\n  So two weeks ago I came to the floor and I said, in Israel Hamas is \nnow joining with the Palestinian Authority. Hamas is a terrorist group \nthat does not recognize Israel and attacks Israel on a routine basis. \nNow that they will be part of a unity government, they will be \nreceiving foreign aid from America. So I said, for goodness sakes, \nwould we not want restrictions on this aid? Would we not want to say \nthat our money shouldn't flow to Hamas?\n  They should have to recognize Israel's right to exist. They should \nhave to renounce violence. On a daily basis they lob missiles from Gaza \ninto Israel. Yet in the Foreign Relations Committee only one other \nMember had the guts to vote against this foreign aid, because foreign \naid is so entrenched in our national psyche that it goes on regardless \nof the behavior.\n  Now, some will say: There are rules. If Hamas becomes a big part of \nthis government, they won't get any money. Guess what. Hamas can read. \nThey have read our legislation. They are purposely setting up their \nunity government to evade our restrictions.\n  There are already people who say the President has a waiver. So in my \nlegislation, the Stand With Israel Act, we would get rid of the \nPresidential waiver and say that if Hamas joins a government with the \nPalestinian Authority, they should get no American taxpayer money. I \nsaid this two weeks ago. The Democrats said: No, President Obama \ndoesn't want to give up the authority to continue sending money to \nthese countries.\n  A week ago we had another disaster. In Israel three young teenagers \nwere killed: Gilad Shaar, Eyal Yifrah, and Naftali Fraenkel, who was \nalso an American citizen as well--killed in cold blood.\n\n  Do you know what the response of Hamas was? To stand up and cheer. In \nfact, I can give you the direct response of Hamas. Khaled Meshal, their \npolitical director, said: ``Blessed be the hands that capture them.'' \nThey stood with glee and cheered when these three teenage boys were \nkilled in cold blood. These were not soldiers, these were civilians.\n  The news reports are that Hamas has joined this unity government \nprecisely because they are bankrupt. They want to get our money. That \nis why they are joining the unity government.\n  What is ours? Ours is the tepid ``oh, please don't behave that way.'' \nBut we have no teeth. The same thing has happened in Egypt, the same \nthing in Pakistan, country after country. The only consistent is the \nmoney never stops and the behavior never changes.\n  Some will argue that foreign aid is a way to project American power. \nWell, if it is, we ought to be projecting American values. We should \nproject what America stands for. We should not be saying: Here is some \nmoney. Do with it what you will.\n  So this has real teeth. This act is called the Stand with Israel Act. \nIt says: No money to terrorists, no money to Hamas unless they are \nwilling to give up the war and begin to find peaceful means of \ncoexisting.\n  So this evening I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign \nRelations be discharged from further consideration of S. 2265 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to say that I appreciate so much \nthe point of view the Senator from Kentucky brings to the committee and \nhis focus on foreign aid. No doubt there are issues relative to aid to \nmany countries around the world that we need to be looking at. This is \nan issue, though, that I really believe the committee itself should \ndeal with first.\n  While I appreciate his desire to deal with this and bring it directly \nto the floor, on behalf of myself and the chairman of the committee, I \nam going to object, but I am going to object because I really would \nlike for this issue to be heard in an appropriate way--this issue and \nmany others the great Senator has brought forth on the floor today.\n  I thank him for his concern. I thank him for the issues he has \nbrought up. I hope the committee itself will deal with this important \nissue, as it should, through regular order. For that reason, I object \nto this particular unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4213-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4213-S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I was proud to be an original cosponsor \nfor the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which \nprotects American women against violence and human trafficking. I am \nespecially proud of the tribal provisions we included in VAWA, which \nare critical because nearly 40 percent of American Indian women will \nendure domestic violence in their lifetime, compared to 24 percent in \nthe general population. VAWA ensures that violence prevention programs \nreceive strong Federal funding and gives law enforcement powerful tools \nto fight violence and trafficking.\n  Violence against women is not just a problem in the United States; it \nis a challenge around the world. That is why I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the International Violence Against Women Act.\n  One key step to empowering women around the world is through access \nto education. Unfortunately, for many young women around the world \ntoday, educational opportunities are limited. According to the United \nNations, only 35 percent of young women in Sub-Saharan Africa will \nreceive a secondary education, let alone the college degree that opens \nup new opportunities for women in the workplace and in leadership \npositions around the world.\n  But even though gender disparities in education remain high, \nespecially in the developing world, countries and nongovernmental \norganizations are stepping up to the plate to make a difference. Today, \nI want to share the story of an organization which empowers young women \nin Rwanda by helping them receive a strong secondary-school education.\n  Rwanda was devastated by the war and genocide in 1994, but against \nall odds Rwandans have managed to rebuild their country and become a \nmodel of low corruption, economic growth, and gender parity in \ngovernment. The constitution mandates a minimum 30 percent \nrepresentation for women in Parliament, and today, remarkably, it is 64 \npercent women. These women have been instrumental in the reconciliation \nand rebuilding of the country and continue to lead today. However, \nwomen are not represented at this level in all sectors, and in the \nrural areas many parents are skeptical of the value of educating their \ngirls. As is typical in many developing countries, if parents have \nlimited money to send their children to school, many will send only \ntheir boys and\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nkeep the girls at home to help with household chores like collecting \nwood and tending to younger siblings. In Rwanda, 97 percent of girls \nattend primary school, but less than 13 percent attend secondary \nschool, meaning that only a small fraction of Rwanda's young women will \nhave the opportunity to go to university.\n  Rwanda Girls Initiative, RGI was founded in 2008 in Seattle, WA, with \nthe mission of educating and empowering girls of Rwanda to reach their \nhighest potential. RGI believes that education is the foundation on \nwhich all other development is built, and educating girls can \nexponentially increase this impact. With this belief and with a strong \npartnership with the Government of Rwanda, RGI started the Gashora \nGirls Academy of Science and Technology in 2011. Gashora Girls Academy \nis an upper-secondary university prep boarding school for 270 girls in \ngrades 10-12 located in the Gashora sector of Bugesera District, a \npoor, agricultural area located an hour to the south of Kigali, the \ncapital of Rwanda. This area was particularly devastated during the \ncountry's genocide in 1994. Gashora Girls Academy offers a curriculum \nthat focuses on STEM subjects--science, technology, engineering, and \nmath--with an underlying belief in the importance of educating and \nnurturing the ``whole girl.'' Beyond the STEM coursework, students \nfocus on developing life skills, leadership, critical thinking, and \nproblem-solving abilities. Crucially, they get an education in a safe \nenvironment, free from the violence that is all too common for many \nyoung women in Rwanda and around the world.\n  In October 2013, Gashora Girls Academy graduated their first class of \nseniors. Of 85 graduates, 25 are admitted to schools in the United \nStates, including Harvard, Yale, Smith, the University of Pennsylvania, \nand Seattle University. Two more girls are going to McGill University \nin Canada. These 27 girls coming to North America will be receiving \napproximately $4.8 million in financial aid in order to attend world-\nclass institutions. Other graduating students are attending schools in \nCosta Rica, China, South Africa, Ghana, and right at home in Rwanda. \nThese girls will become national leaders, doctors, scientists, \nteachers, and more, each contributing to the success of their country.\n  Enatha Ntirandekura is a recent graduate from Gashora Girls Academy. \nBoth of her parents are subsistence farmers and the very little income \nthey make is from a small plot of land. Though Enatha was always a \nstrong student, some in her village discouraged her parents from \nallowing her to continue her studies. They said that a girl shouldn't \nbe educated. At one point, someone in the village burned her family's \ncoffee trees, their sole source of income. But her parents continued to \nsend her to school, and she had the top score in her district on the \nnational exam after middle school. She was offered a scholarship by the \nRwanda Girls Initiative to attend Gashora Girls Academy. Enatha is a \ntenacious student and scored perfectly on the national exam she took \nafter graduating this past year. Because of her success, she has been \nselected as a Presidential Scholar and will receive a full scholarship \nto an American university this fall. She hopes to study agriculture and \nthen go back to Rwanda to work on the problem of malnutrition and food \nscarcity to help her community.\n  As we can see from Enatha, educating a woman is a tremendous \ninvestment. When Enatha returns home with her degree in agricultural \nscience, that one scholarship to Gashora Girls Academy will empower her \nto help many more people in Rwanda. And Enatha's story is not unique; \nin fact, it is the norm. One extra year of secondary school increases a \ngirl's future wages by 15 to 25 percent. When a woman in the developing \nworld receives 7 or more years of education, she marries later and has \nfewer children. When women and girls earn income, they reinvest 90 \npercent of it into their families, creating a ripple effect for coming \ngenerations. Helping Enatha and the young women like her become \ndoctors, teachers, and leaders will transform not only individuals, but \nentire communities.\n  Educating girls and young women is the surest way to empower them. \nEducation empowers them to teach, to lead, and to stand up against \nviolence. I am honored to stand with my female colleagues to draw \nattention to this important issue. A great education transforms lives \nand can lift up entire communities and countries. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to empower women and girls around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4214-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to \nreauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. It is my pleasure to be \njoined in this effort by my colleague and fellow member of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, Senator Bob Casey, Jr.\n  Brain injuries are among the most frequent reasons for visits to \nphysicians and emergency rooms, and contribute to about thirty percent \nof all injury deaths. A critical health issue for military personnel, \nTBI has also become a signature wound of war. According to a Defense \nand Veterans Brain Injury Center, DVBIC, analysis of surveillance data \nreleased by the Department of Defense, DoD, 33,149 U.S. military \npersonnel were diagnosed with a TBI in 2011 alone.\n  People who survive a TBI can face observable effects lasting just a \nfew days, or serious lifelong disability. A survivor of a severe brain \ninjury typically faces five to 10 years of intensive services and \nestimated lifetime costs in the millions. TBI affects not only the \nperson living with TBI, but also the family and community of which the \nindividual is a part. Families are the primary caregivers for a person \nwith brain injury.\n  The Traumatic Brain Injury Act is the only Federal legislation that \nspecifically addresses issues faced by the millions of American \nchildren and adults who live with a long-term disability as a result of \nTBI. I first introduced the TBI Act with the late Senator Ted Kennedy \nnearly 20 years ago. The TBI Act of 1996 launched an effort to conduct \nexpanded studies and to establish innovative programs for TBI.\n  Three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, \nHHS, administer the TBI program: the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, carries out projects relate to prevention, \nsurveillance, and education about TBI; the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, funds basic and applied research; and the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, HRSA, assists states in improving access \nto health and other services, including protection and advocacy \nservices. The TBI Reauthorization Act of 2014 will continue these vital \nsupports for an extremely vulnerable population. This bill also \ncontinues to encourage interagency coordination and requires HHS to \ndevelop a coordination plan for all Federal activities with respect to \nTBI.\n  According to the CDC, in 2009, nearly a quarter of a million children \nage 19 or younger were treated in emergency departments for sports and \nrecreation-related injuries that included a diagnosis of concussion or \nTBI. This legislation also requires the review of scientific evidence \nregarding brain injury management in children and adolescents, \nincluding current and promising additional research.\n  The TBI program offers balanced and coordinated public policy in \nbrain injury prevention, research, education, and community-based \nservices and supports for individuals living with traumatic brain \ninjury and their families and I ask my colleagues' support for the \nTraumatic Brain Injury Act of 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4214-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4214-S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE McLAUGHLIN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Katherine \n``Kay'' McLaughlin.\n  Kay was born in South Boston, MA, on July 11, 1921. She is the middle \nchild of the five children of Francis Pucci and Mary O'Donnell.\n  Kay grew up a short walk from Boston Harbor near Castle Island, a \nRevolutionary War-era fort that still stands today, and spent many days \nwalking from her home to Castle Island and back, a lifelong habit that \nhas contributed greatly to her long life. She graduated from Boston \nGirls High School\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nand would take great joy in telling her children of the day she and her \nfriends skipped school to see Frank Sinatra perform.\n  After high school, she attended Boston Secretarial School and went to \nwork at Submarine Signal Company located in Boston. By that time, she \nhad already caught the eye of a young man in the neighborhood named Leo \nMcLaughlin. In 1944 they were married.\n  Leo and Kay's first child, a girl, arrived in 1946 and there were \nmore to come. In 1957, Kay and her family moved to Bedford, NH. By \n1961, there were six girls and seven boys in the McLaughlin family. \nIncluded in this group were the children of Kay's deceased sister-in-\nlaw and brother-in-law.\n  At the age of 36, Kay was a mother of 13 with another child to come \nin the immediate future. With wisdom beyond her years, Kay arbitrated \ndisputes between rival factions amongst her children. She provided what \nwas needed to solve their problems and keep the family moving in the \nright direction.\n  Though Kay endured many losses--the death of a baby in childbirth, \nlosing a talented daughter in the prime of her life, and losing her \nhusband--they were not enough to stifle her spirit. As time passed and \nher children produced children of their own, she once again became a \nresource to her 16 grandchildren, keeping secrets and providing aid and \ncomfort.\n  Should Kay somehow find a way to live forever, we are all sure she \nwill provide the same aid and comfort to her 17 great-grandchildren. \nWhile she is with us today in person, she will always be with us in \nspirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING ELLA KIRK, MICHAEL MAHL, ELLA MYERS, AND DR. PETER HOCHLA\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, with deep regret I \nwish to speak about a very tragic event that occurred recently in my \nState. On Friday afternoon, May 23, a plane crashed in Arenas Valley, \njust outside Silver City. It is with great sorrow that we say goodbye \nto four New Mexicans: Ella Kirk; 14, Michael Mahl, 16; Ella Myers, 16; \nall of Silver City, NM; and Dr. Peter Hochla, 67, of Albuquerque.\n  Ella Kirk, Michael Mahl, and Ella Myers were talented, gifted \nstudents. They had just finished their sophomore year at Aldo Leopold \nCharter School in Silver City. They were not only fellow classmates, \nthey were close friends, and they were also dedicated to protecting the \nenvironment. Each served on the Youth Conservation Corps ecological \nmonitoring crew, which won first place at the New Mexico EnviroThon \ncompetition earlier this year.\n  On Sunday, June 1, friends and families gathered at a memorial \nservice in Silver City. Their recollections, as reported in the Silver \nCity Sun-News, recall the three remarkable young people taken so \nsuddenly from our midst.\n  Ella Kirk, despite her youth, was a passionate advocate for \nprotecting the Gila River. Her tireless work to save the Gila from a \ndiversion project resulted in a petition of over 6,400 signatures from \nNew Mexico and around the world. She delivered that petition to the \nGovernor and she testified before the New Mexico State Legislature. \nElla played the fiddle, loved dance and music, and was talented in \nboth. At the memorial service, Patrice Mutchnick paid tribute to her \ndaughter, saying, ``She thought every choice she made affected others, \nand that's the kind of caring individual she was.''\n  Michael Mahl was an honor student. He also was a musician. Michael \nperformed at his first open mic night at Diane's Parlor in Silver City \njust 1 month earlier. Michael's father, John Mahl, also performed that \nnight. He recalled later to the Sun-News that his son was a tough act \nto follow. Michael was also a student leader, and was elected by his \nclassmates to be their next student body president.\n  Like Michael, Ella Myers was an honor student. She was a prolific \nwriter and an athlete. Ella was looking forward to attending the summer \narts program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. At the \nmemorial service, her father, Brian Myers, said simply, ``She was a \nremarkable, gifted, talented artist. She had poise, grace, and \nelegance.''\n  Jim McIntosh, a teacher at Aldo Leopold, noted the talents and \ndistinction of these students. ``Michael had a little bit of Elvis in \nhim. Ella Jaz was polite and razor sharp. Ella Myers wanted to know \nwhat she was made of and proved that when she rode the 31-mile Tour of \nthe Gila with a borrowed bike with me.''\n  We remember these gifted young people, who left us far too soon. We \nhonor who they were, and we mourn who they might have become and what \nthey might have accomplished. But even in their tragically short time \nin this world, they touched many lives and inspired all who knew them.\n  We also remember Dr. Peter Hochla, and his legacy of service to our \nnation and our State. Dr. Hochla was born in Slovakia and immigrated to \nthe United States as a child. He was a physician for the New Mexico \nVeterans Administration, and a retired Air Force colonel. As a \npsychiatrist with the Albuquerque VA hospital, he piloted his own plane \nto provide care to veterans throughout New Mexico. He leaves behind his \nwife of 35 years, Dr. Cheryl Greene Hochla, a son, and a daughter. Dr. \nHochla dedicated his life to defending the freedoms that we hold dear \nand to caring for his fellow veterans.\n  The memory of those we have lost is ever with us, and so is the \nsorrow. We do not know why this tragedy occurred. We do not know why \nthese lives were taken so suddenly. But what we do know is that in \nSilver City and in Albuquerque, there are families and friends whose \nhearts are breaking, who are dealing with grief that is so hard to \nbear, and almost impossible to comprehend.\n  Words cannot alter, cannot change, this profound loss. My wife Jill \nand I wish to extend our deepest condolences. We share in your sorrow, \nand we pray that you will find comfort in memories of your loved ones \nand in the mercy of time and God's grace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4215-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4215-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4215-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on July 3, 2014, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris of Maryland) had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2388.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress and \n     the President of the United States to reauthorize the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1076\n\n       Whereas, Insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption, and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 \n     produced insured losses larger than any natural or man-made \n     event in history; claims paid by insurers to their \n     policyholders eventually totaled some $32.5 billion, making \n     this the second most costly insurance event in United States \n     history; and\n       Whereas, The sheer enormity of the terrorist-induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of haute attacks, produced \n     financial shockwaves that shook insurance markets, causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, The lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-297 (TRIA), \n     in which the federal government agreed to provide terrorism \n     reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, Pub. L. \n     109-144, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-160 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, Under TRIPRA, the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industry-wide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed $100 million; and\n       Whereas, Coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to 20% of the insurer's previous year earned \n     premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, After an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays 15% of residual losses and the \n     federal government pays the remaining 85%, and\n       Whereas, The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of $100 billion of aggregate insured losses, beyond which \n     the federal program does not provide coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     100% of the benefits provided under the program via policy \n     holder surcharges to the extent the aggregate insured losses \n     are less than $27.5 billion and enables the government to \n     recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory recoupment amount; \n     and\n       Whereas, Without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism Insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, The presence of a robust private/public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, Without a program such as TRIPRA, many citizens \n     who want and need terrorism coverage to operate their \n     businesses all across the nation would be either unable to \n     get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage that \n     would be available; and\n       Whereas, Without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n       Whereas, Unfortunately, despite the hard work and \n     dedication of this nation's counterterrorism agencies and the \n     bravery of the men and women in uniform who fought and \n     continue to fight battles abroad to keep us safe here at \n     home, the threat from terrorist attacks in the United States \n     is both real and substantial and will remain as such for the \n     foreseeable future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Eighth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     urge Congress and the President of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President of the United States, the Speaker \n     and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-268. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the Secretary of the Interior \n     to immediately take all necessary measures to operate the \n     Yuma Desalting Plant; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1001\n\n       Whereas, under a treaty agreement entered into in 1973. the \n     United States is required to ensure that water delivered to \n     Mexico as part of Mexico's allocation of Colorado River water \n     meets certain water quality standards; and\n       Whereas, in accordance with this agreement, the United \n     States Congress enacted the Colorado River Basin Salinity \n     Control Act of 1974. which directed and authorized the \n     Secretary of the Interior to construct, operate and maintain \n     a desalting plant to treat drainage water from the Wellton-\n     Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District and deliver the \n     treated water to Mexico; and\n       Whereas, construction of the Yuma Desalting Plant was \n     completed in 1992; and\n       Whereas, the Yuma Desalting Plant is capable of treating \n     100,000 acre-feet of water annually; and\n       Whereas, except for limited, initial operations in 1993, a \n     demonstration run completed in 2007 and a nine-month pilot \n     run completed in 2011, the federal government has failed to \n     operate the Yuma Desalting Plant for most of its 30 years of \n     existence; and\n       Whereas, the Department of the Interior is using 100.000 \n     acre-feet of water from Lake Mead to fulfill its water \n     quality obligations to Mexico, rather than conserving an \n     equivalent amount of water through the operation of the Yuma \n     Desalting Plant; and\n       Whereas, the Colorado River system is in its 14th \n     consecutive year of drought; and\n       Whereas, as a result of these drought conditions, the \n     Department of the Interior is projecting that a shortage on \n     the Colorado River is increasingly likely, with the \n     probability that the shortage will exceed 50% in 2017; and\n       Whereas, the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand \n     Study released by the Bureau of Reclamation in December 2012 \n     concluded that there will be a future imbalance between the \n     supply and demand for Colorado River water and cited measures \n     such as water conservation, reuse and augmentation to stave \n     off future shortages on the Colorado River; and\n       Whereas, the Central Arizona Project is a junior priority \n     rights holder to Colorado River water and would bear the \n     largest reduction of Colorado River water in times of \n     shortage: and\n       Whereas, by abdicating its obligation to operate the Yuma \n     Desalting Plant, the federal government has caused the loss \n     of more than 1,300.000 acre-feet from Lake Mead, placing the \n     State of Arizona at increased risk of water shortage; and\n       Whereas, if the federal government were to operate the Yuma \n     Desalting Plant, it would conserve 100.000 acre-feet per \n     year. equivalent to the water needed to supply more than \n     250.000 Arizona homes with water annually.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     the Interior immediately take all necessary measures to \n     operate the Yuma Desalting Plant.\n       2.

A memorial adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     recognize that open-air burn pits impose significant health \n     risks and enact a presumption of a service connection between \n     open-air burn pit exposure and subsequent illnesses that is \n     similar to the presumption in place for exposure to Agent \n     Orange; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          House Memorial 2002\n\n       Whereas, during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, open-air \n     burn pits were widely used for the disposal of waste in place \n     of incinerators until bases became more established. The \n     military burned nearly everything in the open-air burn pits, \n     including plastic, styrofoam, electronics, metal cans, \n     rubber, ammunition, explosives, human waste and lithium \n     batteries: and\n       Whereas, in 2011. an Institute of Medicine study, requested \n     by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     concluded that there was insufficient data to determine \n     whether burn pit emissions had long-term health consequences. \n     However, some United States military personnel that were \n     stationed near burn pits have stated that burn pit exposure \n     has led to a litany of medical problems: and\n       Whereas, after careful review of the Institute of Medicine \n     report, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has directed the \n     Veterans Health Administration to conduct a long-term \n     prospective study on all adverse health effects potentially \n     related to military deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     including health effects potentially related to exposure to \n     airborne hazards and burn pits; and\n       Whereas, congressional lawmakers passed, and President \n     Obama signed, a bill in 2013 that creates a registry similar \n     to the Agent Orange and Gulf War registries to help patients, \n     doctors and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     determine the extent to which air pollution caused by open-\n     air burn pits has led to medical diseases among service \n     members.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress recognize that open-air \n     burn pits impose significant health risks and enact a \n     presumption of a service connection between open-air burn pit \n     exposure and subsequent illnesses that is similar to the \n     presumption in place for exposure to Agent Orange.\n       2.

Unemployed workers in California receive 37 \n     weeks of EUC, and 26 weeks of state benefits, averaging just \n     two hundred ninety-two dollars ($292) a week; and\n       Whereas, On December 28, 2013, the EUC program expired \n     without an extension from Congress. On that day, 214,000 \n     unemployed workers ran out of EUC in California and 12,500 \n     more will be doing so daily; and\n       Whereas, As of February 24, 2014, close to 1,273,100 \n     unemployed workers in California have run out of all \n     available unemployment benefits; and\n       Whereas, The EUC program brought $4.5 billion in benefits \n     to the California economy in 2013 alone; and\n       Whereas, It is crucial for the United States government to \n     take action in renewing the EUC program and extending the \n     unemployment benefits that millions of people direly need: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature supports the \n     extension of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program \n     and respectfully memorializes the United States Congress to \n     promptly renew the extension of unemployment benefits that \n     will tremendously aid millions of people; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, each Senator \n     and Representative from California in the Congress of the \n     United States, and to the author for appropriate \n     distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-271.

and\n       (11) Impedes upward social mobility, and\n       Whereas, federal payroll taxes, including social security \n     and Medicare payroll taxes and self-employment taxes:\n       (1) Raise the cost of employment;\n       (2) Destroy jobs and cause unemployment; and\n       (3) Have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-\n     income Americans, and\n       Whereas, the federal estate and gift taxes:\n       (1) Force family businesses and farms to be sold by the \n     family in order to pay taxes;\n       (2) Discourage capital formation and entrepreneurship;\n       (3) Foster the continued dominance of large enterprises \n     over small family-owned companies and farms; and\n       (4) Impose unacceptably high tax-planning costs on small \n     businesses and farms, and\n       Whereas, a broad-based national sales tax on goods and \n     services purchased for final consumption:\n       (1) Is similar in many respects to the sales and use taxes \n     that are authorized in 45 of the 50 states;\n       (2) Will promote savings and investment;\n       (3) Will promote fairness;\n       (4) Will promote economic growth;\n       (5) Will raise the standard of living;\n       (6) Will enhance productivity and international \n     competiveness;\n       (7) Will reduce administrative burdens on the American \n     taxpayer;\n       (8) Will improve upward social mobility;

Those denials \n     compound the grief of the few remaining survivors of the \n     atrocities, desecrate the memory of the victims, and cause \n     continuing pain to the descendants of the victims; and\n       Whereas, The Republic of Turkey has escalated its \n     international campaign of Armenian Genocide denial, \n     maintained its blockade of Armenia and increased its pressure \n     on the small but growing movement in Turkey acknowledging the \n     Armenian Genocide and seeking justice for this systematic \n     campaign of destruction of millions of Armenians, Greeks, \n     Assyrians, Pontians, Syriacs, and other Christians upon their \n     biblical-era homelands; and\n       Whereas, Those citizens of Turkey. both Armenian and non-\n     Armenian, who continue to speak the truth about the Armenian \n     Genocide, such as human rights activist and journalist Hrant \n     Dink, continue to be silenced by violent means; and\n       Whereas, The accelerated level and scope of denial and \n     revisionism, coupled with the passage of time and the fact \n     that very few survivors remain who can serve as reminders of \n     the indescribable brutality and the lives that were \n     tormented, compel a sense of urgency in efforts to solidify \n     recognition of historical truth; and\n       Whereas, The United States is on record as having \n     officially recognized the Armenian\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\n     Genocide in the United States government's May 28, 1951, \n     written statement to the International Court of Justice \n     regarding the Reservations to the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, through \n     President Ronald Reagan's April. 22, 1981, Proclamation No. \n     4838, and by Congressional legislation/including House Joint \n     Resolution 148 adopted on April 8, 1975, and House Joint \n     Resolution 247 adopted on September 10,1984; and\n       Whereas, Even prior to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United States has a \n     record of having sought to justly and constructively address \n     the consequence's of the Ottoman Empire's intentional \n     destruction of the Armenian people, including through Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 12 adopted on February 9, 1916, Senate \n     Resolution 359 adopted on May 11, 1920, and President Woodrow \n     Wilson's November 22, 1920, decision entitled, The Frontier \n     between Armenia and Turkey; and\n       Whereas, By consistently remembering and forcefully \n     condemning the atrocities committed against the Armenians, \n     and honoring the survivors as well as other victims of \n     similar heinous conduct, we guard against repetition of such \n     acts of genocide and provide the American public with a \n     greater understanding of history; and\n       Whereas, This measure would declare that the Legislature \n     deplores the persistent, ongoing efforts by any person, in \n     this country or abroad, to deny the historical fact of the \n     Armenian Genocide; and\n       Whereas, California is home to the largest Armenian-\n     American population in the United States, and Armenians \n     living in California have enriched our state through their \n     leadership and contribution in business, agriculture, \n     academia, government, and the arts; and\n       Whereas, The State of California has been at the forefront \n     of encouraging and promoting a curriculum relating to human \n     rights and genocide in order to empower future generations to \n     prevent the recurrence of genocide; and\n       Whereas, On April 24, 2013, the President of the United \n     States stated, ``A full, frank, and just acknowledgment of \n     the facts is in all of our interests. Nations grow stronger \n     by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the \n     past, thereby building a foundation for a more just and \n     tolerant future''; and\n       Whereas, President Obama entered office having stated his \n     ``firmly held conviction that the Armenian Genocide is not an \n     allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but \n     rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming \n     body of historical evidence'' and affirmed his record of \n     ``calling for Turkey's acknowledgment of the Armenian \n     Genocide''; and\n       Whereas, The United States' national interests in \n     establishing equitable, constructive, stable, and durable \n     relations between Armenians and Turks cannot be meaningfully \n     advanced by circumventing or otherwise seeking to avoid the \n     central political, legal, security, and meal issue between \n     these two nations: Turkey's denial of truth and justice for \n     the Armenian Genocide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby designates \n     the month of April 2014, as ``California Month of Remembrance \n     for the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature commends its conscientious \n     educators who teach about human rights and genocide; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully calls upon the \n     Congress and the President of the United States to act \n     likewise and to formally and consistently recognize and \n     reaffirm the historical truth that the atrocities committed \n     against the Armenian people constituted genocide; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on the President to \n     work toward equitable, constructive, stable, and durable \n     Armenian-Turkish relations based upon the Republic of \n     Turkey's full acknowledgment of the facts and ongoing \n     consequences of the Armenian Genocide, and a fair, just, and \n     comprehensive international resolution of this crime against \n     humanity; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls upon the Republic of \n     Turkey to acknowledge the facts of the Armenian Genocide and \n     to work toward a just resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, the Governor, and the Turkish \n     Ambassador to the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-274. A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Florida urging the President of the United States to issue \n     final approval for construction and completion of the \n     Keystone XL pipeline project; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                           House Memorial 281\n\n       Whereas, Floridians consume approximately 26 million \n     gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel daily and approximately \n     9.5 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel annually, and\n       Whereas, across party lines, Floridians have long \n     recognized the dependence of the state's tourism and \n     agricultural economy on access to reliable and affordable \n     petroleum products, and\n       Whereas, many other Florida industries, including \n     fertilizer, agrochemical, plastic, manufacturing, bakeries, \n     juice processing, pulp and paper, road construction, metals, \n     restaurants, and grocery stores, are heavily dependent on \n     access to reliable and affordable petroleum products to \n     transport goods, and\n       Whereas, Gulf state refineries produce the vast majority of \n     the gasoline and diesel fuel crude oil delivered and consumed \n     in Florida, and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL pipeline will be capable of \n     transporting more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day \n     to 57 Gulf state refineries, and\n       Whereas, the crude oil transported through the Keystone XL \n     pipeline could replace oil from unstable regions of the world \n     with oil from Canada, a friendly and historically reliable \n     neighbor and our principal source of imported crude oil, and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of \n     Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety \n     Administration, pipelines are one of the safest and most \n     cost-effective means to transport petroleum products, and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL pipeline could reduce the large \n     numbers of tankers and barges carrying crude oil through the \n     Straits of Florida and across the Gulf of Mexico, and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL pipeline will not encounter the \n     disruptions experienced by tankers and barges delivering \n     crude oil to Gulf state refineries during hurricanes in the \n     Gulf of Mexico, thus enhancing Florida's energy security \n     during emergencies, and\n       Whereas, the southern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline \n     has already been approved and construction is proceeding, and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of \n     State, construction of the United States portion of the \n     Keystone XL pipeline is a $3.3 billion project that will \n     create thousands of American jobs, and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL pipeline project has been subject \n     to the most thorough public consultation process of any \n     proposed United States pipeline, and\n       Whereas, according to the Supplementary Environmental \n     Impact Statement issued by the United States Department of \n     State, multiple environmental impact statements and studies \n     have concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline poses the least \n     impact to the environment and is much safer than other modes \n     of transporting crude oil, and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL pipeline project has received \n     bipartisan support in the United States Congress, including a \n     letter to the President signed by 53 Senators urging the \n     President to support the pipeline, and\n       Whereas, a recent Pew Research Center survey has found that \n     two-thirds of Americans support the Keystone XL pipeline \n     project: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the President of the United States is strongly urged to issue \n     final approval for construction and completion of the \n     Keystone XL pipeline project; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-275. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado urging and requesting members of \n     Congress to increase the federal minimum wage and thereafter \n     tie it to inflation to help ensure that hard-working \n     Americans can earn a fair wage and afford to care for their \n     families; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                   House Joint Resolution No. 14-1012\n\n       Whereas, The federal minimum wage was established through \n     the ``Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938'', in response to the \n     Great Depression, to ensure that workers earned enough to pay \n     for necessities and minimum monthly expenses; and\n       Whereas, Since then, the cost of living has steadily \n     increased while the federal minimum wage has generally \n     remained stagnant; and\n       Whereas, Congress has only raised the minimum wage twice in \n     the past 20 years; and\n       Whereas, The federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, \n     has declined from its peak of $10.72 in 1968 to $7.25 today, \n     a 33% decrease in purchasing power; and\n       Whereas, Under the current minimum wage, it is possible to \n     work full time and still be under the minimum federal poverty \n     line; and\n       Whereas, It is virtually impossible for a minimum-wage \n     worker to afford a two-bedroom apartment in any state while \n     working a 40-hour week; and\n       Whereas, Raising the federal minimum wage would decrease \n     American dependency on public assistance programs, such as \n     Section 8 housing vouchers and food stamps, in order to pay \n     for living expenses and raising families; and\n       Whereas, The majority of those who would benefit from a \n     minimum wage increase are full-time workers who are \n     supporting their families in moderate- to low-income \n     households; and\n       Whereas, For the vast majority of low-skilled or unskilled \n     workers, the minimum wage should be simply a starting salary \n     that gets them employed and gives them a chance to advance; \n     and\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\n       Whereas, Increasing the minimum wage would immediately \n     boost the wages of about 15 million low-income workers; and\n       Whereas, Raising the federal minimum wage is projected to \n     significantly boost the economy at large by increasing \n     purchasing power of workers, thereby increasing the United \n     States gross domestic product; and\n       Whereas, In 2006, Colorado voters decisively voted to \n     approve Initiative 42, which raised the state minimum wage \n     and tied it to inflation in order to preserve the purchasing \n     power of Colorado workers and help ensure that they can \n     support themselves and their families; and\n       Whereas, Colorado raised the minimum wage in 2011 and 2012 \n     over the federal minimum, which contributed to a decrease in \n     the unemployment rate from 8.73% to 7.2% during that two-year \n     period; and\n       Whereas, Several other states have notably raised their \n     minimum wages during times of high unemployment, including \n     Washington, Oregon, Ohio, and Arizona, and those states all \n     experienced decreases of at least 1.5% in unemployment during \n     the same two-year period; and\n       Whereas, Raising the minimum wage not only will stimulate \n     the economy but will also lift millions of Americans out of \n     poverty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-ninth \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein,  That we, the Colorado General Assembly, \n     urge and request members of Congress to increase the federal \n     minimum wage and thereafter tie it to inflation to help \n     ensure that hard-working Americans can earn a fair wage and \n     afford to care for their families; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Joint Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of \n     the United States Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders \n     of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, and \n     the Majority and Minority Whips of the United States House of \n     Representatives and Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-276. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois acknowledging the \n     role of optimal infant nutrition during the first year of \n     life and that new mothers require information, guidance, and \n     support to provide the best nutritional start for their \n     babies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 419\n\n       Whereas, Scientific research demonstrates that good \n     nutrition beginning in utero and extending throughout the \n     first year of life is critical to the healthy growth and \n     development of infants and that breastfeeding is the best \n     form of infant nutrition by providing certain health benefits \n     for both the mother and child; and\n       Whereas, The United States Surgeon General and the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics recommend babies be exclusively fed \n     with breast milk for the first 6 months of life, and continue \n     on with breast milk through the first year of life; and\n       Whereas, Healthy People 2020, an initiative that comprises \n     science-based, ten-year national objectives to improve the \n     health of all Americans, administered under the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services, aims to increase the \n     percentage of women initiating breastfeeding to 81.9% and \n     still continuing to breastfeed when their newborn is 6 months \n     of age to 60.6%; and\n       Whereas, It is a mother's choice in how she feeds her baby, \n     and the choice is often made based on the best feeding option \n     for her infant given her and her family's life circumstance, \n     including familial, cultural, and community issues as well as \n     based on barriers to breastfeeding, including returning to \n     work, medical difficulties, and lack of breastfeeding \n     support; and\n       Whereas, The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support \n     Breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other \n     public health organizations do promote breastfeeding goals, \n     and some go beyond this to promote other dietary guidance for \n     feeding an infant under age 2 or identify what a mother \n     should do if she cannot or chooses not to breastfeed, or \n     needs to supplement breastfeeding; and\n       Whereas, An example of this is provided in the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture Food & Nutrition Service \n     publication, ``Feeding Your Baby in the first Year'', which \n     gives participants in the Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) \n     food program a basic overview of the best sources of \n     nutrition for their babies in the first year, starting with \n     breastfeeding, including infant formula if needed, following \n     with the introduction of solid foods; and\n       Whereas, Infant nutrition research has generated a range of \n     iron-fortified infant formulas (as well as specialized infant \n     formulas for premature babies and for those babies with \n     medical conditions needing sustenance to survive and thrive) \n     that address a critical need in providing a safe and \n     nutritious alternative to breast milk for mothers who are \n     unable to breastfeed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Eighth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     acknowledge the role of optimal infant nutrition during the \n     first year of life and that new mothers require information, \n     guidance, and support to provide the best nutritional start \n     for their babies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we recognize the scientific research \n     documenting that breastfeeding is the best form of infant \n     nutrition and supports breastfeeding promotion policies; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That we aspire for mothers to make informed \n     choices about how to feed their infants by requiring that \n     mothers receive, prior to and/or after birth, complete and \n     balanced information on all infant nutrition options; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we call on the U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services to publish and distribute maternal and infant \n     nutrition information approved by the U.S. Surgeon General to \n     mothers prior to and after birth; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge state health departments to \n     facilitate public-private collaboration with families and \n     communities to increase maternal and infant nutrition \n     awareness, particularly in underserved areas, and provide \n     access to nutritional programs for mothers and their children \n     beginning in utero and throughout their first year of life;

In so doing, they have sacrificed their time, \n     dreams and often their own health or lives to preserve our \n     liberties and freedom: and\n       Whereas, we owe a special debt of respect and gratitude to \n     those who were captured and yet kept faith, even while being \n     deprived of their freedom and possibly tortured, and to those \n     whose fate remains unknown by their loved ones: and\n       Whereas, it is fitting and proper that the United States \n     attempt to determine the fate of members of the American \n     armed forces who were taken prisoner or who went missing from \n     World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Cold War \n     missions, the Persian Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     Operation Enduring Freedom: and\n       Whereas, a Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs in the \n     United States House of Representatives would be tasked with \n     conducting a full investigation of all unresolved matters \n     relating to any American personnel who are unaccounted for \n     from these conflicts, including MIAs and POWs who are missing \n     or were captured.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

Grijalva and \n     Yvette Clarke, although the Obama Administration reportedly \n     prioritized deporting only criminals, many individuals with \n     no serious criminal history consistently have been deported; \n     and\n       Whereas, Increased deportations and a continuously broken \n     immigration system exacerbate the living conditions of United \n     States citizen children whose parents have been deported; and\n       Whereas, Separation of children from their parents, \n     irrespective of immigration status, always results in severe \n     consequences for young children who are left with no parental \n     guidance or care and a highly unstable financial situation; \n     and\n       Whereas, As immigration continues to be at the center of a \n     national debate, President Obama and Congress must implement \n     a more humanitarian immigration policy that keeps families \n     together; and\n       Whereas, California is home to approximately 10.3 million \n     immigrants of which approximately 2.6 million are \n     unauthorized to live in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Many Members of Congress recently signed a letter \n     requesting President Obama to suspend any further \n     deportations; and\n       Whereas, Since California is home to a large number of \n     unauthorized immigrants from all parts of the world, this \n     state should make it a priority to keep families together and \n     continue to press President Obama and Congress for a solution \n     to our broken federal immigration system: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the \n     Senate urges President Obama to take executive action to \n     suspend any further deportations of unauthorized individuals \n     with no serious criminal history; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-280. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado urging and requesting members of \n     Congress to update the formula in Section 4 of the federal \n     ``Voting Rights Act of 1965'', as amended, as quickly as \n     possible to ensure Section 5 of the act can be restored and \n     every citizen's voice is heard and every vote is counted; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Joint Resolution No. 14-1009\n\n       Whereas, The Colorado General Assembly has always supported \n     the federal ``Voting Rights Act of 1965'', as amended, and \n     its legacy of protecting American citizens; and\n       Whereas, The Voting Rights Act was one of the greatest \n     achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and helped to not \n     only allow equal access at the ballot box, but to facilitate \n     advancement in other areas of life for minorities across the \n     country; and\n       Whereas, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution in 1869, giving black men the \n     right to vote, but attempted and actual barriers to political \n     participation remain consistently introduced in capitols and \n     Congress even today; and\n       Whereas, In 1964, fewer than seven percent of eligible \n     black citizens were registered to vote in Mississippi and, by \n     the end of 1966, that figure had risen to nearly 60 percent, \n     and during the same period Alabama voter registration rates \n     climbed from below 20 percent to over 50 percent; and\n       Whereas, The so-called Jim Crow laws of the South made \n     voter registration and election rules more restrictive, \n     intentionally reducing political participation by minority \n     voters with the use of poll taxes, literacy tests, and \n     record-keeping and identification requirements; and\n       Whereas, In 1964, only five black citizens held seats in \n     Congress (with none from any Southern state) and a total of \n     94 black citizens served in all legislatures, and today the \n     Congressional Black Caucus has 43 members while over 600 \n     African Americans hold seats in all legislatures, with \n     another 8,800 being mayors, sheriffs, school board members, \n     and other elected officials; and\n       Whereas, Forty-seven percent of these public officials live \n     in the seven states originally covered by the Voting Rights \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, Voter turnout in the South dropped drastically due \n     to segregation-era voting laws, and as a result, by 1910 not \n     a single black voter was registered in 27 of 60 parishes in \n     the state of Louisiana, and black voters were completely \n     eliminated from the rolls in North Carolina from 1896 to \n     1904; and\n       Whereas, In a five-to-four decision in June 2013, the \n     United States Supreme Court ruled that Section 4 of the \n     Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, which section sets \n     forth the formula under which states and jurisdictions must \n     seek preclearance from the United States Department of \n     Justice before enacting new voter laws and regulations or \n     making changes to existing laws; and\n       Whereas, The preclearance provision in Section 5 of the \n     Voting Rights Act relied on the formula contained in Section \n     4 to protect the voting rights of all citizens; and\n       Whereas, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her \n     dissent to the Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder case, stated, \n     ``Just as buildings in California have a greater need to be \n     earthquake-proofed, places where there is greater racial \n     polarization in voting have a greater need for prophylactic \n     measures to prevent purposeful race discrimination.''; and\n       Whereas, Prior to the United States Supreme Court's \n     invalidation of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, federal \n     district courts in several preclearance states, including \n     Texas, Florida, and Alabama, ruled their proposed voting law \n     changes unconstitutional; and\n       Whereas, Sufficient data has been established from numerous \n     studies and surveys that could serve as the basis for a new \n     formula, including data found from calculating the overall \n     size of the minority population, voter turnout among all \n     groups, the number of voting discrimination lawsuits as well \n     as number of cases that have been lost or settled, and the \n     prevalence of racially polarized or biased voting as a factor \n     in voter preferences; and\n       Whereas, Congress has repeatedly extended the Voting Rights \n     Act, which was first passed in 1965 and then reauthorized for \n     five years in 1970, for seven years in 1975, and for 25 years \n     in 1982, and Congress renewed the act in 2006 for 25 years \n     after holding extensive hearings from which they found \n     persistent racial discrimination at the polls; and\n       Whereas, When the Voting Rights Act passed in 2006, it \n     enjoyed wide bipartisan support and was signed into law by \n     President George W. Bush: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-ninth \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein, That the Colorado General Assembly urges \n     and requests members of Congress to update the formula in \n     Section 4 of the federal ``Voting Rights Act of 1965'', as \n     amended, as quickly as possible to ensure Section 5 of the \n     act can be restored and every citizen's voice is heard and \n     every vote is counted; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Joint Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the members of the United \n     States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, \n     the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Black Caucus of \n     State Legislators, the National Organization of Black Elected \n     Legislative Women, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-281. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recognizing the month of May \n     2014 as ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month''; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 367\n\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is better \n     known as Lou Gehrig's Disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the upper and \n     lower motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horn \n     of the spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, The initial symptom of ALS is weakness of the \n     skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; and\n       Whereas, As ALS progresses, the patient experiences \n     difficulty in swallowing, talking and breathing; and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy and the \n     patient becomes a functional quadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, Patients with ALS typically remain alert and aware \n     of their loss of motor functions and the inevitable outcome \n     of continued deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, ALS affects military veterans at twice the rate of \n     the general population; and\n       Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most commonly between 40 \n     and 70 years of age, with the peak age of about 55, and \n     affects both men and women without bias; and\n       Whereas, Annually, more than 5,000 new ALS patients are \n     diagnosed throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, In Pennsylvania, there are currently more than \n     1,000 individuals who have been formally diagnosed with ALS; \n     and\n       Whereas, The $350,000 in State funding the General Assembly \n     appropriated for ALS patient care in fiscal year 2013-2014 \n     provided services to more than 900 constituents and provided \n     a substantial savings to the State budget and to taxpayers; \n     and\n       Whereas, The ALS Association reported in 2009 that on \n     average, patients diagnosed with ALS only survive two to five \n     years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, ALS has no known cause, prevention or cure; and\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month \n     increases the public's awareness of ALS patients' \n     circumstances and acknowledges the terrible impact this \n     disease has not only on patients but on their families as \n     well and recognizes the research being done to eradicate this \n     horrible disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania designate the \n     month of May 2014 as ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis \n     Awareness Month'' in Pennsylvania; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-282. A memorial adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     restore the presumption of a service connection between Agent \n     Orange exposure and subsequent illnesses to United States \n     Vietnam War veterans who served in the waters, which is \n     defined as the combat zone, and in the airspace over the \n     combat; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                             House Memorial\n\n       Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the United States military \n     sprayed twenty-two million gallons of Agent Orange and other \n     herbicides over Vietnam to reduce forest cover and crops that \n     the enemy used. These herbicides contained dioxin, which has \n     since been identified as carcinogenic and has been linked \n     with a number of serious and disabling illnesses affecting \n     thousands of veterans; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress passed the Agent Orange \n     Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-4: 105 stat 11: 38 United States code \n     section 1116) that presumptively recognized as service-\n     connected certain diseases among military personnel who \n     served in Vietnam between 1962 and 1975. This presumption has \n     provided access to appropriate disability compensation and \n     medical care for Vietnam veterans who were diagnosed with \n     illnesses such as type II diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-\n     Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, \n     multiple myeloma, peripheral neuropathy, AL amyloidosis, \n     respiratory cancers, soft tissue sarcomas and others yet to \n     be identified; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to a 2001 directive, the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs policy has denied the \n     presumption of a service connection for herbicide-related \n     illnesses to Vietnam veterans who cannot furnish written \n     documentation that they had ``boots on the ground'' in-\n     country during their time of service, making it virtually \n     impossible for countless United States Navy, Marine and Air \n     Force veterans to pursue their claims for benefits. Moreover, \n     personnel who served on ships in the ``Blue Water Navy'' in \n     Vietnamese territorial waters were, in fact, exposed to \n     dangerous airborne toxins, which not only drifted offshore \n     but washed into streams and rivers draining into the South \n     China Sea; and\n       Whereas, ever since this 2001 directive was implemented, \n     the United States Navy has been excluded from receiving \n     benefits even though Agent Orange has been verified, through \n     various studies and reports, as a wide-spreading chemical \n     that was able to reach Navy ships through the air and \n     waterborne distribution routes; and\n       Whereas, warships that were positioned off the Vietnamese \n     shore routinely distilled seawater to obtain potable water. A \n     2002 Australian study found that the distillation process, \n     rather than removing toxins, in fact concentrated dioxin in \n     water that was used for drinking, cooking and washing. This \n     study was conducted by the Australian Department of Veterans \n     Affairs after it found that Vietnam veterans of the Royal \n     Australian Navy had a higher rate of mortality from Agent \n     Orange-associated diseases than did Vietnam veterans from \n     other branches of the military. When the United States \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied specific \n     cancers among Vietnam veterans, it found a higher risk of \n     cancer among United States Navy veterans; and\n       Whereas, herbicides containing dioxin did not discriminate \n     between soldiers on the ground and sailors on ships offshore; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than thirty veterans service organizations \n     support the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2013. By \n     not passing H.R. 543, a precedent could be set to selectively \n     provide certain groups with injury-related medical care while \n     denying other groups without any financial, scientific or \n     consistent reasoning; and\n       Whereas, when the Agent Orange Act passed in 1991 with no \n     dissenting votes, congressional leaders stressed the \n     importance of responding to the health concerns of Vietnam \n     veterans and ending the bitterness and anxiety that had \n     surrounded the issue of herbicide exposure. The federal \n     government has also demonstrated its awareness of the hazards \n     of Agent Orange exposure through its involvement in the \n     identification, containment and mitigation of dioxin ``hot \n     spots'' in Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should reaffirm the \n     nation's commitment to the well-being of all its veterans and \n     direct the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     administer the Agent Orange Act under the presumption that \n     herbicide exposure in Vietnam includes the country's inland \n     waterways, offshore waters and airspace, encompassing the \n     entire combat zone.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress restore the presumption \n     of a service connection between Agent Orange exposure and \n     subsequent illnesses to United States Vietnam War veterans \n     who served in the waters, which is defined as the combat \n     zone, and in the airspace over the combat zone.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the state of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-283. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Missouri urging the President of the United \n     States and administration officials to support the increased \n     importation of oil from Canadian oil sands, to approve the \n     newly routed TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline, and to support \n     and facilitate permitting for oil production off the northern \n     coast of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, high oil prices are having a major detrimental \n     impact on families, farms, and businesses in Missouri and are \n     likely to undercut the prospects for an economic recovery; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States currently imports almost half of \n     its oil and petroleum products, making it dependent on \n     foreign sources and subject to interruptions and price \n     fluctuations stemming from geopolitical forces; and\n       Whereas, such instability has damaging consequences both \n     for our economy and our national security; and\n       Whereas, the United States Geological Survey estimates a \n     resource of up to 27 billion barrels of oil in the Chukchi \n     and Beaufort seas of Alaska, providing a vast domestic oil \n     reserve, but opposition and regulatory hurdles are keeping \n     energy producers from accessing these resources; and\n       Whereas, the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project seeks \n     to link expanded oil production from the Canadian oil sands \n     to refineries in the United States and to facilitate the flow \n     of oil from the Dakotas to the Gulf Coast, thereby decreasing \n     our dependence on oil from outside of North America; and\n       Whereas, Canada is a close friend and ally, with whom we \n     share links of infrastructure and energy networks and other \n     ties, so that dollars spent on Canadian oil will likely \n     contribute to the success of the American economy; and\n       Whereas, the TransCanada pipeline project is projected to \n     create construction and manufacturing jobs in the United \n     States, adding billions of dollars to the United States \n     economy; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the House of Representatives \n     of the Ninety-seventh General Assembly, Second Regular \n     Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby call upon \n     President Barack Obama and administration officials to:\n       (1) Support the increased importation of oil from Canadian \n     oil sands and to approve the newly routed TransCanada \n     Keystone XL pipeline to reduce our oil dependency on unstable \n     governments, strengthen ties with an important ally, and \n     create jobs for American workers;\n       (2) Support and facilitate permitting for oil production \n     off the northern coast of Alaska to decrease our dependence \n     on foreign oil and spur investment in the American economy: \n     and be it further\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare properly inscribed \n     copies of this resolution for President Barack Obama, Vice \n     President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, United \n     States House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and \n     each member of the Missouri Congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/07/senate-section/article/S4224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROCKEFELLER, from the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 2028.

Res. 495\n\n       Whereas 1 in 5 children in the United States struggle with \n     hunger;\n       Whereas research has found that more than 30 percent of \n     low-income families do not have enough food during the summer \n     months;\n       Whereas the summer food service program for children \n     established under section 13 of the Richard B.
