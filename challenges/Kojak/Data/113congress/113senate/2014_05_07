Mr. President, it is not often I agree with what the Koch \nbrothers say or do. Their radical agenda is normally so far out of the \nmainstream that it makes opposition to their agenda very easy.\n  So imagine my surprise when last week I read a quote from a Koch \nspokesperson in a Kansas newspaper. That is where they are based. Here \nis what the Koch brothers said:\n\n       We are not experts on climate change. We do believe there \n     should be free and open debate on the climate issue and it \n     should be based on sound science and intellectual honesty.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The debate should take place among the scientific \n     community, examining all points of view and void of politics, \n     personal attacks and partisan agendas.\n\n  Listen to what they said: sound science and intellectual honesty from \nthe Koch brothers on this issue.\n  Their statement sounds pretty good. I agree that the Koch brothers, \nKoch Industries, and their myriad political organizations are not \nexperts on climate change--and that is an understatement.\n  I also agree that the debate on climate change should be based on \nsound science. In fact, the sound science has long been debated. The \nPresiding Officer has spent 38 years in Congress and has been one of \nthe leading proponents of recognizing over the decades how our climate \nis changing. Everyone sees it is changing but not the Koch brothers, \nand I will explain a little more.\n  The sound science has long been debated and has reached a clear, \nunambiguous conclusion that climate change is here and it is real.\n  Of course Charles and David Koch know the debate on climate change is \nalready taking place within the science community. They know that. The \ndebate has been open and it has been free.\n  The overwhelming evidence proves that pollution is causing climate \nchange.\n  No one has to take my word for it, including the multi-zillionaire \nKoch brothers--the two richest people in the world.\n  Just yesterday, the White House--not the White House; they announced \nit--released a report and an assessment that was authored by more than \n300 scientists. Newspapers all over the world are talking about this.\n  One of the Hill newspapers we all read has a picture on the front \nthat is stunning. It shows a picture of a man walking near a portion of \na scenic highway that collapsed near Pensacola, FL. A new report--I am \ntalking about the one released yesterday--finds climate change is \nrapidly--rapidly--turning the United States into a stormy and dangerous \nplace and notes rising sea levels and natural disasters. The headline: \n``New Climate Report: People's Lives Are at Risk.'' Subhead: ``Despite \nwarnings, no signs of changed minds on Hill.''\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n  The former head of the environment committee in the Senate said it is \na hoax.\n  The Washington Post: ``Study: Climate Risks Growing.'' It has graphs \nhere about the land surface air temperature rising, sea surface \ntemperature rising, sea level rising, Arctic Sea melting, glacier mass \ndecreasing.\n  Headline, Washington Post: ``Study: Climate Risks Growing.'' Subhead: \n``Every Part of U.S. Being Affected.'' And, of course, the sub-\nsubheadline: ``Conservatives criticize federal assessment.''\n  New York Times, front page, shows a picture of the United States: \nRising temperatures. Now, plus two degrees, that is so significant. The \ntemperature rising just less than a degree can change weather patterns \nin the world, and we are talking about two degrees. Now, they are \nchanging.\n  Most of the State of Nevada is a desert. We have the most mountainous \nState in the Union, but most of Nevada is a desert. We have 314 \nseparate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. \nWe have a mountain that is 14,000 feet high. But even in Nevada we are \nat the top of the rung in one part of Nevada. It is red, as it is in \nmany places, from east to the west, to the Midwest. How can people deny \nwhat is going on? Look at the storms.\n  Mark Pryor described to our caucus yesterday what happened in \nArkansas. The winds blew in Arkansas at 190 miles an hour. Think about \nthat. I was in Reno, NV, once when the wind was blowing 80 miles an \nhour. I couldn't believe the wind could blow any harder. It is so \nfrightening. I was staying in a hotel. They had picture windows. I put \nmy bed in the bathroom so it wouldn't be near windows. But the wind \nblowing 100 miles an hour faster than that, that is what happened in \nArkansas. As he described, these weren't mobile homes; these were brick \nstructures that were just disintegrated. All that was left when that \nstorm hit was the foundation--most of the time.\n  So the Koch brothers want some open debate. It is here. We have done \nit.\n  The report I am referring to concluded there are disastrous--\ndisastrous--climate changes taking place on our Earth due to human \nactivity.\n  While the Koch brothers admit to not being experts on the matter, \nthese billionaire oil tycoons are certainly experts at contributing to \nclimate change. That is what they do very well. They are one of the \nmain causes of this--not a cause, but one of the main causes.\n\n  An analysis by the University of Massachusetts-Amherst--the Presiding \nOfficer knows this well as he is from the State of Massachusetts--\nranked Koch Industries as one of the Nation's biggest air and water \npolluters, period. In one year, Koch Industries released 31 million \npounds of toxic air. How much is that? It is more than Dow Chemical, \nExxonMobil, and General Electric, combined, emit. They are the \nchampions.\n  The Koch brothers' actions against the environment aren't limited, \nthough, to toxic emissions. Charles and David Koch are waging a war \nagainst anything that protects the environment.\n  I know that sounds absurd, but it is true. These two billionaire oil \nbarons are actively campaigning now and spending tons of money against \nanything that seeks to curb pollution, limit our dependence on fossil \nfuels or lower energy costs for working families. Even the Keystone \ndebate--they are one of the main owners of all of that stuff up there, \nthat ugly tar stuff in Canada. They are, if not the largest, the second \nlargest owner of that stuff up there.\n  The Kochs are pumping millions of dollars into political \norganizations, fighting legislation that is good for the environment. \nThey are not doing it only in Washington; they are doing it in State \ngovernments. They have intimidated State legislators.\n  This is ironic, having come from them, I guess--there should be a \ndifferent way of describing it--given their statement urging the ``void \nof politics . . . and partisan agendas'' on issues pertaining to the \nenvironment.\n  For instance, we in the Senate are now considering an energy \nefficiency bill. Who is working against that more than anyone else? The \nKoch brothers. This bipartisan legislation will spur the use of energy \nefficiency technologies in private homes and in commercial buildings at \nno cost to the taxpayers. This bill will make our country more energy \nindependent, protect our environment, and save consumers on their \nenergy bills. If that is not enough, it would also create 200,000 \njobs--American jobs that can't be exported. Even the Chamber of \nCommerce--by the way, huge amounts of money come from the Koch brothers \nto the Chamber of Commerce to run ads against Democratic Senators. But, \nin this instance, the Chamber of Commerce even supports Shaheen-\nPortman.\n  Unsurprisingly, Americans for Prosperity, the main arm of the Koch \nbrothers--not the only one; they have lots of them--has been vocal in \nits opposition to even this bill I just talked about--energy \nefficiency. Remember, these are the same Koch brothers whose president \nTim Phillips recently bragged that his organization targets Republicans \nwho work on environmental issues. Again, you can't make up stuff like \nthis. Here is a direct quote:\n\n       What it means for candidates on the Republican side is, if \n     you . . . buy into green energy or you play footsie on this \n     issue, you do so at your political peril. The vast majority \n     of people who are involved in the [Republican] nominating \n     process--the conventions and the primaries--are suspect of \n     the science. And that's our influence. Groups like Americans \n     for Prosperity have done it.\n\n  They say, if you do anything that is good for the environment, they \nare against you. That is what they said.\n  So try to do something to affect climate change? The Koch brothers \nand their billions of dollars are coming after you not only here in \nWashington but in State legislatures around the country.\n  So that statement says it all. The Koch brothers admit they and their \nradical followers don't accept the science of climate change. The \nPresident of the Koch brothers' organization is actually bragging about \nRepublicans' denial of evidence-based climate change. The Kochs know \nthat scientists across the globe aren't working to mislead the world \nabout the climate. They know that. These 300 scientists who are the \nnexus of the report issued yesterday are people working at \nuniversities--as indicated, at the University of Massachusetts, the one \nquote I cited today. All over the country, these people are trying to \nfigure out what is going on. They know what is going on, and that is \nwhat the report is about.\n\n  Charles and David Koch choose to ignore climate change. They--the \nKochs--choose to put our environment at risk. Why? Because it makes \nthem richer, more affluent. They are making billions of dollars and in \nso doing are significantly damaging our environment.\n  A New York Times article recently highlighted the Kochs' attempt to \nfight renewable energy, even in State legislatures. It became so \npronounced that the New York Times wrote an editorial criticizing these \ntwo wealthy men. As States promote solar and wind energy by offering \nincentives to renewable energy companies, the Koch brothers see how it \nwill affect their bottom line.\n  They do not like that. They want to continue their coal operations, \ntheir diesel fuel operations, their spewing of chemicals all over \nAmerica because they can make more money.\n  As renewable energy grows and becomes more efficient--and it is--oil \nand coal become a smaller piece of the pie. That is a fact, and that \njust won't cut it for Charles and David because it affects their bottom \nline. How unfortunate for the world that the Koch brothers trash this \nbeautiful planet and jeopardize my children's and my children's \nchildren's health and future just to add more zeros to their huge bank \naccount. Bloomberg publications now estimate that the Kochs' combined \nwealth exceeds $100 billion. How much money is enough for these two \nmen?\n  I urge my Republican colleagues in the Senate to stand up to them. \nWell, they won't. You know, after I have given this speech, a few of \nthem will come down here and say: It is freedom of speech. What is \nwrong?\n  We have an obligation to stand when these lies are perpetrated to the \nAmerican people. So no Republican is going to come and defend this \nenergy efficiency bill.\n  Energy efficiency and independence is good for our country, it is \ngood for American families, and it is good for the Earth we live in. So \ndo not be fooled--do not be fooled--by the greed of these billionaires \nnamed Koch.\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\n  Mr. President, during today people will be watching and they will see \na quorum call, nothing on the screen. Why? Because we are in the midst \nagain of one of these never-ending Republican filibusters--hundreds of \nthem. Hundreds of them. Let me remind everyone that Lyndon Johnson was \nmajority leader for 6 years. During that period of time he had to \novercome one filibuster. Mr. President, I have lost track; it is \nhundreds and hundreds of filibusters that we have had to overcome, and \nwe have the Republicans coming here today saying: Well, all we want is \na few amendments.\n  They do everything they can to stop us from progressing on \nlegislation that is good for this country. Anything that is good for \nBarack Obama they think is bad for the country, and for 5\\1/2\\ years \nthey have opposed everything this good man has tried to do. It is a \nshame.\n  So to anyone out there wondering what is going on, it is another of \nthe hundreds of filibusters they have conducted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2743-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the motion to \nproceed.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 368, S. 2262, a bill to \n     promote energy savings in residential buildings and industry, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my staff just told me we are now at more \nthan 500 filibusters--500.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the majority leader has brought to the \nattention of the Senate today the headline news across America. This \nreport by our government about what we are facing with environmental \nchanges in America is a call to action.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and I made a challenge, which I have \nmade before. I will make it again. I am asking any Republican Senator \nto come to the floor today and dispute the following claim: The \nRepublican Party of the United States of America is the only major \nparty in the world--the only major political party in the world--that \nis in denial of what is happening to our environment when it comes to \nclimate change and global warming.\n  I have said it repeatedly. No one has disputed it. One political \nparty is in denial about a change on this Earth that could literally \naffect generations to come. As a result, we are, I guess, stopped in \nour tracks. There is nothing we can do.\n  This bill before us today--the energy efficiency bill, which is on \nthe calendar--if there were ever anything we should agree on, it is \nthis. If your motive in energy efficiency is to save money for a \nbusiness or a family, it is in this bill. If your motive in energy \nefficiency is to create jobs in America, it is in this bill--190,000 \nmaybe 200,000 American jobs. If your motive is to do something for the \nenvironment, energy efficiency is the right bill. But here we are stuck \nin another Republican filibuster. Why? Because they insist on a series \nof amendments.\n  The sponsors of this legislation--Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire; \nSenator Portman, a Republican from Ohio--basically came to an agreement \non a bill that is bipartisan in nature, and there are 10 or more \nbipartisan amendments included in this bill.\n  Has the minority had an opportunity to be part of this process? \nAbsolutely. Yet it is never enough. They want more and more, and they \nare prepared to slow down or stop the passage of a bill which in \nordinary times would have passed by a voice vote. That is not going to \nhappen. Unfortunately, we are going to be mired down in more procedural \nvotes until some of these Senators get the amendments they want.\n  We wasted a week last week, a week in the Senate when nothing \nhappened, when this bill could have passed. Why? One Republican Senator \nwanted to offer an amendment on the Affordable Care Act. They have \nflogged the Affordable Care Act in every imaginable direction, and now \nthis Senator wants to deny health insurance coverage or at least make \nit more expensive for the staff of Members of the Senate and the House \nof Representatives, as well as Members themselves. That is his idea of \na good idea to debate on the floor of the Senate at the expense of this \nbill.\n  Well, shame on the Senate. Shame on those who are obstructing us. We \nhave had enough, have we not, of these filibusters and this \nobstruction? It is time that we roll up our sleeves and get down to the \nwork of the people of this country.\n\n\n                            Health Research\n\n  While I am on the subject, I am leaving to go to a committee meeting \nof the Appropriations Committee to talk about Federal funding for \nhealth research. This is another issue which troubles me, because of \nthe lack of commitment by this Congress to one of the most fundamental \nresponsibilities we have as a government.\n  We are blessed with the best biomedical research agency in the world \ntoday--the National Institutes of Health--one of the most \nextraordinarily public health agencies--the Centers for Disease \nControl--and we continue year after year to underfund these agencies at \nthe expense of America's health and at the expense of creating good-\npaying jobs in our country.\n  For the last 10 years or more we have failed to give the National \nInstitutes of Health protection from inflation, and as a result their \nspending power to award research grants has declined by 22 percent over \nthe last 10 years. As to the researchers at the National Institutes of \nHealth, there are fewer and fewer younger researchers. They have lost \nhope that there is a commitment by this government, by this Nation, to \nmedical research. What is the net result? The net result is that we, at \nour peril, fail to do the research, to find the cures for diseases that \nmake a difference in the lives of Americans and American families.\n  The Republicans argue that it is just too darn much money, that we \ncannot afford medical research. Well, let me give you one statistic to \nthink about. Last year Medicare and Medicaid spent $203 billion of \ntaxpayers' money--$203 billion--on the victims of Alzheimer's--$203 \nbillion. If research at the National Institutes of Health could get to \nthe heart of this disease and find a way to cure it--that would be a \nmiracle--or delay its onset--it seems within the realm of possibility \nmaybe--we could save dramatic amounts of money. Medical research pays \nfor itself.\n  Listen to what is happening in the House of Representatives. We have \na proposal for an extension of a Tax Code provision that will give a \nbreak to businesses to invest in research projects. There is nothing \nwrong with that. I have supported it. Throughout my time in the House \nand Senate, I have supported it. But listen--listen--to the logic. The \nRepublicans in the House argue that if it is an R tax credit that \ngoes to the private sector for research so they can develop new \nproducts and services and be more profitable and create more \nemployment, it does not have to be paid for. Over 10 years, it would \ncost us $140 billion for the extension of this credit, on a 10-year \nbasis, to the private sector, and the Republicans have argued, yes, \nthis may nominally add to the deficit. But, in fact, it does not. The \nresearch and development leads to more businesses, more jobs, more tax \nrevenue to the government, and so they argue we do not have to pay for \nit.\n  Now let me step over here. What about the research and development \ndone, the medical research done by government agencies? Is that worth \nsome money to taxpayers? Absolutely. Finding cures for diseases at \nNIH--Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer; I could go on--each and every one \nof them would be a savings to the taxpayers. Yet they argue: No, that \nis government spending; that adds to the deficit.\n  That is such upside-down thinking. It is such a denial of reality. \nBasic fundamental medical research and biomedical research by these \nagencies relieves suffering, finds cures for diseases, and reduces the \nexpenditures of\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\nour government on health care. I would argue it is just as justifiable, \nif not more so, for us to be making the same investment in increasing \nbiomedical research over a 10-year period of time--incidentally, at the \nsame cost.\n  A 5-percent increase--real increase--in spending in biomedical \nresearch each year for the next 10 years at the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Defense \nmedical research, the Veterans' Administration medical research--those \nfour agencies--5 percent real growth comes out to almost identically \nthe same cost as extending the R tax credit for private companies.\n  Do them both. Do them both and I guarantee you America will get more \nthan a $140 billion return for each one of them. Thinking ahead in an \ninnovative way, with some vision toward the future, investing in \nresearch is really buying for the next generation a better life in \nAmerica and a stronger economy for our country.\n  I want to make that appeal to my colleagues. If we bring the R tax \ncredit to the floor and the argument is made: Well, we do not have to \npay for that because it is going to private companies, the same \nargument should be made when it comes to increasing our investment in \nbiomedical research at the most fundamental agencies that promote \nhealth in America and the world.\n  Back to this bill for a moment, I hope that by the end of the day the \nRepublicans will end this filibuster, that we can start moving toward \npassing this bill. It should have been done last year. It should be \ndone now. These excuses that we need a litany of amendments before we \ncan even consider the bill are just delaying something that is very \nimportant for this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Energy Amendments\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this morning it was suggested \nthat Republicans are creating a problem on the Portman-Shaheen bill \nbecause we are insisting on amendments. I am stunned that anybody would \nthink that insisting on amendments would be unusual or out of order. \nThat is what we used to do in the Senate. We had amendments offered and \nwe had votes on them by both sides.\n  One Senator, it was suggested, insisted on an ObamaCare amendment. \nThat was dropped 5 days ago. Nobody is insisting on an ObamaCare \namendment on the Portman-Shaheen bill. Senator Vitter had suggested \nthat earlier but decided that was not a good idea on this particular \nbill because it was the opportunity, we hoped, to get four or five \nvotes on important energy-related amendments. Senator Durbin actually \nobjected.\n  So I think it is important to set the record straight this morning. \nWhat Senate Republicans are asking for is four or five amendments \nrelated to the subject of energy. I would remind our colleagues that \nthe minority in the Senate has had eight rollcall votes on amendments \nit was interested in since last July--since last July.\n  During that same period the House of Representatives, where it is \noften thought the minority has no influence at all, has had 125 \nrollcall amendment votes. So what is going on is the Senate is being \nrun in a way that only the majority leader gets to decide who gets to \noffer amendments. He says: Maybe I will pick one for you.\n  That is not the way the Senate used to operate, not the way the \nSenate should operate, and I hope not the way the Senate will operate \nstarting next year.\n  The majority leader, as I indicated, is basically shutting down the \nvoice of the people here in the Senate; that is, the people who are \nrepresented by 45 of us. For 7 long years he has refused to allow truly \ncomprehensive debate on energy in this Chamber. We have not had a \ncomprehensive debate since 2007. He had a chance to change that \nyesterday. Dozens of Senators asked him to do that. We know the \nAmerican people want us to do it. But he refused. Apparently he does \nnot think the American people deserve a vote on a single energy \namendment. Apparently he does not think the American middle class, \nwhich is being squeezed by rising energy costs and over-the-top \ngovernment regulations, needs the kind of relief Republicans are \nproposing. He clearly must not think the people of eastern Kentucky \ndeserve our help either. Kentuckians in the eastern part of my State \nare experiencing a depression--that is a depression with a ``D''--that \nthe President's energy policies actually created and are making worse.\n  The administration has proposed new rules that would make life even \nharder for those folks, rules that would make it effectively impossible \nto build another coal plant anywhere in the country. Coal is a vital \nindustry to the livelihood of literally thousands of people in my \nState. We should be allowed to help them, but the majority leader said \nno.\n  Let's be honest. He does not seem to think the people we represent \ndeserve a say on much of anything anymore. Democrats over in the \nRepublican-controlled House, as I indicated earlier, have had 125 \namendment votes since last July, but here in the Senate the Democratic \nmajority has allowed us nine. I said eight earlier. It is actually nine \namendments since last July, that is, rollcall votes. It is shameful. \nBut it says a lot about which party is serious these days and which one \nis literally playing games. It says a lot about the complete lack of \nconfidence Washington Democrats have in an open debate. What is wrong \nwith having an open debate? They are completely out of ideas, and \napparently they do not want anybody to know that Republicans have \nsuggestions to be made. So they are attempting to muzzle us at a time \nwhen middle-class Americans are in need of some relief. Do they really \nthink that Americans who have had to cope with rising electricity \nprices, stagnant wages, and growing hopelessness in the Obama economy--\ndo they really believe the Senate should not even be debating ideas \nthat might help them?\n  It is hard to think otherwise. So I think middle-class Americans, \nlooking at the Senate these days, are left to draw an obvious \nconclusion: That their concerns matter far less to today's Senate \nDemocrats than the political imperatives of the far left. We know the \nPresident's political team must be pleased. One White House aide said \nthey plan to lean on Senate Democrats to ``get the right outcome'' this \nweek; in other words, to stop the American people from having a real \ndebate on energy policies.\n  For the President and his political pals, it must feel like ``mission \naccomplished.'' This means he can avoid having to sign or veto \nlegislation that might be good for the middle class but offensive to \nthe furthest orbit of the left. It also means he can continue to impose \nenergy regulations such as the one I mentioned earlier, through the \nback door, to govern by executive fiat, without having to worry about \nniceties such as Democratic accountability.\n\n  After all, far-left activists presumably demand that the President \nimpose those regulations because they do not want the American people \ngetting in the way again. They know what happened the last time they \nlet that happen, when a fully Democratic-controlled Congress could not \neven pass a national energy tax.\n  As long as it has a Senate Democratic majority on its side, the far \nleft knows it will not have to worry about the American people messing \nup its plans again. The majority leader proved that again this very \nweek. The far left will not have to worry about the representatives of \nthe American people voting through the Keystone XL Pipeline either.\n  Here you have a project the American people support overwhelmingly \nthat would create thousands of jobs when we have rarely, rarely needed \nthem more, and that would pass Congress easily if the majority leader \nwould allow a vote, but he will not because the far left will not let \nhim. If we do get a vote, the Democratic leadership will be sure to \nfilibuster against the jobs the Keystone XL Pipeline will create.\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n  Activists on the left positively hate this energy jobs initiative. \nThey rail against it constantly, even though they cannot seem to \nexplain in a serious way why it is a bad idea. But it is a symbol in \ntheir minds, so they demand Senate Democrats block its approval and \nSenate Democrats dutifully do just that.\n  Again and again we see the needs of the middle class subsumed to the \nwhims of the left. That has become the legacy of today's Democratic \nmajority. They have diminished the vital role the Senate plays in our \ndemocracy. We do not seem to debate or address the most serious issues \nanymore, even with significant events at home and abroad that deserve \nour attention, because for the Senate Democrats who run this place, the \npriority is not on policy, it is on show votes and political posturing \n24/7. This reflects a party that has simply run out of ideas, that has \nfailed to fix the economy after 5\\1/2\\ years of trying, and now sees \nits political salvation not in making good policy for the middle class \nbut in exciting the left enough to save the day come November.\n  I guess we will see if this strategy pays off. But that is not what \ntruly matters around here. What matters is that millions in our country \nare hurting and that Senate Democrats do not seem to want to act. Look, \nthey should be joining with us to help our constituents because the \nAmerican people did not send us here to play games or to serve the far \nleft. Our constituents sent us here to have serious debates on issues \nthat matter to them, such as energy security, national security, \neconomic security. All three can be addressed if the majority leader \nwould simply allow Republican amendments to be considered.\n  Our constituents want Congress to make good policy. The fact that we \ndo not seem to do that under the current majority is quite tragic. The \nAmerican people deserve better. They deserve a debate and they deserve \nto be heard.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                      Specialist Russell E. Madden\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a brave and \nhonorable young man from Kentucky who was tragically lost in the \nperformance of his military service. SPC Russell E. Madden, of \nBellevue, KY, was killed on June 23, 2010, in Afghanistan in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  Specialist Madden volunteered for his final mission and was in the \nlead vehicle in a convoy that was attacked by the enemy. His vehicle \nwas struck by a rocket shell. He was 29 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, he received the Bronze Star Medal, the \nPurple Heart Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the \nOverseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.\n  Russell Madden joined the Army just under 2 years before his death. \nHis father Martin Madden reflects on his son's time in service by \nsaying:\n\n       Nineteen months is not a long military career. But 19 \n     months was long enough to graduate basic training at Fort \n     Sill, Oklahoma, with honors.\n\n  His dad continues:\n\n       Nineteen months is long enough to be running and gunning as \n     a lead convoy gunner on convoys that sometimes took 16 hours \n     to move 40 miles to replenish forward operating bases, \n     completing over 85 missions outside the wire in nine months . \n     . .\n       Nineteen months may not represent a prolonged period of \n     time in the minds of most Americans; however, it is just long \n     enough to create a patriot, to define heroism, and accept a \n     place of honor among those who stand in silent testimonial to \n     the strength of this great nation.\n\n  The bond between father and son that moves Martin to speak these \nwords was forged, of course, not just over 19 months but over Russell's \nentire lifetime. Like so many of the extraordinary heroes who hail from \nKentucky, Russell's childhood is full of examples of a young man \ndevoted to a cause greater than himself.\n  He was the oldest of three children, along with his younger sister \nLindsey and younger brother Martin. Like most young siblings, at times \nthe kids would fight. Russell's parents had a unique way to defuse \nfamily tussles. Martin said:\n\n       In order to settle [disagreements], we placed both [Russell \n     and Lindsey] in the middle of the living room and told them \n     to stand there hugging each other. After about 20 minutes of \n     standing there hugging, we would begin to hear them laughing \n     and having a good time, and we would go in and tell them if \n     they could get along they could stop.\n\n  Little sister Lindsey remembers childhood stories like these, just as \nshe remembers her brother's dedication to service. She said:\n\n       All he ever told me, every time I talked to him, was that \n     he wanted to make me proud. And he has. He always made me \n     proud.\n\n  Russell attended Bellevue High School, where he displayed his \ndedication to serving on a team as a star athlete in football, \nbaseball, and track. During his senior year, the track team was 1 week \naway from the State meet when the top hurdler was injured. The whole \nteam was in danger of not qualifying unless someone stepped in. Russell \nvolunteered to run the hurdles, even though he had never run a hurdle \nevent in his life.\n  Martin Madden recalls:\n\n       Russell took off running at full sprint, stopped when he \n     got to the hurdle and jumped over it, then took off running \n     at full speed until he reached the next hurdle and stopped \n     and jumped over that one, throughout the track. It was the \n     most unorthodox style the coach had ever observed, but with \n     the state qualifier taking place next week, the coach allowed \n     Russell to represent the team.\n\n  As a result, Russell's first-ever hurdle event was the State-\nqualifying match. Even using what his father calls his ``God-awful ugly \nstyle,'' Russell qualified and ran in the final State competition, \nwhere he placed sixth.\n  Russell was a winner on the football field just as he was in track \nand field. Every Friday night, during the 1999 season, fans packed \nGilligan Stadium to watch Bellevue High play out what would be an \nundefeated season. Russell played running back and was such a talented \nathlete that he could also kick field goals and extra points, return \nkickoffs, punt, quarterback, and play wide receiver--and that is only \non the offensive side of the ball. He also played linebacker on \ndefense.\n  As a result of his all-around athletic success, volunteer work, and \ncoaching of youth football teams, Russell was inducted into both the \nBellevue High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Northern Kentucky \nYouth League Football Hall of Fame. He was also recognized by the \nNorthern Kentucky High School Football Coaches Association for his \nsportsmanship. Russell graduated from Bellevue High School in 2000.\n  In 2008 Russell and his wife Michelle learned that their son Parker \nhad a preliminary diagnosis indicating a high potential for cystic \nfibrosis. Martin said:\n\n       Russell joined the Army to fight for his country and \n     provide the medical treatment necessary for his young son.\n\n  Russell enlisted in 2008, and during his deployment to Afghanistan \nwas assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Infantry \nBrigade Combat Team based out of the Conn Barracks in Germany.\n  Russell's father Martin recalls how Russell's fellow soldiers felt \nabout Russell's dedication to them and their team--a dedication that \nechoed the drive of the young man who volunteered for the hurdles and \nexcelled on the gridiron.\n  ``This . . . is what the soldiers in his platoon told me,'' Martin \nsaid.\n  Russell said to them:\n\n       Guys, I will not let you down. We will get there. . . .\n\n  If ever there was going to be a problem, they wanted to be with \nRussell because they knew he would never let them down.\n  Respect and admiration for Russell's dedication to a cause greater \nthan himself even reached the halls of the Kentucky General Assembly, \nwhich passed a joint resolution to designate Kentucky Route 1120, \nwithin the city limits of his hometown of Bellevue, as the ``SPC \nRussell Madden Memorial Parkway.'' Russell's family was present as the \nnew street sign was unveiled for the first time.\n  Russell's wife Michelle said:\n\n       It is an awesome tribute to my husband. He deserves it. I \n     want this sign for my son to say, ``Hey, that's my dad's \n     sign. That's what my dad's done for us.'' This is what is \n     going to carry on his legacy.\n\n  We are thinking of SPC Russell E. Madden's family today, including \nhis wife Michelle, his son Parker, his stepson Jared, his parents \nMartin Madden and Peggy Davitt, his sister Lindsey, his brother Martin, \nand many other beloved family members and friends.\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\n  It is important that Russell's family knows that no matter how long \nor how short his time in uniform may have been, Martin Madden is \nabsolutely right that his son will and must be forever remembered and \nrevered for the sacrifice he has made on behalf of our country.\n  I know SPC Russell E. Madden certainly will be remembered by this \nSenate. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in expressing the utmost \nrespect for his life and his service.\n  We extend our greatest condolences to his family for a loss on behalf \nof our Nation that can never truly be erased.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I was on the floor, as was the Presiding \nOfficer, listening to the distinguished Republican leader's glowing \ntribute to this fallen warrior. We were moved, certainly, by it.\n  He preceded his comments by talking about what is happening to the \nSenate and the fact that even though we are debating, supposedly, the \nfirst energy legislation to come to the Senate floor since 2007, the \nmajority leader's--Majority Leader Reid, who has the power under the \nSenate rules to basically be the traffic cop, to decide which \namendments get heard and voted on and which ones do not--comment was to \nthe effect that the majority leader has essentially shut the Senate \ndown and denied the minority an opportunity to offer their amendments \nand to get votes on amendments.\n  I know people listening must say: Well, here they go again talking \nabout the prerogatives and rights of Senators. But that is not what I \nam talking about. I am talking about the rights and prerogatives of the \npeople I represent, 26 million Texans who are being shut out of a \ndebate on--of all topics--energy.\n  We take great pride in the fact that Texas is an energy-producing \nState, and it is one of the reasons why our economy has been doing \nbetter than much of the rest of the country, because we have \nresponsibly, and with the right kind of environmental stewardship, \ntaken advantage of this gift of the natural resources that we have in \nour State.\n  Thanks to the innovation, and thanks to the investment and the hard \nwork of a lot of people, we are doing better--thank you--than the rest \nof the country when it comes to job creation.\n  It really offended me when the majority leader this morning said:\n\n       Mr. President, during today people will be watching \n     [presumably in the gallery, on C-SPAN, maybe on the evening \n     news] and they will see a quorum call, nothing on the screen. \n     Why? Because we are in the midst again of one of these never-\n     ending filibusters of the Republicans--hundreds of them, \n     hundreds of them. Let me remind everyone, Lyndon Johnson was \n     majority leader for 6 years.\n\n  Well, I would just interject Lyndon Johnson didn't run the Senate the \nway Senator Reid does, when he was majority leader. Senator Reid \ncontinues:\n\n       During that period of time he had to overcome one \n     filibuster.\n       Mr. President, I have lost track. It is hundreds and \n     hundreds of filibusters that we have had to overcome, and we \n     have the Republicans coming here saying today: Well, all we \n     want are a few amendments. They do everything they can to \n     stop us from progressing on legislation and things that are \n     good for this country.\n\n  He is talking about the 45 Senators on this side of the aisle--that \nwe will do everything we can to stop from progressing on legislation \nand on things that are good for the country. How insulting can you be?\n  We are going to have differences of opinion, sure. That is why are \nhere. That is why they used to call the Senate the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, because on the floor, not even Majority Leader Reid \ncan shut me down or any other Senator who stands and is recognized by \nthe Chair to speak on a matter of importance to their State or to the \ncountry.\n  But to have the majority leader come to the floor and say that what \nwe are trying to do is stop progress on legislation and things that are \ngood for the country--he goes on. Senator Reid accuses us of trying to \nstop:\n\n       Anything that is good for Barack Obama they think is bad \n     for the country, and they, for 5\\1/2\\ years, have opposed \n     everything that this good man has tried to do. It is a shame.\n       So anyone out there wondering what is going on, it is \n     another of the hundreds of filibusters they have conducted.\n\n  Majority Leader Reid has been a Member of the Senate for a long, long \ntime. He knows this is not true.\n  So why he would come to the floor of the Senate and say it is \npuzzling to me.\n  We had 2 years when President Obama and Senator Reid's party could do \nanything they wanted. How is that? Well, because they had 60 votes in \nthe Senate, which is sort of the magic number, when you can basically \ndo anything you want in the Senate because the minority doesn't have \nenough numbers to stop the majority or to check their power.\n  So Democrats had the House of Representatives, with Nancy Pelosi as \nSpeaker. They had the Senate, with 60 votes, Harry Reid as the majority \nleader, and they had Barack Obama in the White House.\n  What did we get in those 2 years? Well, one of the things we got was \nObamaCare. We know it was sold on the basis of: If you like what you \nhave you can keep it, your premiums would go down $2,500 and, yes, you \ncould keep your doctor too. But none of that proved to be true--none of \nit.\n  We got Dodd-Frank. Do you remember Dodd-Frank? That was the \nlegislation following the financial crisis of 2008 and the meltdown on \nWall Street that was very damaging to the economy of this country; \nthere is no doubt about it. What we got with unrestrained and unchecked \nsingle-party efforts during the time when they controlled both branches \nof government--the executive and the legislative branches--was \nlegislation that targeted Wall Street, but Main Street was actually the \ncollateral damage. I hear that from my credit unions and community \nbankers in Texas all the time, that the regulations are strangling them \nand keeping them on the sidelines, hurting the economy and hurting job \ncreation.\n\n  My point is the Framers of our Constitution understood it is \nimportant to have vigorous debate on the differences of opinion each of \nus bring in representing our various States. The Constitution makes the \npoint, in Article I, Section 1, that ``all legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \nconsist of a Senate and House of Representatives.''\n  I ask the majority leader, if the Constitution vests all legislative \nauthority in the Senate and the House, what happens when half of the \nSenate is shut down and denied an opportunity to participate in the \nlegislative process?\n  The Constitution goes on to state what kind of legislative power is \nvested in the Senate and the House. Section 8, Article I of the \nConstitution lays out a laundry list of powers the Congress has--the \nsorts of things Congress is intended to legislate on. It contains \neverything from the ``Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts \nand Excises . . . To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \nTo establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization . . . To coin Money . . \n. To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and \ncurrent Coin of the United States; To establish Post Offices and post \nRoads; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts . . . To \nconstitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court.''\n  The list goes on and on. Of course, finally, the last phrase in \nArticle I, Section 8 is laying out the power of the Congress to \nlegislate, where it says, ``To make all Laws which shall be necessary \nand proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all \nother Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the \nUnited States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.''\n  So I ask the majority leader: If the Constitution grants the Congress \nthe power to legislate and specifies all of the things we are supposed \nto legislate on and do as the elected representatives of our various \nStates, what happens when we are shut out of the process, when we are \ndenied an opportunity to represent the people who elected us to office, \nwho have entrusted us with a sacred responsibility and a stewardship?\n  It is beyond outrageous. It is beyond outrageous for the majority \nleader to make the remarks he made this morning that I previously \nquoted because he knows they are not true. He knows they are not \nfactual. The Constitution itself guarantees my constituents, all 26 \nmillion of them, the rights laid out in the Constitution in Article I. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\nthey vote for a U.S. Senator, they are entitled to have their Senator \nparticipate in the legislative process. We are not guaranteed the right \nto win these votes, but we are given the responsibility and the \nprivilege of representing them in this place, and we cannot do it when \nthe majority leader runs this place like a dictator.\n  We are debating--supposedly--an energy efficiency bill. As I said, it \nis the first time we have had an energy debate on the floor since 2007. \nThere are a lot of very good ideas that have been offered to improve \nthe underlying piece of legislation. I have no doubt the underlying \nlegislation would pass. It will pass, if the majority leader allows us \nan opportunity to offer and debate our proposals for improving the \nunderlying bill, but if he is going to shut us out of the process and \ndeny the people I represent a voice and an opportunity to improve this \npiece of legislation, we are not going to cooperate.\n  The majority leader keeps saying no to amendments, and he denigrates \nour right on behalf of our constituents to offer amendments and to get \nvotes on those amendments. I know I have come to the floor before, as \nother Members have come to the floor, and tried to speak on this topic. \nI know sometimes this sounds as though it is all just about process. It \nis about process. How boring could that be. It is important because in \nessence the majority leader has imposed a gag rule on the minority in \nthe Senate, a gag rule in the world's greatest deliberative body--no \nmore.\n  I don't know what the majority leader is afraid of. Is he afraid of a \nvote on the Keystone XL Pipeline? I think I saw a poll the other day \nthat said roughly 61 percent of the respondents to that poll thought \nthis was a good idea, that we get more of our energy from a friendly \nsource, such as the nation of Canada, and rather than having to \ntransport all of it in tank cars on trains that occasionally crash and \ncause a lot of damage, it might be better to build this pipeline so we \ncould safely transport that oil from Canada down to refineries in my \nState, where it could be converted into gasoline, aviation fuel, and \nthe like, and in the process create an awful lot of jobs.\n  Sixty-one percent, according to that poll I read, said they thought \nthat was a pretty good idea. Yet the majority leader will not even \nallow a vote on that amendment. He will not allow a vote on minority \namendments. He will not allow a vote on Democratic amendments. I bet my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle must be frustrated, indeed, \nbecause they have been denied an opportunity to participate in this \nprocess, too, thanks to the autocratic powers being exercised by the \nmajority leader.\n  Here is another idea this side of the aisle had for an amendment we \nwould like to get some debate and a vote on. We are not asking to win. \nWe can do the math. We know we are in the minority. But these are \nimportant topics. Vladimir Putin invades Crimea, the Russian Army is \nbuilding up in the Ukraine and causing havoc in that country, and it \nlooks like he is not going to stop. The President said we are going to \nmake sure there is a cost imposed as a result of Vladimir Putin's \ninvasion of Ukraine, so we are going to impose a number of sanctions. \nThe fact is, as my colleague from Arizona, the senior Senator from \nArizona, has said, Russia is a gas station posing as a country. I think \nthat is a pretty humorous way of saying the energy Russia produces and \ntransmits to Ukraine and Europe is its main source of economic power \nand revenue. If we could undermine that by exporting more energy from \nthe United States to Europe, that would dissuade Vladimir Putin, \nperhaps, in addition to other things we might do, but the majority \nleader will not even allow us an opportunity to vote on that issue. By \nthe way, it will also continue to create more jobs in America.\n  Here is what the majority leader has done. Since he has been majority \nleader, he has basically blocked any opportunity for Republicans to \noffer amendments on legislation 84 times--84 times--including 14 times \njust this year. He has shut us out. He has imposed the Reid gag rule \nand said: I don't care what the Constitution says. I don't care that \nyou were elected by the people in your State to come here and be their \nvoice and to offer their ideas on legislation. I don't care. We are not \ngoing to allow it, is what Majority Leader Reid has said 84 times.\n  Then he has the audacity to impugn our motives this morning, to \ninsult the job we are trying to do to represent our constituents. He \ncalls that a filibuster. George Orwell wrote a book called ``Nineteen \nEighty-Four,'' where he talked about how people can twist the ordinary \nunderstanding of the English language in a way that is very dangerous. \nBut I would suggest that no definition of filibuster could be derived \nfrom the fact the majority leader has imposed his gag rule, has shut us \nout of the legislative process, and denied us the opportunity to do \nwhat the Constitution guarantees. He calls that a filibuster? Give me a \nbreak.\n  So the majority leader comes to the floor this morning and says: If \nyou are watching C-SPAN or if you happen to be visiting the Capitol and \nare in the gallery, all you are going to see are quorum calls. You are \ngoing to hear nothing but crickets on the Senate floor because there is \nnot going to be anything happening there.\n  The reason that is true, in large part, is because he has shut down \nthe process. He has denied us a voice. He has denied us an opportunity \nto participate in the legislative process the Constitution talks about \nin the provisions I just read.\n  I am probably not going to persuade Majority Leader Reid about the \nerror of his ways because I don't think he cares. I don't think he \ncares. It is not going to affect whether he is reelected in Nevada, \nperhaps, and there is nothing the minority can do, given the fact the \nmajority leader has extraordinary power under the Senate rules and \nunder the precedent of the Senate. He can get away with it, if the \nSenate allows it, if the public allows it. But that is why it is \nimportant to come to the Senate floor and expose this fraud for what it \nis. It is a fraud.\n  The majority leader is trying to deceive the American people into \nthinking that by speaking out against this gag rule we somehow are an \nobstacle to passing legislation. We have certain responsibilities to \nthe people who sent us, and that responsibility does not include \nsitting down and shutting up when we are being run over by a freight \ntrain by the name of Senator Harry Reid. It is outrageous. It is \noutrageous.\n  Thanks to the majority leader we likely will not have any amendments \non this piece of legislation. I think at last count there were roughly \n30 ideas we had that we would like to offer amendments on. We have even \nproposed to Majority Leader Reid that we would take those 30 or 40 \namendments and talk among ourselves and maybe we can reduce those to 5 \nor so relevant amendments--items that have to do with energy, with \njobs, with national security. His answer is, no, forget it.\n  Instead of accepting responsibility for his decision, he blames us \nfor filibustering. What does he expect us to do? To be quiet? To sit in \nour offices while he runs this railroad that used to be known as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, runs over our rights and the rights \nof the people we represent? Well, we are not going to sit down and shut \nup. We are not.\n  Back in my younger days I used to be a practicing lawyer. I would be \nhired by a client to come into court and make an argument on their \nbehalf, to give them the representation they were entitled to under our \nsystem of justice. I had my argument and the opposing party had their \nargument and their lawyers and their witnesses, and they came in and \npresented it before a jury of either 6 people or 12 people, depending \non the court you were in, and we would ultimately settle that dispute \nbetween the parties, kind of like the difference of opinion we have \nhere on how the Senate ought to operate and what business we ought to \nbe conducting.\n  In court, when you have a dispute between opposing parties, the judge \nand the jury who are impartial will listen to the facts, and the judge \nwill decide what the law is that applies in that kind of case, and then \nyou will have a verdict. And that law, with the judgment the judge \nsigns incorporating those findings of fact by the jury, is how the case \nis decided.\n  How does that work here in the Senate? What is the analogy? The best \nanalogy I can think of is that we will indeed have a verdict, but it is \ngoing to be by the voters in the midterm elections come November.\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\n  My only conclusion is that the majority leader must be afraid of \nhaving this sort of robust debate because he knows it will expose some \nof his members to votes they may have a hard time explaining back home. \nThere actually may be some accountability, Heaven forbid. So his answer \nis to shut down the Senate. It is very sad.\n\n\n                        Veterans Administration\n\n  Mr. President, with each passing week we are finding out more and \nmore about institutional failures within the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. We recently learned that the Phoenix VA system had a secret \nwaiting list designed to conceal a massive backlog of delayed \nappointments, and that some of the veterans who were put on this secret \nwaiting list actually died while waiting to get the treatment they \ndeserved.\n  Now we are learning that staffers at a VA outpatient clinic in Fort \nCollins, CO, were deliberately showing their clerks how to create \nfraudulent appointment records. In the meantime, there are still more \nthan 589,000 VA pension and compensation claims pending nationwide, and \na majority of them are backlogged according to the VA's own criteria, \nwhich is more than 4 months.\n  Every day it seems as though we learn of a new part of this scandal \nbecause whistleblowers stepped forward and said: Yes, that was \nhappening where I worked too.\n  Yesterday, the Austin American-Statesman published a story entitled \n``VA employee: Wait list data was manipulated in Austin, San Antonio.'' \nThe story says:\n\n       A Department of Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk has \n     accused VA officials in Austin and San Antonio of \n     manipulating medical appointment data in an attempt to hide \n     long wait times to see doctors and psychiatrists, the \n     American-Statesman has learned.\n       . . . the 40-year-old VA employee said he and others were \n     ``verbally directed by lead clerks, supervisors, and during \n     training'' to ensure that wait times at the Austin VA \n     Outpatient Clinic and the North Central Federal Clinic in San \n     Antonio were ``as close to zero days as possible.''\n       The medical support assistant . . . said he and other \n     clerks achieved that by falsely logging patients' desired \n     appointment dates to synch with appointment openings. That \n     made it appear there was little to no wait time, and ideally \n     less than the department's goal of three months.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Austin American-Statesman, May 6, 2014]\n\n   VA Employee: Wait List Data Was Manipulated in Austin, San Antonio\n\n                          (By Jeremy Schwartz)\n\n       A Department of Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk has \n     accused VA officials in Austin and San Antonio of \n     manipulating medical appointment data in an attempt to hide \n     long wait times to see doctors and psychiatrists, the \n     American-Statesman has learned.\n       In communications with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, \n     a federal investigative body that protects government \n     whistleblowers, the 40-year-old VA employee said he and \n     others were ``verbally directed by lead clerks, supervisors, \n     and during training'' to ensure that wait times at the Austin \n     VA Outpatient Clinic and the North Central Federal Clinic in \n     San Antonio were ``as close to zero days as possible.''\n       The medical support assistant, who is seeking whistleblower \n     protection and has been advised to remain anonymous by \n     federal investigators, said he and other clerks achieved that \n     by falsely logging patients' desired appointment dates to \n     sync with appointment openings. That made it appear there was \n     little to no wait time, and ideally less than the \n     department's goal of 14 days. In reality, the clerk said, \n     wait times for appointments could be as long as three months.\n       The claims echo recent allegations that VA officials in \n     Arizona and Colorado similarly manipulated wait time data or \n     maintained secret lists to obscure lengthy wait times for \n     medical care. Three top administrators at the VA medical \n     center in Phoenix have since been put on leave and the VA's \n     inspector general is conducting an investigation into an \n     alleged secret wait list at the facility. A retired doctor at \n     the Phoenix facility told CNN that more than 40 veterans \n     there died while waiting for an appointment.\n       This week, the American Legion, the nation's largest \n     veterans service organization, called for the resignation of \n     VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, citing several issues, including \n     wait times for medical care.\n       When asked to respond to the allegations, local VA \n     officials said in a statement they would review their \n     scheduling practices, but didn't directly address the claims.\n       ``In light of the charges recently made against the Phoenix \n     VA, (director of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care \n     System Sallie) Houser-Hanfelder has made it clear she does \n     not endorse hidden lists of any kind,'' the statement reads. \n     ``To ensure the integrity of the health care system, she has \n     directed each service chief to certify they have reviewed \n     each of their sections and scheduling practices to ensure VA \n     scheduling policies are being followed. All staff who \n     schedule appointments have also been instructed to have \n     refresher training to make sure policies are clear and being \n     followed accurately.''\n       U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called for emergency \n     hearings after learning of the Texas allegations.\n       ``This is yet another deeply troubling account, and I'm \n     afraid we have not heard the last of gross mismanagement \n     within the VA and deception by VA bureaucrats,'' Cornyn said \n     in a statement. ``It is time for urgent steps to be taken \n     that match the gravity of this situation.''\n       He also called for Shinseki to step down.\n       ``It is absolutely disgusting to think that another VA \n     facility would be cooking the books like this, especially in \n     our own community. The House of Representatives is digging \n     into these allegations against the VA from every direction \n     possible and we will get to the bottom of this,'' said U.S. \n     Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock.\n       The Texas clerk said he saw the scheduling manipulation \n     when he worked at the Austin VA Outpatient Clinic from \n     December 2012 to December 2013 and when he transferred to the \n     San Antonio clinic, where he still works. He said he also saw \n     similar maneuvers at the Waco medical center earlier in 2012.\n       ``If you had any appointments showing over a 14-day waiting \n     period you were given a report the next day to fix it \n     immediately,'' said the clerk, a disabled veteran who served \n     in the Army from 2002 to 2011. Fixing it meant recording the \n     requested appointment date closer to the available opening, \n     he added.\n       The clerk said that scheduling clerks in Austin were also \n     instructed specifically not to use a VA tool called the \n     Electronic Waiting List, which is designed to help veterans \n     waiting for appointments get slots created when other \n     veterans cancel their appointments.\n       ``The failure to use (the electronic waiting list) may also \n     pose a substantial and specific danger to public health, \n     because patients who should be included on the EWL are not \n     receiving more timely appointments when they become \n     available,'' according to the clerk's communications with the \n     Office of Special Counsel.\n       While the VA's massive backlogs of disability benefits \n     claims have garnered much attention in recent years, \n     investigators have also increasingly discovered problems with \n     access to VA medical care.\n       In 2012, the VA inspector general found that the department \n     had vastly overcounted how many veterans were waiting 14 days \n     or less for a mental health evaluation. While the VA claimed \n     a 95 percent rate in meeting the two-week target, \n     investigators found that the real number was 49 percent, with \n     the remaining 51 percent of patients waiting about 50 days \n     for an evaluation.\n       That same year, a scheduling clerk at a VA medical center \n     in New Hampshire told a Senate committee that staffers there \n     were instructed to obscure wait times for mental health help \n     by using a method similar to that described by the Texas \n     clerk.\n       ``The overriding objective at our facility from top \n     management on down was to meet our numbers,'' Nick Tolentino \n     told the committee. ``Performance measures are well intended, \n     but are linked to executive pay and bonuses and as a result \n     create incentive to find loopholes that allow facilities to \n     meet its numbers without actually providing services.''\n       Last week, the House voted to ban bonuses for VA \n     executives, a move opposed by VA leadership. Shinseki has \n     defended the bonus system, saying it is necessary to \n     ``attract and retain the best leaders.''\n       Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs, which is also investigating delays in \n     VA medical care, blasted the VA on Tuesday for not taking \n     better advantage of its authority to send patients who are \n     waiting months for appointments to private medical providers.\n       ``Whether we're talking about allegations of secret lists, \n     data manipulation or actual lists of interminable waits, the \n     question VA leaders must answer is `Why isn't the department \n     using the tools it has been given--fee-based care being one \n     of them--to ensure veterans receive timely medical care?' '' \n     he said.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Scandals such as these confirm the VA lacks safeguards \nagainst official abuses, and it also lacks accountability--the kind of \naccountability that would ensure American veterans get the care and \nsupport they need in a timely fashion.\n  In the wake of the Phoenix revelations--and now, more urgently after \nwhat happened at Fort Collins and now reports of abuses at San Antonio \nand Austin, perhaps--I have called on the majority leader to hold \nhearings on these scandals, and I reiterate that call today.\n  I also reiterate my call for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign his \nposition and to let someone else take on the reforms necessary to get \nthe VA back on track.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  As I said yesterday, and as the American Legion noted, Secretary \nShinseki is an American patriot who did multiple combat tours in \nVietnam and has devoted his life to serving his Nation. He deserves \nnothing but our respect for that service. But, unfortunately, the VA \nscandals on his watch have been so numerous and so outrageous that they \ndemand immediate accountability, and it has become clear to me that \nSecretary Shinseki is not the right person for the job.\n  He has been in charge of the Department more than 5 years. Under his \nwatch, many of the VA's problems have gotten worse, not better. These \nproblems call for new leadership and a new direction.\n  As Dan Dellinger of the American Legion said on Monday:\n\n       There needs to be a change, and that change needs to occur \n     at the top.\n\n  I emphasize again the urgency of the situation.\n  I know the President yesterday was talking about the urgency of \ndealing with climate change. I hope the President and Congress would \nact with at least the same kind of urgency the President was arguing \nfor when it comes to climate change, when it comes to our veterans--\nsome of whom are dying, waiting to get the treatment they are entitled \nto.\n  What the VA needs is full-scale institutional reforms which introduce \nmuch stronger safeguards against administrative abuses and much greater \naccountability for senior officials. Because, let's face it, the VA's \nproblems go well beyond a few rogue health care personnel and \nadministrators in Phoenix and Fort Collins, CO.\n  At a time when American veterans are facing enormous physical and \npsychological and financial challenges, the Federal Government is \nletting them down. Don't take my word for it. According to a recent \nsurvey of war vets from Afghanistan and Iraq:\n\n       Nearly 1.5 million of those who served in the wars believe \n     the needs of their fellow vets are not being met by the \n     government.\n\n  One Iraq veteran--a former Army staff sergeant named Christopher \nSteavens--told the survey group he had been trying to get health care \nand financial relief for more than a half year, and had yet to hear \nback from the VA. They hadn't even gotten back to him and responded. He \nsaid:\n\n       When I raised my right hand and said, ``I will support and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States of America,'' \n     when I gave them everything I could, I expect the same in \n     return. . . . It's ridiculous that I've been waiting seven \n     months just to be examined by a doctor--absolutely \n     ridiculous.\n\n  Sergeant Steavens is right. It is ridiculous. But it is more than \nthat. It is disgraceful, and it dishonors the brave service our men and \nwomen in uniform have given on our behalf. It is past time for us to \nget serious about fixing the problem.\n  Again, to underscore the urgency of these issues, the survey I \nmentioned a moment ago found that one out of every two Afghanistan and \nIraq war veterans says they know a fellow servicemember who has \nattempted or committed suicide. One out of two knows somebody who has \ntried or has successfully committed suicide, and our message to the \nveterans is: Just wait. Be quiet. Sit down. Shut up.\n  It is unacceptable. As I said earlier, Secretary Shinseki is an \nAmerican patriot. But after 5 years as head of the Veterans' \nAdministration, it is time for him to step down and make way for new \nleadership.\n  More important, it is past time for the Veterans' Administration to \nstart honoring its promise to America's heroes. The status quo is \nunacceptable and no one disputes that. The only question is: Are we \ngoing to do something about it? Appointing a new Secretary would be a \ngood start.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Talwani Nomination\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Indira Talwani to the United States District Court for \nthe District of Massachusetts. Ms. Talwani is a brilliant and \naccomplished attorney who will make an outstanding addition to our \ndistrict court.\n  She is an American success story. Her parents were immigrants from \nIndia and Germany. If confirmed, she will be the first Asian-American \ndistrict court judge in Massachusetts.\n  She has received honors throughout her career, and her background and \nexperience unquestionably qualify her for the bench. She will be \nsomeone the people of Massachusetts, of New England, and our whole \ncountry can be proud of.\n  I believe she will be an objective, unbiased decisionmaker, and that \nis exactly what we need for our district court judges. I recommend her \nwholeheartedly to the Members of this body.\n  The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill is going to be considered \nhere today, and I recommend it to all of the Members of this body \nbecause it is a bill that has been developed across parties in a \nbipartisan way--across industries, across labor, across consumer \ngroups.\n  This is a bill which on a bipartisan basis is going to lead to \nimprovement in the building codes of the United States to reduce energy \nconsumption, increases in the efficiency of industrial equipment to \nreduce energy consumption, to increase the energy efficiency of Federal \nbuildings in our country to reduce energy consumption. None of it is \nbeing done on a mandatory basis. It is all done on a voluntary basis. \nThat is why we have a consensus here today.\n  The consensus includes an understanding that this is going to create \n190,000 new jobs in our country--from the Shaheen-Portman bill. It will \nsave consumers $16 billion per year. And it will cut carbon dioxide \ngoing into the atmosphere, polluting our country and our world by the \nequivalent of 22 million automobiles per year by the year 2030.\n\n  These are benefits that are going to be maximized because we are \ngoing to start working smarter, not harder, just reducing the amount of \nenergy we consume, reducing the amount of CO2 we send into \nthe atmosphere, and doing it on a voluntary basis--voluntary.\n  So let's have a vote here on the Senate floor. Let's just get it \ndone. Let's agree on what it is that we know is going to help our \ncountry. We know it is going to create more jobs. But the Republicans \nsay: No, we need a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. We need a vote on \nsomething that is highly controversial, and we demand that vote.\n  Majority Leader Reid agrees to have a vote on the Keystone Pipeline--\nagrees to have a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. How controversial is \nthat? Well, you are going to take the dirtiest oil in the world, coming \ndown from Canada, build a pipeline through the United States, bring it \ndown to Port Arthur, TX, which is a tax-free export zone, and then that \noil is going to be exported out of the United States. Where are the \nbenefits for the United States in this scenario? We take the \nenvironmental risk, the Canadians get the benefit of having the \ndirtiest oil in the world come through that pipeline, and then it is \ngoing to be exported out of the United States.\n  How do I know it is going to be exported out of the United States? \nBecause I, as a member of the House of Representatives, had this \namendment over and over brought to the floor of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and every time the American Petroleum Institute \nopposed it. Even though they say it is all about North American energy \nindependence--ha-ha--when you have a vote, every Republican votes to \nkeep that provision out of the bill so the oil can go out of the United \nStates. So just stop this about ``energy independence for North \nAmerica'' if you don't, as a part of the Keystone Pipeline, accept a \nprovision where the oil has to stay here. Otherwise, what is the point? \nI will tell you what the point is. It is maximizing profit for the oil \nindustry because they make more money when they sell the oil outside \nthe United States. American consumers don't get the benefit of it, no. \nThe world is going to get the benefit of it; the oil industry is; the \nCanadians are.\n  Majority Leader Reid said: We will have a vote on that. We will have \na vote on it.\n  And then what happens? We come back this week, and the Republicans \nsay that is not enough. This nice energy efficiency bill is going to be \nthe vehicle for even more highly controversial issues, which at the end \nof the day is all meant to do what? To kill the energy efficiency bill \nbecause it reduces the amount of CO2 that goes into the \natmosphere on a voluntary basis.\n  How do we know that? Well, we know it because their amendments go \nright\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nto the heart of what it is that we should all now finally accept. They \nwant to have a vote and a big debate here that would prevent the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency of the United States of America from \nregulating greenhouse gases, from regulating global warming. That is \nthe debate they want to have. They are saying: No energy efficiency \nbill--which everyone agrees on--unless we have a debate on whether our \nEnvironmental Protection Agency can regulate greenhouse gases.\n  It is 2014. It is 100 degrees in Kansas today. There are hurricanes, \ncyclones, the tides are rising, the water is warmer, and the storms are \nmore intense. It is not just here, it is all across the planet. The \nscientists agree that there is global warming. Their amendment would \nprohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating global \nwarming pollution. That is what they call something that is reasonable.\n  We have a bill everyone agrees should pass, but after getting an \nagreement that the Keystone Pipeline would be debated, they just \ncontinue on down the pathway.\n  Yesterday the Obama administration released a third U.S. National \nClimate Assessment. From droughts in the West to deluges in the East, \nthis new report shows that we are becoming the United States of climate \nchange and that we must act in order to keep our Nation safe and \nstrong.\n  Second, they want to attach a provision to massively expand our \nexports of natural gas. They want to take the natural gas that is being \ndrilled for here in the United States and put it on ships and send it \nout of our country. The more natural gas we export out of our country, \nthe higher the prices are going to be for natural gas in our country. \nIt will be more expensive to generate electricity. It will be more \nexpensive for manufacturers to make their products in our country. It \nwill be more expensive for those who want to build natural gas buses \nand natural gas trucks to be able to do so.\n  That is something they want to do--export the natural gas of the \nUnited States to other countries. Does that make any sense? Is that the \nkind of noncontroversial discussion we should have at the time we have \nan energy efficiency bill that should go through? No, not at all. This \nis meant to dynamite the energy efficiency bill. That is what that \namendment is all about.\n  Then they want to add a rider to the bill as well that will prohibit \nthe EPA from even considering at any time in the future a price on \ncarbon--or, for that matter, prohibiting anyone.\n  These are loaded, highly controversial amendments, all at their heart \ndenying the reality of how much harm they will do to the United States. \nMeanwhile, the Koch brothers smile. They smile because they know it is \nall going to accomplish their principal goal: making sure no energy \nefficiency bill passes in the Senate this year, no reduction in the \namount of greenhouse gasses we are sending up. That is the agenda. It \nis going to be the agenda into the future for the Republican Party. It \nhas been the agenda.\n\n  I look out and I see Republicans who have worked hard to put together \nthis energy efficiency bill. I praise them for their willingness to \ncome together on commonsense, reasonable provisions that reduce the \namount of carbon going into the atmosphere on a voluntary basis by \nencouraging the creation of 190,000 new jobs in our country that \nDemocrats and Republicans agree on. And I see this whole process \ngetting hijacked by the Koch brothers, by the oil industry, by the \nnatural gas industry that wants us to devolve into a big debate over \nscience that is now completely and totally consensus not only here but \naround the planet.\n  The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for \nplanets. We have to engage in preventive care to avoid the worst, most \ncatastrophic impact of climate change on this watch we have here in the \nSenate. But, no, the process is being hijacked. You can see it here. \nThey want to torpedo this process so that more oil, more coal, and more \nprofits for the coal and oil companies become the agenda.\n  So all I can say, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are at a historic \nturning point. The headlines in the newspapers across this country and \nacross this planet tell the story today: Climate risk growing. That is \nthe consensus. That is the reality. That is what this energy efficiency \nbill is meant to deal with. And what will happen--and we are going to \nsee it over and over--is we are going to have Member after Member on \nthe Republican side get up and demand that we have a debate on \nsomething unrelated to this energy efficiency bill where there is a \nconsensus. They want to take climate science that is a consensus around \nthe planet and have another huge debate here on it. That is the tragedy \nof this.\n  The green generation, the young people in our country, they know this \nis the challenge of this generation. We as a nation have to stand up. A \nhigh percentage of that CO2 in the atmosphere is red, white, \nand blue. We cannot preach temperance from a barstool. We cannot tell \nthe rest of the world ``you must do something'' if we are not doing \nsomething. That is what the bill we should be debating here today would \ndo on a bipartisan basis: reduce greenhouse gases, create 190,000 jobs, \nand do it all on a voluntary basis--too simple, too good, too clearly \nconsistent with these two objectives of job creation and greenhouse gas \nreduction.\n  So I think what we are seeing is that the conserve in conservative no \nlonger exists--not with the Koch brothers around. So this is now just \ngoing to be something that short-circuits the legislative process. It \nensures that the energy efficiency bill is collateral damage because of \ntheir insistence on these amendments, when instead we have a chance \nthis week to say that we are going to move forward on a smart energy \npolicy; that we will work smarter, not harder; that we should come \ntogether to pass this bill without these giveaways to the oil industry \nand to the coal industry so that we can create jobs and save energy. \nAnd I would recommend to my colleagues that is the correct historical \nposition this Chamber should be in right now.\n  At this point, Madam President, I yield the back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of [S. 2301] \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Missouri Mr. Blunt will be recognized next for 10 minutes or so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks by Senator Blunt, \nI be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for \nensuring that I have the time to talk for a few minutes about an issue \nhe and I feel very strongly about; that is, the best use of American \nenergy and what American energy means to American families.\n  It seems to me the request our side of the aisle is making is not at \nall unreasonable. It has been 7 years since the Senate had a real \ndebate on energy. The Shaheen-Portman bill creates that opportunity, \nbut suddenly we were told: This bill is so good already. Why do you \nwant to continue to talk about ways to make it even better? There are \nvery few things beyond energy and health care which I can talk about \nfor a substantial period of time--and I hope to talk about health care \nsometime between now and the end of the week. Energy has the same kind \nof impact on families that health care has.\n  The majority leader wants to control every debate every week in the \nSenate,\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nwhich means nothing happens. That is not the way the Senate works. \nTraditionally, any Member of the Senate can introduce any amendment \nthey want on any bill at any time. However, that is not the way the \nHouse works. I served in the House. The majority runs the House, and \nthe Rules Committee in the House is nine in the majority and four in \nthe minority. It is pretty hard to lose a vote in a 9-to-4 committee. I \nthink that is why the committee was established that way.\n  The Senate has never been run that way. Now we have a one-man rules \ncommittee that wants to decide on every bill and every rule which comes \nup. This gag rule where Senators can't talk about the topics they want \nto discuss is something that didn't used to happen in the Senate, but \nit is now a daily and weekly part of the Senate.\n  We are now at the point where we go to the majority leader and ask: \nOn the energy bill, could we have five amendments that deal with \nenergy? That is so far from how the Senate and the Constitution was \ndesigned to be or the Senate practice has been. It is pretty hard to \nbelieve that Senators on the minority are reduced to the point that we \nhave to go to the majority leader and ask: Mr. Leader, could we have \nfive amendments that deal with energy?\n  When the Energy bill was on the floor of the Senate 7 years ago--the \nlast time the Senate dealt with energy--every Senator could have every \namendment they wanted on anything they wanted to talk about because \nthat was the Senate. One of the prices we paid for that 6-year term was \nwe might have to vote on some things we would rather not vote on. Now \nwe have the 6-year term, but the majority leader doesn't want us to \nvote on things that the majority may not want to vote on, and there are \nprobably people in the minority who don't want to vote either. Not \nvoting is a pretty safe route apparently politically, but it is not the \nbest route for the country.\n  I would like to see a real debate on energy, and one of the issues I \nwould like to see debated is the amendment I offered to this bill to \nhave a point of order to be sure that at least 60 Senators would have \nto approve a carbon tax.\n  I offered a similar amendment to the budget last year, in 2013, and \n52 of my colleagues agreed with me, and we had a majority vote of 53 \nwho said we don't want to have a carbon tax, but if we do have a carbon \ntax, it needs to be extraordinary because it affects everybody's \nutility bill. It affects everybody's ability to pay that bill. It \naffects whether a person has a job with a paycheck that allows them to \npay that bill. Fifty-three of my colleagues, including myself, said we \ndon't want to do that.\n  Several people who voted against that amendment in 2013 have had a \nhard time explaining why they were against it, so I thought maybe we \nwould vote on it again. I think we would have more than 53 votes this \ntime. If we don't vote this time, we are more likely to have a lot more \nthan 53 votes next time because the American people get it.\n  For the vast majority of the country, half of the utilities come from \ncoal. Rules that create a carbon tax--the simple focus of that is coal, \nand the focus is fossil fuels generally. The Germans are buying \nresources from us because they are abandoning their nuclear facilities \nand converting to coal-fired powerplants.\n  We have a lot of coal and, more importantly, we have a lot of coal-\npowered plants. If we could say, let's not use coal, but our utility \nfacilities work just like they work without having to take millions of \ndollars for new investments, that would have a different kind of impact \non families than saying, let's not only not use coal, let's build a new \npowerplant everywhere they have a coal powerplant because otherwise the \nutility bills will double when we build a new powerplant. When we build \na new powerplant, the utility bill is going to double.\n\n  Also, why would we want to have even the access to a policy that \nwould allow people's utility bills to double? Middle-income families, \nlow-income families are the hardest impacted by that, especially in \nStates such as my State, where 80 percent of the utilities come from \ncoal; but, again, a majority of the utilities come from coal in a \nmajority of the landmass of the country. Our rates would rise 19 \npercent in the first year with a carbon tax or the kinds of rules the \nregulators are trying to put in place that would have a carbon tax-like \nimpact, and in the decade after that first year they would double.\n  One doesn't have to be very smart to multiply a utility bill by two. \nIf the boss showed someone the utility bill at work, they wouldn't have \nto be a genius to multiply that by two, and they wouldn't have to be a \ngenius to figure out that if the utility bill doubles, the job that \nhelps them pay their utility bill at home might go away as well.\n  It would cause significant job loss. It would cause households to pay \nmore for all of the energy they have. They already pay a lot for \nenergy. For the 40 million American households that earn less than \n$30,000 a year, they already spend more than 20 percent of their income \non energy. Do we want those families to continue to see that bill go up \nand every month wonder what they could have less of so they can pay \nmore for the same utilities, and not because it had to be that way but \nbecause the government decided it wanted it to be that way? The \nhouseholds that will be the last households to get the new energy-\nefficient appliances, the last families to get the new windows and the \nbetter doors and more insulation in the ceiling, those are the families \nimpacted in a dramatic way. Those are the families who live in houses \nwhere they have to think: Which room can we no longer afford to heat or \nno longer afford to cool in the heating and cooling months of the year, \nwhen we will have to close that door and roll up the throw rug and put \nit at the base of the door so the heat and cooling no longer impacts \nthat room? Do we want families to do that so we can have a carbon tax, \nso we can have bad energy policies?\n  We can do a better job by making American energy more affordable and \nmore accessible, not making it less so.\n  What is wrong with having that? I heard my friend from Massachusetts \nsay earlier that we are insisting on a controversial amendment on the \nKeystone Pipeline. So what. What is controversial about it? A majority \nof us say we are for it. Controversy would mean people must feel \nstrongly the other way, so they can vote against it.\n  Let's let the American people know where we stand on these issues. \nAre we going to do smart things about more American energy or not? The \nenergy future of the country is so good that in spite of everything the \ngovernment has done to slow it down, it still has been a major economic \ndriver.\n  I would like to see us vote on the Keystone Pipeline. I would like to \nsee us vote on the carbon tax, whether that is a good idea or not. I \nwould like to see us vote on what kinds of facilities we need to secure \nour energy position in the world economy.\n  There shouldn't be anything wrong with these amendments. Senators \nshouldn't be stopped with a gag rule from the majority leader's office \nof what we can and cannot talk about. The idea that we can't have \nenergy amendments on an energy bill should embarrass every single \nSenator here and concern everybody we work for. Hopefully, we will be \nable to move forward with debate on an energy bill that is actually \nabout energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me first say to my good friend from \nMissouri, I plan to talk about energy, the very thing he is talking \nabout. If we go back and look logically, if we are dependent upon \nfossil fuels for 75 percent of our ability to run this machine called \nAmerica, and we extract that, what is going to happen? I think we all \nknow what is going to happen and I think people need to be forewarned.\n  I am going to tee this up by talking a little bit about President \nObama's climate assessment meeting he had yesterday. All of these \npeople were talking about the world coming to an end, the report he \ncame out with--let me, first of all, ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Delaware be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The whole idea in this report by design is to spark fear \nin the American people so they will go along with the administration in \nimplementing their policies that will kill\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nfossil fuels and leave us with nothing but a broken economy. When I say \nbroken economy, if, in fact--and no one would refute this--we are \ndependent upon fossil fuels--coal, oil, and gas--for 75 percent of the \nenergy to run America, then what is going to happen to our economy if \nwe extract 75 percent? I think we all know logically what is going to \nhappen.\n  In the words of White House counselor John Podesta this morning: \n``The American public doesn't feel that sense of urgency about the \nimpacts of climate change and I think this report will help influence \nthat.'' That is nothing but an admission. The whole reason for this \nreport is to try to resurrect the issue of global warming. We heard my \ngood friend from Massachusetts talking about that. He is very \nknowledgeable, and I will refer to some of his activities in a minute.\n  But keep in mind, this is John Podesta. It is the same John Podesta \nwho is representing some of the terrorist regime from Sri Lanka that is \nno longer in effect. He is the same one who ran the White House during \nthe Clinton years. So he comes from a very partisan perspective. But \nnonetheless, I appreciate the fact that he is admitting this is the \nreason for the climate assessment President Obama did yesterday, \nbecause he wants to try to bring this up again.\n  I can remember back when the polling showed that global warming was \neither the No. 1 or No. 2 of the environmental issues in America. Do we \nknow where it is now? It is No. 10, according to the last Gallup poll. \nSo people have forgotten about it. People have caught on. They have \nseen the scientists come in and refute all this IPCC stuff that the \nUnited Nations has been putting forth for a long period of time. I \nthink it is a recognition that people have caught on to this and it is \nno longer the issue they want it to be.\n\n  Whether it is a drought or a flood, high temperatures, low \ntemperatures, you can't find a job, you are finding more allergic \nreactions, then the White House blames it on global warming. Fear has \nalways been a tactic the administration and other global warming \nalarmists have used to spur people into action. Time and time again, \nwhen the American people learn the details and the costs of the \nsolutions to global warming that they contend exist, they don't want \nanything to do with it--and the costs are enormous.\n  Congress last debated global warming when my good friend, now Senator \nMarkey, was in the House of Representatives. It was the Waxman-Markey \ncap-and-trade bill. This bill would have cost, according to Charles \nRiver Associates--and I think people recognize them as authentic--\nbetween $300 billion and $400 billion a year. That is the cost. I would \ncontend this would be the largest tax increase in the history of this \ncountry. That is consistent with other analyses. One was the Wharton \nGroup and many of the scientists there who were making evaluations came \nout with the same thing: between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. \nMIT came out with about the same amount of between $300 billion to $400 \nbillion a year. The cost estimate has been the same over the last 15 \nyears since we first started debating this issue. I don't think anyone \nis challenging that.\n  But what is important--and this is kind of in the weeds, but we have \nto talk about this: I applaud Senator Markey for at least the levels of \npollution--of emissions, I should say--that come from different sources \nthat he was wanting to regulate, and that was those with 25,000 tons of \nCO2 emissions or more. That would be, quite frankly, the \nmajor emitters, the refineries and all of that. Here is the problem we \nhave today. It is far worse than the Waxman-Markey bill would have \nbeen, because it wouldn't call for the regulation of just those \nentities that emit 25,000 tons or more, but the same as the Clean Air \nAct.\n  The Clean Air Act has a threshold of 250 tons of greenhouse gases a \nyear. Stop and think about that: If it costs between $300 billion to \n$400 billion to regulate the emitters who emit 25,000 tons of \nCO2 a year, how much more if we regulate everyone with 250 \ntons? It has never been calculated. It would be very difficult. But we \nare talking about billions and billions of dollars more. So the \nregulations are far worse.\n  The first of these regulations now being developed is the New Source \nPerformance Standards for newly constructed powerplants. The rule would \nessentially make it illegal to build new coal-fired powerplants. That \nis what it was designed to do.\n  The next step would be to take the existing powerplants--those that \nare employing hundreds of thousands of people in America today--and \nthey would be out of a job. So that would go to the refining industry, \nand so forth, and establish new regulations for each and every \nindustry. These greenhouse gas regulations mark the latest attempt by \nthe EPA to destroy affordable and reliable electricity and energy \nsupplies that have been the hallmark of our economy for a long period \nof time. They are already doing it in other areas too. It is not just \nregulating the greenhouse gas emissions or CO2 emissions; it \nis other regulations that are unbearable.\n  This one right here--they are talking about changing the ocean \nregulation. This chart is an interesting one because this shows that \nvirtually every county in America would be out of attainment with their \nnew goals. In my State of Oklahoma, we have 77 counties. All 77 \ncounties would be out of attainment if they are able to do that.\n  In 2011, the EPA finalized its utility MACT. By the way, that stands \nfor maximum achievable control technology. That is what we are talking \nabout. So they passed this. Now it is passed. It is history now. They \nfinalized utility MACT with a rule that costs over $100 million and \nwould result in 1.65 million lost jobs.\n  The EPA put this rule out without even considering the cost of it, \nsaying it wasn't required to do so. In other words, the law does not \nsay they are required to say what it costs. I take issue with that. \nThey estimated the rule would result in the retirement of less than \n10,000 megawatts of electricity generation, but today we know the power \ncompanies around the country have announced the retirements totaling \nmore than 50,000. So they are off by 500 percent. Fifty thousand \nmegawatts in direct response to the EPA regulation.\n  By the way, when we had the utility MACT, I filed a CRA, and this is \nsomething I want to make sure people are aware of, and certainly my \ncolleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle. On all of these \nregulations, when they reach the point where the regulation is final--\nand we know for a fact it is going to cost dollars and it is going to \ncost jobs--I am going to file a CRA. A CRA is a Congressional Review \nAct. A CRA provides that if there is a regulation--and I hear so often \nmy colleagues in the Senate will say to their constituents, Don't blame \nme for these regulations because that is the regulatory--that is the \nEPA and other regulators doing it. But a CRA forces them to take an \nissue. So all one has to do is find 30 people in the Senate, have them \nsign a CRA, file the CRA, and then it is simply a simple majority--51. \nIn the case of this utility MACT, I only lacked three votes for \nstopping that rule. So we anticipate that we are going to be able to \nstop a lot of these rules.\n  In about 10 days, the EPA is poised to propose another new rule, the \n316(b) cooling water intake rule. This rule is designed to protect fish \nfrom being caught and killed in nets designed to prevent them from \nentering powerplant systems. While the rule doesn't have any human \nhealth benefits, it is expected to cost industry over $100 billion in \ncompliance costs, which, of course, will be passed on to everyone in \nAmerica who ends up paying these bills.\n  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which is called \nNERC, has warned that this rule will have a far worse impact on \nelectricity affordability and reliability than the utility MACT did. We \nknow it will.\n  In fact, the FERC Commissioner recently said that because of EPA's \nrules, the United States is likely to see rolling electricity blackouts \nover the summer months in the next few years as demand for electricity \noutstrips the supply remaining after all of the powerplant shutdowns \nthat are slated to occur in response to EPA's rules.\n  The EPA has been systematically distorting the true cost of its \nregulations for years, and I have been raising this as an issue for \nsome time now, but it has been very difficult to air them out before \nthe entire Senate simply because at this point the sole goal of the\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nDemocrats seems to be to protect their majority.\n  If we look at this chart, this was prior to the 2012 election. What \nwe found they were doing, prior to the 2012 election, was postponing \nmany of these very onerous regulations because they knew we would be \ndoing a CRA and the public would know who is responsible for these. \nThey had postponed this. This is a report I put out in October 2012, \nand that was to try to force the administration to not wait until after \nthe election to come out with their rules. That is what they did.\n  They are doing it again. Last week I released documents revealing \nthat the EPA intentionally delayed the release of its greenhouse gas \nnew source performance standards--that is the NSPS--by 66 days in order \nto avoid it being finalized before the midterm elections--the same \nthing as 2012.\n  I also sent a letter to Gina McCarthy, who is the Director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, asking why the rule was delayed, \nespecially when she had previously told me it was the result of a \nblacklog in the Federal Register. In other words, she was saying: The \nFederal Register did not post this rule until 66 days after we gave it \nto them. We checked with the Federal Register, and they said that is \nabsolutely false. They have an immediate turnaround for these rules.\n  So now I am waiting for a response to that letter. I do not want to \nuse the ``L'' word. I know there is a lot of pressure put on the \nemployees and certainly the Director of the EPA to try to minimize what \nthe public feels is going to be the cost of these regulations.\n  Had the EPA stuck with its original timeline of finalizing this rule \nby September 20 of this year, then I would have been able to work with \nmy colleagues to force a Congressional Review Act vote to overturn the \nrule just weeks before the election. Then people would know the cost of \nthese things.\n  But what we could do right now is vote on a few of the amendments. \nOur Senator from Missouri was talking about these amendments. We have a \nbill that is coming up. We have amendments that should be considered--\nall having to do with energy, so they are all appropriate amendments to \noffer, as he articulated for about 10 minutes a few minutes ago.\n  I have some amendments that would do this. He mentioned one of them \nthat he and I are together on. But one of my amendments is amendment \nNo. 2977, entitled the ``Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2014.'' It simply \nprohibits the EPA from promulgating any greenhouse gas emissions \nregulations to combat climate change because they are denying this is \nthe reason they are doing it. Of course we know what has happened to \nthe science they are relying on through the United Nations that has now \nbeen refuted.\n  The second amendment I have is amendment No. 2979. It would prevent \nthe EPA from issuing any new Clean Air Act regulations--such as those \non climate change--until it complies with section 321(a) of the Clean \nAir Act. Let's keep in mind, this is the Clean Air Act, as shown on \nthis chart. We are talking about decades ago. This is what the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is supposed to do:\n\n       The Administrator shall conduct continuing evaluations of \n     potential loss or shifts of employment which may result from \n     the administration or enforcement of the provision of this \n     chapter. . . .\n\n  It is saying they are supposed to already tell the public what the \ncost is in terms of jobs and money. That is the law, but they are not \nobeying the law. So I have an amendment that puts teeth in it and says \nyou cannot have any new rules until you comply with section 321(a) of \nthe Clean Air Act. Very reasonable, and it is the law today.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA is not interested in doing this. With the \nUtility MACT rule, it completely dismissed the rule's cost and did not \nconsider it when putting out the rule.\n  The EPA acted in contradiction to Supreme Court precedents that \ndecisionmakers are required to ``weigh advantages against \ndisadvantages, and disadvantages can be seen in terms of costs.'' That \nis the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have to get to the last part. Rather than to face these \nissues head-on, I am going to share something that happened last year \nand then again this year. There is a very wealthy person named Tom \nSteyer. Tom Steyer has a mansion that overlooks the Golden Gate Bridge. \nHe had a fundraiser for Barack Obama last year, raising a lot of money, \nbut the one I am more concerned about is the fundraiser he had when he \nannounced--this is just within the last month--Tom Steyer, a very \nwealthy person, said he was going to personally donate $50 million and \nraise an additional $50 million to try to do two things. One is to \nresurrect this whole idea on global warming since the people do not \ncare about it anymore. As a result of that, we had an all-night vigil. \nRemember that? That was right after Tom Steyer made his announcement.\n  The second thing he is mandating is to kill the Keystone Pipeline. \nThere is a lot of money out there. The regulatory burdens already being \nplaced on this country are enormous, and the cost of regulations are, \nperhaps arguably, the worst problem facing this country.\n  Last week the Competitive Enterprise Institute published a major \nreport calculating the cost of the President's regulations at $1.86 \ntrillion. To put that in perspective, Canada's entire GDP is $1.82 \ntrillion. India's is the same amount. So that is what the cost would \nbe, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n  People know what has happened to the military with this \nadministration, they know what has happened to energy, but the cost of \nthese regulations is something that is going to have to be addressed.\n  Lastly, I would say this. I know there are people out there who \nlegitimately believe greenhouse gas is causing global warming and the \nworld is going to come to an end, but I would suggest this: Lisa \nJackson was the Administrator--chosen by Barack Obama--the first \nAdministrator we had for the EPA. I asked her this question, on the \nrecord, live on TV. I said: Madam Administrator, if we were to pass \nbills like the Markey-Waxman bill or regulate by regulation the \nCO2 in the United States of America, would this have the \neffect of lowering the CO2 emissions worldwide? She said: \nNo, because that is not where the problem is. It is in China. It is in \nIndia. It is in Mexico.\n  In other words, if you believe--as I do not believe--but if you \nbelieve CO2 is going to bring about the end of the world, \nthen even if we do something in this country, it is not going to solve \nthe problem. Arguably, it would make the problem worse because as we \nlose our manufacturing base, they are out seeking electricity and \nenergy from countries where they do not have any of these regulations, \nand that would have the effect of increasing, not decreasing, emissions \nof CO2.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my friend for not objecting to \nmy additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                      Bulletproof Vest Partnership\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, our Nation's police officers work \nfearlessly and tirelessly every day to protect our families and to keep \nour communities safe. As we get ready to honor their service during \nNational Police Week, the least we can do is stand by them and ensure, \nas they are doing their job, they are able to do it as safely as \npossible.\n  Every day more than 1 million law enforcement officers across this \ncountry accept risks to their personal safety. As they leave their \nfamilies at dawn and head off to their jobs, they know and their \nfamilies know they accept, as a part of their mission of public safety \nservice, the risk that they may not come home that night.\n  We owe it to them to do what we can to make that service just a \nlittle bit safer, to ensure that more of them come home safely, week in \nand week out, year in and year out. Providing officers with bulletproof \nvests is one of the most effective ways we can contribute to that \ndesired outcome.\n  I have come to the floor because I share the deep frustration of my \ngood\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nfriend Chairman Patrick Leahy over the continued inability of this body \nto overcome the objection of one Senator and move forward to renew, on \na bipartisan basis, the Federal Bulletproof Vest Partnership.\n  Yesterday, Chairman Leahy gave the Senate another opportunity to take \nup and reauthorize this partnership through a unanimous consent \nrequest. He is trying to move forward a bill we have already voted out \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis. Yet it was \nblocked again by objections raised by a colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  For 14 years the Federal Bulletproof Vest Partnership has been an \nimportant way for our Nation to equip local police departments with one \nof the most effective ways to keep our officers safe, but this needs to \nbe a lasting commitment. This needs to be an enduring partnership. As \nnew officers join, they need to be fitted for new vests. Because vests \nwear out and do not last forever, we need to ensure they can be \nreplaced.\n  We know bulletproof vests work. Since 1987 bulletproof vests have \nsaved the lives of more than 3,000 police officers across this country. \nI am proud to continue in the tradition of my predecessor, now-Vice \nPresident Joe Biden, in supporting local law enforcement and in \nsupporting this initiative.\n  In my home State of Delaware, this partnership has provided our \nofficers with thousands of vests over the last 14 years, including more \nthan 3,800 over just the last 5 years.\n  The Delaware community has, unfortunately, seen up close why these \nvests are so important. It was 13 years ago that Dover Police Sergeant \nDavid Spicer was trying to make an arrest--an arrest he successfully \ncompleted--when the suspect with whom he was wrestling pulled out a gun \nfrom a hidden pocket and shot him at close range four times.\n  As Sergeant Spicer bled out--he lost nearly half the blood in his \nbody before effecting the arrest--because he was wearing a vest \nprovided to him through the Federal Bulletproof Vest Partnership his \nlife was saved.\n  I was honored to welcome Dover Police Sergeant David Spicer here 2 \nyears ago on a previous effort at reauthorizing this long bipartisan \nbill.\n  More recently--just last February of 2013--at the New Castle County \nCourthouse, in my hometown of Wilmington, a gunman unleashed a stream \nof bullets into the courthouse lobby, tragically killing two. On what \nwas a devastating morning in the courthouse lobby, two lives were also \nsaved--those of Sergeant Michael Manley and Corporal Steve Rinehart--\nCapitol Police officers who were wearing bulletproof vests funded in \npart through this Federal Bulletproof Vest Partnership.\n  The very real results of this Federal-State partnership, of this \ninvestment in keeping the men and women of law enforcement safe in the \nline of duty, are hard to ignore.\n  With many police departments at the local level facing shrinking \nbudgets, this bulletproof vest partnership makes vests, which cost more \nthan $500 apiece, more affordable, ensuring officers are outfitted with \nthe most current and effective and appropriate protection possible.\n  In fact, the program specifically prioritizes smaller departments \nthat often struggle to afford vests and do not provide vests or require \nvests for their officers. It is exactly in these smaller and more rural \nagencies and departments where line-of-duty deaths due to gunfire had \nhistorically been high.\n  This is critical. As a county executive in my previous role in local \ngovernment in Delaware, I saw firsthand how officers in smaller \nagencies often struggle to have current, up-to-date, and effective \nbulletproof vests.\n  In addition, this is a program that is a 50-50 match with Federal and \nlocal money. How could anyone oppose this program that saves thousands \nof police officers' lives, that extends the reach of the Federal-State \npartnership in keeping our communities safer, and that is such a wise \ninvestment in saving lives that matters so much to our communities?\n  A colleague objected yesterday, has objected before, and will object \nagain. I am reminded of so many times when a bipartisan bill comes to \nthis floor and dies due to objection after objection after objection, \nand at times I struggle to understand the rationale. In his objection \nyesterday, my colleague raised an argument that somehow this program, \nwhich promotes public safety, does not fit within the authority granted \nto Congress under the Constitution, that it is not part of the \nenumerated powers of Congress.\n  I disagree. Whether you ascribe to the narrow Madisonian view of the \ngeneral welfare clause in the Constitution or follow an expansive or \nHamiltonian view--as our Supreme Court has done since 1937, when they \naffirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security Act in Helvering \nv. Davis--this is not a close call.\n  If providing Federal-State partnership money for bulletproof vests \ngoes beyond the enumerated powers of this Congress, what does that mean \nfor public health, for investments in partnerships with State public \nhealth agencies to prevent pandemics and flus? What does this mean for \nthe Interstate Highway System? What does this mean for hundreds of \ndifferent partnerships where, in a cost-effective way, we work together \nwith communities and States all over this country to extend and improve \nthe general welfare of the people of the United States?\n  To my colleague's argument today on this floor that this is solely a \nState or local responsibility, the reality is that the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership does not replace local action with Federal action. It \nensures a Federal partnership, an investment, to help police \ndepartments struggling to meet the safety needs, the equipment needs of \ntheir officers, to act when they otherwise cannot.\n  In my view, the partnership is even more important because it is \nabout more than just handing out dollars and vests. It ensures all \nvests are compliant with National Institute of Justice safety \nstandards. Only the Federal Government has the resources to do that \nlevel of analytical work. It is no more reasonable for us to expect \nevery State to have their own National Institutes of Health to do \ncancer research or for every State to have a National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration.\n  Having one coordinated national program to ensure that these \nbulletproof vests are as effective as possible at saving the lives of \nthe men and women of law enforcement just makes sense. In my view, the \ndenial of the Federal role where it is necessary and efficient would \ntake us back to the Articles of Confederation, a very cramped and \nnarrow view of the appropriate role of our national government, one \nwhich our forefathers found unworkable two centuries ago.\n  The truth is plain. Without this program, we leave police officers \nwithout lifesaving vests in the line of fire, in the line of duty. For \nus to fail to stand up for them, when they stand up for us each and \nevery day, I find outrageous. This is the way the world looked before \nChairman Leahy and Republican Senator Campbell created this program \njointly back in 1999.\n  In that world, before there was a Federal Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership, there would today be two more Delaware families without a \nhero at their dinner table tonight. Not on my watch. That will not \nhappen as long as I am here to stand for the men and women of law \nenforcement and to promote the Federal role, an appropriate Federal \nrole, in standing side by side with State and local governments to \nprovide the equipment the men and women of law enforcement need.\n  This partnership expired back in 2012. Fortunately, we have been able \nto fund it through short-term appropriations. This is a tiny program in \nthe scope of this Federal Government: $22 million a year. The entire \nFederal investment in local law enforcement is less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the entire Federal Government. Yet it enables standards and \nleveraging of the type I described that extends the reach of law \nenforcement and improves the safety of the men and women who put their \nlives on the line for us. Without authorization, this program becomes \nunsustainable short term and does not allow us to improve the program \nyear in and year out. The reauthorization bill that was passed by the \nJudiciary Committee this Congress extends the program another 5 years, \nensures its consistency, but makes important reforms to save money, as \nwell.\n  It prevents localities from using other Federal grants as their \nmatching\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\nfunds. It takes action to eliminate the Justice Department's backlogs. \nThe bill would require agencies using the program to have mandatory \nwear policies, and would, for the first time, ensure these lifesaving \nvests are fitted appropriately for women, at a time when there are more \nand more women in law enforcement and more often at the very front line \nof protecting our communities.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. Enacting this bill is a moral \nresponsibility. Police officers work to keep us safe every day. \nCongress can and should do the same for them. Congress should be \nstanding with our law enforcement officers, not standing in their way. \nI applaud the persistent leadership of Chairman Leahy and will stand \nwith him as long as it takes to get this program back on track and \nensure its long-term survival.\n  While this program had a long history of bipartisan support and \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee with a number of Republicans \nvoting for it, a few of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nnow do not seem to think this investment in officer safety is an \nappropriate one for this body and this government to make.\n  Last year our Nation lost 33 police officers in the line of duty \nkilled by gunshots. According to the National Law Enforcement Officer's \nMemorial Fund, there is some reason to be cheered because this is the \nsmallest number lost in a year since the 1800s. Those 33 deaths--line-\nof-duty deaths of men and women shot to death while protecting their \ncommunities--is 33 too many. We have an opportunity to continue to \nprovide to State and local law enforcement vests that can save these \nand other lives.\n  We should continue working tirelessly until those numbers come down \nto zero. In recent months, I have been proud as this body has come \ntogether across the partisan divide, has passed a budget bill, an \nappropriations bill, a farm bill, has begun to deal with some of our \nNation's most urgent needs. But I am distressed by this particular \naction, to block even consideration of so small a program with such \nimportant consequences, and it is to me profoundly disheartening. I \ncall on my colleagues to stop blocking this bill and to allow this body \nto debate and to pass this reauthorization that will save lives in law \nenforcement this year and every year going forward. We owe them no \nless.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk once more \nabout the negative side effects of the President's health care law.\n  President Obama has been spiking the football over the number of \npeople who he says have actually signed up for insurance through his \nexchanges. He also said that Democrats should forcefully defend and be \nproud of the health care law.\n  He has had nothing to say to the Americans who are seeing their \npremiums increase.\n  This Washington mandate insurance is loaded up with so many specific \nmandates that unless you get a massive taxpayer subsidy, it is just not \naffordable for many families across this country.\n  For some people the insurance gets even more expensive, even less \naffordable, depending specifically on where you live.\n  Insurance companies used to base your premiums on a lot of different \nfactors, like how likely you were to use insurance, and different \nthings specific to how you would use medical services.\n  The Obama health care law took away some of that and replaced it with \nwhat they call a community rating. Now there are only a few factors \nthat can be used to set people's premiums, and where you actually live \nis one of those. Your premiums used to be based on you, but now they \nare based on your neighbors and how likely your neighbors are to use \ntheir own health insurance. What we are seeing is all across the \ncountry people are paying more specifically because of where they live.\n  The Associated Press ran a story on this last month. The headline was \n``Rural residents confront higher health care costs.''\n  The Associated Press quoted a rancher in Colorado whose premiums had \njumped 50 percent--to about $1,800 a month. The rancher said:\n\n       We've gone from letting the insurance companies use a pre-\n     existing medical condition to jack up rates, to having a pre-\n     existing ZIP code being the reason health insurance is \n     unaffordable.\n\n  As this rancher said, ``It's just wrong.''\n  I agree, so I looked into this, and here is what I found. Some of the \nlines are drawn so that people just down the road or even people on \ndifferent sides of the street can pay wildly different premiums. These \nare people of exactly the same age, and these are people who are buying \nthe lowest-cost silver plan.\n  The President likes to talk about income inequality, but the \nPresident has created a new kind of insurance inequality. It is not \nonly rural areas like where that rancher lives in Colorado.\n  In Louisiana in one community the premium for the lowest-cost silver \nplan in the ObamaCare exchange for a 40-year-old person who doesn't get \na subsidy would be $255 a month. But if you live right across the \nstreet--right across the street--the premium for that same person, same \nage, same lowest-cost silver plan, would be $311 a month--22 percent \nhigher, $56 more a month, just because you live on one side of the \nstreet instead of the other side of the street, under the President's \nhealth care law. That is $672 a year. That was Louisiana.\n  Now let's take a look at North Carolina, with the same situation. If \nyou live on that side of the line, if your ranch house or farm house is \nover there, it is $263 a month. Just down the road, the other side of \nthe line, it is $319 a month. Again, it is $56 more a month or $672 \nmore a year for the same individual. All they would have to do is move \nfrom that side to this side and they would either save or pay that much \nmore. It is 21 percent more expensive on one side than the other.\n  Is this fair? The Democrats talk about fairness all the time. \nDemocratic Senators have come to the floor to talk about giving \neverybody a fair shot. Do those Democrats who passed this health care \nlaw, who voted for the law, think that in that county in North Carolina \nthey are getting a fair shot depending on which side of the line they \nlive? Does the Senator from Louisiana believe that they get this fair \nshot on either side of the line? Does President Obama believe that \nthese people in North Carolina or Louisiana are getting a fair shot?\n  Why did the Democrats in Washington create a law that penalizes \npeople based on on which side of the street they live?\n  Here is another example--Arkansas. Here we have an area, one side of \nthe line or the other. On this side of the line it is $263 per month \nand on this side $294 a month--same age, same situation, no matter \nwhich of side of the line you live on--$31 a month more expensive.\n  Are those people in Arkansas getting a fair shot from the President's \nhealth care law? For too many people in places such as Colorado, \nLouisiana, North Carolina, and Arkansas, the costs of the President's \nhealth care law are unfair and are too high. Sure, there are some \npeople who are being helped, but there are a lot of people who are \nbeing hurt by the President's health care law, people who are feeling \nthe negative side effects of the law.\n  Why don't Democrats admit this? Why don't they admit that the health \ncare law is not giving people a fair shot?\n  The President says: Forcefully defend and be proud. Why aren't the \nDemocrats in this Senate who passed this law coming to the floor to \ndefend the fact that for millions of people in Arkansas, Louisiana, \nNorth Carolina, Colorado, and all across America, the premiums are too \nhigh. The health care law is too expensive for families, and it is also \ntoo expensive for a lot of employers.\n  There was an article in the Denver Post last week entitled: ``Health \nlaw\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\npresents options, challenges for Colorado's small businesses.'' The \narticle tells the story of a small business in Denver that sells \ncardboard boxes.\n  According to the article, the owner of this business has offered \ninsurance to his workers for three decades. To get a policy that meets \nthe new mandates of the President's health care law was going to cost \n50 percent more than they had been paying in the past.\n  The article says, ``About half of small businesses in Colorado are \nseeing double-digit premium increases'' because of the law.\n  Double-digit premium increases are not what Democrats promised from \ntheir health care law, and it is not what the American people wanted. \nPeople wanted something very simple from health care reform. They \nwanted better access to quality, affordable care.\n  Instead, Democrats gave Americans higher costs and unequal treatment. \nIt is not a fair shot. It is not what American people wanted, what they \nneeded, and it isn't working.\n  Americans don't need a law that Democrats voted for without ever \nreading it, and it is a law that raises their premiums, a law that \nNancy Pelosi said: Hey, first you have to pass it before you get to \nfind out what is in it.\n  Republicans have offered a patient-centered approach that would solve \nthe biggest problems facing families: the cost of care, access to care, \nand ownership of their policies. That means allowing small businesses \nto pool resources in order to buy health insurance for their employees. \nIt means letting people shop for health insurance in other States and \nbuy what is actually best for them and their families. It means \nreforming our medical liability system to give patients fair \ncompensation for tragic mistakes, while ending junk lawsuits that drive \nup health care costs for everyone. It means adequately funding State \nhigh-risk pools that help sick people get insurance without raising \ncosts for healthier individuals.\n  These are just a few solutions Republicans have offered, just a few \nof the things that we will do to give Americans real health care reform \nand a real fair shot--health care reform that gives people the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost without all the \nnegative side effects.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3521\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about an \nissue we should all be concerned about, the State of veterans health \ncare in our VA hospitals, our VA clinics, our VA system, and around the \ncountry.\n  I have been concerned about this for some time, working very hard on \ngetting outpatient clinics built in Louisiana--new ones, expanded ones, \nin particular, in Lafayette and Lake Charles.\n  I am a member of a bipartisan working group on VA backlog issues, and \nwe have made substantial progress through that bipartisan group. We \nhave also introduced legislation to deal specifically with that VA \nbacklog crisis.\n  As we work on those things, unfortunately, the news out of the VA \ngets worse and worse, and the need for real progress on these fronts--\nincluding the community-based clinics I am going to talk about in \nLouisiana and elsewhere--that need gets more and more dire.\n  Think about the recent reports. CNN and others have reported that in \nArizona at least 40 U.S. veterans died--died--waiting for appointments \nat the Phoenix VA health care system. Many of these were placed on a \nsecret waiting list. The secret list was part of an elaborate scheme \ndesigned by the VA managers in Phoenix who were trying to hide the fact \nthat 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a \ndoctor.\n  There is an official list that is shared with officials in \nWashington. That official list shows that the VA has been providing \ntimely appointments. The problem is, you don't get on that official \nlist, in some cases, until you have waited months and months and months \non the secret list that is hidden from Washington, that was hidden from \nthe world, and that was hidden from outsiders until the news media \nbroke the story. So 40 of those veterans died waiting for appointments \nthrough this abuse.\n  In Colorado, USA Today and others reported that clerks at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs clinic in Fort Collins were instructed \nlast year about how to falsify appointment records so it appeared the \nsmall staff of doctors was seeing patients within the agency's goal of \n14 days--the exact same abuse, the exact same type of scheme, but \ndifferent details. Many of the 6,300 veterans treated at the outpatient \nclinic waited months to be seen, but that was hidden through this \nscheme.\n  If the clerical staff had allowed records to reflect that veterans \nwaited longer than 14 days, they were punished by being placed on the \nbad boy list, the report shows. So, again, it is exactly the same fraud \nand abuse, the same scheme, designed to hide the real waits that \nveterans in these places and in many other places around the country \nare subjected to.\n  We see these horrible abuses. We see these examples with increasing \nfrequency. It has gotten so bad that the head of the American Legion \nand the head of the Concerned Veterans for America on Monday called for \nSecretary Shinseki to resign and called for members of his top \nleadership to resign with him.\n  The calls for his resignation came after months of reporting that I \nhave been talking about--U.S. veterans who have actually died waiting \nfor care at VA facilities across the country. It came after these \nreports about Phoenix. It came after these reports about Colorado.\n  The heads of these organizations did not rush into a public call for \nhis resignation. They did not take that lightly. That is virtually and \nperhaps completely unprecedented, but they did that on Monday. They \ncalled for the Secretary's resignation. They called for it publicly, \nand they called for several of his leadership team to resign with him. \nThat is how bad it has gotten.\n  Yet in the midst of this, rather than responding to this crisis in \nany way we can, as quickly as we can, we have important matters hung up \non pure politics on the Senate floor. Specifically, I am talking about \nmy proposal to move forward with 27 community-based clinics around the \ncountry, including the two vital new and expanded community-based \nclinics that we need to move on, approve, and build in Louisiana, in \nLafayette and Lake Charles.\n  These clinics around the country--and particularly the two in \nLouisiana, in Lafayette and Lake Charles--have been hung up through one \nbureaucratic screw up after another. These should have been built by \nnow.\n  First, in terms of our two Louisiana clinics, the VA messed up how \nthey let out the contract, and that caused them to pull back. It was \ntheir mistake, pure and simple. They have admitted that freely, and it \ncost us 1 year in terms of moving forward with those clinics.\n  After that mistake was corrected--after the loss of 1 year of \nwaiting--then the CBO decided that they were going to score these \nclinics in a completely new way, something they had never done before, \nand that caused a ``scoring'' or ``fiscal issue'' with regard to all 27 \nof the community-based VA clinics around the country that I am talking \nabout. That further delayed progress.\n\n  Finally, after these two major delays, leaders in the House got \ntogether on a bipartisan basis--and I want to commend my Louisiana \ncolleagues in the House, in particular led by Congressman Boustany and \nothers--to fix this scoring issue. They put together a reform bill and \nthey got it approved by the House overwhelmingly, with one dissenting \nvote. In today's environment, resolutions to honor Mother Teresa don't \npass the House of Representatives with only one dissenting vote, but \nthey did that.\n  So it came over here, and I worked to address some small issues and \nobjections that existed on the Senate side through a perfecting \namendment which I have at the desk. I worked very hard for weeks to \nclear up those objections so we could move forward with this \nnoncontroversial measure. Because of that, we have the unanimous \nsupport of the Senate--not one single objection to moving forward with \nthese 27 community-based VA clinics around the\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\ncountry. There is not one single objection related to the substance of \nthat proposal--not one.\n  The only objection now has been from the distinguished Senator from \nVermont who objects to moving forward with this focused proposal \nbecause the Senate does not agree unanimously or near unanimously with \nhis much larger bill that encompasses dozens of VA issues. Again, I \nhave pledged to and I will work with the Senator on those broader \nissues. I have been working hard on those issues, including these \nclinics, including being an active member of the bipartisan working \ngroup on the VA backlog issue. I will continue to work on that. But the \nfact remains his larger bill has substantial opposition. There are \naround 46 Senators--excuse me, around 44 Senators who oppose that \nlarger bill.\n  In the meantime, I think we should agree on what we can agree on. We \nshould make progress on what we can make progress on, starting with \nthese 27 clinics. Veterans have been dying around the country because \nof these ridiculous waits and the fraud and abuse involved in hiding \nthese waits. These 27 community-based clinics will directly help \naddress veterans who are waiting for months and months in some cases, \nwaiting for medical treatment. It will directly alleviate that issue in \nthe communities in 18 States where these clinics will be located. There \nis a significant number of communities in a significant number of \nStates. So let's agree on what we can agree on. Let's make that \nsignificant progress. Let's keep talking and working on the rest.\n  Last November Senator Sanders seemed to agree with that principle and \nthat way of moving forward. In talking about another Veterans' Affairs \npiece of legislation, he said, on November 19 of last year, ``I'm happy \nto tell you that I think that was a concern of his.''--talking about \nanother of our colleagues--``We got that UC'ed last night.''--unanimous \nconsent--``So we moved that pretty quickly, and I want to try to do \nthose things. Where we have agreement, let's move it.''\n  To repeat from that quote: `` . . . I want to try to do those things. \nWhere we have agreement, let's move it.''\n  That is all I am asking for. We are not going to agree on everything \nimmediately, but we can agree on important things right today, right \nthis hour, right this minute. We do agree on 27 important community-\nbased clinics in 18 States around the country, including 2 in \nLouisiana--Lafayette and Lake Charles, LA--that Senator Landrieu and I \nrepresent.\n  I want to try to do those things where we have agreement. Let's move \nit. And that can start right this minute in a productive, positive way \nwith these 27 community-based clinics around the country. So let's \nagree on what we can agree on. Let's move on this important clinic \nissue.\n  Leaders of national groups--American Legion, American Vets, DAV, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and others--think the same. That is why \nthey wrote a letter on June 10 of last year--June 10 of 2013--saying \nthese community-based clinics are important. Let's come together, work \ntogether, and move specifically on these community-based clinics. They \nare important.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nJune 10 to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 10, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House Minority Leader, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders of Congress: We write you, as leaders of \n     Congress, to urge you to work together to prevent a looming \n     problem that over the next several years may harm the health \n     of more than 340,000 wounded, injured and ill veterans in 22 \n     states who will be in need of care provided by the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA). Without your intervention, these \n     veterans are in jeopardy of losing that important health \n     resource.\n       Since the 1990s, Congress has helped improve VA health care \n     access and patient satisfaction by authorizing and funding \n     nearly 900 VA community-based outpatient clinics. These are \n     important facilities for local, convenient, and cost-\n     effective primary care for millions of veterans. \n     Unfortunately, a policy shift by the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO); in 2012 has effectively halted Congressional \n     authorization of leases for such new clinics. Also, as old \n     leases expire and need reauthorization in future years, this \n     CBO decision jeopardizes existing VA-leased health, research \n     and other facilities.\n       Last year, CBO announced it would redefine 15 VA-proposed \n     leases as ``capital'' leases and would treat them as current-\n     year mandatory obligations, costing more than $1 billion \n     altogether over a 20-year period. In order to advance these \n     leases to approval, House budget rules would have forced an \n     offset to equal the cost of these leases with an unrealistic \n     Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 reduction in mandatory veterans' \n     programs. Since no such accommodation could be made in a \n     single year, and VA had not addressed such an offset in its \n     FY 2013 budget, the proposed lease authorizations were \n     dropped from the authorizing bill. These 15 proposed \n     community facilities are now in limbo, and veterans are not \n     being served.\n       This unexpected challenge will not resolve itself absent \n     action by House and Senate leadership to ensure Congress \n     continues to authorize leases of local VA community-based \n     outpatient clinics and other VA facilities when such \n     approvals are needed. Also the VA warns that over time \n     numerous existing leases will be expiring. Lack of \n     reauthorization could result in closures of current clinics. \n     Newly proposed clinics without lease authorization cannot be \n     activated. Costs of veterans' VA care will be rising while \n     they face longer travel and more waiting for needed \n     treatment, or they may be forced to go without treatment.\n       Committee leaders with jurisdiction over the VA have \n     pledged to solve this problem, but no resolution has emerged \n     since CBO's determination, made nine months ago. Without \n     leadership intervention, these promised clinics and more in \n     the future cannot be activated or will be shut down, and \n     wounded, injured and ill veterans in need will be denied VA \n     health care.\n       The CBO's policy must be reversed or otherwise addressed in \n     consultation with VA and the Office of Management and Budget. \n     We ask that you take action that results in Congressional \n     authorization of the 15 clinics still in limbo since 2012, \n     the additional ones proposed earlier this year in VA's budget \n     for FY 2014, and in general to find the means to allow VA's \n     leased facilities to continue to provide flexible, low-cost \n     VA care to wounded, injured and ill veterans. The current \n     situation is unacceptable and must be remedied.\n       We appreciate your support for America's veterans and look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter S. Gaytan,\n       Executive Director, The American Legion.\n     Barry A. Jesinoski,\n       Executive Director, Washington Headquarters Disabled \n     American Veterans.\n     Robert E. Wallace,\n       Executive Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \n     States.\n     Stewart M. Hickey,\n       National Executive Director, AMVETS.\n     Homer S. Townsend, Jr.,\n       Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. These groups agree with what Senator Sanders said last \nyear and they agree with what I am saying today: Let us come together \nand move on those things we can agree on, and they specifically wrote \nthe Senate leadership about these community-based clinics.\n  That leads to my unanimous consent request, which is to adopt this \nspirit of agreeing where we agree, getting things accomplished whenever \nand wherever we can, and continuing to work on the rest.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Veterans' Affairs Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 3521 and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that my amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me touch on a few of the points of \nmy distinguished colleague from Louisiana.\n  First of all, regarding the allegations against the VA in Phoenix, as \nwe know, these are very serious allegations, and it is absolutely \nappropriate the inspector general do a thorough and independent \ninvestigation of those allegations. As I am sure my colleague from \nLouisiana knows, the leadership at Phoenix has rejected those \nallegations, saying those are not true. The Secretary of VA has done \nwhat I believe,\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nand I would hope my friend from Louisiana believes, is the right thing \nto do, which is to do an independent investigation.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I did learn enough in school to know you don't \nfind somebody guilty without assessing the evidence. And frankly, just \nbecause CNN says something doesn't always make it the case. So what we \nneed is a serious independent investigation into the very serious \nallegations about Phoenix and any other facility within the VA. I have \nsaid I will hold hearings immediately--more than one hearing, if \nnecessary--to get to the truth of the matter regarding the VA situation \nin Phoenix.\n  I would also tell my friend that when we talk about the VA, when we \ntalk about health care in general--and I am sure he would agree with \nme--as a nation we have a whole lot of serious problems, don't we? We \nhave about 30 million people today who have no health insurance at all. \nHarvard University estimates about 45,000 people die each year because \nthey do not get to a doctor when they should, because we are the only \ncountry in the industrialized world that doesn't guarantee health care \nto all people.\n  There was a study that came out recently that indicates that some \n200,000 to 400,000 patients a year die in hospitals in America because \nof medical errors, in ways that could have been prevented--200,000 to \n400,000 people a year. So, yes, as chairman of the Senate Veterans \nCommittee, I am going to do everything we can do, along with my \ncolleagues, in a bipartisan way to make sure the veterans of this \ncountry get all of the health care they need, and get the best quality \nthey can.\n  This is a very serious issue, and with an independent investigation \ntaking place in Phoenix now, we are going to get to the truth of that.\n  When we talk about the VA, as I am sure my colleague from Louisiana \nknows, in fiscal year 2013, the VA provided 89.7 million outpatient \nvisits, and the VA has 236,000 health care appointments every single \nday. Today, over 200,000 veterans in 151 medical centers in 900 \ncommunity-based outreach clinics all over this country are walking into \nthe VA to get health care. I assure my colleague from Louisiana that \nevery single day there are problems within the VA. When there are over \n200,000 people walking in, there are going to be problems. But I also \nassure my friend there are problems in every other medical facility in \nAmerica today as well.\n  I just mentioned the very frightening situation that, according to a \nvery significant study, we are experiencing between 200,000 and 400,000 \npatients dying from what are preventable deaths because of hospital \nerrors all over America. My point about saying that is to say, let's \nput the VA within a broader context. If you want to criticize the VA, \nfine, I am there with you. You got problems, I will work with you. But \nlet's not paint a broad brush.\n  The VA has 151 medical centers, they have 300,000-plus employees--\nmany of them veterans themselves--and in my view, and in the view of \nthe veterans community--the veterans associations--the Veterans' \nAdministration is providing high quality care to the veterans across \nthis country.\n  It is not just me. My colleague from Louisiana may have recently read \nthat an independent customer service survey, done by the American \nCustomer Satisfaction Index--these are people who assess how people \nfeel about medical facilities around the country--found that in 2013 an \noverall satisfaction rating for the VA was 84 percent for inpatient \ncare and 82 percent for outpatient care, which in some respects was \nhigher than for the hospital industry in general.\n  For the past 10 years, the American Consumer Satisfaction Index has \nfound a high degree of loyalty to VA among veterans of over 90 percent. \nI would suspect my colleague from Louisiana finds--as I have found when \nI talk to veterans in Vermont--and he asks them, as I am sure he does, \nwhat do you think about VA health care, veterans will say: You know \nwhat. It is pretty good health care. Is it perfect? No. Are there \nproblems? Yes. In general, they think it is pretty good health care.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have a pending unanimous consent request and I would \nlike to inquire how I proceed to have a ruling on that and, hopefully, \nhave it passed through the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. SANDERS. What I am going to do, Madam President, is I am going to \nobject, and I am going to ask for a unanimous consent request on \nlegislation that I have offered, and I want to say a word about that.\n  I want to ask a question of my friend from Louisiana. My colleague \nfrom Louisiana has indicated he wants to work with us. I think I heard \nthat in his statement today, and I applaud that. I am not quite sure he \nhas done that yet, but I look forward to working with him and his \nstaff. I would invite my colleague from Louisiana to come to my office \nat a mutually convenient time to see how in fact we can work together.\n  Will my colleague from Louisiana take me up on that offer, I ask \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, or reclaiming the floor, since my \nunanimous consent request----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I just asked a brief question of my \nfriend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, a point of parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I had a unanimous consent request. It \nhas been objected to. May I reclaim the floor and reclaim my time? In \ndoing so, I will be happy to respond to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request has not yet formally been objected \nto.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would again ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3521 \nand that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that my \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I do object. And I am going to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I may reclaim the floor and reclaim my time, I would \nlike to respond.\n  I think it is really unfortunate. As we all agreed to today and in \nprevious appearances on the floor, there is absolutely no objection on \nthe merits of this proposal. The only objection from the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont is that a far larger bill, which does have \nsignificant opposition--around 44 Members, almost half of the Senate--\npeople have concerns about that. So if he can't play the game exactly \nhis way, he is going to take his ball and go home, and he is going to \nblock 27 community-based clinics on which there is no substantive \nobjection, on which the leaders of national veterans organizations have \npleaded with leaders of the Senate and House to act in a bipartisan \nway.\n  I am particularly concerned that today what I hear is an even higher \nbar that we are going to have to meet to act on these clinics that are \nnot objected to on their merits.\n  Previously the Senator from Vermont talked about his far broader \nbill. Today he talked about all of health care. Apparently I am going \nto have to agree with Senator Sanders about all of health care reform \nbefore we can move forward on these 27 community-based clinics on which \nthere is no substantive objection.\n  The Senator from Vermont said he will do everything he can to deal \nwith these issues. Well, we can do something right here, right now, to \ndeal with these issues. It is not solving every problem in the world. \nIt is not solving every problem in health care. It is not solving every \nproblem in the VA. But it is doing something real and meaningful and \nsubstantial in 27 communities and 18 States. We can move forward with \nthese community-based clinics. We can try to do those things on which \nwe have agreement. Let's move it. We can do that. That is all I am \nasking. And I think it is really counterproductive to\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\ntake the view that until we agree about all of the VA or about all of \nhealth care or whatever, we are not going to do any of that. I think \nthat is really sad and counterproductive.\n  I will keep coming to the floor. I will keep working on this vital \nissue. I will keep working on other vital issues. I will keep talking \nto the Senator from Vermont about his broader bill. But I have to say \nthat these scandals in Phoenix and elsewhere don't alleviate my \nconcerns; they only heighten my concerns about a broader bill that is \ngoing to push many more patients, overnight, into a system that is \nobviously broken.\n  So I will continue working and talking about it all. I will continue \nworking in the bipartisan working group on the VA backlog. But let's do \nwhat we can do now. Let's start with one step and then two and then \nfive, and then maybe we can start to jog and then we can start to run. \nI think that is the productive path forward.\n  I urge my colleague to reconsider and let us move forward with these \nimportant clinics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, unfortunately, I didn't quite hear that \nthe Senator from Louisiana wanted to work with us. So I will have my \noffice call his office and see if we can sit down with our staffs and \nfind out what the Senator's concerns are about the legislation.\n  It is not Bernie Sanders' legislation. It is not the Veterans' \nCommittee's legislation. This is legislation supported by the American \nLegion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nthe Vietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica, and virtually every other veterans organization in America.\n  In preparation for the discussion I look forward to having with my \ncolleague from Louisiana, this is not changing the world. This is not \nlegislation that is going to solve every problem in the world. But it \ndoes do a whole lot to improve the lives of millions of veterans and \ntheir families who are hurting, and I think it is appropriate that we \ndo that. I want my colleague from Louisiana to be thinking about these \nissues and to come into the office and tell me: No, Senator Sanders. I \ndisagree.\n  Does he disagree with restoration of full COLA for military retirees? \nAs he knows, for current people in the military and new people who are \ncoming in, they are going to get less of a COLA than longstanding \nmembers of the military. Maybe he disagrees; maybe he doesn't. Let's \ntalk about it.\n  Does he believe the veterans community--people who go into the VA--\nshould be entitled to dental care? I don't know about Louisiana, but in \nVermont that is a very serious issue. All over this country veterans \nare dealing with rotting teeth, and they can't get that care in VA \nfacilities right now.\n  There is widespread support for advanced appropriations for the VA. I \nthink virtually all the veterans organizations understand that the VA \ncould do a better job if they had advanced appropriations. I support \nit. Many people support it. I don't know if my colleague from Louisiana \nsupports it. Let's work together, and I will find out.\n  The next time we come down to the floor and go through this exercise, \nwe can tell the people what we agree with and what we don't agree with.\n  On ending the benefits backlog, the truth is that the current VA \nAdministration--General Shinseki and others--inherited a paper system. \nCan you believe that? In the year 2009 the VA benefits system was on \npaper--maybe the last remaining system of its size in the world to \nstill be on paper and not digital. What people at the VA have done--\nGeneral Shinseki and others--is they transformed that system from paper \nto electronic records. Guess what. The backlog is going down. But that \nis not good enough for me. We have language in this bill which will \nmake sure the backlog continues to go down.\n  There is an issue I am sure my colleague from Louisiana is very \nfamiliar with: instate tuition. There are veterans from Louisiana who \nmay want to go to school in Vermont or veterans from Vermont who may \nwant to go to school in Louisiana, but they can't get instate tuition. \nIt is a serious problem, and we address it. What does my colleague from \nLouisiana feel about that issue?\n  Then there is extending health care access for recently separated \nveterans. As he knows, we have legislation now that extends free health \ncare to all those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan for 5 years. I \nthink it should be extended for 10 years. Does he agree or does he not \nagree? The veterans community feels very strongly about that issue.\n  We have high unemployment rates for returning veterans. We want to do \nsomething to expand employment opportunities.\n  We have the issue of sexual assault--a very serious issue, as we all \nknow--and we want to make sure the VA is providing excellent-quality \ncare to those victims of sexual assault.\n  We have, in my mind, a really tragic problem. The good news is that a \nfew years ago Congress did the right thing and said to the post-9/11 \nveterans, those men and women who came home seriously injured: We are \ngoing to pass a caregivers act to give support to your wives or your \nsisters or your brothers who are providing often 24/7 care for you--\nevery single day, long hours--at great stress. We are going to help \nyou.\n  But what we didn't do is reach back to the Vietnam-era veterans, the \nKorean war veterans, even World War II veterans. There are families \ntoday in which a 70-year-old woman is taking care of her husband who \nlost his legs in Vietnam, and day after day, year after year she is \ngetting virtually no support from the government.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica and many other organizations that say we can't ignore those \npeople. I don't know what my friend from Louisiana feels about this. \nLet's talk about it.\n  Here is the bottom line. The bottom line is, as I have said many \ntimes, I do support the provision the Senator from Louisiana speaks \nabout. We do need these facilities. But we need a lot more. We need \ncooperation and people coming together.\n  I believe the Senator from Louisiana said there were 44 people who \nvoted in opposition. He is right. He forgot to mention that there were \n56 who voted for this bill, with the support of every veterans \norganization in America. One person was absent who would have voted for \nit, so 57 voted for it and 44 voted against it. Unfortunately, in the \nrules of the Senate, when we have a Republican filibuster, we do need \n60 votes. I am looking for three more Republican votes. One of those \nvotes I would very much appreciate receiving is from the Senator from \nLouisiana. That would make me two votes shy. And we think we are making \nsome progress with some other Republicans who understand that we must \naddress the serious needs facing the veterans community.\n  I again extend my request to the Senator from Louisiana to work with \nme. But pending that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto Calendar No. 297, S. 1950, with the Sanders amendment, which is at \nthe desk and is the text of S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health \nand Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I object on behalf of myself and 43 \nother Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. If not for any other reason but because of the \nsubstantive concerns with the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I hear what my colleague from Louisiana \nsays. I hear that he objects to passing legislation which has the \nsupport of virtually every veterans organization in the country that \nrepresents many millions of veterans. I hear him objecting to \nlegislation which has the support of 57 Members of the U.S. Senate. I \nhear him objecting to what I believe is legislation which has the \nsupport of the vast majority of the American people, who do believe we \nshould do right by our veterans. It is very easy to send people off to \nwar; it is a lot harder to take care of them when they come home.\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  I would simply say that I look forward to sitting down with my \ncolleague from Louisiana and other Republican colleagues--and we are \ndoing that right now but specifically with my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter--and seeing where we can agree and how we can create \nsome significant legislation to address the very serious problems \nfacing the veterans community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, just to briefly repeat, I did object on \nbehalf of myself and 43 other Senators about major provisions in this \nbill. I am happy to talk about it. I am happy to work on it. I am happy \nto work with Senator Burr, who is the ranking member on the committee, \nwho has been communicating all these concerns to Senator Sanders and \nhis staff. But I think that is very different from objecting to a \nfocused community-based clinic bill that has no objection on the \nmerits.\n  I just think it is a shame not to try to do those things where we \nhave agreement--let's move forward--not to move forward. That would be \nmoving forward in a substantial way. That would quickly improve the \nlives of veterans in 27 communities and in 18 States, including \nLafayette and Lake Charles--communities that certainly Senator Landrieu \nand I very much care about and very much want to have their VA issues \naddressed in this way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I simply reiterate my hope that Senator \nVitter would sit down with me, his staff would sit down with my staff, \nand we can work out our differences. I have always been willing to \ncompromise and make changes in the legislation.\n  But for the veterans of this country who have suffered so much and \nwho have been hurt so much, we owe them so much, and we have to do \nright by them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Public Service Recognition Week\n\n           Honoring Heidi King, Chuck Bolen, and Brian Stout\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this week we celebrate Public Service \nRecognition Week to honor public servants at all levels of government \nfor their admirable patriotism and contributions to our country.\n  We often forget that these public servants at all levels of \ngovernment go to work every day with the sole mission to make this \ncountry a better and safer place to live. Day by day, they go about \ntheir work, often receiving little recognition for the great work they \ndo.\n  Since 2010, I have come to the Senate floor on occasions to honor \nexemplary Federal employees--a tradition that was begun by my friend \nSenator Ted Kaufman.\n  Amongst the list of Federal employees we have honored across the \ncountry are some who serve here on this Senate floor.\n  Today I want to celebrate Public Service Recognition Week by taking \nthis opportunity to recognize three federally employed Virginians who \nare doing exemplary work behind the scenes to make our government more \neffective and keep our fellow citizens safe.\n  Normally, we would have their photos here in the Chamber, but since \nwe have three, we are going to recognize them all with this single \nposter. Again, these are exemplary Federal employees.\n  The first is Heidi King, who served as the Director of the Patient \nSafety Program Office at the Department of Defense and currently leads \nthe DOD's Partnership for Patients.\n  While at DOD, she helped develop a patient safety program which helps \nmedical professionals eliminate preventable medical errors.\n  Breakdowns in communication between doctors, nurses, and special care \nproviders are historically the cause of many tragic medical events such \nas surgical errors, prescription mistakes, and hospital-acquired \ninfections.\n  To combat this, Heidi coordinated with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to bring together more than 100 independent experts in \nthe medical field. These experts developed a comprehensive training \nprogram for medical professionals to learn about the factors within \ntheir control that commonly contribute to errors.\n  In 2008, DOD implemented Heidi's program in combat support units in \nIraq. As a result, communication errors decreased 65 percent, \nmedication and transfusion errors decreased 85 percent, and the rate of \nbloodstream infections from catheters also dropped dramatically. Heidi \nshould be proud of her work, which is directly responsible for the \nhealth of many brave soldiers.\n  In an effort to spread these best practices, the safety program has \nestablished 11 training centers across the country, where more than \n6,200 medical professionals have participated to become master trainers \nand instructors. They then return to their health care systems to lead \nimplementation of the program.\n  This is the kind of commonsense, cost-effective, yet also lifesaving \nprogram that does not get much recognition but is an example of a \nFederal employee going above and beyond the call of duty to help her \nfellow Americans and actually help the bottom line.\n  I would also like to recognize two TSA employees for their heroic \nactions that helped save a passenger's life.\n  While posted at Washington National Airport last month, TSA employee \nChuck Bolen was told that a passenger was in need of immediate \nassistance.\n  As soon as Bolen saw the passenger slumped in the chair, he knew he \ndid not have a lot of time and was prepared to do whatever was \nnecessary to keep the passenger alive.\n  As the man's condition declined rapidly, Bolen sprinted to grab the \nnearest AED machine. With help from his colleague Brian Stout, a marine \ninfantry sergeant who did three combat tours in Iraq and now works for \nTSA, they worked together to apply the AED machine. After a single \nattempt, the machine advised to begin CPR. Bolen initiated chest \ncompressions and continued administering the lifesaving action, even \nafter first responders arrived on the scene.\n  Thankfully, their quick collaborative actions paid off. While in the \nambulance on the way to the hospital, the man's heart started and \nstopped several times, but today he is alive and recovering from triple \nbypass surgery.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Heidi King, Chuck \nBolen, and Brian Stout--truly great Virginians but also great civil \nservants--and all those who serve at the Department of Defense and the \nTSA for their hard work and dedication to our Nation.\n  While today we have highlighted three, as I mentioned at the outset, \nover the last 5 years I have come many times and have highlighted folks \nfrom across Virginia and across the country. As I mentioned, as well, \nthere are people serving right now on this Senate floor who have \nreceived this kind of attention for their quiet dedication to duty and \nmaking the Senate a more functioning institution.\n  As we constantly come to the floor and debate the challenges of our \nbudget and other issues, I think it is very important--while we may \ndiffer about which programs we support and what functions our \ngovernment should take on--we never underestimate the enormous value \nour Federal employees contribute on a regular basis to the safety, \nsecurity, and, quite honestly, the function of our national government.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in recognizing the efforts of \npublic servants across the country during Public Service Recognition \nWeek and thank them for the very important work they do every day.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Student Debt\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that \nimpacts tens of millions of people across\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nthe country and hangs over our entire economy, and that is student \ndebt.\n  Borrowers have accumulated over $1.2 trillion in student debt. Think \nabout that for a minute. That is more than people owe on their credit \ncards. Talk about a drag for not only the individual, for their family, \nbut for the entire economy.\n  Students in my home State of Michigan are among the most heavily \nindebted in the country when they graduate. Frankly, we want them to \nget degrees, not debt, when they graduate.\n  Nearly two-thirds of students in Michigan who graduated in 2012 had \nstudent loan debt, with each student averaging nearly $29,000. So they \nwalk outside the door--congratulations--take off the cap and gown and \nget a $29,000 bill.\n  This growing mountain of debt represents a threat to our economy and \nto the dreams of millions of Americans.\n  Today too many people are saddled with decades of debt just because \nthey want a fair shot to go to college and to get ahead in life.\n  Instead of saving for a house, buying a car or just buying gas or \ngroceries, millions of people are simply paying student loan payments \nmonth after month, year after year, decade after decade.\n  I hear from many of my constituents about how they are being crushed \nby the burden of student debt. I have seen it in my own extended \nfamily. They write about having $50,000 or $100,000 of debt. If you are \ngoing to medical school, if you are in specialty areas as a grad \nstudent, they have $200,000 or more in debt.\n  Some of the reforms we have already put in place help some borrowers \nby limiting the payments on their Federal loans relative to their \nincomes. That is a good thing, but this is not enough, and it doesn't \ndo anything to help people who have private loans--oftentimes on top of \nthe loans through the Federal Government. Some of these private loans \ncarry interest rates like credit cards and are literally driving people \ninto bankruptcy.\n  I have constituents who use words such as ``crippling'' or \n``catastrophic.'' They talk about anxiety attacks.\n  One person wrote that because of the high interest rates on his \nprivate loans, ``it is getting to the point where [he] cannot eat \nbecause of [his] student loan payments.''\n  Another constituent, Thomas, wrote to me that each of his three \nchildren has a combination of Federal and private loans totaling \n$75,000 to $110,000--each.\n  What Thomas wrote to me really sums up the student debt crisis we are \nfacing and that families across the country are facing:\n\n       Loans are designed to give students a chance to go to \n     college and to obtain high-income jobs. Somehow the interest \n     they pay has become just another wound for college grads that \n     have a tough time finding jobs. . . . It will leave grads \n     with a high risk of default, not being able to pay for their \n     dreams and not being able to fund their retirement accounts \n     for many years.\n\n  That is crazy. That is just not right, and that is not how it should \nwork in our country. That is certainly not what we think of when we \nthink of striving for the American dream. Whether it is the Federal \nGovernment or the big banks, we should not be making a profit off the \nbacks of students, and that is exactly what is happening.\n  That is why I am so proud to be fighting alongside Senator Warren and \nmy other colleagues to address this very urgent and growing problem.\n  Senator Warren and I fought last year to stop students from getting \nstuck with a raw deal. Now we are back at it again this year, and we \nare going to keep fighting until we can solve this problem.\n  Horace Mann once called education ``the great equalizer'' in our \nsociety. Everyone who wants to work hard and go to college in order to \nsimply have a fair shot in life should not be denied that opportunity.\n  It shouldn't be the great equalizer on debt. It has to be the great \nequalizer on opportunity.\n  These folks are willing to play by the rules, work hard, and pay back \ntheir loans on time. We have to make sure that the system isn't rigged \nagainst them.\n  The legislation we have introduced will not only help millions of \nAmericans, it will also boost our economy by allowing borrowers to \nspend their money on a home, a car or just the needs of their families \ninstead of interest payments. Nobody should have to put off getting \nmarried or starting a family just because of student loans.\n  We are not just talking only about young people, this bill helps \nstudents of all ages: students in their twenties, thirties, and \nbeyond--young professionals and parents who have stepped up to help \ntheir children. In fact, the student loan debt has gotten so out of \nhand that senior citizens in the country owe tens of billions of \ndollars on student loans.\n  Our bill will help millions of responsible borrowers of all ages in \nevery State across the country. The Bank On Students Emergency Loan \nRefinancing Act is a reasonable commonsense and fiscally responsible \nway to address the student loan crisis.\n  This is simply about giving those who want to go to college a fair \nshot to get ahead, making sure that those who already borrowed to get \nan education are not being unfairly weighed down by debt just so the \ngovernment or the big banks can turn a profit.\n  I thank Senator Warren for her leadership on this vital issue. This \nis about allowing all of those who currently have student loan debt to \nbe able to refinance--to be able to refinance at a rate actually that \nwas voted on, 3.68 percent, by colleagues on both sides 1 year ago. It \nis not a number that is picked out of the a hat. It will allow people \nto exchange an 11 percent or 12 percent on a private loan or a 6 \npercent, 7 percent or 8 percent interest rate on a public loan for \nsomething that is affordable, that will allow them to take those extra \nprecious dollars, invest in their future, and the country's future.\n  That is what this is about. It is very simple, and it is paid for by \nwhat has been commonly called the Buffett rule, which basically says \nthose who have benefited by the blessings of this country and those who \nare the wealthiest among us would contribute a little bit more to make \nsure that everybody has a fair shot at getting ahead.\n  We can't afford for America to be a big-shot economy. We have to make \nsure that everyone has a fair shot to make it. Nobody is asking for a \nhandout; they are asking to work hard. They are asking to know that the \nsystem is not rigged against them.\n  They are asking to know that they are going to be able to go to \ncollege, get out of college, pay back their student loans at a \nreasonable, fair rate, buy a house, get married, have a career, have \nchildren, and go on to have the American dream. That is what this is \nabout. This needs to get passed as quickly as possible so people know \nthey are going to have the opportunity to get ahead in America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, more than a year ago Senators Shaheen and \nPortman worked on an energy efficiency bill--a good bill. That was more \nthan a year ago. That bill was, as I have indicated, good, but during \nthe past many months, through the energy committee and the work of Ron \nWyden and others, that bill was improved greatly. Ron Wyden was \nchairman of that committee at the time, and they did so many good \nthings with that piece of legislation. We had six cosponsors--three \nDemocrats and three Republicans.\n  This bill would create 200,000 jobs, and it would help our Nation's \nenergy proficiency significantly.\n  So I moved to proceed to the bill in September, this past September--\nand we have been through this a number of times, but I will repeat it \nvery quickly. We were held up from doing that for a number of reasons, \nnot the least of which was the junior Senator from Louisiana wanting to \ntake away the health care for our staffs. That threw a few roadblocks \nin the way. So without going into detail, we never got that done.\n  But Senators Shaheen and Portman, as I have indicated, did not give \nup. They worked hard to incorporate 10\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nseparate bipartisan amendments into this bill. So the bill was good \nlast September, but it is terrific now.\n  As a result of that, we improved the number of people who were \nwilling to support this legislation. We went from 3 and 3 to 7 and 7--\n14 cosponsors of this bill. On the Republican side are Senators \nPortman, Ayotte, Collins, Hoeven, Isakson, Murkowski, and Wicker. On \nthe Democratic side are Senators Shaheen, Bennet, Coons, Franken, \nLandrieu, Manchin, and Warren. There is a good mix of Senators on both \nsides. So we worked very hard to finalize a more bipartisan bill. I \nworked with them. I didn't give up. We continued to try to move \nforward. We did that, as we did with childcare recently. It was in \nMarch, actually. I have looked for every bipartisan bill we could come \nto the floor on. We did it with the childcare bill, as I said, and we \nshould do it on this bill. That was my anticipation. And we were able \nto do it, I thought.\n  So this Shaheen-Portman bill is a very fine bill. I reached out to \nRepublican Senators. To be honest, I didn't reach out to them; they \nreached out to me. They wanted to work to get this passed. Originally, \nthe arrangement was, let's just pass this bill as it is.\n  Right before the Easter recess, I was asked: How about a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution on Keystone?\n  I said: I don't want to do that. We already have an agreement.\n  Anyway, we relented and said OK. So I came back after the Easter \nrecess, and that agreement we had, well, they said: Let's change it. We \nno longer want a sense-of-the-Senate resolution; we want a vote on a \nfreestanding piece of legislation.\n  I said: We have an agreement.\n  Anyway, I relented and we had that proposal. So we had that all \nworked out. Then we were told there needs to be five more amendments.\n  So, as I have said before, this has been very hard to do, this shell \ngame. It can be described in other ways, but it has been very difficult \nto pin down the Republicans for anything more than a day or two because \nthey keep changing their minds.\n  So here we are, and my offer is this: If Shaheen-Portman passes, with \nthe seven Republican cosponsors, we will have a freestanding vote \nforthwith on Keystone, with whatever time is fair. I have put 3 hours \nin the proposal I will make in just a minute, but it doesn't matter--\nwhatever time they want for a freestanding vote on Keystone, which they \nhave been wanting to have for a long time.\n  You get the picture, Mr. President. That is what I think should \nhappen. It is a good bill, but it is so much better than it was a year \nago. It is a great bill now, not a good bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by me after consulting with Senator McConnell, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 368, S. 2262; that there \nbe no amendments, points of order, or motions in order to the bill \nother than budget points of order and applicable motions to waive; that \nthere be up to 3 hours of debate on the bill equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that the \nbill be subject to a 60 affirmative-vote threshold; that if the bill is \npassed, the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 371, S. 2280, at a time to \nbe determined by me after consultation with the Republican leader but \nno later than Thursday, May 22, 2014--and I will just enter the comment \nhere that if they want it earlier, they can have it, but that is the \ndate I have suggested--that there be no amendments, points of order or \nmotions in order to the bill other than budget points of order and the \napplicable motions to waive; that there be up to, again, 3 hours of \ndebate on the bill equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill; that the bill be subject to a \n60 affirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it has \nbeen my position since late last week that it would be appropriate for \nthe minority--not having had but eight rollcall votes since July--to \nhave five amendments of our choosing on this bill, and therefore I am \ngoing to propose a counter consent request at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 368, S. 2262; that the only amendments in \norder be five amendments to be offered by myself or my designee related \nto energy policy, with the first amendment being my amendment No. 2982 \non saving coal jobs, and with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each \namendment; that following the disposition of these amendments, the bill \nbe read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I incorporate \nby reference the statement I made earlier today on this bill and \nreluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nRepublican leader.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this morning I noted that the \nmajority leader has refused for 7 years to allow a serious debate on \nenergy in this Chamber. I said he has tried to stifle the voice of the \nAmerican people again this current week as well, at a time when so many \nmiddle-class Americans are suffering from high energy costs, lost jobs, \nand stagnant wages in the Obama economy; at a time when global crises \nclarify not just the need but the opportunity for America to establish \na greater energy presence overseas that would grow more jobs here at \nhome; at a time when eastern Kentuckians are suffering a depression, \nmade so much worse by this administration's elitist war on coal.\n  Well, Republicans are going to keep fighting. Even if Senate \nDemocrats would rather pander to the far left and shut down debate, \nRepublicans are going to keep fighting for the middle class. That is \nwhy we had hoped to offer forward-leaning amendments today which aim \nnot just to increase energy security but also to improve national \nsecurity and economic security for our middle class.\n  One amendment I had hoped to be able to offer would approve \nconstruction of the Keystone Pipeline, which everyone knows will create \nthousands of jobs right away.\n  One amendment would expedite the export of American energy to our \nglobal allies, which would create more of the jobs we need right here \nin the United States.\n  One amendment would have prevented the administration from moving \nforward with its plans to impose a national carbon tax through the back \ndoor, even though Congress already rejected the idea several years ago \nand even though we know it would devastate an already suffering middle \nclass.\n  There is another amendment too, one I had planned to offer \npersonally, along with the junior Senator from Louisiana and the senior \nSenator from North Dakota. It would halt the administration from moving \nforward with new regulations on coal-fired powerplants until the \ntechnology required to comply with the regulations is commercially \nviable, which it currently is not.\n  The Obama administration's extreme regulations would hammer existing \ncoal facilities too, taking the ax to even more American coal jobs in \nthe midst of an awful economy. These coal regulations are especially \nunfair to the people of my State. We know they would hit Kentuckians \nwho are already suffering--constituents of mine who just want to put \nfood on the table and feed their families. Congress needs to do \nsomething to help. That is why I would have offered that amendment \ntoday.\n  I remind my colleagues that the amendment we had hoped to offer is \nalmost identical to legislation offered by the Democratic senior \nSenator from West Virginia that already passed the House of \nRepresentatives on a bipartisan basis. So there is no excuse not to \npass it here. We hope the Senator from West Virginia and his Democratic \ncolleagues will stand with us to do just that.\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  My friend talks about the left-leaning Senators. Three of the \nDemocratic Senators who sponsored this legislation could be called \nanything but leaning left: Landrieu, Manchin, and Warner. That brings a \nsmile to anyone's face.\n  It is a fiction that we haven't had votes to debate energy policy. We \nhave had trouble having bills because of the obstruction of the \nRepublicans. But we voted on the Keystone matter before we did the \nbudget debate where we had over 100 votes. That was last year. So we \ndebated Keystone last year, we had a vote on it, and we are willing to \nhave another vote on it.\n  It is my understanding we are now going to enter into debate on \nwhatever people want to talk about for the next hour, and I understand \nwe are going to have a series of votes at 3:45 p.m.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time postcloture on the \nmotion to proceed be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2763-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2014\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But for purposes of moving through this \nafternoon, I ask this consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the floor is Senator Shaheen from New \nHampshire. I have never had a Senator better prepared than she on any \nissue that we bring up, who is more concerned about her State, and has \nworked harder on an issue than she has worked on the issue now before \nthis body.\n  It is a shame that it appears my Republican counterpart has peeled \noff a couple of the cosponsors of this legislation, Republicans who \naren't going to vote to finish this bill. What a shame. It happens \nevery time we get to an issue which we are trying to move forward. It \nis the obstruction we have faced for going on 6 years. It is too bad. \nBut I commend Senator Shaheen for her diligence. And I hope, prior to \nthe final curtain call on Monday, we can work the next few days to try \nto come up with some way forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his very \nkind words on my efforts, along with Senator Portman's, on this \nlegislation. I certainly share the hope that we can come to some \nagreement on amendments that will allow us to move forward on the bill.\n  Can the Presiding Officer tell me the status of the procedure right \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in divided time until 3:45.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. So I will have about 10 minutes for remarks. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes.\n\n\n                            Shaheen-Portman\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nagain talk about the importance of this bipartisan Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act, also known as Shaheen-Portman.\n  This legislation makes sense for all kinds of reasons, but I want to \nstart with the fact that energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way \nto address this country's energy needs. The cheapest energy is energy \nwe never have to create. So if we can reduce our energy consumption, we \ncan save money.\n  Not only will this legislation create jobs, reduce pollution, and \nmake our country more energy secure, but it will also save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars a year through energy efficiency.\n  I would point to a study by the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy which shows in greater detail what this poster points \nout: This bill is going to create jobs, reduce pollution, and save \ntaxpayers billions of dollars.\n  The legislation has been endorsed by over 260 businesses, \norganizations, environmental groups, and labor unions. It has a broad \ncoalition of support. The legislation before us includes not just this \nbill as Senator Portman and I originally introduced it, but it includes \n10 bipartisan amendments which provide even more jobs, even more \nsavings, and even more reduction in pollution.\n  According to the study by experts at the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, by 2030 our legislation has the potential to \ncreate 192,000 jobs here in America--192,000 domestic jobs--to save \nconsumers and businesses $16 billion a year, and to reduce carbon \npollution by the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road.\n  We have a poster which lays this out very directly so people can see \nthe difference this legislation would make: By 2030, 192,000 new jobs, \nsave consumers $16.2 billion a year, and decrease carbon pollution by \nthe equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road. So those are the \nbenefits just by embracing energy efficiency. The legislation does this \nwithout any mandates, without increasing the deficit. In fact, all of \nthe authorizations in this bill are offset and we even see a $12 \nmillion deficit reduction, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. We are going to be able to do all of this without a major \ngovernment program, without increased government spending, without any \nmandates. The reason we are going to be able to do it is because there \nare opportunities that exist across all sectors of our economy to \nconserve energy and create good-paying, private sector jobs.\n\n  Shaheen-Portman addresses a number of opportunities to do this by \nreducing barriers to efficiency in the major energy-consuming sectors \nof the national economy. First is in the building sector. Buildings in \nthis country consume almost 40 percent of all of our energy use. It \nalso addresses the industrial sector that consumes more energy than any \nother sector in our domestic economy, and then it addresses the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Federal Government is the biggest user of energy in our country. \nAbout 93 percent of that energy is used by the military. This \nlegislation puts in place commonsense policies that deploy more \nefficient technologies and techniques. It has been endorsed by hundreds \nand hundreds of business coalitions, by environmental and efficiency \ngroups, by labor unions, and we have seen a number of letters of \nsupport just in the last couple of weeks for this legislation. I \nintroduced those into the Record yesterday.\n  One of the reasons we get the number of jobs, the amount of savings \nand benefits from pollution is because since we first introduced the \nbill last year we have added 10 bipartisan amendments that make this \nbill even better. Senator Portman and I have worked closely and \ncontinually with Senators from both sides of the aisle as well as \nstakeholders and industry advocates who want to improve the bill, and \nwe have incorporated their bipartisan, substantive amendments into the \ntext. Those amendments expand sections of the bill that address energy \nefficiency barriers in buildings, the manufacturing sector, the Federal \nGovernment, and also puts in place regulatory relief provisions to \nmaintain the underlying principle of advancing efficiency in the \nprivate sector.\n  The bill enjoys even more support from groups such as the Edison \nElectric Institute, the Business Roundtable, the American Gas \nAssociation, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe Painters and Allied Trades, and the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil. It is unusual to have energy legislation that enjoys such a \nbroad coalition of support from across many sectors.\n  As we heard just now on the floor, there is a difference of opinion \nabout how to move forward on both sides of the aisle. I am hopeful we \ncan come to an agreement, that we can agree there are amendments both \nsides would like to see added to the bill, so that even though we have \n10 more amendments in this legislation than when we first introduced \nit, there could still be an opportunity, I hope, for some additional \namendments to be added. That is what we are working on. I know \neverybody is acting in good faith to try to get that done. So I hope we \ncan maintain the bipartisan spirit of this bill as Senator Portman and \nthe Senate leadership and I work to see how we can come to an agreement \nthat moves this legislation forward.\n  I know there are others who would like to speak, and I hope to have \nan opportunity throughout the afternoon to add some more reasons why I \nthink we should support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time during the quorum \ncall be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I come to speak in support of the Shaheen-\nPortman bill, otherwise known as the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. As I like to put it, it\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nsaves money and saves energy. Keep it simple.\n  It comes at an important time, and it is no surprise that as someone \nfrom Alaska, I care about oil and gas issues, energy issues, energy \nefficiency. This is a bill that is important to talk about but also \nhopefully to pass and move to the House to take up.\n  Conservation makes sense. It saves money and makes people more \ncomfortable in their homes and workplaces and also is good for the \neconomy and environment. It is particularly important to Alaska.\n  Alaska's per capita energy costs are the highest in the Nation. We \nhave long and cold winters, limited infrastructure in rural parts of \nthe State, and we spend more on energy than anywhere else. So we have \nthe most to gain from energy efficiency improvements. In Alaska, energy \ncosts affect every aspect of life. Energy costs are driving people away \nfrom the traditional homes in rural Alaska. It is getting too expensive \nto heat even the smallest of homes. The cost of fuel to run your boat \nor snow machine for subsistence hunting and fishing is sky-high. In \nFairbanks, AK, filling your fuel tank to heat your home could easily \ncost you $1,900, and that may only last half of the winter. Electric \nheat isn't much better. Right now in Fairbanks electricity costs 19 \ncents per kilowatt, which is not a good alternative to heat your home. \nBundling all the costs of energy together puts a lot of pressure on the \npocketbook.\n  That is why I fought to get a permit to restart the Healy coal plant \nand make sure the existing coal plant at the University of Alaska, \nFairbanks, is exempt from EPA regulations. We need to stabilize energy \ncosts while making investments in energy efficiency; otherwise, \ncommunities such as Fairbanks will become unaffordable to live in.\n  For schools in Alaska, 75 percent of the energy costs goes into space \nheating. Money that is spent on heating and electricity is money they \ncannot spend in the classroom, making sure we have the best education \nfor our young people. As an example, the State of Alaska alone spends \n$62 million a year on energy, one-tenth of the State's operating \nbudget.\n  Our State provides energy to the rest of the Nation. Yet our \nresidents can't afford to live where they want to live or in many cases \nwhere their families have lived for generations. Energy efficiency can \nhave an immediate and profound effect on the lives of people in these \ncommunities.\n  The Shaheen-Portman bill is deficit neutral. It is estimated that by \n2030 it will save consumers $60 billion and create nearly 160,000 jobs, \na good sign after this month's jobs report of almost 280,000 jobs added \nto the private sector and to our economy.\n  I filed an amendment to provide a $5,000 tax credit toward the \npurchase of energy-efficient home heating and cooling appliances for \nfamilies living in very high energy consumption States; for example, \nconverting a home from expensive heating fuel to cleaner, more \nefficient natural gas or clean-burning woodstoves, even replacing \nappliances with newer and more energy-efficient models to cut back on \nelectric use and lower energy bills. For example, an ENERGY STAR \ncertified refrigerator uses 20 percent less energy than the current \nstandard and 40 percent less energy than the standard in 2001.\n  As many of my colleagues have expressed, it is disappointing that \nthis Senate takes so long to deal with a fairly modest bill. Let's be \nhonest. While it is all good policy, this is very modest legislation. \nCongress has not passed major energy legislation since 2007, and the \nenergy landscape has radically changed. The costs of renewable energy \nhave decreased drastically as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and \nbiomass resources have grown all across this country. A rational energy \npolicy for our Nation includes both renewable and nonrenewable energy \nresources.\n  Directional drilling, hydraulic fracturing has changed the \ntraditional energy production landscape too. Production is way up. \nAfter Saudi Arabia and Russia, the United States is traditionally the \nthird largest producer of crude. The final numbers are not in yet for \n2013, but it looks as though we are about to be No. 1 or very close to \nit. Yet we still rely too much on foreign oil.\n  The United States consumes about 19 billion barrels of oil per day. \nAll told, about 13 million barrels per day of our demand is supplied by \nU.S. products--crude, natural gas liquids, and ethanol. It still leaves \nanother 5 to 6 million barrels per day from other countries, many of \nwhom don't like us very much, and that is where Alaska comes in.\n  We can play a significant role by providing U.S. production and \ncreating some good jobs too. The potential is huge. The Trans-Alaska \nPipeline delivers 550,000 barrels a day, just over 10 percent of the \ndomestic oil production. That is down from a peak of 2 million barrels \na day 25 years ago, but there is a lot more oil and gas to go after.\n  Producers of oil and gas create incredibly high-paying jobs. The \naverage sector wage in Alaska is $117,000, and we can produce more \njobs.\n  After 20 years of stagnant growth, we started development in the \nArctic again with the Chukchi and Beaufort exploration wells in 2012. \nWe are making strides to return in the summer of 2015. Alaska can \nensure our energy security and economic prosperity through development \nof our domestic resources, thereby reducing our reliance on foreign \noil.\n  Our picture very clearly shows the volume of capacity in Alaska and \nwhere we fit in in the world, and this is just what we know about. If \nwe add Cook Inlet to it--let me give you the sense of the potential in \nthe Arctic. Chukchi has 15.4 billion barrels of oil and 77 trillion \ncubic feet of gas. Beaufort has 8.2 billion barrels of oil and 28 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas. NPR-A has 1 billion barrels of oil.\n  The issue of the NPR-A, which is the National Petroleum Reserve--this \narea has only had slight exploration over the years, and now we are \nstarting to develop in that area. We have now moved forward on the \nfirst well.\n  I was very pleased that one of my first acts, working with the \nadministration, was getting the administration to see the light of day \nand solving the problem with the first issue of the CD-5. Production at \nthe first well--one well, one development--is at 17,000 barrels a day. \nThe second one is right next door, which is called GMT-1, and will \nproduce another 30,000 or 40,000 barrels of oil a day. And, of course, \nthere is ANWR, which we estimate has around 10-plus billion barrels of \noil. Again, Alaska is a storehouse of energy, not only oil and gas, but \nmany others.\n  The point I want to make is that the oil and gas industry--the study \nthat was done in Alaska--can produce 54,000 jobs and has over 50 years \nworth of production in the Arctic. If you look at it from local and \nState and government revenues over the 50 years, it is well over $100 \nbillion, plus another $150 billion in payroll.\n  Another issue, which is important to Alaska, and also to this country \nis the liquefied natural gas export. A project can produce many jobs \nand create huge economic opportunity throughout this country. We \nestimate a project that will move gas off the North Slope, which will \nthen be distributed around the world, will be worth about $65 billion \nin development. There will be an 800-mile pipeline, liquefication \nplant, and marine terminal. It will be the largest and most expensive \nenergy project in North America. It will create up to 15,000 design and \nconstruction jobs, and up to 1,000 jobs during operation. LNG will have \nan export capacity of 2.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas sales \nto overseas buyers which can total more than $12 billion a year.\n  The steel pipe to construct that 800-mile pipeline, which is 42 \ninches in diameter--almost an inch thick--is so big that it will take a \nsingle pipe mill 2 years to produce that. This will only add to the \nimportant role the oil and gas industry plays in the national economy.\n  Nine percent of all the jobs in 2011 came from the oil and gas sector \nand 37,000 direct jobs were created nationwide. As I said earlier, they \nare good-paying jobs.\n  I have two or three more points to make before I close. As I talk \nabout oil and gas, it is not only important for Alaska's economy, it is \nalso an important part of the whole energy system in this country. We \nhave a huge amount of it. We are happy the Arctic is moving forward. \nAgain, this project was stalled for many years, but it is now moving in \nthe right direction.\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\n  The same was true for the NPR-A. It was stalled out for many years, \nbut now it is moving in the right direction.\n  Alaska is unique in many ways. This bill talks about energy \nconservation and what we can do to preserve the capacity of our energy \nuse. By 2025, Alaska will be at 50 percent renewable energy internal \nconsumption. We embrace conservation everywhere we can.\n  I can tell you from my own experience that not only is my home \nenergy-efficient, but the commercial buildings that I operate are also \nenergy-efficient. We have new boiler systems that are 98 percent more \nefficient. As a result, we are saving the tenants lots of money every \nyear. We installed new energy-efficient windows, and other elements, \nwhich have made those buildings more efficient, thereby saving them \nmoney and allowing us to put more money back into the complexes.\n  Even though this is not a comprehensive bill, it is a piece of \nlegislation that gets us to do some energy policy in this country down \nthe road.\n  The Presiding Officer lives on the east coast, and I live in Alaska, \nso we are far apart by thousands of miles, but we still have the same \nissues. Consumers want more efficient facilities and more efficient \nbuildings to lower their costs so they can save money and more energy \nso they can create new development--new economic development. That is \nwhat this bill does in many ways.\n  By creating conservation and creating more energy-efficient \nlegislation, such as this, we are creating jobs just by this act. I \nthink it is important that we look at this bill from a broad \nperspective and do what we can to make ourselves more dependent on our \nown energy sources, be they oil and gas or energy-efficient renewable \nenergy or energy-efficient projects. The more we are dependent on our \nown resources and less dependent on foreign oil, the better off we will \nbe from a national security perspective and from an economic \nperspective.\n  I will leave with one statistic. Because of all the work to become \nmore dependent on our own energy resources and more energy efficient, \nwe are sending $100 billion less overseas to foreign countries for \npetro oil over this last year.\n  I appreciate having a moment to talk on the floor. I am not only \ninterested in talking about Alaska's oil and gas, but also how we can \nimprove energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy. There is \nnothing that pits one against the other. It is all about the projects \nand working together.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are here today to discuss the energy \nefficiency bill and what may or may not be the status on any given \namendments. I want to take a few minutes this afternoon to speak about \nthe issue of liquefied natural gas exports.\n  Senator Barrasso has proposed a bill that would provide for fast-\ntrack status for DOE licensing to LNG projects to export to members of \nWTO countries.\n  As we focus on our opportunities that we have when it comes to our \nnatural gas, our LNG, and the opportunities for Federal support for \nenergy projects overseas, I think it is important to recognize there is \na little inconsistency going on with this administration slow-walking \ninfrastructure and hydrocarbon development in this country. I will give \na couple of examples. The Export-Import Bank has supported a slew of \nLNG-related transactions over the past couple of decades. These are \nstructured and project-financed transactions, these are loan \nguarantees, and some are even direct loans. With the assistance of the \nEx-Im Bank and my committee staff, the Congressional Research Service \nhas compiled a report on this subject which I would like to reference \nat this time.\n  I emphasize that this is a list for LNG-related projects only. * * \n* if not exhaustive of the other kinds of energy-related infrastructure \nthat the Federal Government finances overseas.\n\n  So what we have here are projects that are LNG-related transactions \nthat have been moved through the Export-Import Bank.\n  Over $350 million in loan guarantees for equipment and services went \nto Trinidad and Tobago in 1996. In 1997, we saw over $775 million in \nloan guarantees go to Qatar and Oman for engineering and management \nservices, for cryogenic heat exchanges, for compressors, and for gas \nturbine drives. In 2000 there was a loan guarantee of over $70 million \nthat went to Malaysia. In 2002 there was a $135 million loan guarantee \nfor equipment and services for Nigeria. Then between 2005 and 2006 we \nhad over $800 million in loan guarantees for liquefaction and \nfacilities-related engineering services to Qatar. In 2008 there was a \n$400 million direct loan for equipment and services to Peru; then in \n2010 $3 billion in direct loan and loan guarantees for equipment and \nservices to Papua New Guinea.\n  In 2012 there was nearly $3 billion in direct loans for engineering \nservices to Australia. There was a large project that included the \nliquefaction plant, a shipping terminal, and transmission lines. Then \njust last year there was another $1.8 billion in direct loans to \nAustralia for facilities construction.\n  There have been over a dozen projects, eight countries, and $10 \nbillion in financing.\n  I think it is important to recognize that the Export-Import Bank is \none of the few agencies in the Federal Government that actually turns a \nprofit, and my objective in listing these projects is not to oppose the \nfinancing--that is not what we are talking about--but, rather, to point \nout the inconsistency that we have in some policies. Simply put, we are \nfinancing LNG export projects overseas because they are a good idea. We \nlike that approach. But we are politicizing the project for their \nreview here at home.\n  If LNG projects can create wealth and can support jobs in Australia \nand in Qatar, they can and will do the same here in the United States \nof America.\n  But this administration is stalling on other infrastructure and \ndevelopment initiatives, not just LNG export facilities. We have the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. It is a great example. Offshore development is \nyet another example.\n  Another Federal agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, \nhas supported oil and gas projects in other countries.\n  I also reference for my colleagues this afternoon another CRS report \nthat was commissioned by my committee staff. So OPIC--this is not OPEC \nbut OPIC--has provided insurance and financing to companies operating \nin Indonesia, Guatemala, Egypt, and Botswana. The bigger list includes, \nback in 2002, $25 million of insurance for a liquefied petroleum gas \nstorage facility in Guatemala. In 2005, we had a $2.5 million insurance \nfor a natural gas pipeline in Benin; $2.5 million in insurance for a \ngas pipeline in Togo; $45 million in insurance for another pipeline in \nGhana; $320 million in insurance for an offshore natural gas pipeline \nin Israel.\n  Again, I am not saying that financing this is a wrong idea or a bad \nidea; I am asking the simple question: If this is good enough for \nhelping other countries, why are we not doing it here at home?\n  There is a third Federal agency I wish to briefly mention that has \nsupported energy-related projects overseas. This is the Trade and \nDevelopment Agency. It funds feasibility studies, pilot projects, \ntechnical assistance, reverse trade missions, and various training \nactivities. I reference for my colleagues a third CRS report, again \ncommissioned by my committee staff, that showcases some of these \nactivities.\n  Specifically, on LNG, the Trade and Development Agency funded \nfeasibility studies for: LNG import and power generation in Thailand \nback in 2004, CNG/LNG distribution in Indonesia in 2005, import \nterminals in Lithuania and Romania in 2008, floating LNG storage and \nregasification in Ghana in 2011, and reverse trade missions to Turkey \nin 2005 and South Africa in 2008 on LNG-related issues.\n  The Trade and Development Agency has also funded energy-related \ntechnical related assistance to Brazil, Colombia, Peru, India, Sri \nLanka, Jordan, Morocco, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Nigeria. They have \nfunded reverse trade missions with Cambodia, Vietnam, Iraq, Kazakhstan, \nTurkmenistan, Georgia, and Hungary.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  Again, helping other countries to develop their energy resources \nwhile helping American companies find opportunities to generate jobs \nhere in the United States is a worthwhile policy as well. It is a \nworthwhile policy abroad and a worthwhile policy at home.\n  I know my colleague from South Dakota wants to say a few words this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a moment I intend to propound a \nunanimous consent request that it be in order for me to offer my \namendment No. 3002 to S. 2262, but I will speak for just a moment if I \nmight about it.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we are here in the Senate with Senate \nDemocrats continuing to block Republican amendments that would approve \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline, stop the administration's war on affordable \nenergy, and expand liquid natural gas exports to our allies overseas.\n  My amendment No. 3002 is on the list of commonsense amendments that \nshould be voted on as part of the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency \nbill.\n  As with almost all of the President's energy policies, the EPA's \nanticipated ground level ozone regulations would do serious damage to \nour economy and to working Americans. In fact, this regulation is \nexpected to be the most expensive in the EPA's history.\n  In 2010 the EPA proposed lowering the permitted ground level ozone \nlevels from 75 parts per billion to 60 to 70 parts per billion. The \nenergy industry estimate suggests that lowering the ground level ozone \nconcentration to 60 parts per billion would cost businesses more than \n$1 trillion a year between 2020 and 2030--$1 trillion a year. Job \nlosses as a result of this measure would total a staggering $7.3 \nmillion by the year 2020, devastating entire industries, especially \nU.S. manufacturing industries.\n  Even by the EPA's own estimates--this is the EPA's own estimate--this \nregulation could cost up to $90 billion per year--far outpacing the \ncost of any EPA regulations we have ever seen before. My own State of \nSouth Dakota would lose tens of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, \nnatural resources, mining, and construction. In fact, the cost of this \nregulation is so great that when the EPA first proposed lower levels in \n2010, the White House delayed the regulation until after the \nPresident's reelection.\n  My amendment No. 3002 would stop the administration's upcoming \nproposal on ground level ozone which is anticipated to be proposed and \nput out by December of this year. It is a very straightforward \namendment. First, it would require the EPA to consider the cost and \nfeasibility of new ozone regulations. It might surprise many Americans \nto know that the EPA isn't even allowed to consider costs when setting \nthese new regulations. My amendment would fix that.\n  Additionally, my amendment would force the EPA to focus on the worst \nareas for smog before dramatically expanding this regulation to the \nrest of the country. There are 221 counties across 27 States in this \ncountry that don't meet the current standard of 75 parts per billion. \nThis chart shows the areas of the country and, as we can see, they are \nheavily populated, more urban areas of the country.\n  It makes sense to me that we ought to focus on these urban areas \nbefore expanding ozone regulations to areas such as western South \nDakota where we clearly don't have a smog problem. Under my amendment, \n85 percent of these counties would have to achieve full compliance with \nthe existing standard before the EPA could move forward with a lower \nlevel that dramatically expands the reach of ozone regulations.\n  So this is what it looks like today. These are the 200 some counties \nthat are not in compliance, and my amendment would require 85 percent \nof those to be in compliance before we could expand the map to where it \nwould look like this, referring to my chart. This is what the proposal \nwould do. Now, look at how much of the United States is covered by that \nexpanded map. The provision in the Clean Air Act was enacted in the \n1970s to address smog in downtown L.A., not background ozone levels in \nwestern South Dakota.\n  We should continue to focus on the worst areas for ground level ozone \nbefore dramatically expanding those regulations to rural areas of the \ncountry.\n  I hope the majority will stop blocking votes on this and other job-\ncreating amendments that are offered by Republican Members. Senator \nReid has blocked all but nine rollcall votes on Republican amendments \nsince last July. That is one a month. One Republican amendment, on \naverage, a month has been voted on here in the Senate over the last \nnine months. By contrast, the House Democrats--the minority in the \nHouse--have gotten votes on 125 amendments over the same period--12 \ntimes the number of amendments that have been allowed Republicans here \nin the Senate.\n  A number of my colleagues have been to the floor, and we heard from \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski. Senator Barrasso has an LNG \nexport amendment that I think is very relevant to this debate and very \nimportant to this country to both our energy security and national \nsecurity interests. I am going to continue to ask that the majority \nprovide a chance for Republicans to participate in this debate by \nallowing a vote on my amendment and the many others that are pertinent \nto the economy of this country, to creating jobs in this country, to \nproviding energy independence for this country, to providing energy \nsecurity for this country, and to making sure we don't get crazy \nregulations that subject areas of western South Dakota to smog \nregulations that were designed for downtown L.A. That is a fairly \nstraightforward, simple, commonsense suggestion, and it is what my \namendment would accomplish.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2262\n\n  So I see we have a Democratic Senator on the floor who would, I \nexpect, object to this request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer my \namendment No. 3002 to S. 2262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Mr. President. I regret that. I think it is \nunfortunate. I know there are many others of my colleagues on this side \nwho have amendments they would like to have votes on and to have an \nopportunity to debate. It is the first time we have debated an energy \nbill since 2007. It is of fundamental importance to this country on so \nmany levels.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this week members of both parties have \noffered a number of energy-related amendments to the pending bill. The \nminority leader has even said he is willing to limit the number of \namendments to five--five energy-related amendments--and the majority \nleader continues to say no.\n  I am not sure what the majority leader is afraid of in terms of \nallowing people to vote. People come to the Senate and they are \nexpected to speak up and tell people their positions on various issues.\n  One of the amendments I had hoped to offer today expedites liquefied \nnatural gas exports. The magazine The Economist recently published an \narticle with the headline: ``The petro-state of America: The energy \nboom is good for America and the world. It would be nice if Barack \nObama helped a bit.''\n  The article explains that the process for obtaining permits to export \nliquefied natural gas from the United States is insanely slow.\n  This isn't an exaggeration. In over 3\\1/2\\ years, the administration \nhas approved only seven applications to export LNG. The administration \nis sitting on 24 pending applications. Fourteen have been pending for \nmore than a year, and some have been pending for more than 2 years. \nThese administration delays are unacceptable. The excuses have run out.\n  We have introduced legislation. LNG exports are a critical component \nof stopping Russian aggression against our key allies and strategic \npartners. Nine of our NATO allies import 40 percent or more of their \nnatural gas from\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nRussia. Four of our NATO allies import 100 percent of their natural gas \nfrom Russia. These are our allies. Yet they are heavily dependent on \nRussia for their energy.\n  LNG exports would help our NATO allies as well as our strategic \npartners and allow them to free themselves from Russian energy. That is \nwhy our NATO allies are calling on us--on Congress--and the United \nStates to expedite these LNG exports. These will give our allies an \nalternative supplier of natural gas and enable them to resist Russia's \naggression.\n\n  It is going to be an added benefit for our country in terms of \ncreating thousands of good-paying jobs here in the United States. As \nthe Economist explained, LNG exports ``could generate tankerloads of \ncash'' for America. The exports will create jobs in gasfields in \nWyoming, steel mills in the Midwest, and at our Nation's ports.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2014--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Harkin, \nWarren, and Durbin for their leadership on the important issue of \nstudent debt. In the United States we all appreciate the value of \neducation. We know it leads to higher paying jobs, and we know it leads \nto better health and even longer lives. Education gives everyone in \nthis country a fair shot.\n  My grandpa never graduated from high school. He worked 1,500 feet \nunderground in the mines in Ely, MN. He\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nsaved money in a coffee can in the basement so he could send my dad to \ncollege. My dad went to a community 2-year college and then went on to \nthe University of Minnesota, where he earned his journalism degree. He \nwent from those hard-scrabble mines in Ely, MN, on to a journalism \ncareer where he got to interview everyone from Mike Ditka to Ronald \nReagan to Ginger Rogers. My mom taught second grade until she was 70 \nyears old. I still run into people who tell me what a great teacher she \nwas. And here I stand, a U.S. Senator, the granddaughter of an iron ore \nminer, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, and the first \nwoman elected to this job from my State. One thing I know for sure: It \nwould not have been possible without education. It would not have been \npossible without my parents, my grandparents, and my teachers, who \nbelieved in me and believed in the value of education.\n  I still remember getting into college. I still remember back then--\nand I graduated from high school in 1978--that it was $10,000 a year to \ngo to the college I went to. I remember my dad thinking: I can't afford \nthis. We went and met with the student loan and financial aid people. \nHe was wearing his brown polyester pants, and he had all these coins in \nhis pockets. Somehow we were able to get this done through loans and \nthrough his financing a good part of it. Back then, on a journalist's \nsalary and my mom's teacher salary, we were able to afford a college \nlike that. But now I see my daughter and I know how much it has changed \nand how expensive it is. Yet it is still so necessary.\n  Higher education doesn't just benefit individual students, it \nbenefits our entire economy by creating a more flexible, productive, \nand mobile workforce at a time when more jobs require some form of \npostsecondary education. In manufacturing now, more jobs require \npostsecondary education than not. We cannot allow cost to be a barrier \nto opportunity when we have job openings right now.\n  I see my friend the Senator from North Dakota, and I know they have \njob openings in North Dakota. We have job openings in Minnesota. We \nhave job openings that require skill, that require post-high school \nskills. Yet a lot of our kids can't afford to get those degrees.\n  Rising costs for education are putting a strain on families and \nstudents and making college seem out of reach for too many young \npeople. Many find themselves deeply in debt long before they set foot \nin the workplace.\n  This student debt hangs like an anchor around not just these students \nbut around our entire economy, and it is dragging us down. Graduates \nwith high debt may delay making key investments, such as saving for \nretirement or getting married or buying a home.\n  We had a hearing today in the Joint Economic Committee with Chairman \nYellen of the Federal Reserve, and she talked about the fact that while \nour economy is improving, housing is still flat. She talked about the \nfact that housing is flat because so many young people aren't forming \nhouseholds. They are not getting houses.\n  Student debt may impact a person's career choices by deterring \ngraduates from taking jobs in order to pursue jobs that allow them to \npay their debt. So we don't have people going into teaching.\n  According to the report I released as Senate chair of the Joint \nEconomic Committee, our State has one of the highest rates of student \ndebt in the country, with 71 percent of recent graduates in Minnesota \nhaving a loan debt compared to 66 percent nationally. The average debt \nload of student borrowers who graduated in 2011 in Minnesota is also \nmore than $3,000 higher than the national average. It is over $30,000 \nin our State compared to $27,000 nationally.\n  The good news is that there are things we can do. As you know, Mr. \nPresident, last summer we acted to prevent the interest rates on \nsubsidized Stafford loans from doubling. Yesterday we introduced the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act in the Senate. This \nbill would give student loan borrowers a fair shot at managing their \ndebt by offering them the opportunity to refinance their debt at the \nsame low rates offered to new borrowers in the student loan program.\n  Outstanding student loans now total more than $1.2 trillion. That \neven means something in Washington. It surpasses total credit card debt \nand affects 40 million Americans. That is why I am a cosponsor of the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act--because it is time we \ngave students a chance to refinance their loans and find better \nfinancial footing.\n  Education is the pathway to economic opportunity. Workers with higher \nlevels of education have experienced much faster wage growth and lower \nunemployment rates than other workers. But the increasing level of \nstudent debt in recent years presents challenges for graduates just \nbeginning their careers. These bright young people should be planning \nfor their futures, not struggling financially because they worked hard \nto earn their degrees.\n  Our country has come a long way since my grandpa saved that money in \na coffee can in his basement so he could send my dad to college. There \nare parents all over America who want to do the same thing, but the \nmoney they have to save right now couldn't fit in a coffee can. That is \nwhy we have to make it easier and not harder for our students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and pass this bill so \nstudents can manage their debt and build a better future for themselves \nand for their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2769-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2769-S2770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the first time since 2007 the \nSenate has taken up and considered an energy bill. I am pleased we are \nfinally discussing this important issue. I hope we will also take time \nto talk about our country's recent boom in oil and gas production.\n  In the years since our last energy debate in the Senate, the United \nStates has transitioned from a position of inordinate dependence on \nforeign energy sources to become one of the largest energy producers in \nthe world today. Much of this is the result of technological \ninnovation, and we must do everything possible to make it easier for \ndomestic companies to access, refine, and transport the oil and gas \nthat has become available with recent advances in technology.\n  In my view, energy efficiency and industrial competitiveness should \nnot be addressed without also addressing energy production. The two are \nnecessarily interrelated, and it makes no sense to treat each in \nisolation. But that isn't happening today. As a result, we are missing \na critical opportunity to have an important debate on how best to \ninvest our Nation's resources to support domestic energy production.\n  The bill we have been discussing establishes new programs promoting \nenergy efficiencies for buildings and manufacturing. It authorizes new \nspending for career skills and workforce training. But instead of \nsimply devoting additional resources to energy efficiency programs, we \nshould first understand the impact of existing energy sector programs \nadministered by the Federal Government and, most critically, have a \nserious conversation about broader energy policy.\n  If the Senate actually functioned the way it was designed and I was \ngiven the opportunity, I would have called up amendment No. 3015, which \nwould eliminate some of the duplication and overlap which has become so \nprevalent as the size and scope of the Federal Government continues to \nexpand.\n  Our Federal bureaucracy has grown to the point that government \nagencies are simply unaware many of the programs they administer are \nduplicated by similar--and sometimes nearly identical--programs \nadministered in other Federal agencies.\n  The Federal Leviathan has become so large and complex that the left \nhand literally doesn't know what the right hand is doing, especially \nwhen it comes to spending taxpayer moneys. This is simply unacceptable.\n  Our national government has grown so unwieldy that coordination \nbetween its individual parts cannot be assumed and often must instead \nbe mandated. This phenomenon is certainly the case with many of the \nprograms that would receive funding if this bill was enacted as \ncurrently written.\n  Currently, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, and \nthe Department of Energy each administer\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nprograms that fund training and education targeted specifically at the \nenergy sector. I am sure the Federal bureaucrats in each of these three \nagencies are trying to do as best they can. But it can't possibly be \nnecessary or, for that matter, wise for all three agencies to be doing \nthe same thing.\n  The obvious solution is for the Department of Energy to ensure there \nare no federally funded programs with the same stated objectives as the \nprograms they are already administering.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to coordinate with the \nSecretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education prior to issuing any \ncareer skills and workforce training funding opportunity announcements \nto ensure that these three departments are not issuing redundant and \noverlapping grants.\n  We cannot keep spending more taxpayer dollars in the same inefficient \nways. Energy efficiency is important, but far more important is our \nNation's overall energy policy. We should be discussing energy \nefficiency only as part of that critical debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the debate which \nhas gone on the last 2 days on this floor about two very important \nissues related to a stronger energy policy for America.\n  As I said earlier in the week, and I was proven to be correct, it is \nunlikely we would develop an energy policy in the next 4 days in open \ndebate on the floor of the Senate. Lots of people came down and talked \nabout things they thought should be in it. Many of those things I agree \nwith, but there is a process we go through, and we are working \nthrough--not as quickly as some people would like, but we are making a \nlot of progress.\n  Right now on the floor of the Senate are two very important pillars \nor two very important cornerstones or two very important first steps \nwhich could be taken in the building of a stronger, more vibrant, more \ncommonsense, more middle-class-friendly, more job-creating energy \npolicy than the one we have right now.\n  The saddest thing about watching this debate or speeches which sort \nof parade as if it is a debate, but it is not really--pretend that it \nis a debate but it is not--the speeches we have heard are not outlining \nthe truth to the American public about what is going on.\n  We have the opportunity the next time the Senate gathers early next \nweek to have a cloture vote on an energy efficiency bill. That means \nbring debate to an end and vote on an energy efficiency bill which will \ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, supported by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Chemistry Council, and the Environmental Defense \nFund. Hundreds of organizations have come together across the political \nspectrum looking here for common sense and cooperation, and they are \nnot finding much of either.\n  These coalitions have spent an enormous amount of time lobbying \nMembers of the House and the Senate to pass an efficiency bill led by \nSenator Shaheen and Senator Portman, two very respected Members of this \nbody--one Republican with strong conservative credentials, one Democrat \nwith strong progressive credentials but both demonstrating in their \ncareer the ability to work together and find common ground, exactly \nwhat the American public is asking for. We can ask any Republican, any \nDemocrat, any Independent, and they say: Can't you all work together \nand find a way forward?\n  So Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen did. They brought a bill to \ncommittee. I wasn't the chair. I can't take credit for this. Ron Wyden \nis the chair and Lisa Murkowski is the ranking member. They can take \ncredit for this. They came up with a fantastic bill which creates jobs, \nsaves a lot of energy, and is our best source of energy through \nefficiency. It creates jobs right here in America. It is the cleanest \nenergy we can produce.\n  So these two terrific Senators come and bring us a bill. It is \ndebated in public, in committee, and amazingly comes out of committee I \nthink on a vote of 19 to 3, a very important piece of building an \nenergy policy.\n  Even as chair of this committee now--and I hope to remain chair for \nmany years to come. There is an election between that and that \naspirational goal, so we shall see. I would like to remain chair. But I \ncan promise it is not going to be one bill which comes out of the \nenergy committee that builds an energy policy.\n  First of all, part of the bills have to come out of the Finance \nCommittee. They are about tax policy related to the generation of all \nsorts of different kinds of electricity not even in my jurisdiction. \nThere are some issues that have to come out of the commerce committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction and authorization over pipelines. There are \nother committees that are going to have to contribute to strengthening \nand building an energy policy where America can be independent and \nsecure, where we can have partnerships with Canada and Mexico, \nproducing the cleanest fuels possible and generating electricity in the \ncleanest way possible, abundantly and affordably and reliably for our \npeople, that will make manufacturing soar in this Nation, that will \ngive opportunities for more domestic drilling both onshore and \noffshore.\n  The people I represent want this so badly, and they know it can \nhappen. I am not sure why more Senators don't understand this can \nhappen, but it is going to take cooperation. It is going to take a \nlittle give-and-take. I guess that is too much to ask and that is so \nsad. I guess it is too much to ask for a little cooperation and a \nlittle give-and-take.\n  So this energy efficiency bill comes to the floor, and it is held up \nbecause many Members want other pieces of the energy plan. They most \ncertainly have good ideas. Most certainly there are good ideas out \nthere on both sides of the aisle, but there is one idea that is very \npowerful. To say how powerful it is, I am not going to read my words \nabout it. I have already spoken about it is time to build the Keystone \nPipeline now. It is time to stop studying now.\n  I respect the President's review of the situation. I disagree with \nthe length of time he has taken and with the decision he made last week \nto continue to study. I have said respectfully to him: Mr. President, \nthe time for studying is over. The time for building is now. The \nprocess has run its course over 5 years, five studies. Every one of \nthem has come down on the side of building it for jobs, for security, \nand it is better for the environment to transport this product, these \noil sands, from one of our best friends, Canada, by pipeline than by \neither rail or truck.\n  Everyone in this country knows how dangerous and crowded the highways \nand railways are. One does not need to serve on the transportation \ncommittee of the Senate or House to understand that issue. Every \nmother, every father, every 17-year-old with a driver's license--in our \nState it is 16, and maybe in some States it is 20--understands how \nscary it is to drive on highways with big trucks filled with, \nunfortunately, sometimes dangerous things.\n  Why would we want this for our children? Why can't we add to the 2.9 \nmillion miles of pipeline we have and build a pipeline with Canada? We \nare not talking about building a pipeline with Cuba or Venezuela. We \nare talking about Canada--our best ally, our greatest trading partner, \nand our partner on the frontlines of wars, in the research labs we \npartner with them--to build a pipeline to safely move oil they are \ngoing to produce one way or another because they need it for their \neconomy and the world needs it. They have the highest environmental \nstandards in the world.\n  Our highways are crowded. Our trains are crowded. Trains are \ncolliding all over the country. Every morning in some section of the \ncountry there is another train that has run off the track with horrible \nmaterials being spilled into waters and rivers. I think Democrats are \nupset about that, Republicans are upset about it.\n  There is one very big idea, very big amendment to the efficiency bill \nI think the Republicans would truly like; that is, to have a vote on \nthe Keystone Pipeline. As the chair of the committee, I know that is \ntheir strong feeling. I am a supporter of the Keystone Pipeline. So I \nthink to myself: Let's see if we could maybe make this work.\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n  The Republican leadership has been saying for months they want a \nvote--not a resolution, not a sense of the Senate, which we have \nalready had, but a straight up-or-down vote on a directive to build the \npipeline.\n  So I think to myself: This seems to be fair, a little give-and-take. \nDemocrats aren't happy--not everybody--with the Keystone Pipeline, not \nall Republicans are happy with the efficiency, but the business \ncommunity is broadly supportive of both and so are labor unions. So we \nhave labor unions, the business community, and the environmental \ncommunity which is strongly in favor of efficiency.\n  Of course many of the strongest voices are not for Keystone and I \nunderstand that. We have a different view. I respectfully disagree with \ntheir position, but this is a big country. It is a democracy, and we \nrepresent that democracy right here at these desks.\n  So I think to myself in my Louisiana way: Maybe if every side gives a \nlittle bit, we could get two very important things done, when nothing \nmuch is getting done in the energy sector, which is what we need to \nmove our economy forward, to get labor unions working, to get people \nwho aren't in labor unions working, to create jobs--hundreds of \nthousands, millions of jobs. Everybody is talking about that in their \ncampaigns.\n  It is upsetting to me to know how many people are running for \nreelection in this Chamber who go home and talk about jobs and then \nturn around and come here and vote no. They talk about jobs at home and \nvote no in the U.S. Senate--no for efficiency jobs, no for the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  It is very interesting. I am going to read what some of the \nRepublican leaders have said about Keystone. Maybe they have changed \ntheir minds since they have said these, and over the weekend maybe the \npress could ask them if they have had a change of heart.\n  Senator Wicker said on January 25, 2013:\n\n       Many Americans understand the economic importance of moving \n     forward with the Keystone pipeline and what that means for \n     job creation and energy security in the United States. It is \n     imperative that we continue to press the Administration to \n     approve this critical project.\n\n  So next week on Monday or Tuesday, my friend, the Senator from \nMississippi, is going to have an opportunity to vote to press the \nPresident on Keystone and to vote for a bill that he is a cosponsor \nof--the energy efficiency bill. Again, he is going to have a chance to \npress the President of the United States to build the Keystone \nPipeline, using all the power he has as a Senator from the State of \nMississippi to do that, and to vote on the energy efficiency bill. I \nhope he will follow his words and his promise.\n\n  Senator Chambliss and Senator Isakson, in a letter to President Obama \non February 11, 2014, said:\n\n       By any reasonable standard, the Keystone Pipeline is \n     clearly in our national interest. Keystone will greatly \n     advance our energy security interests by establishing a \n     reliable supply of oil from one of the most stable trading \n     partners and closest friends, and will lead to economic \n     growth and help create good jobs, sustainable jobs for U.S. \n     workers.\n\n  I would like to add my name to this. They might not want me to, but I \nwould like to add my name so it would say that Senator Isakson, Senator \nChambliss, and Senator Landrieu believe in this. I couldn't have said \nit better myself.\n  So I wonder what they will do next week when we have a chance to vote \non the efficiency bill and on the pipeline.\n  Senator Cornyn, the minority whip, on May 7, said:\n\n       It might be better to build this pipeline so we could \n     safely transport oil from Canada down to refineries in my \n     State where it can be converted to gasoline, aviation fuel \n     and the like, and the process will create an awful lot of \n     jobs.\n\n  May 7 floor statement from Senator Cornyn.\n  This pipeline connects to refineries in Texas. So I wonder, the \nSenators from Texas--Senator Cruz, Senator Cornyn--are you going to \nvote for an up-or-down vote on Keystone and vote on the efficiency \nbill? You can vote no, you can vote yes on the efficiency bill. Energy \nefficiency may not be important to people in Texas. The chambers of \ncommerce in Texas may not have a position. I think they are very \nsupportive, from what I have looked at, and the national chamber of \ncommerce is on board. Maybe that is not important to them, but I think \nit is.\n  I spend a lot of time in Texas. It is a neighboring State. They have \na big economy. I do a lot of work for their coastal restoration. People \ntell me that even though jobs are plentiful in Texas, thank goodness--\nnot in every community but in many communities and in Louisiana--we can \nalways use more. Building and construction jobs are local in nature, \nputting our architects and engineers to work. The engineers were in my \noffice last week saying: Senator Landrieu, some of our engineers are \nbusy, but some of them aren't, and we could put a lot of engineers to \nwork on this energy efficiency bill.\n  So if Senator Cornyn wants to actually build the pipeline and press \nthe President to build it, he is going to have a chance to vote up or \ndown on whether he wants to do that, and the opportunity is to do it in \nconjunction with an up-or-down vote on an energy efficiency bill. \nDemocrats get a little bit of what they want, Republicans get a little \nbit of what they want, and what the country gets is cooperation and a \nchance for jobs, which is all they want, really--good jobs.\n  Senator Inhofe:\n\n       President Obama and the administration no longer have a \n     valid reason to stall the final stages of the pipeline. \n     Approving the Keystone Pipeline is one thing the President \n     can do today with his pen that will create thousands of jobs.\n\n  The President said he is not going to do it. The question is, Will \nSenator Inhofe join with enough of us to pass a bill that presses him \nto do it? I think if we could get the vote on the floor, we might be \nable to get our 60 votes. I have never said we were guaranteed--there \nis no guarantee, but we are very close. We have 11 Democratic \ncosponsors, including myself, on a bill with 45 Republicans. We are \njust three or four short. I think that would be defined as \n``pressing.''\n  Senator Burr said this in January 2012:\n\n       Today I join 43 other Senators in introducing a bill to \n     continue construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project \n     that will take great steps towards improving our energy \n     security as well as create jobs for thousands of American \n     workers. Despite claims that promoting energy security and \n     creating jobs are top priorities, President Obama has \n     rejected the permit earlier this month.\n\n  Senator McConnell said:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline--a good example of something that \n     would create jobs for the American people.\n\n  As Senator McConnell knows, there might be quite a few people from \nKentucky who are out of work who could travel not too far. It is better \nto work at home and be with your family and kids--I understand that--\nbut lots of times people have to travel distances to work. Sometimes \npeople want to travel those distances because the jobs available to \nthem at home are minimum wage, and if they travel and get out, they can \nmake handsome sums--working tough hours and long hours, but people have \nbeen doing it for decades. I know there are people in Kentucky who \nwould like jobs. So I am hoping that next week when Senator McConnell \nhas some time to think through this as the minority leader, he can come \nto the floor and say: You know what, this isn't such a bad deal after \nall.\n  Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have presented a bill that is \nsupported by the Chamber of Commerce and the Environmental Defense Fund \nand so many business organizations that depend on me and Senator Reid \nto help them create private sector jobs in America.\n  This isn't a government program. This is creating private sector \nhigh-paying jobs, saving energy. We have been working on it for 5 \nyears. This is not a new idea. This is not something Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Portman are doing in an election year.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for her great leadership. She started working \non this when she was Governor, before she even got to the Senate of the \nUnited States. She is an expert on energy efficiency. I can remember \nwhen former-President Clinton came to our caucus several years ago. \nSenator Shaheen was one of the first to stand up and ask him several \nimportant and very timely questions and say: Mr. President, you have \ngiven us a way forward here on a piece of energy legislation that I \nthink both Republicans and\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nDemocrats can support. I am looking forward to leading it.\n  This was years ago. This isn't an election-year ploy; this is a half \na decade of work.\n  So my question to my Republican friends is, Do you want to build the \nKeystone Pipeline or do you want an issue to talk about? Because it \nseems to me that we can get a vote on the efficiency bill and on the \nKeystone Pipeline, so we actually are doing what you all say you want \nto do, which is to press the President.\n  That is all our power is. I know it is hard for people to realize \nthis, but our powers are limited by the Constitution. We are Senators; \nwe are not Presidents. We have equal power to the Presidency, not more \nand not less. So while some people might want to run around and \nconvince people in their hometowns that they have more power than the \nPresident, they do not. They have equal power. So let's exercise it. \nLet's press, which is what our job is--pressing the administration. \nSometimes administrations don't want to do what Congress does, so \nCongress presses forward. But we don't want to press, I don't think. I \nthink they want to talk or have an issue to talk about.\n  I would like to have a vote. I would like to separate the wheat from \nthe chaff, clear the fog. This is not complicated at all.\n  You have heard a lot about amendments, amendments, amendments. There \nis one thing that is more important than all the amendments--more \nimportant than Senator Vitter's amendment, Senator Barrasso's \namendment, more important than any amendments on our side--that is, are \nwe going to vote to build the Keystone Pipeline? Right now, 70 percent \nof the people of the United States support building the pipeline. Right \nnow, the studies have been completed. Right now, the evidence is in.\n  I know there are people on this floor who disagree, and I want to be \nas respectful as I can. There is no one on the floor here debating this \nnow, but if you did come, I would most certainly appreciate you talking \nabout it if you are opposed. I know there are people who still feel as \nif Keystone is not the right thing to do, but the evidence is in on \nthat, and we should build it. It is important to secure America's \ndomestic production. It is important for America to not rely on \noutsiders--particularly those who aren't our friends--for the energy we \nneed to keep our economy growing and strong.\n  It is very disheartening for me to read the headlines every day--and \nI know from my constituents that it is for them, too--and see what is \ngoing on in Ukraine and watch Europe not being able to be as strong as \nI know Europe wants to be. I know they want to be stronger, but because \nthey depend so much on Russia for their gas and they are not energy \nindependent, they have to be careful about what they do to come to the \nUkraine's aid. Anybody can understand that. It doesn't take a diplomat \nto explain what is going on.\n  Does America ever want to be too weak to stand up to Russia? I don't \nthink so. Does America ever want to be too weak to stand up to China? \nNo. Do we ever want to be too weak to stand up to India if we have to, \nor Venezuela? No. So build the pipeline. We have already built 2.9 \nmillion miles of pipe. I have 9,000 miles of pipeline in Louisiana. We \nhave been building them a long time. Yes, sometimes they have not been \nlaid correctly. Yes, Federal agencies and State agencies have failed \nthe people in many instances in making sure the environment was as \nprotected as it should be. But we know how to build energy \ninfrastructure. And I will tell you that the people of Louisiana would \nmuch rather build infrastructure than put uniforms on our sons and \ndaughters and send them halfway around the world so we can get gasoline \nin our cars.\n  Let me put it plainly. I lost 44 men in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gone. I \nhave hundreds of wounded soldiers. When you ask me what the price is--\nbuild the Keystone Pipeline or continue to have wars over oil--I don't \nknow, it is pretty easy for me.\n  I am not going to let people come down to the floor here and get away \nwith talking about these amendments because it is not about amendments. \nIt is not about process. It is about whether this Senate wants to press \nthis legislation. Press. That is all we can do. We can't make the \nPresident do anything unless we can override the veto if he vetoes it, \nand that has happened before--not often, but it has happened--but that \nis what the Constitution says.\n  So let's take it one step at a time. Let's press on to build the \npipeline, get an up-or-down vote. Let's move forward on an energy \nefficiency bill that the House has actually, amazingly, passed a good \nversion of. Think about it. Not only has a Democratic-controlled Senate \npassed an efficiency bill with seven Republican cosponsors and at least \na dozen more who I know would vote for the bill if allowed to by their \nleader, Mr. McConnell, but the Republican-controlled House has already \npassed an energy efficiency bill. So we would just go to conference \nwith these two bills and work out the details, and all of these \norganizations that have lobbied and spent money and time to try to \nexplain this to us--``Please, can you all help us create jobs we need \nright here at home? We would be so happy and encouraged that the \nDemocratic process is working''--showing them that we are hearing them \nand listening to them would be a really terrific step forward.\n  Finally, you will hear some Republican leaders say: Well, Senator, \nthat sounds great, but you have to deliver us 60 votes for Keystone.\n  No, I never said I could deliver 60 votes for Keystone. I said I \nwould try to deliver 60 votes. That is all I can do.\n  I said I would try, and I have tried my best. We had three Democrats \nlast year. We now have 11 Democrats. I am not doing this by myself. \nSenator Heitkamp has been extraordinarily helpful, Senator McCaskill \nhas been wonderful, and Senator Tester has been helping, as has Senator \nDonnelly. So many of our colleagues have been working very hard over \nhere. We are so close. It is not about amendments, it is about \nKeystone. That is the amendment, Keystone.\n  If we can have a separate vote on Keystone and a separate vote on \nenergy efficiency, we can press the House to act and get those two \nmatters, hopefully, to the President's desk. That is the best we can \ndo. What the President decides to do after that, I don't know. He has a \nresponsibility, and we have a responsibility. He will exercise it as he \nsees fit, but we need to do our job. We can't worry about doing his \njob. He needs to do his job.\n  It is time to build the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I will submit for the Record the dozens of comments made by my \nRepublican friends about how important it is to build the pipeline. \nThey didn't say: Let's build the pipeline and also pass three other \nimportant pieces of legislation. They didn't say: Let's build the \npipeline, but we don't really want to build the pipeline until we can \nget votes on X, Y, and Z. They said the most important thing we can \ndo--and 70 percent of the American public supports it, and it is \ngrowing every day--is to build this pipeline. Labor and business \nsupport it. A broad range of people supports it, with the exception of \nNebraska, which has not made its final decision. Our law allows for \nNebraska courts to make the final decision about where that pipeline \nwill be laid because the people of Nebraska did not want it laid in one \nof the largest water aquifers in North America, so they moved the line, \nwhich is appropriate, and so that is being worked out. Other than that, \nwe are ready to go.\n  I particularly hope the people of Kentucky will ask Senator Mitch \nMcConnell if he is ready to build the Keystone Pipeline and if he is \nready to vote to press the President to build the Keystone Pipeline, \nwhich is within the limits of our power. Our powers are limited, but we \ncould exercise them to the fullest. I hope we will do that, and I hope \nnext week we will get a straight-up vote on the efficiency bill Senator \nPortman and Senator Shaheen have worked so hard on that is supported by \na broad range of coalition members, and I hope that coalition will \ngenerate and get its members activated between now and Tuesday.\n  I hope those in America who want to build this Keystone Pipeline will \nalso activate their phones, their emails, and contact their \nlegislators, particularly our two leaders Harry Reid and Mitch \nMcConnell, who will ultimately be responsible for whether these votes \noccur.\n  All we can do is do our best. I think I have demonstrated a real \neffort to get\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nthis done, and I thank my colleagues over here who have been \nextraordinarily helpful. We hope we can find common sense, common \nground, and do what the Senate of the United States can do, press \nforward to create jobs for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2773-S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 66th consecutive \nweek the Senate has been in session to ask my colleagues to wake up to \nthe threat of climate change. The topic has become taboo for \nRepublicans in Congress, and so the discussion on climate change is \nsomewhat one-sided around here, but the recent comprehensive National \nClimate Assessment released this week shows Americans are witnessing \nthe effects of climate change in every State of our Nation.\n  Colleagues, read the assessment. Find out how climate change is \naffecting every region of the country.\n  In March I visited Iowa, where I heard over and over that Iowans are \nawake to the threat of climate change and are actually ready to hold \nPresidential candidates accountable on climate when they go there for \nthe first-in-the-Nation Presidential caucus.\n  Over the April recess I spent 5 days traveling down the southeastern \ncoast of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. I went \nthere to talk to people on that coast firsthand. I met with scientists, \nstudents, outdoorsmen, faith leaders, and State and local officials--\npeople of diverse backgrounds, but all of them have one thing in \ncommon: their concern for the coastal communities they love. These \nfolks know climate change is real because they see it where they live. \nThey are not waiting around for this Chamber to get organized. They are \nacting.\n  Last week I spoke here about the business owners, community leaders, \nand researchers I met in North Carolina. From there I headed into South \nCarolina. My first stop was the University of South Carolina's Baruch \nInstitute for Marine and Coastal Sciences.\n  At the Baruch Institute, I learned how salt marshes--the ocean's \nnurseries and our first line of defense against storms and hurricanes--\nhave to adapt to rising sea levels. These marshes retain sediment as \nthe tide goes in and out, and they slowly increase their elevation as \nthe sea level rises, if given enough time.\n  Dr. Jim Morris, director of the Baruch Institute, has been studying \nthese marshes for decades. He is a renowned expert. He explained that \nsea level rise is starting to happen so fast that the marshes may not \nkeep up. If they can't keep up, then the marsh deteriorates to mudflat, \nand the mudflat deteriorates to open water, which is already happening \nin places I visited. That deterioration from marsh to mudflat can \ndevastate coastal property, infrastructure, and wildlife.\n  Business as usual means sea level rise increases of 3 feet or more by \n2100. This chart illustrates what the Baruch Marine Institute and \nsurrounding marshes would look like after this sea level change--before \nand after. It would be pretty much a goner.\n  Next I visited the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, which \nextends for 22 miles and encompasses more than 6,000 acres of barrier \nislands, salt marshes, intricate coastal waterways, sandy beaches, \nfresh and brackish water impoundments, and maritime forest. Sea level \nrise threatens this area as well.\n  One signal: Last year over 70 percent of endangered loggerhead turtle \nnests had to be relocated by people in order to prevent them from being \nflooded. This is a place where these turtles have been nesting for \ncenturies, but now look at how coastal erosion is affecting their \nnests. These are the turtle eggs, and the coast has eroded. National \nPark Service officials there told me:\n\n       This is not just about wildlife. This is about the \n     community. It's about your livelihood and well-being.\n\n  They are right.\n  According to a foreword in the report titled ``Climate Change Impacts \nto Natural Resources in South Carolina'' by Alvin Taylor, director of \nthe South Carolina Department of Natural Resources--I mean, tell me how \npeople from South Carolina are denying climate change is real when the \nState published a report called ``Climate Change Impacts to Natural \nResources in South Carolina.''\n  Here is what the report says:\n\n       Climate-related changes may adversely affect the \n     environment in many ways, potentially disrupting or damaging \n     ecological services, water supply, agriculture, forestry, \n     fish and wildlife species, endangered species, and commercial \n     and recreational fishing . . . Fishing, hunting, and wildlife \n     viewing contributes almost $2.2 billion annually to South \n     Carolina's economy and supports nearly 59,000 jobs.\n\n  How can they pretend it is not real? Business owners and executives \nin South Carolina are starting to take action on climate change. There \nis a South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, headed by Frank \nKnapp, who has organized something called the South Carolina Businesses \nActing on Rising Seas to raise awareness among businesses and their \ncustomers of the threat posed to the Palmetto State. In cities \nincluding Charleston and Myrtle Beach, coastal businesses threatened by \nrising sea levels are displaying strips of blue tape in their window \nfronts where the water level would be to show their support for taking \naction.\n  I continued down the coast and visited Charleston's Fort Johnson, \nwhere marine research facilities are located for NOAA, the College of \nCharleston, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and the \nMedical University of South Carolina. The tide gauges in Charleston are \nup over 10 inches since the early 1920s. Deny that all you want. It is \na measurement, it is not a theory.\n  This chart shows what Fort Johnson would look like with 3 feet of sea \nlevel rise, which is projected for 2100. Nearly all the research \nfacilities at Fort Johnson would be lost ironically to the very seas \ntheir research helps us understand. Three feet could actually be on the \nlow end of sea level rise by 2100. This chart of Fort Johnson \ndemonstrates what 3 feet of sea level rise looks like.\n  During my visit at Fort Johnson, I heard from students, faculty, \nelected officials, and Federal and State employees all working at the \nleading edge of climate change and adaptation research. One scientist, \nDr. Peter Moeller, described how climate change is allowing algae \nspecies to grow in waters where they were previously not found. As \nthese algae species migrate to new areas, they encounter bacteria, \nfungi, and other unfamiliar algae. As Dr. Moeller explained to me, \nunder these conditions, previously nontoxic algae can make dangerous \ntoxins that are novel to science and nature. It almost sounds as if \nscience fiction, but these are the consequences of human-caused climate \nchange.\n  My last stop in South Carolina was at a roundtable discussion at the \nCoastal Conservation League. There I heard from a diverse group of \nSouth Carolinians--researchers, environmental advocates, business \nowners, and faith leaders--about their efforts to raise awareness to \nthe threats of climate change and to promote clean energy. I learned \nthis: South Carolinians are not afraid to talk about climate change and \nhow it is affecting their State--at least not until they get to \nWashington.\n  When WCBD-TV in Charleston asked Representative Mark Sanford about my \nvisit to his State, he actually said something quite nice. He said:\n\n       At our family farm in Beaufort, I've watched over the last \n     50 years as sea levels have risen and affected salt edges of \n     the farm. I applaud Senator Whitehouse for getting people \n     together in the Lowcountry today to discuss this problem, and \n     while we would likely approach solutions differently, \n     building the conversation is a necessary first step.\n\n  That is a helpful opening, and I appreciate that.\n  Jim Gandy, chief meteorologist for WLTX Columbia, has been \nforecasting South Carolina weather for 28 years. He is affectionately \nknown as South Carolina's weatherman. Jim was at the White House this \nweek to interview President Obama about the National\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nClimate Assessment. Through his blog, ``Weather and Climate Matter,'' \nand his broadcasts, Jim makes weather and climate understandable for \nhis viewers. I spoke with him while I was in South Carolina, and I \nlearned that his TV station thought it may actually take some heat for \nJim's discussing climate change on the air, and they were braced for \nthe flow back. It never came. South Carolinians have their eyes open. \nIt is only taboo here in Washington.\n\n  I continued down into Georgia, to the heart of the Savannah Historic \nDistrict. Audrey Platt, the former vice-chair of the Garden Club of \nAmerica's Conservation Committee, invited me to her historic home in \nSavannah for a local meeting of the Garden Club joined by Savannah \nMayor Edna Jackson. Also there was Reverend Mary Beene from the Faith \nPresbyterian Church who talked about the M.K. Pentecost Ecology Fund \nthey run for ecological stewardship of natural resources.\n  We headed out to Fort Pulaski and Tybee Island. There is a tide gauge \nat Fort Pulaski. It takes measurements. It is not complicated. It \nproduces clear, irrefutable facts, not theories. At Fort Pulaski, NOAA \nmeasures that sea level has risen over eight inches. Projections for \n2100 put most of this region under water. This chart shows that sea \nlevel rise of 3 feet will devastate the area.\n  Here is Fort Pulaski, GA, and the coast around it. That is what is \nleft with 3 feet of sea level rise.\n  On Tybee Island I had lunch with city officials and council members, \nrepresentatives of the Georgia conservancy, NOAA scientists, Georgia \nGarden Club members, and local sustainability directors. The message \nwas clear: Sea level is rising. Oceans are warming. Infrastructure and \necosystems that Georgians depend on are being threatened. One example: \nAccording to a University of Georgia biologist, sea level rise will \naffect the State's oyster crop. The oysters in Georgia thrive at the \ntidal edge, sometimes above water, sometimes below water, as the tide \ngoes up and down. As rising sea levels come up, it will cause the \noyster habitat to shift or leave them vulnerable to predation as they \nspend more time under water. Being out of the water actually protects \nthem from underwater predators.\n  The people of Tybee Island are preparing. Councilman Paul Wolff \nshowed me the storm-water tide gate, which the City of Tybee put in \nplace to accommodate higher tides and rising seas. He explained to me \nthat the road out to Tybee Island--Tybee Road--which is, by the way, \nthe island's only access road, will be flooded as much as 45 times per \nyear with just one foot of sea level rise, and the city has already put \nin place a short-term plan for 14 to 20 inches of sea level rise by \n2060. What does that do to an island's economy if, 45 days of the year, \npeople can't get there?\n  Down the coast, I visited the University of Georgia's Marine \nInstitute at Sapelo Island and its director Dr. Merryl Alber. Sapelo is \na barrier island off the coast of Georgia managed by the Georgia \nDepartment of Natural Resources. The Marine Institute is a world \nrenowned field station for research into coastal ecosystems. Here I \nlearned how they measure what they call blue carbon, the amount of \ncarbon stored in the salt marsh. They are doing that as part of the \nNational Science Foundation's long-term ecological research program.\n  Salt marsh, as it turns out, are huge carbon sinks. They absorb \nmassive amounts of carbon. But the carbon that is stored there may be \nreturned to the atmosphere and add to the climate problem if salt \nmarshes succumb to sea level rise and have nowhere to migrate. We also \nheard how the intruding salt water is changing local marsh ecosystems \nand jeopardizing fresh water supply.\n  Georgia actually runs a Coastal Management Program Coastal Incentive \nGrant Program to increase knowledge about sea level rise. If Georgia \nruns a Coastal Management Program Coastal Incentive Grant Program on \nsea level rise, how can people who represent Georgia in Washington \npretend this isn't occurring?\n  I ended the day in Georgia out on the water with Charlie Phillips, \nwho is a terrific character, a great guy to be with--a local, very \nsuccessful clammer. We went out on his air boat over the marshes that \nhe built himself. He is also very knowledgeable. He is a member of the \nSouth Atlantic Fishery Management Council that runs the regional \nfishery. He has been an outdoorsman his whole life, and he needs fresh, \nclean water for his Georgia clams. Unfortunately, Charlie says that \nchanges in climate are hurting the ecosystem that supports his \nlivelihood--his and his employees. He worries about the future of his \nbusiness.\n  This is South Carolina and Georgia. When you actually go there, what \ndo you find? Business owners, researchers, faith leaders, and elected \nofficials, all responding to changes that they are witnessing. They \nunderstand. They see the risks that climate change poses, and they hope \ntheir representatives in Congress will wake up to the danger of climate \nchange, the home-State danger that their constituents are already \nseeing happening right around them.\n  After seeing the beauty of both South Carolina and Georgia along \nthose lovely coasts, it is painful to see there the early warning \nsymptoms of climate change. It called to mind President Theodore \nRoosevelt's message from more than 100 years ago to America's \nschoolchildren. It is sort of old fashioned language, but that was \n1907. He said this:\n\n       [I]n your full manhood and womanhood, you will want what \n     nature once so bountifully supplied and man so thoughtlessly \n     destroyed. And because of that want, you will reproach us, \n     not for what we have used, but for what we have wasted. . . . \n     [A]ny nation which in its youth lives only for the day, reaps \n     without sowing, and consumes without husbanding, must expect \n     the penalty of the prodigal. . . .\n\n  The people I met in South Carolina and Georgia, along with a huge \nmajority of Americans nationwide, know that climate change is real. \nThey see it happening in their lives, and they want us to take action. \nIt is time for Congress to listen to their voices. It is time for \nCongress to listen to the fishermen who see the fisheries moving around \nand the oceans warming. It is time for us to listen to the clammers at \nthe seashore who see the changes in the sea level and know what it \nmeans for them. It is time for us to listen to the foresters who see \nthe pine beetle killing forests by the hundreds of square miles, and \nthe firefighters who fight fires in those forests who see the fire \nseason expanding by 60 days. It is time for us to listen to the farmers \nwho see unprecedented drought and flooding. It is time for Congress to \nlisten to the voices of their constituents before we all, in our \nfoolishness and in our folly, must pay the penalty of the prodigal. \nIndeed, it is time for Congress to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2774-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2774-S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday on the Senate floor about \nmy concerns with the nature of the way the Department of Veterans \nAffairs is being operated. Much of my concern occurred as a result of \nconversations I have had with veterans back home in Kansas and their \nexperiences both on the benefit and medical side--some real concerns \nwith individual examples of what has happened in some of our VA \nfacilities in our State, and this growing sense that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs has become unable, unwilling, to provide the necessary \nservices in a cost-effective, efficient, timely manner that our \nveterans so deserve.\n  As I indicated yesterday, there is no group of people I hold in \nhigher regard than those who have served our country and believe that \nthe benefits that were promised our veterans must be provided to them, \nand I am concerned that is no longer the case.\n  I also indicated yesterday that I have served on the House and Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee for now 18 years. I was the chairman of the \nhealth care subcommittee. I have worked with nine secretaries of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. During that time I always had the \nsense, until the last few years, that things were always getting better \nfor our veterans. Today, the frustration that I bring to share with my \ncolleagues is the belief that many veterans no longer have hope that \nthe\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is there to meet their needs and to care \nfor them.\n  In preparing for those remarks yesterday--but really in studying this \nissue over the last several years--there is a real shocking \ndevelopment, which is the number of times we hear stories, incidents, \nfacts about what is going on with our veterans at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the services being provided. Just to highlight to \nmy colleagues, based upon inspector general reports that are then, in \npart, based upon press reports, are some things we have seen and heard \nabout the Department of Veterans Affairs and their efforts to care for \nAmerica's veterans.\n  The one that is in the news at the moment--there is an additional IG \nreport that is being anticipated--the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Hospital \nadministration apparently developed a secret waiting list of up to \n1,600 sick veterans who were forced to wait months to see a doctor. It \nis believed that at least 40 U.S. veterans died waiting for their \nappointment as a result of being placed on the secret waiting list. \nAgain, this is being investigated, a report is expected, and we will \nsee what that report says. But, clearly, this is one of huge concern, \nresulting in potentially the death of veterans.\n  There is a wait time cover-up. According to the GAO--the Government \nAccountability Office--last year, quoting them:\n\n       It's unclear how long an appointment has been delayed \n     because no one can really give you accurate information . . . \n     It is so bad that [GAO staff] have found evidence that VA \n     hospitals tried to cover up wait times, fudged numbers, and \n     backdated delayed appointments in an effort to make things \n     appear better than they are. In addition, the GAO states that \n     ``nothing has been implemented that we know of at this \n     point'' despite the fact that the GAO and the VA Inspector \n     General ``reported similar findings for over a decade.''\n\n  Reports of falsifying records were stored in the VA clinic at Fort \nCollins, CO, where the VA's Office of Medical Inspector found that \n``clerks were instructed on how to falsify appointment records so it \nappeared the small staff of doctors was seeing patients within the \nagency's goal of 14 days.'' In fact, the investigation determined that \nclerical staff at the Colorado clinic were punished if they allowed \nrecords to reflect that a veteran waited longer than 14 days. Let me \nsay that again. In fact, the investigators determined that clinical \nstaff at the Colorado clinic were punished if they allowed records to \nreflect that a veteran waited longer than 14 days.\n  No oversight in quality of care. In December, the GAO reported on VA \nhospitals finding that patients were not being protected from doctors \nwho have historically provided substandard treatment. None of the \nhospitals examined by the GAO in Dallas, Nashville, Seattle, and \nAugusta, ME, adhered to all of the requirements to review and \nadequately identify providers who are able to deliver safe, quality \npatient care.\n  In Los Angeles in 2012, more than 40,000 requests for diagnoses were \n``administratively closed'' and essentially purged from the books so \nreported wait times would be dropped. In Dallas in 2012 another 13,000 \nappointments were canceled. According to the Washington Examiner, the \nVA canceled more than 1.5 million medical orders with no guarantee that \nthe patients actually received the treatment or that the tests that \nwere required by those orders were given.\n  By the VA's own admission in an April of 2014 fact sheet, cancer \nscreening delays accounted for the deaths of at least 23 patients in VA \nfacilities nationwide, and another 53 patients suffered from some type \nof harm due to improper care. Reports have also linked poor patient \ncare, maintenance issues, and unsanitary practices to at least six \npreventable deaths in Columbia, SC, five in Pittsburgh, four in \nAtlanta, and three each in Memphis and Augusta, GA.\n\n  Other reports:\n  More than 1,800 veteran patients in the St. Louis VA Medical Center \nmay have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis as a result of unsanitary \ndental equipment. The facility has remained under fire for patient \ndeaths, persistent patient safety issues, and critical reports. Despite \nthe problems at the medical center, the facilities director from 2000 \nto 2013 received nearly $25,000 in bonuses during her tenure there.\n  CNN reported that after they obtained VA internal documents that deal \nwith patients diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and 2011, at least 19 \nveterans died because of delays in simple medical screenings such as \ncolonoscopies or endoscopies at various VA hospitals or clinics. Let me \nsay that again. In 2010 and 2011, 19 veterans died because of delays in \ngetting simple medical screenings related to cancer. The veterans were \npart of 82 vets who have died or are dying or have suffered serious \ninjuries as a result of delayed diagnosis or treatment.\n  Loopholes in VA performance. An Iraq and Afghanistan combat vet, who \nis also a former mental health administrator at the VA Medical Center \nin Manchester, NH, said in April 2012 that VA hospital managers across \nthe country regularly sought loopholes to get around meeting \nperformance requirements. He explained that ``meeting a performance \ntarget, rather than meeting the needs of the veteran, becomes the \noverriding priority in providing care.'' He went on to say that \n``offering bonuses to managers to make sure they met performance \nrequirements creates a perverse administrative incentive to find and \nexploit loopholes . . . that will allow the facility to meet its \nnumbers without actually providing the services or meeting the \nexpectation the measure dictates.''\n  Finally, this one. It is not from the inspector general's report. But \nin a hearing before the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on April 9--\nabout a month ago--the deputy for the VA inspector general for health \ncare inspections stated:\n\n       I believe that the VA has lost its focus on the importance \n     of providing quality medical care as its primary mission. . . \n     . There is no good explanation for these events. They are not \n     consistent with good medical practice, they're not consistent \n     with common sense and they're not consistent with VA policies \n     that exist.\n\n  It is amazing to me--it is so troubling to me--we have these reports \nover a long period of time across the country--not isolated incidents. \nIt is even more troubling to me--despite these reports, these \ninspections, these criticisms of the VA--it is hard to find any \nevidence the VA is doing anything to improve its record, its \nperformance, or to better care for the veterans of our country. We \nshould demand more, and we need leadership at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs that will do so.\n  As I indicated yesterday, I do not believe this is a matter of money. \nThere has been a 60-percent increase in VA spending since 2009--normal \nincreases of 2, 3, or 4 percent each year over the last several years. \nAs I indicated yesterday, the President himself talked about how \nsuccessful the administration has been in providing the necessary \nresources for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Our veterans deserve better care and treatment. These are the folks \nwe ought to honor and esteem. These are the people who we must live up \nto with our commitments to provide the benefits and health care they \ndeserve and have earned.\n  If these were isolated instances, they would be a terrible thing. But \nbecause they are so pervasive, because they are so widespread, and \nbecause there appears to be no effort to correct the problems, it is \nimportant--it is critical--that Congress and the American people demand \nbetter service, care, and treatment for our Nation's heroes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak today as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2775-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2775-S2780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to talk about the growing problem of student debt and \nthe college affordability crisis that is gripping our Nation. I also \nrise to talk about one of the things we need to do\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nto address this crisis; that is, to pass the Bank on Students Emergency \nLoan Refinancing Act, which I was proud to join Senator Elizabeth \nWarren of Massachusetts in introducing yesterday.\n  We have to take action on student debt because it is a huge problem \nin this country. The total amount of student loan debt held by \nAmericans is more than $1.2 trillion today--surpassing the total amount \nof credit card debt in our Nation. More and more Americans are becoming \nsaddled with large amounts of student debt and that limits their \nability to buy homes, save for retirement, and make other purchases \nthat will help keep our economy growing.\n  My State--Minnesota--has the unfortunate distinction of being the \nState with the fourth highest average debt for students graduating from \na 4-year college, at over $30,000 per student. Over the last several \nyears, I have held college affordability roundtables in Minnesota to \nhear from students and families about the challenges they face in \npaying for college and to talk about ways to make the situation better. \nLet me tell you about one of the stories I heard.\n  Last month, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, I met \nJoelle Stangler, a sophomore who is the incoming student class \npresident. With a 4.12 GPA, Joelle graduated from Rogers High School in \nMinnesota as their valedictorian. She was also senior class president \nand the captain of her volleyball team. Joelle does not lack motivation \nwhen it comes to school.\n  Both of Joelle's parents were teachers, and, in fact, she comes from \na long line of educators going back six generations. But a couple years \nago, Joelle's mom Cassie Stangler made the difficult decision to quit \nher job as a fifth grade teacher to go to work in the private sector, \nwhere she could get more money, so she could help send her four kids to \ncollege.\n  Among the fifth grade classes in her school district, Mrs. Stangler's \nstudents showed some of the highest rates of improvement on test \nscores. We lost a great teacher because of how expensive post-secondary \neducation is.\n  Not only that, even with her mom's sacrifice, Joelle, who is only in \nher second year of college, already has $12,000 in student loans. She \nestimates that her total debt will be around $30,000 by the time she \ngraduates. Again, that is even with her mom leaving the job she loves, \nthe job as a society we would want her to be in and that she is so \ngreat at.\n  At the roundtables I have around the State of Minnesota, I always \nhear about students working multiple jobs, sometimes even putting in 40 \nhours a week while going to school full time. Working and school is \ngood. It is not bad necessarily. Some work can help students manage \ntheir time, become more productive, and of course help pay for college, \nbut evidence shows that when a student starts to work more than 15 \nhours a week, it becomes harder for the student to maintain good grades \nin school and to graduate from school on time. Students are working \nmore because college is becoming less and less affordable and they are \nstill taking out more and more student loans and graduating with more \nand more debt, despite having worked while they were in school.\n  I do not think that is right. I do not think it is productive for our \ncountry. One student at the last roundtable I did told me: I can work \n40 hours a week and have less debt or I can work 20 hours a week and be \nmore involved in school. That is not the kind of choice students should \nhave to face in America. I have talked to students who work full time \nwhile going to school and actually sell their blood every once in a \nwhile to help pay maybe their rent or their housing.\n  Recently, some encouraging things have happened in Minnesota. Thanks \nto the work of Gov. Mark Dayton and the State legislature, our State's \npublic colleges and universities received an increase in funding from \nthe State. Last year, after more than a decade of spending cuts to \nhigher education and tuition increases in Minnesota, the State \nincreased higher education funding for this academic year and next \nacademic year by 10 percent, including a 15-percent increase in need-\nbased State grants.\n  This much needed funding has allowed the public universities and \ncolleges in Minnesota to hold their tuition steady, instead of passing \non higher costs to Minnesota's students. This has been a significant \nvictory for Minnesota students and families, but students are still \nfacing daunting costs in paying for college and they are still \ngraduating with far too much debt.\n  In the Senate I have been working on a number of solutions to the \ncollege affordability problem. I have two bipartisan bills with Senator \nChuck Grassley of Iowa that would help students and families understand \ncollege costs and compare the costs of different colleges as they go \nthrough the process of selecting a school. Our Net Price Calculator \nImprovement Act makes these online tools more user friendly in order to \ngive students and their families a better estimate of college costs \nbefore they decide where to apply to college.\n  Senator Grassley and I have another bill that will require schools to \nuse a universal financial aid letter. Right now these letters are \nincredibly confusing. They do often clearly indicate what is a grant \nand what is a loan. A lot of people do not think--they say ``award \nletters'' on them sometimes and they include loans. A lot of people do \nnot consider a loan an award. They use different terminology. If you \nget a Stafford subsidized loan in one letter, it might say ``Stafford \nsubsidized loan,'' this amount.\n  Another, it might have a code number, an X5382. When we put out this \nbill, I got all kinds of calls from college counselors and from high \nschool counselors, saying thank you. Our bill would make sure students \nand their families and their counselors get clear and uniform \ninformation so they can make apples-to-apples comparisons between what \nthe different schools are offering.\n  Another part of the college affordability problem which is often \noverlooked is the price of textbooks. Students in Minnesota are \nspending an average of $1,400 per year on textbooks, $200 more than the \nnational average. One Minnesotan I have heard from, Kari Cooper at \nBemidji State, has to choose between paying for her textbooks and \npaying her rent. She ends up putting her textbook costs on her credit \ncard.\n  I introduced a bill with Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois called the \nAffordable College Textbook Act that would address this problem. Our \nbill would expand the use of free, online, open-source college \ntextbooks, which are a great alternative to the traditional expensive \nkind. This is a great way to reduce the overall cost of going to \ncollege.\n  College students such as Kari, Joelle, and countless others are \nworking incredibly hard when they are still taking on significant \namounts of debt. Part of the reason this debt will stay with them for a \ngood portion of their lives is that they are paying such high interest \nrates.\n  Many college graduates are locked into loans with interest rates as \nhigh as 10 percent, which makes it all the more difficult to pay off \nyour student loan. The last thing our students need is to be saddled \nwith high interest rates on student loans that continue to burden them \nlong after graduation. There is a clear commonsense solution. That \nsolution is contained in the bill I am proud to have joined Senator \nWarren in introducing, the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing \nAct.\n  Students and graduates should be able to take advantage of lower \ninterest rates and refinance their loans. When interest rates are low, \nhomeowners, businesses, and even local governments regularly refinance \ntheir debt. Yet despite being the biggest student lender by far, the \nFederal Government offers no refinancing options to student borrowers.\n  Once a person graduates, if they have a high interest rate on their \nstudent loans, they are stuck with that high interest rate forever. \nThat is not right for our students and families and it is damaging to \nthe long-term well-being of our country because it holds people back \nfrom making decisions that help drive economic growth: the decision to \nbuy a home, to start a family, start a new business, to purchase big-\nticket items such as a car.\n  Our new bill would allow students and graduates who have existing \nprivate and public student loan debt from\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\ntheir undergraduate education to refinance these loans at less than 4 \npercent. Last summer we came together in Congress to prevent the \ninterest rate on new student loans from doubling. Thanks to that \neffort, undergraduate students taking out new loans now have a rate of \n3.86 percent. The bill we introduced yesterday would enable students \nand graduates who are saddled with higher interest rates on their \nundergraduate loans to refinance at the same 3.86 percent rate.\n  There are nearly 40 million Americans with outstanding student loans. \nMany of them face interest rates higher than 3.86 percent, some of them \nmuch higher. This legislation will give them a chance to cut down their \ndebt and keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. It will help \nthousands of students in Minnesota who, similar to Joelle and Kari, are \ndoing everything they can to get their college degree.\n  So many Minnesotans in schools across the State show tremendous \nperseverance and grit in getting a college education and in cobbling \ntogether the resources to pay for it. They should not end up with \ncrushing debt and be unable to take advantage of lower interest rates \nto reduce that debt, when so many other kinds of debt--almost every \nother kind of debt you are able to refinance.\n  We have a lot to do and a long way to go to reduce student debt for \nour students and make college more affordable. Doing that will help \nmore Americans find jobs to support their families, help more employers \nfind qualified workers for their businesses, and help our economy \nprosper. Passing this bill will be one important step we can and we \nshould take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of Senator Franken \nand Senators Durbin and Warren and Jack Reed, who will speak after me, \nfor their efforts on dealing with the terrible burden of debt that far \ntoo many young people in this country face. We know it is bad for them. \nWe know this is a burdensome, onerous debt. We know it is bad for their \nfamilies. In many cases, mothers and fathers cosign these loans and \nhave to put off other kinds of things they want to and should do in \ntheir lives.\n  We know what it means to those families and to the economy and those \ncommunities where these students come out of college with huge debt. \nThey cannot buy a car. They cannot buy a home. They cannot start a \nbusiness. In many cases they put off getting married and starting a \nfamily because of debt. None of this is good.\n  Think back a generation. I heard Senator Klobuchar speak today on the \nfloor. She went to what we consider in this country an exclusive, very \nexpensive university. She scrounged together, her teacher mother, her \nfather--I was in the Presiding Officer's chair as she was speaking. Her \nfather is a reporter, a journalist, columnist, as my wife is. He did \nnot make a lot of money. It was difficult to come up with tuition, room \nand board for Amy Klobuchar, a young 18-year-old student then, but they \nwere able to do it. I looked back at my wife who graduated college 30-\nplus years ago, the daughter of a maintenance worker in a powerplant, a \nunion member, 35 years in the union. She is the oldest of four. Her \nparents absolutely had a commitment to send her to college but could \nnot afford it. Her mother took a job as a home care worker as Connie \nwas approaching college age. She is the oldest. She went to a State \nuniversity, Kent State University, one of the fine State universities \nin our State.\n  She graduated in 1979 with only about $1,200 in student loan debt. \nShe worked part of that time, she got grants, but college tuition was \nso much less expensive then, not just at private, more elite schools \nbut at State universities especially and community colleges. Now it is \nso out of reach for far too many families.\n  As the students approach that day and have these discussions with \ntheir parents, it is important to try to think through how these \nstudents who do not necessarily have a lot of sophistication yet in \nfinances, how they look at this. A recent study found that two-thirds \nof student loan borrowers were not as aware of the difference between \nFederal student loans and riskier, higher interest private student \nloans.\n  So they go into this not necessarily always with eyes wide open. They \nare idealistic. They are enthusiastic about going off to school. They \nwant to get ahead. They do not want to put too big a burden on their \nparents or obviously on themselves, but they are not, according to the \nstudy, aware of the differences between Federal student loans and these \nhigher interest private student loans.\n  Many students then take out private student loans, even though they \nare eligible for the more affordable Federal ones. You can't expect \nstudents to have a fair shot at building a successful livelihood if we \ndon't give them the tools to succeed. That is why the Know Before You \nOwe Private Student Loan Act is so important. The bill would require \nprivate student loan lenders to clearly state the difference between \nthe student's ultimate cost of attending college and the student's \nestimated financial assistance.\n  They should be taking full advantage of any Federal financial aid \npackages they may qualify for before taking on any private student loan \ndebt, although they so often don't know that because this is \ncomplicated.\n  Second, our bill would provide loan statements to borrowers and their \nfamilies at least once every 3 months so they can understand what they \nare getting into. Also, it would require private student loan lenders \nto submit an annual report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nabout student loans.\n  We know private student loans typically have significantly higher \ninterest rates. They offer more limited payment options. They offer no \nrelief for graduates who are underpaid, have been laid off or are \nunable to find work.\n  That is why my Refinancing Education Funding to Invest for the \nFuture, or REFIF Act, addresses this problem by authorizing the \nTreasury Department to make the private student loan market more \nefficient. It would allow borrowers to refinance their more costly \nprivate loans into more affordable loans at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Now the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act would allow \nhomeowners to refinance and lock in lower Federal interest rates. All \nof these pieces of legislation will give students a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream of going to school--whether they choose to go to Lorain \nor Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, whether they want \nto go west to Otterbein, a private school in Ohio or Denison or Oberlin \nor whether they want to go to a larger State university such as Ohio \nState or usually Toledo or Youngstown State.\n  It would allow those with private student loans into the Federal \nprogram, saving hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars by switching \nto the lower Federal interest rates.\n  We all hear it. The Presiding Officer hears it from his Connecticut \nresidents. Senator Reed hears it from Rhode Island, and we will hear \nfrom people in our States pleading for help. Let me share a couple of \nthem, and then I will yield the floor for Senator Reed.\n  Kelly McVicker, a father of three in Toledo--I spoke with him on the \nphone and I talked to him. We went to Perrysburg High School, a suburb \nof Toledo--an affluent suburb--but still a place where students \nstruggle with student loans and student debt.\n  When Kelly was 17, he took out a $48,000 student loan to get his \ndegree. Today he is 31, working to pay down that original loan, which \nhas now grown to $73,000, while also trying to support his family.\n  He took out a $48,000 loan. He has been working, he has been going to \nschool, and he has been doing what people and what society asked of \nhim, and yet he is now saddled with this $73,000 debt.\n  Andrea, from the same part of the State, the northeast corner of \nOhio, wrote to me from Williams County saying:\n\n       I have been repaying my student loan religiously for about \n     14 years, and I feel as though my payment never goes down.\n       My interest rate is 7.75 percent. When I contact my lender, \n     they have no offer to lower the rate.\n       I find it hard to believe when my mortgage is 3.25 percent, \n     and so is my auto loan. I can even get a credit card with \n     zero percent interest.\n       I would be better off defaulting and let the companies take \n     care of it.\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\n       I am married with three children. At this rate, I will \n     still be paying off school loans when my oldest goes to \n     college.\n       I did not have the luxury of having financial help from my \n     parents, and I am trying not to let that happen to my own \n     children.\n       Higher education is extremely important to my husband and \n     me, and as a middle class family, there doesn't seem to be \n     much help in this area.\n       I am a frustrated person who seems to be indebted to \n     student loans, and I don't want the same for my children.\n\n  All of these pleas, whether they come from Providence or whether they \ncome from Cleveland, are from people who want to do the right thing. \nThey want to get out from under these loans, but they want to pay them. \nThey want to pay them back. They just want an interest rate that is \nmore competitive when they see what their home mortgage interest rates \nare.\n  For Andrea from Williams County, her interest rates for her home \nmortgage are less than half of what she is paying for student loans. \nWhy should that be? We need to respond to these pleas for help from so \nmany of our constituents of all ages, of both genders, from all across \nour States in communities, small towns, big cities, and rural areas.\n  Across the country there are responsible borrowers who have played by \nthe rules and are still finding themselves coming up short. Unless we \nact, we will have a generation of Americans unable to build a life for \nthemselves because they are in a nonstop cycle of dealing with costly \nloan repayment.\n  It is important. We have the opportunity, by passing these bills, to \ngive Americans the fair shot they need at paying off their loans, of \ngoing to school, of getting ahead, starting businesses, starting \nfamilies, buying homes, and getting this economy back on track.\n  We can do this, and it is important we start today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleagues Senator Franken and Senator Brown for \ntheir leadership and very wise comments on this issue, which is one of \nthe most difficult ones that young Americans face, and that is paying \nfor college and student loans.\n  As my colleague had indicated, this is just really the tip of the \niceberg because these debts that they have accumulated will prevent \nthem from buying homes, from starting families, and ultimately affects \nour economy in a tremendously disruptive way.\n  All of this is coming into very sharp focus as we begin the \ngraduation season. We have high school seniors who are choosing a \ncollege to attend. We have college graduates who are leaving campus and \nfacing a very difficult job market. Those who are going to college are \nlooking at huge potential debt. Those who are leaving college already \nhave, in most cases, those debts and are now thinking about how they \ncan deal with them as they go forward.\n  Outstanding student loan debt today is at an estimated $1.2 trillion, \nand it is growing.\n  According to the Institute for College Access and Success, between \n2008 and 2012, average student loan debt increased by an average of 6 \npercent per year--much, much faster than the rate of inflation. So we \nhave an issue that is not only critical today, but it is getting worse \neach and every day.\n  Seventy percent of the class of 2012 graduated with student loans, \nand the average student debt was $29,400. That is a lot of money. With \nthat debt and with a job that is paying modest wages, or in many cases \nnot being able to find such a job, it is very difficult to pay those \nloans.\n  I just met with the presidents of all my colleges and universities in \nRhode Island, and we talked about the urgency of this issue. Rhode \nIsland ranked fifth in the Nation for average debt, with students owing \nan average of more than $31,000 when they graduate from college. We are \nfifth in the Nation.\n  We are also, I would like to point out, regretfully, first in the \nNation in unemployment. We have the classic situation of Rhode Island \ngraduates leaving with an average of $31,000 of debt and struggling in \none of the toughest job markets in the United States to find work. That \nis a very difficult combination to bear; that is so for so many young \npeople not only in Rhode Island but in Ohio, Massachusetts, and people \nacross this country.\n  This debt is a huge drag on our economy. It is a threat to our \nfuture.\n  We have to take action. We just can't sit back and watch this get \nworse each day as it is.\n  First, we must commit to lowering costs for low- and middle-income \nfamilies. The Pell grant is the foundation for making college \naffordable.\n  It is the work of my distinguished predecessor, Senator Claiborne \nPell, who understood that if you could make college affordable for \ntalented Americans, they could remake this country and the world. For \ndecades we did that. We provided the kinds of resources and grants that \nallowed talented, but not wealthy, students to go to school, to leave \nschool without huge debts, and to begin immediately to apply their \ntalents to the issues that confronted this country and this world.\n  In fact, I would argue that his foresight back in the 1960s and 70s \nset the stage for all of these great sorts of revolutions.\n  Why did we have a telecommunications revolution? Because we had not \nonly the educated scientists and engineers to develop transistors, to \ndevelop all of these new technologies, but we also had the most \neducated population in the world to use them.\n  That wasn't an accident. That was building on the GI bill in the \n1940s, with the Higher Education Act in the 1960s, adding the Pell \ngrant in the 1970s, to make college affordable and accessible to the \nwidest section of Americans.\n  That has been the engine that has driven our growth and our economic \nprogress over many decades. That engine is sputtering right now because \nof the debt that is being put on these students because the cost of \ncollege is going up.\n  We certainly have to reject the proposal in the House by some of our \nRepublican colleagues that would roll back investment in the Pell \ngrant. We have to do more to make the Pell grant accessible to more \ncitizens, more Americans.\n  Second, we have to tackle this student loan debt crisis.\n  The Federal Government should not be generating revenue from student \nloan interest payments. Instead, we should be offering lower rates. \nThat is why I introduced the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act to \nset interest rates to cover our costs and nothing more, and allow for \nrefinancing of loans that are at high fixed rates.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Warren of Massachusetts, who is an \nextraordinary leader on this issue, to develop a new student loan \nrefinancing bill that would enable student loan borrowers to refinance \nat the rate that was enacted under the Bipartisan Student Loan \nCertainty Act last year.\n  We also have to hold loan servicers accountable for treating \nborrowers fairly. Students must get accurate and clear information \nabout their repayment options, and that is why Senator Durbin's \nBorrowers' Bill of Rights Act is so critically important. I am proud \nthat he has joined us on the floor, and I am very proud to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Third, States, colleges, and universities have to step up. They have \nto do more to provide the resources, to provide the efficiencies, so \nthat we can make college more affordable for all of our citizens.\n  I have introduced the Partnerships for Affordability and Student \nSuccess Act to reinvigorate the Federal-State partnership for higher \neducation with an emphasis on need-based grant aid.\n  One of the problems we have, frankly, is that in the 1970s, if you \nlooked at the Pell grant, it would cover roughly three quarters of \ntuition at a public four-year university. Now it covers only about one-\nthird of tuition for those who can get the grant.\n  If we could go back to those times where you could basically get--if \nyou were a low-income deserving student--a grant, we wouldn't have such \na crisis in student debt. So we have to make grant aid more accessible, \nand that requires a State, Federal, university, and college \npartnership. A recent report presented at the American Educational \nResearch Association found that grant aid increased the likelihood of \ngraduation for low-income students while unsubsidized student loans \nresulted in a decrease in graduation rates.\n  If we are worried about graduating young people from college, the one\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nthing we can do is take the worry of debt off their shoulders, take the \nuncertainty of trying to put together, cobble together, financing for \neducation by giving them the grants that used to be something we \nthought were part and parcel of the American dream.\n  We also know that one of the main reasons tuition has skyrocketed is \nthat State appropriations for higher education have declined. According \nto the State Higher Education Finance report, State spending per full-\ntime equivalent students reached its lowest point in 25 years in 2011.\n  States do have to put more into their State and university college \nsystems. I say that knowing full well the challenges the States face, \nsome of which are the result of policies and guidance that we have \ngiven them. But if the States are not willing to put more resources in, \nit ultimately is shifted on to the shoulders of students, and \nultimately there is only so much weight they can bear.\n  States have to reinvest in higher education, and we can help give \nthem incentives to do that, rather than disincentives. I hope our \nlegislation will do that.\n  Finally, colleges and universities must take greater responsibility \nfor affordability and student loan debt. This is not something that is \nbeyond their prerogatives. They are not helpless in this. They have to \nnot only advise students on the best course of action--in fact, in my \nview, colleges, public, private, for profit, nonprofit, should be \nfiduciaries, really. They should operate in the best interests of \nstudents, not the best interest of the bottom line, not to make up for \nlost State contributions, not to sign up for esoteric deals with \nfinancial companies because they get a huge payment back in return.\n  Just as in the classroom, they should be trying to give these \nstudents the best education. In the financial aid office they should be \ngiving them the best deal possible on paying for college.\n  To ensure that, to basically make sure that all of these institutions \nhave some, as they say, skin in the game, I introduced the Protect \nStudent Borrowers Act with Senators Durbin and Warren. I must say this \nis also the result of some hard lessons we learned in the financial \ncrisis. If institutions don't have an interest in the loans they are \nmaking--in fact, if they are encouraging people to take loans they \ncannot afford--disaster is just days, months, weeks away. It is coming. \nWe want them to be more responsible. So we would ask them, as the \npercentage of their students who default rises, that these institutions \nstart sharing some of the risk; that they start being conscious of the \narrangements they are giving, the tuition they are charging, the \ncourses they are offering; that they have a vested interest in their \nstudents succeeding, and not the institution getting as much money as \npossible.\n\n  I know there are other colleagues on the floor, and I have more to \nsay about this, but we have a great deal of work to do here. This is \nabout a fair shot for all of our students and all of our families. \nWorking with Senator Warren and Senator Durbin and my other colleagues, \nwe are going to try to make a difference for students across this land.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, our new colleague from \nMassachusetts, and Senator Reed and I have started this effort, but we \nare welcoming ideas and supporters from both sides of the aisle to join \nus.\n  The conversation tonight on the floor of the Senate may be the most \nimportant conversation that millions of American families could hear, \nbecause we are talking about student debt. Student debt in this country \nhas reached the breaking point. It has reached the point where the \ncover of Time magazine would have a question mark. It shows a student \nheaded off to college and the comment of the question mark is, Is It \nWorth It?\n  It has reached the point where the cost of higher education is so \nhigh, the indebtedness associated with it so high, that many are \nstepping back now to ask that very basic question: Is it worth it, to \ngo this deeply in debt for college courses--an associate's degree, a \nbachelor's degree, or more? That question would have been unthinkable \nin my day--unthinkable. If there was one driving idea in my mind from \nmy mother and father, it was stay in school, go to college, do the best \nyou can and don't quit, keep working at it. Thank goodness, for me--\nthank goodness, for me--the Soviet Union decided to launch Sputnik. \nThat was the biggest break I ever got in my life and I didn't even \nrealize it.\n  It was October 1957. They launched this basketball-sized satellite \nthat circled the globe. We didn't have any rockets or satellites at the \ntime, and this satellite, as it circled the globe, let off this beep \nand signaled it was out there. You couldn't hear that beep on Earth \nwith the ordinary powers of individuals--some scientist could pick up \nthat signal--but they heard that beep on the floor of the Senate. What \nhappened is Members of the Senate came in here--Democrats and \nRepublicans--scared to death. We knew Russia had the bomb and now they \nhad satellites.\n  We did a lot of work. We started preparing our Department of Defense \nto get ready; something may be coming our way. Then something happened \nwhich was nothing short of amazing. Somebody said: If we are going to \nbeat the Russians, if we are going to beat the Soviets, we are going to \nneed an awful lot of educated people, and so they came up with an idea. \nIt was the first time in history the Federal Government had ever \nconceived of an idea of loaning money to college students to go to \nschool, unless you were a veteran, with the GI bill. You didn't have to \nbe a veteran. They would loan money to students to go to college, and \nthey called it the National Defense Education Act. Sounds right, \ndoesn't it? If we are going to defend America, we need education. So we \nwill loan money to students all across America to go to college.\n  What that did was to completely destroy the stereotypes of colleges \nand universities, which used to be for the very brightest and the sons \nand daughters of graduates. In the 1960s, after the National Defense \nEducation Act, higher education was democratized and a young high \nschool student from East St. Louis, IL, walked into the admissions \noffice at Georgetown University and went to school with a National \nDefense Education Act loan from my Federal Government.\n  I didn't borrow much money because it didn't cost much money, though \nit seemed like a lot at the time. The deal was you borrowed it, and \nthen, in the 10 years after you graduated--you got 1 year grace \nperiod--you paid it off in 10 installments with 3 percent interest, \nwhich I did. I borrowed money for college and law school. Did I know \nwhether that was a good idea to go in debt for college? I didn't, other \nthan the fact I had been told over and over and over the best thing you \ncan do with your life is to go to college.\n  Fast forward 50 years. Fast forward from that experience in my youth \nto today. Imagine a student with the same motivation for college is \nsitting in an admissions office and, instead of being told they may \nhave to borrow $500 or $1,000, they are told they may have to borrow \n$20,000 to go to school 1 year. Imagine a 19-year-old student making a \ndecision about being $20,000 in debt. How in the world can they make \nthat decision? They are still motivated, they want that college \neducation, and so they basically say: I will sign up. The admissions \nofficer has said classes start next week. If you sign these papers you \nwill be in there. If you don't sign the papers, you won't be. So \nstudents are signing up.\n  All across America, the indebtedness these students, and many times \ntheir parents, are incurring is building up to record levels. There is \nmore student loan debt in America than credit card debt. There are \ntragic stories emerging from it--stories of students deeply in debt, \ndropping out of school with no degree; stories of students deeply in \ndebt finishing school unable to find a job; and stories of students \ndeeply in debt going to semiworthless, for-profit schools with diplomas \nnot worth the paper they are written on.\n  What happens at the end of the day? The debt of these students is not \nlike any other debt. Luckily, we have as a colleague in the Senate \nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who once taught the bankruptcy course at \nHarvard Law School, so she can help correct me if I am wrong--at least \nfill in some blanks\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nfor me here. Currently, if someone declares bankruptcy in America \ntoday, there are some debts you cannot discharge. I am going to try to \nremember a few of them; she can help me with the others.\n  You cannot discharge taxes owed to the government. You still have to \npay that. You cannot discharge money you owe for alimony and child \nsupport, if I am not mistaken.\n  I don't know if there is another category, but I am going to add \nstudent loans here, and I yield to my colleague, with the permission of \nthe Chair. Did I get an A on that or at least a B?\n  Ms. WARREN. The Senator got an A.\n  Mr. DURBIN. All right. So the fourth category is student loans. If \nyou end up in debt with a student loan, it is one of the few loans in \nyour life you can't discharge in bankruptcy. The money you borrowed for \nyour home, yes, that is dischargeable; the money you borrowed for your \ncar, yes, that is dischargeable; the money your borrowed for a boat, \nyes, that is dischargeable; the credit line you have just for your \nordinary expenses, yes, that is dischargeable; but when it comes down \nto student loans, it is a debt you carry to the grave. You either pay \nit or they will hound you for as long as you live.\n  That is why it is different than other debts. That is why we came \ntogether and said it is time for us to look at these student loans, the \namount of debt which students and families are carrying, and do \nsomething about it.\n  Three bills emerged. The first bill I call the student borrower bill \nof rights. It says when you sit down at that desk in the admissions \noffice they have to tell you what your rights are. They have to tell \nyou the government loan you could use to pay for your education has a \nlower interest rate, more reasonable terms, can be consolidated at a \nlater point in your life, a limitation on how much money out-of-pocket \nyou are going to have to pay based on your income, and you might have \nsome forgiveness if you go into some areas such as teaching and \nnursing. You have to be told this.\n  Right now, students sitting across from that admissions officer are \nbeing steered into the most expensive, worst loans. So the bill I have \noffered--the student loan borrower bill of rights--says, first, tell \nthem the truth. Tell them the best circumstances for them to borrow \nmoney, if they need to borrow it.\n  Secondly, the bill of Jack Reed of Rhode Island basically says that a \nuniversity has a vested interest in making sure a student doesn't \nborrow too darned much money; that a student doesn't get so deeply in \ndebt they can never pay it back. That university, if they do not accept \nthat responsibility, could be on the line themselves for some of that \ndebt.\n  Think they will take it a little more seriously? You bet they will. \nThat is the Reed bill, which I am cosponsoring.\n  To discuss the third bill, I wish to defer to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, with the permission of the Chair. It is the one that is \na really critical element in this approach to dealing with student \nloans and student debt. With the permission of the Chair, I ask to \nenter into a dialogue with the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to, at this point, yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts to describe for the Record her refinancing proposal.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  It starts with the premise right where the Senator was, and that is \nthe Federal Government, once upon a time, lent money to our students. \nMy colleague remembers the NDEA loans that went out at 3 percent. The \nFederal Government was subsidizing those loans, making it easier for \nstudents to be able to borrow.\n  Where we have ended up today is that instead of there, we have \nstudents with outstanding student loan debt at 6 percent, at 7 percent, \nat 8 percent, at 9 percent, and even higher. So this isn't just to \ncover the cost of the loans. This is double, in some cases, what it \ntakes, triple, in some cases, what it takes to cover the cost of the \nloans. That means the administrative costs, the bad debt costs--the \ncosts of borrowing the money.\n  So last summer, we were looking at new student loans that were coming \nthrough--the interest rates were about to double--and Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, said if the interest rate doubles up to 7 \npercent, that is too high. So Congress said that for all new borrowers \nin 2013, the interest rate would be 3.86 percent on undergraduate \nloans, 5.41 percent on graduate loans, and 6.41 percent for PLUS loans. \nMake no mistake, the government still makes money--not a lot but the \ngovernment still makes money on those loans.\n  What we propose is to take all of the outstanding student loan debt \nand refinance it at those interest rates--exactly the same rates that \nvirtually every Republican agreed to last summer, many Democrats agreed \nto last summer, and to say we are going to finance it down. So kids who \nare trapped in loans at 8 percent, at 9 percent, and even higher will \nbe able to get these lower interest rates on their loans. It will save \nsome people hundreds of dollars a year, it will save some thousands of \ndollars a year.\n  We propose to pay for that by enacting the Buffet rule--closing some \ntax loopholes on millionaires and billionaires--so we can bring down \nthe interest rate for our students.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, and I see the \nmajority leader is on the floor, so I will close with this:\n  These three proposals--students being admitted to college should be \ntold the truth about their debt and the best way to minimize their \ndebt; that the colleges will not loan more money than is reasonable or \nbe on the hook themselves, if they do; and that students have an \nopportunity to refinance their student loans--would have a dynamic \nimpact on student debt in America today and give working families and \nstudents a fair shot at a higher education they can afford without a \ndebt that would cripple them for life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2780-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to very briefly join my colleagues \nhere\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\nin support of the effort being led by Senator Durbin, Senator Warren, \nSenator Reid, and Senator Harkin. They have done such incredible work \non behalf of students all across the country.\n  One of the most amazing statistics to me is a simple one. Not so long \nago the United States was No. 1 in the world when it came to the number \nof young people who had college degrees. In a very short amount of \ntime, we have precipitously fallen from No. 1 to No. 12 due to the fact \nthat other countries have caught up, which is an issue in and of \nitself, but it also has something to do with the fact that the cost of \ncollege has become calamitous for students all across this country, and \nit is taking kids a lot longer to complete their degrees--many of whom \nare starting and never even finishing.\n  I am an example of the squeeze that American families are in. I don't \ncomplain about the income my wife and I make, but we are both paying \nback our student loans and we are saving for our kids' student loans. \nSo I know the amount of a family's income that can be gobbled up trying \nto pay back prior college and save for future college, and I know where \nthat money would go if it weren't going to pay for those two costs. For \nus, that money would go into the local economy.\n  So this is the middle-class issue of our generation, as my colleague \nSenator Schatz often says, because it is not just about families trying \nto pay back college and save for college; it is also about all of the \nplaces that money could go if it weren't going to the banks and the \nFederal Government, which are making a pretty profit off of this system \nas it is.\n  Finally, I will make a pitch for a piece of legislation that Senator \nSchatz, myself, and Senators Murray and Sanders have introduced because \nI think we need to have two conversations. One is about making sure we \nreduce the financial burden for families, but there is also a \nconversation we need to have about putting pressure on schools to \nreduce the ticket price, the sticker price of attending college. We, \nfrankly, haven't done a very good job of leveraging the $140 billion we \nspend on financial aid to pressure colleges to do the right thing.\n  There is one for-profit college in California that takes in 1.6 \nbillion every year of taxpayer dollars, and the average student there \nspends only 3 months on campus because they start school and never \nfinish it. Their loan default rates are above 30 percent. That is a \nterrible investment for those kids but also for the Federal taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Our piece of legislation--which we hope will be considered in the \nbroader reauthorization of higher education statutes in this country--\nwould say it is time we hold colleges to a different standard and force \nthem to get serious about costs and quality. In the end, that will be \njust as helpful--keeping control of quality and cost at our colleges--\nas the effort being led by so many of my colleagues on the floor here \ntonight.\n  I am very glad to join in this effort. It is a personal cause for me \nand my family given that we are living this reality today but one that \nis a much greater imperative for all families who have been struggling \nwith this burden across the State the Presiding Officer and I \nrepresent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief, and I will \ncome back tomorrow to speak at greater length.\n  One of the things Americans know is that college is becoming more of \na necessity and is getting to be priced like more of a luxury. We can't \nhave that. When college is a ticket to success--not just income success \nbut even recent surveys show longevity and happiness--it is a crying \nshame when any American deserves to go to college but doesn't go or \ndoesn't go to the right college because he or she can't afford it. We \naim to change that in a variety of ways, but the one Senator Warren has \ntalked about and taken the lead on is in terms of refinancing.\n  It is absolutely outrageous that students who got out of college in \nthe last 5 to 20 years are paying 8 percent, 9 percent, and up to 13 \npercent in interest. If they took out a loan today, they would pay 3 \npercent or 4 percent. This puts huge burdens on their shoulders in \ntheir prime earning years and their family-forming years. It crimps the \nhousing market because if you have $30,000 in student loans, you are \nnot likely to take out a $100,000 mortgage.\n  So all we are asking for is a fair shot. If you deserve to go to \ncollege, you should have a fair shot at affording college. And if you \nhave gone to college, you should have a fair shot at being able to pay \nyour debts and live a decent life. It is very simple.\n  We Democrats are focusing our attention on what the average American \nneeds, giving the average American a fair shot. And there is probably \nno place where that fair shot is less attainable than in college \naffordability and in acquired student loan debt.\n  I hope people will listen to us in the next several weeks. I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--unlike on minimum wage or \nequal pay--will join us in coming up with a bipartisan proposal. I hope \nwe can do something for these students--those who have already gone to \ncollege and are paying disproportionate interest and those who are \ngoing to college and need to afford it. Everyone deserves a fair shot \nin America, and they certainly deserve a fair shot, if they have earned \na place in college, to afford that place in college.\n  I look forward to continuing this discussion and debate in the next \nseveral weeks to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York and \nall of my colleagues who have been here.\n  Forty million borrowers in this country have student loan debt. \nStudent loan debt is exploding, and it threatens the financial \nstability of our young people and the financial stability of this \ncountry.\n  I am pleased to see so many of my colleagues here tonight talking \nabout this problem because, make no mistake, this is an emergency. \nOutstanding student loans now total more than $1.2 trillion, and \nmillions of young people are struggling to keep up with their payments.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Congress set artificially high \ninterest rates on old student loans which generate extra money for the \ngovernment. The GAO recently projected that the government will bring \nin $66 billion on just the slice of student loans issued between 2007 \nand 2012. Those are the kinds of profits that would make a Fortune 500 \nCEO proud.\n  These young people didn't go to the mall and run up charges on a \ncredit card. They worked hard and they learned new skills that will \nbenefit this country and help us build a stronger America. They deserve \na fair shot at an affordable education, and we can give them immediate \nrelief by cutting the interest rate on existing student loans. We \nshould cut those interest rates and cut those government profits.\n  Yesterday I joined with 27 of my colleagues to introduce the Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which will do just that. The \nidea is simple. With interest rates near historic lows, businesses, \nhomeowners, and even local governments have refinanced their debts. But \na graduate who took out an unsubsidized loan before July 1 of last year \nis locked in to an interest rate of nearly 7 percent. Older loans run 8 \npercent, 9 percent, and even higher. We need to bring those rates down, \nand we need to do it now.\n  Bank on Students would allow student loan borrowers the opportunity \nto lower their interest rates on old loans to match the rates the \ngovernment offers to new borrowers--3.86 percent on undergraduate \nloans, 5.41 percent for graduate loans, and 6.41 percent for PLUS \nloans.\n  I wish to be clear. These rates are still higher than what it costs \nthe government to run its student loan program. Our work will not be \ndone until we have eliminated all of the Federal profits on these \nloans. But this legislation is an important step in that direction, and \nit is a step both Republicans and Democrats should support.\n  Last year nearly every Republican in Congress--in the House and the \nSenate--voted for the exact same loan rates in this legislation. If \nRepublicans believe that 3.86 percent is good enough for new \nundergraduate borrowers, then\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nit should be good enough for all existing undergraduate borrowers. \nThere is no reason on Earth to say some kids can get a better deal than \nothers when they all worked hard to do exactly what we wanted them to \ndo--get an education.\n  This legislation won't add a single dime to our deficit. The Bank on \nStudents legislation adopts the Buffett rule, which limits tax \nloopholes for millionaires and billionaires. Every dollar we bring in \nas a result of that change will go directly to supporting lower \ninterest rates on existing student loans.\n  We only introduced this bill yesterday, but we are already getting a \ngreat response. Think tanks such as Demos, student groups such as Young \nInvincibles, teacher groups such as the American Federation of Teachers \nand the National Education Association have all come forward and \nendorsed this proposal. Letters and emails and phone calls are already \npouring in. I am also encouraged by the fact that some Republicans have \nalso come forward to say they are open to considering a refinancing \nproposal.\n  I want to be clear. This should not be a partisan issue. I am eager \nto work with any of my colleagues who believe we need to do something \nabout the growing student debt crisis. If the Republicans have issues \nwith this proposal, if they want to suggest different offsets or policy \nchanges, they should bring their ideas forward. What we can't do is \ncontinue to ignore this problem and hope it will go away on its own.\n  Congress made this mess by setting artificially high interest rates \nthat are crushing our kids. It is Congress's responsibility to clean it \nup.\n  I don't kid myself. Refinancing will not fix everything broken in the \nhigher education system. But the need for comprehensive reform must not \nblind us to the urgency of addressing the massive debt that is already \ncrushing our young people.\n  This is personal for me. I grew up in an America that made it a \npriority to invest in its young people and the opportunity to go to \ncollege. An affordable college and affordable loans opened a million \ndoors for me. I will keep fighting to make sure every kid who works \nhard and plays by the rules gets a fair shot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2782-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LORI GELLATLY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am tremendously honored to follow my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, who has so zealously and \nthoughtfully developed a program that deals with the breaking, \ncalamitous burden of student debt which affects so many of our young \npeople across this country, including my State of Connecticut, and I \nthank her for her great work.\n  I wish to talk about that issue following the very eloquent remarks \nof my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Reid, Brown, as well as Schumer and \nSenator Warren, to be followed by Senator Baldwin. But first I wish to \ntake a moment or two to express my deepest condolences for the family \nof Lori Gellatly, who was shot and killed today in Oxford, CT. This \ntragedy is not only saddening but shocking because Lori is dead and her \nmother is seriously wounded and in very dire condition. They were shot \nby her estranged husband who was under an ex parte restraining order \nfrom a judge and who is suspected. All we have right now are \nallegations of his committing this atrocious crime. My heart goes out \nto their family and to their children. She left two children behind.\n\n  There will be time to talk about the lessons we can learn from \ndomestic violence like this shocking infamy. In her application for the \nrestraining order she described a violent altercation with her \nestranged husband which made her ``afraid for her kids and herself.'' \nShe was granted an ex parte order but it was only temporary. A hearing \nto consider a permanent restraining order was scheduled to take place \nliterally tomorrow. Connecticut law prohibits anybody who is the \nsubject of a full 1-year restraining order from possessing a firearm. \nFederal law has applications as well to individuals under a permanent \nrestraining order, but this prohibition does not extend under \nConnecticut law to an individual who is subject to an ex parte order.\n  I recently met with Representative Gabby Giffords to discuss the \nnexus and close connection between the issue of domestic violence and \ngun violence. Together with my colleagues Senators Murphy and Durbin we \ndiscussed this problem and potential remedies. In this calendar year \nalone five other homicides have taken place stemming from intimate \npartner violence in Connecticut alone. So the issue of temporary \nrestraining orders is an even more acute aspect of this problem. \nAccording to the Domestic Violence Intervention Program, women in \nabusive relationships are more than 7 times more likely to be killed by \nan intimate partner after 2 weeks of leaving the relationship than at \nany other time. We ought to do much more to protect victims of domestic \nviolence during this extremely vulnerable time--indeed a time when they \nare most vulnerable.\n  While we will have time in the future to discuss this tragedy, right \nnow my heart, my prayers, and my family's thoughts go out to Mary \nJackson, Lori's mom, as well as Lori's two children and all of the \nfamily, and my thoughts and prayers are with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2782-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2782-S2785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              STUDENT DEBT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would like to proceed with remarks \non the student debt and loan issue, and I will be brief because I know \nit is late. There have been some very remarkable and eloquent remarks \nand personal stories about the meaning of college education.\n  My dad came to this country in 1955 at the age of 17 without even a \nhigh school degree. He never had one. He spoke very little or no \nEnglish and had virtually nothing more than the shirt on his back and \nknew no one. Throughout his life one of his highest aspirations was for \nhis children, my brother and me, to have a college education. He valued \nit almost more than anything else that he could hope for us to have. It \nwas part of his dream. For him and countless immigrants and countless \nworking men and women born in this country for decades, a college \neducation has been part of the American dream, part of the fair shot \nthat every American should have, an economic opportunity at self-\nfulfillment and developing their full potential because that is what \neducation helps us to do. That is the reason why Americans are going \ninto debt at unprecedented levels, because they believe in that \nAmerican dream and the fair shot that it gives people through \nopportunity in this greatest Nation in the history of the world. It is \npart of our DNA as Americans that we aspire to educate and fulfill all \nof our potential, which benefits not only us but the whole country and \nall of our society.\n  The average level of debt in Connecticut is about $27,000--\ncalamitously bad not only for those individuals but also for our \nNation. For the individuals it means that financially crippling burden \nstops them from marrying at the time they wish, having children when \nthey might like, starting businesses, buying homes, and moving forward \nwith their lives. Who can start a small business with tens of thousands \nof dollars of debt? Risk taking is constrained and straitjacketed. \nPeople's personal lives are affected and changed forever.\n  Student debt today has increased concurrently to approximately $1.2 \ntrillion in this country. What we are doing in this proposal by \nproviding a fair shot to those folks who have debt now and those who \nwill incur it in the future is simply enabling them to do what people \nare able to do with other kinds of debt, whether it is their homes or \ntheir cars--to refinance so that they get the benefit of lower interest \nrates so they avoid that financially crippling burden saddling their \nlives so that they are able to buy homes, start families, and begin \nbusinesses in ways that benefit them and everyone in our society.\n  There is another dark side of this conversation which is that the \nAmerican government profits off the backs of students who have incurred \ndebt and who are beginning their lives in debt right now. In fact, the \nUnited States profits from these loans even at 3.86 percent. So the \nstark crass fact is that even with this relief that we are suggesting \nand proposing and agitating to\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\ngive to these students who have debt now, graduates that are out there \nwith debt with 8, 10, some 11 or 12 percent interest rates, the U.S. \nGovernment will still make money from those loans--less money but the \nloans are still profit-making.\n  We should regard higher education as an investment in the future and \nnot a revenue source or profit source. We should regard students as an \ninvestment--a personnel investment, a human resources investment, to \nput it again in crass business terms--that will pay off for years, not \nas immediate profit centers. That kind of wise investment looks beyond \nthis quarter or next quarter. It looks to the human revenue in quality \nof life and contributions and new inventions that will change our lives \nfor the better, in a more productive workplace that will make our \ncompanies more successful and profitable.\n  I hear from people all around the State of Connecticut. I got a \nstirring and moving email today from Bob in Naugatuck who told me his \ngranddaughter has a student loan that he has cosigned and therefore he \nis potentially liable for it. Dean told me about his master's degree \nand that he is $55,000 in debt, struggling to support his family with \nhis wife. Between them they have four jobs.\n  Alese, a mother of three, went back to school when her children were \nyoung because she ``wanted to make sure they had an example to follow \nwhen they finished high school.'' She is now $46,000 in debt.\n  As much as our economy is recovering, these folks are in danger of \nbeing left behind.\n  There are other measures that we should adopt, such as the uniform \nforms for college costs that will fully inform people about what debt \nthey are incurring, the Pell grant expansion, the bills mentioned for \nnet price calculated, and expanding other types of grants. We should \ntake a step forward to provide a fair shot for all Americans in this \nmeasure that enables refinancing of loans that otherwise will crush our \nhuman potential and leave us poorer as a Nation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor for my distinguished \ncolleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a growing \ncrisis in our Nation that threatens our economy and the future strength \nof our country. A college education should be a path to the middle \nclass, not a path to indebtedness. But today America carries the burden \nof $1.2 trillion in student loan debt.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin almost 70 percent of the students \ngraduating from 4-year institutions will have student loan debt, and \nthe average debt amount will be $28,000. This is real money. This is \nreal money that isn't going into growing our economy at a time when we \ndesperately need economic growth. This is real money that isn't going \ntowards buying a student's or graduate's first car or first home.\n  The total amount of student debt in the United States has tripled in \nthe last decade, from $363 billion in the year 2005 to over $1 trillion \ntoday. At the same time Federal financial support for students has not \nkept up with the need. The Pell Grant once covered $7 out of every $10. \nToday it covers $3 out of every $10 in college costs. In addition many \nStates have scaled back their investments in higher education. The fact \nis that State investment in higher education has declined significantly \nover past decades, which has exacerbated the problem, particularly as \nStates struggle to balance their budgets in these tough economic times. \nTheir investments in students have decreased, meaning higher tuition, \nfewer grants, and fewer scholarships.\n  I heard from Wisconsin students that the cost of a higher education \nin my State puts college out of reach for too many. Thirty years ago \nundergraduate tuition at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus was \nabout $1,000. Today it is well over $8,000, and it is not just in my \nhome State of Wisconsin. Across the country tuition at public 4-year \ncolleges has tripled. This all means that more students are borrowing \nthrough Federal student loan programs to cover the high cost of a \nhigher education. For students in the University of Wisconsin system, \nunmet need after grants and scholarships is over $9,000, nearly \ndoubling in the last decade. Yet the Federal Government limits on \nsubsidized loans have remained relatively stagnant over those same 30 \nyears. In many cases the limit on what a student can borrow through the \nStafford Loan Program means their loans will not even cover the cost of \ntuition, let alone other significant college expenses. The promise of a \nhigher education has instead become a burden that has fallen squarely \non the shoulders of students and their families.\n\n  Today, reflecting the trend of shifting costs onto students, 44 \npercent of college operating expenses are paid through tuition. \nNationwide, 49 States, including my home State of Wisconsin, are \nspending less on higher education than they did before the great \nrecession. Wisconsin has seen a 20-percent decline in State spending on \nhigher education since 2008 while instate tuition has increased by \nalmost 6 percent over the same time period.\n  It has not always been this way, and we seem to have lost touch with \nthe American idea of building a path to the middle class by making a \nstrong investment in higher education and giving Americans a fair shot \nat upward mobility.\n  In 1944, starting with the compact to returning soldiers from World \nWar II made through the GI bill, our Nation made a commitment to future \nprogress by investing in education. Between 1944 and 1951, 8 million \nveterans received education benefits, including many former \ndistinguished Members of this body.\n  In 1958 President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, signed the \nNational Defense Education Act, providing loans for college students \nand funds to encourage young people to enter teaching careers--the \nprecursor to our current program for student loans.\n  President Lyndon Johnson built upon this legacy. A cornerstone of the \nGreat Society was a path to the middle class through a college \neducation. The Higher Education Act of 1965 gave us the Federal Student \nLoan Program, known today as the Stafford Loan Program, and the \nEducational Opportunity Grant Program, known today as the Pell Grant \nProgram. This generation of Americans and lawmakers lived in trying \ntimes. Yet they still had the foresight to make the hard choices, the \nchoices necessary to invest in the future--our future.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the Federal Government has made \nmajor investments in expanding access to higher education for all \npeople willing to work hard to pursue their dreams. Unfortunately, in \nrecent years we have neglected that proud legacy.\n  Recently, Congress lowered interest rates for new borrowers but not \nfor those borrowers who are stuck paying back old loans with much \nhigher interest rates, be they public or private. Further, for those \nwho are in true financial distress, Congress has made discharging loans \nin bankruptcy nearly impossible, first by eliminating this option for \nFederal loans in 1995 and then for private loans as well in 2005.\n  Tonight we are giving a voice to the debt crisis that faces millions \nof American families and students. Tonight we are giving voice to a \nnumber of solutions that can address this crisis if we work across \nparty lines.\n  I believe Congress must take action, and that is why I am proud to \njoin my fellow freshman colleague Senator Warren as a cosponsor in \nsupport of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This \nlegislation would allow those with outstanding student loan debt to \nrefinance their debt at the lower rates currently offered to new \nborrowers. It is simple. It is paid for by making millionaires and \nbillionaires pay their fair share in taxes to give our students a fair \nshot at a bright future, and it will help strengthen the economic \nsecurity of American families who are struggling with this debt.\n  I believe making college affordable is one of the most important \nsteps we can take toward rebuilding our middle class and breathing new \nlife into the American dream. I want to live in an America where \neveryone has a fair shot at getting ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, it is an honor to stand here with a chorus \nof my colleagues speaking about an issue that goes to the core of the \nidea of this country; that is, every generation will be better than the \none before. It is the idea that in this Nation we should lead globally \nin enriching the lives of our citizenry.\n  The Presiding Officer and I talked a few seconds ago. He said he was \ngoing home after this to put his kids to bed. I hope the Presiding \nOfficer doesn't mind me sharing that. I know the Presiding Officer is \ngoing to teach his kids the same thing my parents taught me: Work hard \nand play by the rules so you can go to college and try to achieve your \ndreams.\n  When I have traveled all over the State of New Jersey--North Jersey \nand South Jersey, from urban towns to suburban towns and even rural \ntowns--I have heard the same kind of frustration, which is the rising \ncosts of college. Not only that, I see more and more people who try to \ntake on the challenge of paying for those rising costs and find \nthemselves saddled with staggering debt. The facts reflect the \nsentiments, frustrations, concerns, and anguish that I hear.\n  Today the average student graduates from college with around $29,000 \nin loans. That is up from an average of $27,600 in 2011 and $23,792 in \n2010. In fact, right now in New Jersey 16 percent of my constituents \nare carrying student debt. That is over 1 million New Jerseyans who are \nweighed down by this significant financial obligation.\n  Let me put this in perspective because it has a ripple effect within \nour economy. Take, for example, our housing. Housing is such an \nimportant driver to economic development, and it is an important driver \nto jobs. Owning a home is a dream many people in America have as well. \nWell, the reduced purchasing power due to high student debt levels is \nholding back people's ability to help drive our economy forward.\n  The housing industry, which is still recovering from a crisis, is an \nexample. The National Association of Realtors cited student loan debt \nas a primary reason for the decline in housing purchases among first-\ntime buyers. Of 20 percent of first-time buyers who find it difficult \nto save for a downpayment, 54 percent of first-time buyers said student \nloans make it tough to save money. According to a recent survey by the \nNational Association of Realtors, about half of all the people polled \nin a survey said student debt was a huge obstacle to buying a home. \nAccording to the Federal Reserve of New York, from 2009 to 2012 home \nownership rates fell twice as much for 30-year-olds who had a history \nof student loans than it did for those who don't.\n  This is a problem which is impacting families, and it is stifling \npeople's ability to participate and make our economy robust. It is \nmaking job growth a challenge. It has many different layers.\n  What I want to focus on for the last few moments is my desire to keep \nAmerica No. 1. When it comes to educating our populous, we should be \nand have been historically top in the globe, especially at the higher \neducation levels. When we created programs that many of my colleagues \nhave cited--I heard Senator Durbin speak about programs that literally \ntook him from a lower middle-class environment to achieving his dreams. \nAccessing affordable college loans allowed him to achieve his dreams. \nWe created these programs because we understood that the workforce in \nthis Nation is essential for economic competitiveness. Indeed, in a \nglobal knowledge-based economy, it is the knowledge of the people that \ndrives the economy forward. Without highly skilled workers, America \nsimply won't be able to compete in this new global economy. This wisdom \nhas been understood for decades, for generations. You educate your \nworkforce to the highest levels on the globe, and your economy will \nlead the globe.\n  Well, today we are seeing challenges, and we are seeing this reality \nchange. Today the average price of a college degree in the United \nStates has climbed to $13,856. Compare that with some of our critical \nglobal competitors. Take the UK, for example. In the UK, the average \ncost is $5,288 for a higher education. Take Germany, another one of our \nglobal competitors. German students pay a mere $933. Those competitive \neconomies understand that they don't want to put up barriers so their \nyoung people can learn. They want to remove them.\n  The cost of college in America puts our young people at a severe \ndisadvantage compared to their peers around the world. It is not a \nlevel playing field. We are asking our kids to compete globally, but we \nare putting up barriers that are unique to this economy.\n  When the cost of college in the United States is now more than 51 \npercent of the median income in America--let me say that one more time. \nThe cost of college in America is now 51 percent of the median income \nin America, while the cost of college in Germany is just 4.3 percent of \nthat country's median income. When the United States has one of the \nhighest percentages of adults--we are one of the top in the globe for \nadults 55 to 64. That generation of Americans which had the kinds of \nstudent loan programs and opportunities Senator Durbin talked about are \nat the top, but only 43 percent of Americans ages 25 to 34 have a \ndegree. Instead of that younger group being at the top, America has \nnow--compared to our competitors--fallen to 16th place globally.\n  In other words, older Americans who benefited from a rational system \nof affordable college and abundant affordable loans are leading. Madam \nPresident, 55- to 64-year-olds are leading the globe in the percentage \nof population with a college degree. The younger we are getting in our \ncountry, the lower we are falling in our competitiveness with our \ncompetitors in terms of the kids who have college degrees. We wonder \nwhy that is. It is because the ability to afford college has been \ngetting more and more difficult.\n  I am encouraged by my colleagues. We should be doing everything to \nencourage forthcoming generations to pursue higher education so we \ndon't slide further in global rankings and compromise our long-term \nability to compete. That is why I am standing here right now. That is \nwhy I am proud to cosponsor Senator Warren's newly introduced \nlegislation, the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which \nwould allow those with outstanding student loan debt to refinance at \nthe lower interest rates currently offered to new borrowers. It simply \nallows them to refinance loans the way you can with a mortgage and \nother types of loans. This will make us more competitive.\n\n  I commend a lot of my colleagues who spoke here. I especially commend \nSenator Harkin, Senator Reed, and Senator Gillibrand, who have been so \nactive in calling attention to this issue.\n  We cannot afford for the cost of obtaining a higher education to be \ndecades of crushing debt. It is unacceptable. The legislation we are \ntalking about today seeks to lighten the burden on student borrowers \nand to put money back in their pockets and to help fuel our economy \nbut, more importantly, to help everyone understand that in this Nation \nwe are still doing everything possible to lead the globe in education.\n  There is a lot of work to do. My team is trying to focus on some \nissues I saw as mayor. For example, when I was mayor we worked with \nschools and financial aid counselors to help families simply fill out \nthese forms that are necessary to obtain aid.\n  The College Board estimates that 2.3 million students do not fill out \nthe free application for financial aid form, better known as the FAFSA \nform. They don't fill it out because of its complexities. They don't \nfill it out because of issues that make it difficult to even report \nwhat is necessary. As a result, many qualified students are skipping \nthis process because they find it complex and burdensome. They are not \neven getting into college, not even afforded that pathway to cultivate \ntheir genius and apply it to our economy.\n  So much more can be done. This should be a national call to make \ncollege as affordable in this generation as it was for past \ngenerations. Past generations in America led the globe and drove the \ntop economy on Earth because of that education, but now we are raising \nthe wall and shutting out more of our young minds from this pathway \nbecause of unaffordable colleges.\n  For individuals, a college education translates to more than just odd \njob opportunities, more than just higher earnings, it is an ascent up \nthe economic ladder.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I will conclude with this: In a recent \nstudy, it was found that the United States could add $500 billion to \nthe gross domestic product over the next 15 years by increasing the \nnumber of workers with postsecondary education by 20 million--more \nworkers, a greater economy, a more successful America, and a nation \nthat leads the globe. Let's do and learn from what our parents and \ngrandparents knew and did in this body and around the Nation.\n  Let's make college affordable for our citizens.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, on the Senate floor we have been focusing \non policies that give Americans a fair shot, bills that would help to \nreverse the growing trend of income inequality and create more \nopportunities to climb the economic ladder, the idea that if you work \nhard and plays by the rules, you can do well for your family and you \ncan create a better opportunity for your children and their children.\n  Making college more affordable and reducing student loan debt is \ncentral to these goals. In fact, I think it is the middle-class issue \nof our generation.\n  It is hard to get ahead nowadays without a college degree, but the \ncost of college is growing faster than the cost of all other consumer \ngoods--twice as fast as health care costs.\n  The growing cost of college is preventing some from getting a degree \nin the first place and leaving others with unmanageable levels of debt. \nThis is the middle-class issue of our time.\n  Students have taken on more than $1 trillion in debt to cover the \ncost of college. Student debt is now the fastest growing and highest \nconsumer debt burden behind mortgages.\n  This debt burden is not sustainable. Saddled with this debt, young \nadults are delaying starting families, buying homes and cars, and \nstarting new businesses. The rate at which students are failing to \nrepay their loans is alarming. Over one-third of borrowers who are in \nrepayment are delinquent on their loans by 90 days or more. One-third \nof borrowers are delinquent.\n  One of my constituents from Wahiawa, HI, took out a loan to help \ntheir son go to college. The loan was for $92,000 in 2006. Today they \nowe $143,000. This local resident says:\n\n       The interest compounds. It's like a loan shark, pretty \n     close. There's no way out. No way to pay it, ever.\n\n  We are hearing these stories far too often from many families in \nHawaii and across the country, and they need our help. A college \neducation is supposed to be a path to opportunity and the American \ndream, not a life of debt. It is clear our current system is not \nworking.\n  The Federal Government is giving $140 billion a year in financial aid \nto institutions of higher learning in Federal grants and loans. That is \ngood, not bad. Higher education is the straightest line for us to \ndevelop the workforce we need and for people to move up the economic \nladder, but with that $140 billion we should be making college more \naffordable for students. Instead, we are getting the opposite result \nfor the $140 billion.\n  Average Pell grant awards have increased by almost 20 percent in the \npast 10 years. In that same time period, Pell grants covered 25 percent \nless of the average public school's tuition and fees. We are paying \nmore and we are getting less. There is a growing gap between the \nfinancial aid that is available to students and the cost of college. To \nfill that gap, students are loading up on debt.\n  Last summer, Congress passed a bipartisan student loan compromise \nthat lowered the student loan interest rate for new borrowers, but \nmillions of student borrowers were left out of that deal and are paying \nmuch higher rates.\n  I am proud to join Senator Warren in introducing the Bank on Students \nEmergency Loan Refinancing Act. This bill will allow students with \noutstanding student loan debt to refinance at the same low interest \nrates offered to new borrowers under the bipartisan student loan \ncompromise.\n  That is fair. Students struggling with student debt deserve to get \nthe same deal Congress is giving to new borrowers. But when we talk \nabout making colleges more affordable, we need to remember that \nlowering student loan interest rates is only part of the problem. It is \nnot just the interest; it is the principal.\n  We need a bold long-term plan to bring down the cost of college. That \nis why I introduced the College Affordability and Innovation Act with \nSenators Chris Murphy, Patty Murray, and Bernie Sanders. The bill is \nabout holding schools accountable to taxpayers and students. We want to \nreward those schools that are focused on affordability and give \nincentives for the rest to make affordability part of their mission. If \nyou are a college, you can have whatever mission you want, but you have \nno special right to Federal funding.\n  Our bill says, very simply, if you receive Federal dollars, part of \nyour mission must be about affordability and access. There are \npotentially billions of dollars that are not being used wisely.\n  As we invest in higher education--and we should, through student loan \nsubsidies and Federal financial aid--we should make sure schools are \nactually fulfilling our Federal public policy goals of making college \nmore affordable and more accessible for all students.\n  Let's work together to make sure a college education is a path of \nopportunity for all students and not a life of debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2785-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2785-S2786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF THE ARMY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Graham and I introduced a \nbill to establish a National Commission on the Future of the Army, an \nindependent panel that will bear the responsibility of analyzing some \nmajor changes to the U.S. Army that were proposed in the President's \nbudget. The Army's budget for Fiscal Year 2015 sets a path toward \nmajor, irreversible changes to Army capacity and capability, \nparticularly in the Army National Guard and Army Reserves, that cannot \nbe ignored by the Congress.\n  Senator Graham, my fellow co-chair of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, has said repeatedly that these changes fundamentally alter what \nit means for the National Guard to be a combat reserve of the Army. The \nchanges would also render the Nation's operational reserve insufficient \nin its ability to retain gains in experience and readiness that the \nreserve has achieved over a decade of continuous deployment. Most \ndramatically, these changes would transfer all of the National Guard's \nAH-64 Apaches to the active component, leaving the Nation without any \ncombat reserves for one of the aircraft most essential to ground \noperations.\n  But the changes that the President's budget proposal would begin to \nmake next year go much deeper. They would eventually reduce the \nNation's Army National Guard to 315,000 soldiers, the fewest in \ndecades. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Odierno, testified \nbefore the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense that this \nnumber is too low.\n  General Odierno said that, at that level, if any of our assumptions \nabout future conflict were wrong--that is unless operations were short, \ndecisive, and did not require significant sustainability--then we would \nnot be prepared. Our Nation's defense would be ill-prepared for future \nconflicts in the mold of past conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq, \nVietnam, or Korea.\n  No one needs to be reminded of the tight fiscal constraints our \ngovernment currently faces, and that sequestration, unfortunately, \nremains the law of the land. Simply barring any changes from taking \nplace in America's Army is not an option. The legislation that Senator \nGraham and I propose will allow several of the Army's proposed cost-\navoidance measures to move forward, while permitting time for a \ncommission to study the major and truly controversial changes that have \nbeen proposed.\n  In addition to tasking the commission with considering overall size \nand force mix of the Army, this legislation calls for an evaluation of \nforce generation assumptions. That is because the policies put into \nplace during 13 years of war are not the same as those that will be \nneeded post-drawdown, and determining the right modifications is \nessential to planning for the use and structure of the Army of the next \ndecade.\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n  Congress, under the authorities granted by the Constitution, has a \nresponsibility to both raise and equip armies, and to regulate that \nportion of the militia which is called into Federal Service. When a \nbudget proposal makes changes in those areas that are as considerable \nas these, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to hit the pause \nbutton and to ask for a second look.\n  We look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to \nensure that we properly balance and size the Army, and that we do not \nrepeat past mistakes by needlessly discarding the depth of our forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2786-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LEWIS D. CARTER JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an accomplished \neducator from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Lewis D. \nCarter Jr. will retire from his position of superintendent of the \nMonroe Country Schools on July 1--nearly 40 years after beginning his \ncareer in education.\n  An intense passion for education runs throughout the Carter family. \nLewis's grandfather was the first in the family to hold the post of \nsuperintendent of the Monroe County Schools in the early 1900s. His \nfather also held the position for 28 years until his retirement in \n1980, and his great-aunt and his great-uncle held the same position \nnear the time of his grandfather. For Carter, teaching the next \ngeneration of children might as well be ingrained in his DNA.\n  Carter got his start in 1975 teaching health and PE. Since then, he \nhas held positions across the education field. In 1991, he was made \nprincipal of Tompkinsville Elementary School. In 1994, he began 10 \nyears as the director of adult education, in addition to coordinating \nthe School to Work program. More recently he served as the deputy \nexecutive director of the Kentucky Education Cabinet--an assignment \nthat immediately preceded his current position.\n  Carter will have plenty to keep him busy in retirement. In addition \nto his large family he and his wife of 42 years, Sheila, have two \nchildren and six grandchildren--Lewis will let you know that he has a \n``hunting, fishing and golfing list'' that requires his attention.\n  While Lewis can look forward to some much deserved fun in his \nretirement, he will be sorely missed in the Monroe County School \nSystem. Lewis's big heart and passion for education serve as an example \nfor us all. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring \nthis exemplary citizen.\n  Mr. President, The Daily Times recently published an article \nchronicling Lewis D. Carter Jr.'s career. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From the Daily Times, April 11, 2014]\n\n                           Carter Will Retire\n\n                           (By Gina Kinslow)\n\n       After five years as superintendent of Monroe County \n     schools, Lewis Carter is stepping down.\n       Carter announced his retirement Thursday night during the \n     Monroe County Board of Education meeting. It becomes \n     effective July 1.\n       After making his announcement, staff members and others \n     present for the meeting, applauded and gave him a standing \n     ovation.\n       Carter cited his age as one reason for retiring. He is 62. \n     ``I think it's time [to retire],'' he said. ``I feel like \n     it's time.''\n       Another reason for retiring is the success the school \n     system has achieved in the last five years.\n       ``I want to make sure when I retire that everything is \n     good,'' he said.\n       Carter read a lengthy list of accomplishments for the \n     school district before announcing his retirement.\n       ``When I first came here, we set goals as the whole \n     administrative staff,'' he said. ``We met every single goal \n     without exception. When our team met the last goal, I said to \n     myself, `That's good.' That was in December.''\n       That last goal was seeing Monroe County High School become \n     a high-achieving school and being listed in the 94.6 \n     percentile.\n       ``When I came here, we were like in the 28 percentile,'' he \n     said.\n       Carter pointed out successes achieved by other schools in \n     the district, including Monroe County Middle School becoming \n     a national school to watch and being named one of the top-10 \n     achieving middle schools in the state.\n       He noted Tompkinsville Elementary has been named a Blue \n     Ribbon School nominee and Gamaliel Elementary won the \n     Winners' Circle Choice Award in the Kentucky Tell Survey. GES \n     was also recognized by the Kentucky Department of Education \n     as an honor school two years in a row.\n       Joe Harrison Carter Elementary was named the overall winner \n     of the Governor's Cup academic competition and has been \n     recognized as K-PREP [Kentucky Performance Rating for \n     Educational Progress] progressing school.\n       Toby Chapman, school board chairman, learned of Carter's \n     retirement plans on Tuesday and said the news came as a \n     shock.\n       ``He had another year on his contract. I thought he was \n     going to stay, but evidently he's ready to go,'' Chapman \n     said.\n       Carter had a two-year contract with the school board to \n     serve as superintendent.\n       Chapman praised Carter for the good job he has done as \n     superintendent.\n       ``I won't say we've always seen eye-to-eye on everything, \n     but we've always worked out what was best for the kids,'' \n     Chapman said.\n       Carter succeeded Rachel Ford and Liz Willett, who served as \n     interim superintendents, following the resignation of George \n     Wilson as superintendent.\n       Prior to becoming superintendent of Monroe County schools, \n     Carter served as deputy executive director of the Kentucky \n     Workforce and Education Cabinet. He also served in many roles \n     for the Monroe County school system during his career, \n     including as assistant principal and then principal of \n     Tompkinsville Elementary.\n       He began his career in education in 1975 teaching health \n     and physical education, as well as coaching school athletic \n     teams.\n       As for his retirement plans, Carter said, ``I have a \n     hunting, fishing and golfing list. I plan to have fun.''\n       Dr. Michael Carter, school board member, said he will miss \n     Carter.\n       ``Lewis has always been a great spokesman for our school \n     and I know he truly cares about our schools and our \n     children,'' he said. ``I don't think we will find anybody who \n     cares more than Mr. Carter does.''\n       Eddie Proffitt, also a school board member, said Carter has \n     done a lot for the school system.\n       ``He was a good superintendent. He will be hard to \n     replace,'' Proffitt said.\n       The search for a replacement will begin as soon as \n     possible.\n       ``e're going to meet with Lewis tomorrow. We are going to \n     call a lawyer and get the ball rolling, so probably in the \n     next couple of weeks we'll be advertising for applications,'' \n     Chapman said.\n       He hopes to have a new superintendent hired by the first of \n     June, so they can spend a month working with Carter, since \n     his last day will be June 30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2786-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONDEMNING ABDUCTION OF FEMALE STUDENTS IN NIGERIA\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, today I was honored to take part in a \nceremony honoring Israeli President Shimon Peres. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the remarks I made at the ceremony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [May 7, 2014]\n\n                   Luncheon in Honor of Shimon Peres\n\n\n                     Remarks by Senator John McCain\n\n       It is my pleasure to join all of you today as we honor \n     President Shimon Peres, one of the bravest and most \n     principled political leaders of our time. I was honored to \n     join with my colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation \n     bestowing the congressional gold medal on this great man. I \n     was not surprised when that legislation passed unanimously, \n     and it my hope that our colleagues in the House will move \n     forward with their own legislation soon.\n       President Peres deserves this honor. The story of his life \n     is entwined with the story of\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\n     the birth and development of the State of Israel, and in him \n     we see the essence of Israel itself--an invincible spirit \n     that cannot be denied. Through his determination, his \n     strength and perseverance, and his profound compassion, \n     President Peres enabled a seemingly impossible dream to \n     become a reality and changed forever the destiny of the \n     Jewish people.\n       Even as a young man, Shimon Peres showed a dedication to \n     public service and a commitment to the pursuit of justice and \n     peace. He was an active leader in the ``Working Youth'' \n     group, he founded a kibbutz in the Jordan Valley, and became \n     a member of the Haganah [hah-gah-nah]--all before he reached \n     21.\n       Over the course of his seventy years of public service, \n     President Peres has served as a member of the Knesset for 48 \n     years and held virtually every position in dozens of \n     cabinets, serving in nearly two dozen ministerial posts \n     including twice as Prime Minister, and as Defense Minister, \n     Treasury Minister, and Foreign Minister. He was then elected \n     as the ninth President of the State of Israel, the position \n     he holds today.\n       I have met many brave and inspiring people in my life, but \n     there are few who have done more to preserve freedom for \n     future generations than Shimon Peres. He recognized that the \n     highest duty of leaders is to protect and preserve the \n     freedom and security of their people, even in the face of \n     hostility and in the face of doubt and disappointment. And \n     this is just what President Peres has done, not only for the \n     Jewish people but for all people.\n       He has been a leader for strength, building Israel's \n     military and defense capabilities. He has been a leader for \n     prosperity, helping make Israel one of the strongest \n     economies in the world today. And he has been a leader for \n     peace, making difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions in \n     persuading the Palestinians to pursue negotiations and find \n     peace for all, standing by his belief that all children, both \n     Israeli and Arab alike, deserve the chance to grow up and \n     grow old free from the threat of violence and tyranny.\n       In the time that I have known Shimon Peres, I have been \n     inspired by his statesmanship, leadership, courage and \n     civility. And among his many virtues, I have been most \n     inspired by his idealism. Shimon Peres has always been a \n     dreamer. He once said that ``dreaming is only being \n     pragmatic''--words that drew criticism from some and laughter \n     from others.\n       But he is right, of course. It is difficult to understand \n     how someone who has witnessed such unspeakable horrors in his \n     life can still place such faith in dreams. But it is due in \n     part to his optimism and idealism, and his willingness to \n     serve on behalf of those dreams, that Israel exists today. By \n     never giving up on his dreams, Shimon Peres reminds us that \n     we do not need to give in to complacency or cynicism--and why \n     we can't afford to.\n       So I join all of you in recognizing the great achievements \n     of Shimon Peres. And I thank you for devoting your time to \n     honor this great man. With your help, it is my hope that our \n     friends in the House will complete the necessary legislation, \n     and all of us in Congress will be able to join together to \n     express the abiding affection and admiration that we and the \n     American people have for one of Israel's most distinguished \n     sons--a man whose inspiration and impact will endure far \n     beyond the generations who have witnessed them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2787-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MARRINER S. ECCLES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Over time, many Utahns have been honored for their \ncontributions to our country, and perhaps no one contributed more to \nour Nation's economic success at such a critical time than Marriner S. \nEccles. I am honored to stand with the Eccles family this week as the \nFederal Reserve unveils a statue of Marriner Eccles in the atrium of \nthe Marriner S. Eccles Building of the Federal Reserve Board in \nWashington, DC.\n  Marriner Stoddard Eccles was born in Logan, UT, on September 9, 1890, \nthe oldest of nine children. Following the death of his father, who had \nbecome a leading industrialist with numerous enterprises, Marriner, at \nthe young age of 22, took over the leadership of his father's \nbusinesses that were left to his mother, Ellen Eccles, and Marriner and \nhis siblings. Previously, Marriner had worked in several of his \nfather's businesses, had served a mission for the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter Day Saints, LDS, in Scotland and had attended Brigham \nYoung College in Logan.\n  A superb business analyst and bold administrator, he reorganized and \nconsolidated his father's industrial conglomerate and banking network. \nEccles, along with his brother George, joined with the Browning family \nin Ogden, UT, to form the Eccles-Browning Affiliated Banks, believed to \nbe the first multibank holding company in the United States.\n  With the onset of the Great Depression of the 1930s, banks around the \ncountry faced customers rushing to withdraw their deposits. The Eccles-\nBrowning Affiliated Banks withstood several bank runs, and in the \nprocess, Eccles began to understand the need for a compensatory fiscal \nand monetary policy. In July of 1933, Eccles was one of the experts \nsummoned by the Senate Finance Committee to travel to Washington to \ncounsel Congress on the profound economic turmoil that was occurring \nacross the country.\n  Eccles delivered 38 pages of testimony, including a distinct 5-point \nplan for fixing the economy. ``We must correct the causes of the \ndepression rather than deal with the effects of it!'' became one of the \nmost quoted lines from Eccles' dramatic testimony. His five-point plan \nincluded unemployment relief through direct aid to the States, a bank \ndeposit guarantee program, canceling the World War I Allies' war debt, \nimplementing a national minimum wage, and establishing a national \neconomic planning board.\n  Eccles made his points clearly enough that the Roosevelt \nadministration invited Eccles to join as an Assistant Treasury \nSecretary. Even when asked by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to \nbecome a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, Eccles stood strong and \nreplied he would ``not unless fundamental changes [were] made in the \n(Federal Reserve).''\n  Eccles' involvement with policymaking did not stop there. He became \ninvolved with the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, the Federal Housing \nAct of 1934, and the 1933 law creating the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation. With FDR's blessing, Eccles rewrote the 1935 Federal \nReserve Act and became the first Chairman of the reorganized Federal \nReserve Board, serving from 1936 to 1948. In February 1944, Roosevelt \nappointed Eccles to another 14-year term and Eccles stayed on the Board \nuntil 1951, when he resigned, marking a total of 17 years of service.\n  Eccles' talents combined with the policies he supported helped \ncounter the recession crisis of 1937-1938, which in turn helped build \nAmerica's economic strength prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor and \nWorld War II.\n  Many at the time considered Marriner Eccles' policies to be radical, \nbut there is little doubt that his influence at the Federal Reserve \ncontinues to benefit our country today.\n  It is my honor to stand with the Eccles family this week and unveil \nyet another tribute to this remarkable Utahn we are so proud of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2787-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2787-S2788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY THROUGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to support the introduction \nof a bill I am cosponsoring, the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality \nCharter Schools Act.\n  Charter schools are about freedom for teachers, choices for parents, \nand more and better opportunities for students.\n  I gave the weekly address for the Republican Party on Easter weekend, \nand I said that, instead of mandating tasks for you to do, government \nshould enable you to create a happier, safer, more prosperous life.\n  This bill is just the kind of proposal that enables people. It \nenables parents to help their children get a real opportunity by \nchoosing better schools for them to attend. It enables students to \nlearn and succeed. It enables teachers to succeed by giving them the \nfreedom to use their firsthand knowledge.\n  And it enables administrators to succeed by freeing them from \nbureaucratic mandates and giving them the chance to use their good \njudgment.\n  The bill would continue the Federal charter schools program, which \nsince 1994 has given grants to states to start new charter schools. It \nwould make improvements to that program to ensure that those funds are \nused as effectively as possible to increase the number of high-quality \ncharter schools.\n  Specifically, this bill would invest more Federal funds in the \nreplication and expansion of high-quality charter schools with a proven \nrecord of success, while still giving States the flexibility to invest \nin innovative new models.\n  The bill would continue Federal support for non-profit organizations \nwhich help charter schools find suitable facilities, while also \nencouraging States to assist charter schools in this task.\n  It would provide those hard-working and creative educators seeking to \nopen\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\ncharter schools with greater flexibility in how they use Federal \nstartup grants, for example, by allowing them to use the funds for \ntransportation or for facilities improvements if that is what they \ndecide is the best use of funds.\n  Finally, this legislation would encourage States to provide charter \nschools with the support they need to be successful and to hold them \naccountable when they fail to demonstrate positive results.\n  Last summer, Senator Rand Paul and I sat in a room with the parents \nwho had been able to get their child into a charter school in \nNashville, where 600 students were left on the waiting list.\n  It was an emotional experience to hear these parents talk about their \nchild getting this opportunity, to hear the students talk about how \nwell they are doing, and to hear from the teachers who spend their \nlives helping these students.\n  Charter schools are public schools stripped of many Federal, State \nand union rules and constraints placed on traditional public schools. \nThe money the State government would ordinarily spend on their district \nschool follows each child to the charter school instead.\n  Charter schools cannot charge tuition, and any student who wants to \nattend a charter school may do so if space is available.\n  If more students want to attend than can be accommodated, the charter \nschool must use a lottery to decide which students receive a seat.\n  Several years ago I visited the Memphis Academy of Science and \nEngineering, a charter school in Memphis. While most Memphis students \nwere on spring break at the time, the sophomores I visited were in the \nclassroom studying Advanced Placement biology.\n  Because the school's teachers have the flexibility to do what is best \nfor their students, the school was open 12 hours a day and on Saturday \nmornings because many of these children did not have as much at home as \nothers. And these children, who the year before had been at schools \ndeemed ``low-performing,'' were succeeding.\n  These students were fortunate because their parents had the \nopportunity to choose this charter school, and their children were \nlucky enough to win a seat.\n  Across Tennessee, more than 15,000 students now have that same \nopportunity to attend one of 68 charter schools--and they are thriving \nas a result.\n  A recent study by Stanford University found that, on average, \nTennessee students attending charter schools gain the equivalent of 86 \nadditional days of instruction in reading and 72 additional days of \ninstruction in math each year than do students attending district \nschools.\n  In other words, they make almost a year-and-a-half's worth of \nprogress in a single school year.\n  About 60 percent of students attending charter schools in Tennessee \nare low-income, more than 90 percent are African American or Hispanic.\n  In other words, charter schools in Tennessee are making a difference \nfor those students who have traditionally been least well served by our \nNation's public schools.\n  We have come a long way since 1992, when, in my last act as U.S. \nEducation Secretary under George H.W. Bush, I sent a letter to every \nschool superintendent across the country, urging them to consider \nreplicating the early successes of charter schools in Minnesota--which \nwere then called ``start-from-scratch schools.''\n  At the time, there were only a dozen charter schools in existence. \nToday, there are well over 6,000, serving over 2.5 million students. \nNearly 5 percent of all public schools students in the United States \nnow attend charters.\n  Most important--the fact that should give great urgency to our effort \nhere today--there are an estimated 580,000 students on waiting lists \nfor charter schools throughout the Nation.\n  That is because parents and students see that charter schools are \nworking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE FRANKLIN REGIONAL COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the heroic acts \nof students and teachers during the crisis at Franklin Regional High \nSchool in Murrysville, PA. The entire community displayed astounding \ncourage in the face of tragedy.\n  On the morning of April 9, 2014, a knife-wielding student assaulted \nstudents and teachers at Franklin Regional High School. During the \nattack, 24 people were injured, some gravely. However, thanks to the \nselfless actions of students, faculty, and support staff, the attacker \nwas subdued and additional harm was prevented.\n  Students shielded friends from danger and administered emergency \nfirst aid, an attentive student had the composure to sound the fire \nalarm to warn people to exit the building, and several brave \nindividuals put their safety on the line to incapacitate the attacker. \nAt a time of crisis, the Franklin Regional family proved their \ncommitment to one another.\n  I also want to acknowledge the brave actions of law enforcement and \nemergency personnel whose quick arrival ensured the safety of our \nstudents. Their prompt arrival provided lifesaving medical attention to \ninjured students and the community remains indebted to their vigilance.\n  I believe that the Senate should recognize the Franklin Regional \ncommunity for their bravery and resiliency. It is imperative that the \ncommunity knows that our country shares their grief and stands with \nthem as they overcome this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2788-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RECOGNIZING ADAM BOYD\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful Farm Bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Hardin County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Hardin County worth over $2.3 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $10 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be our shared \ncommitment to school construction, renovation, and fire safety through \nthe Harkin grant program. Working together with state and local \ncommunities, this funding has ensured Iowa students are learning in \nschools that are safe, and modern. I look forward to learning about the \nrenovations made possible in Hardin County.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northern Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Hardin \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nHardin County, I have fought for funding for the Iowa National Guard \nReadiness Center in Iowa Falls worth $2 million, helping to create jobs \nand expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That's why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Hardin County has received $396,191 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Hardin County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $73,350.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Hardin County has received more than $6.6 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as--\nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Hardin County's \nfire departments have received over $1.3 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\ndisabilities. As the primary author of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (ADA) and the ADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for \nour fellow citizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly \na quarter century since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nHardin County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Hardin County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Hardin \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2790-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HAMILTON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans.\n  Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing \nfunds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program has \nallowed towns like Jewell to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that \nHamilton County has earned $240,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings. They build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize OWL and \nthe important work that it does for older women in our country. For \nmore than 30 years, OWL has served as the only national nonprofit to \nfocus solely on the issues of aging American women and be the voice for \nthe 74 million mid-life and older women in our country.\n  Every Mother's Day, OWL focuses on a key issue that affects our \nNation's aging women--our mothers, grandmothers, wives, sisters, aunts, \nand friends. Past issues of OWL's Mother's Day Campaign have ranged \nfrom examining our Nation's health care system, addressing the growing \nepidemic of elder abuse, and educating women on end-of-life choices. \nThis year, OWL has chosen to focus on the need for quality, accessible \nlong-term care. Women often serve as the primary caregivers for a loved \none, and women also may need long-term services and supports as they \noutlive men. Today, OWL is hosting a briefing to unveil a report on key \nfindings and discuss how this year's Mother's Day Campaign can create a \ndialogue around this topic.\n  I particularly look forward to seeing their findings this year. As \nchairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and particularly this \nMay in observance of Older Americans Month, I am well aware of the need \nto examine the long-term care system in America. As the population ages \nand more Americans need long-term care services and supports, it is \nimportant that they receive high-quality care without placing a burden \non their families. The Aging Committee has and will continue to examine \nthis topic and raise awareness of the issues surrounding our Nation's \nlong-term care.\n  OWL's continued work across the Nation is more critical now than ever \nbefore, and we must ensure that our existing long-term care system is \nable to meet the needs of America's women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2791-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2791-S2792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ROBERT LEON DUNLAP\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto note the passing of Robert Leon Dunlap, of North Charleston, SC. He \ndied Thursday, April 17 at the age of 83.\n  Dunlap attended Midland Park Elementary School and graduated from \nNorth Charleston High School. He served in the Army during the Korean \nwar, and was a 52-year veteran of the Charleston County Volunteer Fire \nand Rescue Squad. Robert was also married to Gloria Massalon Dunlap for \n52 years.\n  Assistant Chief Dunlap helped found, and served in, the North \nCharleston Volunteer Rescue Association, which in 1973 was expanded to \ninclude all of Charleston County. This volunteer organization responds \nfor accidents, fires, and land and water rescues. Dunlap was the \nassociation's treasurer more than 50 years. He earned the Order of the \nPalmetto for his services, and the current North Charleston \nheadquarters is named in his honor.\n  While fulfilling his rescue duties, Dunlap also worked at the \nCharleston Naval Shipyard.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004--\nas modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in \nExecutive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of \nFebruary 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive \nOrder 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, \nExecutive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of \nMay 1, 2012--is to continue in effect beyond May 11, 2014.\n  The regime's brutal war on the Syrian people, who have been calling \nfor freedom and a representative government, endangers not only the \nSyrian people themselves, but could yield greater instability \nthroughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, \nincluding supporting terrorist organizations and impeding the Lebanese \ngovernment's ability to function effectively, continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national \nemergency declared with respect to this threat and to maintain in force \nthe sanctions to address this national emergency.\n  In addition, the United States condemns the Asad regime's use of \nbrutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Asad regime to \nstop its violent war and allow a political transition in Syria that \nwill forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, \nopportunity, and justice.\n  The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, \nand actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to \ncontinue or terminate this national emergency in the future.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                          The White House, May 7, 2014.\n\n                                 Notice\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of \n                        the government of syria\n\n  On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria \nAccountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act Of 2003, Public \nLaw 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he \ndeclared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive \nOrder 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and \nprohibited the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. \nThe national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for \nadditional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, \nExecutive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of \nApril 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order \n13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and \nExecutive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.\n  The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States constituted by the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-\nexisting occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction \nand missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts \nwith respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.\n  The regime's brutal war on the Syrian people, who have been calling \nfor freedom and a representative government, endangers not only the \nSyrian people themselves but also is generating instability throughout \nthe region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including the use \nof chemical\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\nweapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and impeding the Lebanese \ngovernment's ability to function effectively, continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national \nemergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that \nemergency adopted on that date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, \n2006, in Executive Order 13399; on February 13, 2008, in Executive \nOrder 13460; on April 29, 2011, in Executive Order 13572; on May 18, \n2011, in Executive Order 13573; on August 17, 2011, in Executive Order \n13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, \nin Executive Order 13608; must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2014. \nTherefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the \nnational emergency declared with respect to the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria.\n  In addition, the United States condemns the Asad regime's use of \nbrutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Asad regime to \nstop its violent war and allow a political transition in Syria that \nwill forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, \nopportunity, and justice.\n  The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, \nand actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to \ncontinue or terminate this national emergency in the future.\n  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and \ntransmitted to the Congress.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 7, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 9:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4120.

A bill to amend the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to \nreauthorize a provision to ensure the survival and continuing vitality \nof Native American languages; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today Senator Murkowski \nand I introduce the Native American Languages Reauthorization Act of \n2014. We are also joined by our fellow colleagues and cosponsors of \nthis bill: Senators Begich, Franken, Heinrich, Hirono, King, Schatz, \nTester, and Tom Udall.\n  Since the Native American Languages Act of 1992 became law, we have \nmade considerable progress in keeping native languages alive. The \nNative American Languages Act of 1992 established a grant program \nwithin the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to ensure the survival \nof native languages. Through the Health and Human Services Department \nAdministration for Native Americans, the native languages grant program \nhas made documented impacts on the revival of Native languages across \nIndian Country.\n  The bill we introduce today will reauthorize the native languages \ngrant program until fiscal year 2019. The Native language grant program \nhas made several reports to Congress on the significant impacts that \nits grants have for native communities. In the 2012 report on the \nImpact and Effectiveness of Administration for Native American \nProjects, out of the 63 total language grantees, Administration for \nNative Americans evaluated 22 language projects from across Indian \nCountry. The 2012 impact data showed that from these 22 projects a \ntotal of 178 language teachers were trained; 2,340 youth had increased \ntheir ability to speak a Native language or achieved fluency; and 2,586 \nadults had increased their ability to speak a Native language or \nachieved fluency.\n  Promoting Native language programs will strengthen our Native \ncultures and, according to the National Indian Education Association, \nwill also promote higher academic success in other areas of learning. \nThe continuity of Native languages is a link to previous generations \nand should be preserved for future generations.\n  The Native Americans Languages Act has helped to save native \nlanguages and encourages both young children and adults to develop a \nfluency in their Native language. Across South Dakota and Indian \nCountry, this vital grant funding gives the opportunity for our \ncherished Native elders to sit down with the younger generation to pass \non native languages. We must continue our efforts to promote Native \nlanguage revitalization programs to ensure the preservation of Native \nAmerican cultures, histories, and traditions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us and reauthorize this important \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nto save and preserve native languages before it is too late.\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Portman, Mr. Markey, \n        Mr. Toomey, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. McCain, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 2301. A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States \nCode, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I will introduce legislation that \nwill help victims of one of the most vicious crimes and one of the most \nevil crimes in our society: child pornography.\n  When Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act more than 20 \nyears ago--and I had a lot to do with that, and then-Senator Biden \ndeserves an awful lot of the credit for that--the law required that the \ndefendant in a child sexual exploitation case must pay restitution \n``for the full amount of the victim's losses.'' Those losses can \ninclude lost income as well as expenses for medical services, therapy, \nrehabilitation, transportation, and childcare.\n  The restitution statute works in a straightforward way for crimes \nthat involve individual defendants who cause specific harm to \nparticular victims. But child pornography is different. Victims not \nonly suffer from the initial abuse, but they continue to suffer as \nimages of that abuse are created, distributed, and possessed. As the \nSupreme Court recently put it, ``Every viewing of child pornography is \na repetition of the victim's abuse.''\n  In the Internet age, a child pornography victim's abuse never ends, \nbut identifying everyone who contributes to that ongoing abuse can be \ndifficult, if not impossible. A predator who commits and records the \nabuse might be readily identified. Those who distribute those images, \nhowever, are harder to find, and many who obtain and possess them might \nnever be identified at all. They may get lost in the crowd. They may \nseek safety in shadows. But the harm they cause to victims is no less \ndevastating.\n  Our challenge is to craft a restitution statute suited for this \nunique kind of crime. We are meeting that challenge today by \nintroducing the Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution \nImprovement Act. Amy and Vicky are victims in two of the most widely \ndistributed child pornography series in the world. They know how \ndifficult it is to seek restitution for ongoing harm caused by unknown \npeople.\n  The Supreme Court reviewed Amy's case and issued a decision on April \n23, titled ``Paroline v. United States.'' The Court said the existing \nrestitution statute is not suited for her kind of case because it \nrequires proving how one defendant's possession of particular images \nconcretely harmed an individual victim. That is simply impossible to \nprove and puts the burden on victims forever to chase defendants only \nto recover next to nothing.\n  Several of my colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, joined me \non a legal brief in that case. We hoped that the Supreme Court would \nconstrue the existing statute in a way that was workable to protect \nchild pornography victims. The Court chose not to do that, and it is up \nto Congress to craft a statute that works. I believe we are up to the \ntask, and the bill I am introducing today is the way to do it.\n  The Amy and Vicky act creates an effective, balanced restitution \nprocess for victims of child pornography that responds to the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Paroline v. United States. It does three things. \nFirst, it considers a victim's total losses, including from individuals \nwho may not have yet been identified. This step reflects the unique \nnature of child pornography and its ongoing impact on its victims. \nSecondly, the bill requires real and timely restitution and gives \njudges options for making that happen. Third, it allows defendants who \nhave contributed to the same victim's losses to spread the cost of \nrestitution among themselves. If a victim was harmed by a single \ndefendant, the defendant must pay full restitution for all of the \nvictim's losses, but if a victim was harmed by multiple individuals, a \njudge has options for imposing restitution on a defendant, depending on \nthe circumstances of the case. The defendant can be required to pay the \nfull amount of the victim's losses or the defendant can pay less than \nthe full amount but at least a statutory minimum for crimes, such as \npossession, distribution or production of the child pornography.\n  In its decision in the Paroline case, the Supreme Court discussed \nwhether a defendant should pay full restitution for harms that he did \nnot cause entirely by himself. At the same time, the Court recognized \nthat the harm from child pornography flows from the trade or the \ncontinuing traffic in the images. It would be perverse to say that as \nmore individuals contribute to a victim's harm and loss by obtaining \nimages of her abuse, the less responsible each of them is so that the \nvictim ends up with nothing. The Amy and Vicky act addresses these \nissues.\n  A defendant may sue others who have harmed the same victim in order \nto spread the costs of restitution but must do so in a timely fashion \nand only after the victim has received real and timely payment. As my \ncolleagues may know, Federal law already provides for criminal \ndefendants who must pay restitution to do so on a payment schedule \nsuitable for their individual circumstances.\n  I wish to thank three groups of people who have been critical in \nbringing us to this point only 2 weeks after the Supreme Court's \ndecision. First and foremost, I wish to recognize and thank both Amy \nand Vicky, the brave women for whom this bill is named who represent so \nmany child pornography victims. Amy and Vicky both endorse this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from each of them be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Amy's Letter Supporting the Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim \n                  Restitution Improvement Act of 2014\n\n       I am writing today to give my support to the Amy and Vicky \n     Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act of 2014. \n     It is very important that this law get passed as soon as \n     possible.\n       The past eight years of my life have been filled with hope \n     and horror. Life was pretty horrible when I realized that the \n     pictures of my childhood sex abuse were on the Internet for \n     anyone and everyone to see. Imagine the worst most \n     humiliating moments of your life captured for everyone to see \n     forever. Then imagine that as a child you didn't even really \n     know what was happening to you and you didn't want it to \n     happen but you couldn't stop it. You were abused, raped, and \n     hurt and this is something that other people want. They enjoy \n     it. They can't stop collecting it and asking for it and \n     trading it with other people. And it's you. It's your life \n     and your pain that they are enjoying. And it never stops and \n     you are helpless to do anything ever to stop it. That's \n     horror.\n       There was also hope. Hope in finding someone who could help \n     me like my parents and my lawyer. And hope in meeting Joy, my \n     psychologist, who was the first person who really understood \n     what I was going through. Then I met Cindy, my therapist, who \n     also really helped me with all the twists and turns with what \n     I was feeling when I tried to make sense of my life and what \n     had happened to me as a child and what is happening to me on \n     the Internet. I felt lots of hope when my lawyer started \n     collecting restitution to help me pay my bills and my \n     therapist and for a car to drive to therapy and to just try \n     to create some kind of 'normal' life. Things were getting \n     better and better.\n       Then we started having problems with the restitution law. \n     Judges sometimes gave me just $100 and sometimes nothing at \n     all. A few judges really got it, like when I was at the Fifth \n     Circuit oral argument two years ago and the judges agreed \n     that the child sex abuse images of me really do cause ongoing \n     and long-term harm. The article by Emily Bazelon in the New \n     York Times also really helped to tell my story so that people \n     can understand what it's like to live with child pornography \n     every day of your life. I was really happy to discover \n     recently that her article received honorable mention in a \n     contest recognizing excellence in journalism.\n       After a long time and a lot of court hearings all over the \n     country, my case was finally at the Supreme Court. I couldn't \n     believe how long and how far my case and my story had gone \n     until I was sitting there in the Supreme Court surrounded by \n     so many of the people who have supported me and helped me \n     during these years. To hear the justices discussing my case \n     and my life was really overwhelming and gave me lots of hope \n     not just for myself but for other victims like Vicky who I \n     met for the first time right before the oral argument. I know \n     there were other victims there too who are too afraid to \n     speak out and too afraid to even think about what happened to \n     them and what is happening to them online, on the Internet, \n     because of their childhood sexual abuse and child \n     pornography. I hoped that at last the very important people \n     on the Supreme Court would decide that not just me, but all \n     the victims like me--who were so young when all these \n     horrible things happened to us--could get the restitution we \n     need to try and live a life like everyone else.\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n       All the justices were respectful and it was obvious that \n     they had thought a lot about the issues. When the oral \n     argument finished I was really hopeful that we would win the \n     case. It felt good doing something this significant to make a \n     difference in the world. It was a great feeling after so many \n     years of just trying to get it right.\n       My hope turned to horror when the Court decided two weeks \n     ago that restitution was ``impossible'' for victims like me \n     and Vicky and so many others. I couldn't believe that \n     something which is called mandatory restitution (twice) was \n     so hard to figure out. It just seemed like something \n     somewhere was missing. Why, if so many people are committing \n     this serious crime, why are the victims of that crime, who \n     are and were children after all, left out? The Court's \n     decision was even worse than getting no restitution at all. \n     It was sort of like getting negative restitution. It was a \n     horrible day.\n       This is why I am so happy, and hopeful, that Congress can \n     fix this problem once and for all. Maybe if they put \n     mandatory in the law for a third time judges will get it that \n     restitution really really really must be given to victims! \n     After all this time and all the hearings and appeals and the \n     Supreme Court, I definitely agree that restitution needs \n     improvement and hopefully this bill, the Amy and Vicky Child \n     Pornography Restitution Improvement Act of 2014, can finally \n     make restitution happen for all victims of this horrible \n     crime.\n       Thank you for supporting this law and working so hard to \n     give victims the hope and help they need to overcome the \n     nightmares and memories that most others will never know. \n     Thank you Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer for making my \n     hope real!\n     Amy (no longer) Unknown.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  ``Vicky,'' c/o Carol L. Hepburn,\n\n\n                                              Attorney at Law,\n\n                                         Seattle, WA, May 3, 2014.\n     Re Support for Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Restitution \n         Improvement Act\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Senator, U.S. Congress,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am the subject of the ``Vicky'' \n     series of child pornography images, which I have been told by \n     law enforcement agents is one of the most widely traded in \n     the world. I am writing to you under pseudonym, and through \n     my attorney, because I have been stalked by pedophiles in the \n     recent past and I am concerned that disclosure of my legal \n     name and address could lead to further stalking.\n       I appreciate the Supreme Court's recent recognition in the \n     Paroline decision of the pain and loss suffered by victims \n     and the need for mandatory restitution. This upholds both the \n     victim's need for compensation and helping the offender \n     realize they have hurt an actual person. The difficult part \n     of this decision is the immense amount of time and work \n     investment that will be required by the victim to collect \n     restitution, without the guarantee that they will ever \n     collect the full amount to be made whole again. With each \n     case in which the victim seeks restitution from someone who \n     has possessed and/or distributed their images, there is an \n     emotional cost just for being involved in the case. It brings \n     up the painful reality of the victim's situation of never-\n     ending humiliation and puts it right in the victim's face \n     once again. This decision places on the victim the huge \n     burden of several years of litigation without any promise of \n     closure. This is a dismal prospect because it leaves victims \n     like Amy and myself with the choice between not pursuing \n     restitution (which would not provide us with the help we \n     desperately need to heal) or continuing to have this painful \n     part of our lives in our face on a regular basis for several \n     more years, if not decades. Without any guidelines as to how \n     the district courts will calculate restitution from each \n     offender, I worry that the emotional toll may not be \n     adequately compensated for in the end. I sincerely hope that \n     Congress will take the time to create some guidelines for \n     restitution for victims of child pornography possession and \n     distribution that will protect the victim and enable them to \n     receive full compensation.\n       I would be happy to talk with you about this at some later \n     time. I am currently very pregnant and due to deliver my \n     first child in two weeks. I respectfully ask that you support \n     this legislation and do all that you can to see that it \n     becomes law.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                        ``Vicky''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Second, I wish to thank Amy and Vicky's legal team who \nwere instrumental in developing this legislation. They include \nProfessor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah School of Law, one of \nthe leading authorities on criminal law in this country, and attorneys \nJames Marsh of New York and Carol Hepburn in Seattle. Professor Cassell \nargued the Paroline case before the Supreme Court, and it is the \nexperience of these tireless advocates that informed how to respond to \nthat decision.\n  Third, I wish to thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who \njoin me in introducing this bill. In particular, I wish to recognize \nthe senior Senator from New York Mr. Schumer who also signed on to the \nlegal brief I filed in the Paroline case. We serve together on the \nJudiciary Committee, and he has long been a champion for crime victims.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from today's Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 6, 2014]\n\n Congress Needs To Act To Allow Victims of Child Sex Abuse To Recover \n                              Restitution\n\n                          (By Editoria1 Board)\n\n       ``I am a 19 year old girl and I am a victim of child sex \n     abuse and child pornography. I am still discovering all the \n     ways that the abuse and exploitation I suffer has hurt me. . \n     . .'' So began the victim impact statement of a young woman \n     who was 8 when she was raped but whose abuse has never ended \n     because the uncle who assaulted her took pictures that have \n     been widely trafficked on the Internet. ``It is hard to \n     describe what it feels like to know that at any moment, \n     anywhere, someone is looking at pictures of me as a little \n     girl being abused by my uncle and is getting some kind of \n     sick enjoyment from it,'' she wrote.\n       The Supreme Court did not dispute her suffering nor her \n     right to receive restitution from viewers who take pleasure \n     in her abuse and create the sordid market demand for child \n     pornography. But the court set aside the $3.4 million awarded \n     her. Now Congress needs to fix the law.\n       The 5-to-4 ruling in Paroline v. United States is a double-\n     edged sword for the advocates of child pornography victims. \n     It upholds part of the Violence Against Women Act, which \n     calls for restitution to victims such as ``Amy Unknown,'' as \n     the woman is identified in court papers, but it limits the \n     amount of damages proximate to the harm caused by a specific \n     offender--a standard that puts the burden on the victim and \n     makes it difficult to collect damages.\n       Doyle Randall Paroline, who pleaded guilty to possessing \n     child pornography that included images of Amy, was ordered by \n     an appeals court to pay all of the $3.4 million owed to Amy \n     for the psychological damage and lost income she has \n     suffered. The court's majority, in an opinion written by \n     Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, ruled that Mr. Paroline should be \n     assessed an amount that is not trivial but comports with \n     ``the defendant's relative role in the causal process that \n     underlies the victim's general losses.''\n       Justice Kennedy acknowledged that his approach ``is not \n     without difficulties.'' How should a court calculate the harm \n     caused by one person's possession of an image seen by \n     thousands? Mathematically dividing the total amount by the \n     number of estimated views produces an amount so small as to \n     be insulting rather than therapeutic. What, in short, is the \n     right number between zero and $3.4 million?\n       The justices are right in thinking that Congress should \n     revisit the issue. Legislation set to be introduced Wednesday \n     by Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-\n     Utah) seems to be a step in the right direction, with its \n     outline of options for full victim recovery when multiple \n     individuals are involved and giving multiple defendants who \n     have banned the same victim the ability to sue each other to \n     spread the cost of restitution. The court was clear in its \n     opinion that ``the victim should someday collect restitution \n     for all her child pornography losses.'' Congress needs to \n     provide the tools to turn that someday into reality.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. It says that the Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim \nRestitution Improvement Act is ``a step in the right direction.''\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in enacting this legislation. \nIt creates a practical process and recognizes the unique kind of harm \ncaused by child pornography and requires restitution in a manner that \nwill actually help victims.\n  In her letter, Amy writes that the legislation we are introducing \ntoday ``can finally make restitution happen for all victims of this \nhorrible crime.''\n  Let's get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2799-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2799-S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3010.

and\n       (E) another loan limitation, commonly known as the ``loan-\n     to-value'' test, is tied to the appraisal, which often does \n     not adjust for efficiency features of houses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (A) improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting by \n     Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy cost \n     savings are included in the underwriting process as described \n     below, and thus to reduce the amount of energy consumed by \n     homes and to facilitate the creation of energy efficiency \n     retrofit and construction jobs;\n       (B) require a covered agency to include the expected energy \n     cost savings of a homeowner as a regular expense in the \n     tests, such as the debt-to-income test, used to determine the \n     ability of the loan applicant to afford the cost of \n     homeownership for all loan programs; and\n       (C) require a covered agency to include the value home \n     buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house in tests \n     used to compare the mortgage amount to home value, taking \n     precautions to avoid double-counting and to support safe and \n     sound lending.\n       (c) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Criteria.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, in consultation \n     with the advisory group established in subsection (f)(2), \n     develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to \n     implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for use \n     when testing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a \n     covered loan, that account for the expected energy cost \n     savings for a loan applicant at a subject property, in the \n     manner set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).\n       (2) Requirements to account for energy cost savings.--The \n     enhanced loan eligibility requirements under paragraph (1) \n     shall require that, for all covered loans for which an energy \n     efficiency report is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee by \n     the mortgagor, the covered agency and the mortgagee shall \n     take into consideration the estimated energy cost savings \n     expected for the owner of the subject property in determining \n     whether the loan applicant has sufficient income to service \n     the mortgage debt plus other regular expenses. To the extent \n     that a covered agency uses a test such as a debt-to-income \n     test that includes certain regular expenses, such as hazard \n     insurance and property taxes, the expected energy cost \n     savings shall be included as an offset to these expenses. \n     Energy costs to be assessed include the cost of electricity, \n     natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regularly used to supply \n     energy to the subject property.\n       (3) Determination of estimated energy cost savings.--\n       (A) In general.--The guidelines to be issued under \n     paragraph (1) shall include instructions for the covered \n     agency to calculate estimated energy cost savings using--\n       (i) the energy efficiency report;\n       (ii) an estimate of baseline average energy costs; and\n       (iii) additional sources of information as determined by \n     the Secretary.\n       (B) Report requirements.--For the purposes of subparagraph \n     (A), an energy efficiency report shall--\n       (i) estimate the expected energy cost savings specific to \n     the subject property, based on specific information about the \n     property;\n       (ii) be prepared in accordance with the guidelines to be \n     issued under paragraph (1); and\n       (iii) be prepared--\n\n       (I) in accordance with the Residential Energy Service \n     Network's Home Energy Rating System (commonly known as \n     ``HERS'') by an individual certified by the Residential \n     Energy Service Network, unless the Secretary finds that the \n     use of HERS does not further the purposes of this section; or\n       (II) by other methods approved by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the advisory \n     group established in subsection (f)(2), for use under this \n     section, which shall include a third-party quality assurance \n     procedure.\n\n       (C) Use by appraiser.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     used under paragraph (2), the energy efficiency report shall \n     be provided to the appraiser to estimate the energy \n     efficiency of the subject property and for potential \n     adjustments for energy efficiency.\n       (4) Required disclosure to consumer for a home with an \n     energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued under \n     paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to--\n       (A) inform the loan applicant of the expected energy costs \n     as estimated in the energy efficiency report, in a manner and \n     at a time as prescribed by the Secretary, and if practicable, \n     in the documents delivered at the time of loan application; \n     and\n       (B) include the energy efficiency report in the \n     documentation for the loan provided to the borrower.\n       (5) Required disclosure to consumer for a home without an \n     energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is \n     not used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued \n     under paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to inform the \n     loan applicant in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the \n     Secretary, and if practicable, in the documents delivered at \n     the time of loan application of--\n       (A) typical energy cost savings that would be possible from \n     a cost-effective energy upgrade of a home of the size and in \n     the region of the subject property;\n       (B) the impact the typical energy cost savings would have \n     on monthly ownership costs of a typical home;\n       (C) the impact on the size of a mortgage that could be \n     obtained if the typical energy cost savings were reflected in \n     an energy efficiency report; and\n       (D) resources for improving the energy efficiency of a \n     home.\n       (6) Pricing of loans.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered agency may price covered loans \n     originated under the enhanced loan eligibility requirements \n     required under this section in accordance with the estimated \n     risk of the loans.\n       (B) Imposition of certain material costs, impediments, or \n     penalties.--In the absence of a publicly disclosed analysis \n     that demonstrates significant additional default risk or \n     prepayment risk associated with the loans, a covered agency \n     shall not impose material costs, impediments, or penalties on \n     covered loans merely because the loan uses an energy \n     efficiency report or the enhanced loan eligibility \n     requirements required under this section.\n       (7) Limitations.--\n       (A) In general.--A covered agency may price covered loans \n     originated under the enhanced loan eligibility requirements \n     required under this section in accordance with the estimated \n     risk of those loans.\n       (B) Prohibited actions.--A covered agency shall not--\n       (i) modify existing underwriting criteria or adopt new \n     underwriting criteria that intentionally negate or reduce the \n     impact of the requirements or resulting benefits that are set \n     forth or otherwise derived from the enhanced loan eligibility \n     requirements required under this subsection; or\n       (ii) impose greater buy back requirements, credit overlays, \n     or insurance requirements, including private mortgage \n     insurance, on covered loans merely because the loan uses an \n     energy efficiency report or the enhanced loan eligibility \n     requirements required under this subsection.\n       (8) Applicability and implementation date.--Not later than \n     4 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and before \n     December 31, 2017, the enhanced loan eligibility requirements \n     required under this subsection shall be implemented by each \n     covered agency to--\n       (A) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or refinancing \n     of any loan for the sale, of any home;\n       (B) be available on any residential real property \n     (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) \n     that qualifies for a covered loan; and\n       (C) provide prospective mortgagees with sufficient guidance \n     and applicable tools to implement the required underwriting \n     methods.\n       (d) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Valuation \n     Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) in consultation with the Federal Financial Institutions \n     Examination Council and the advisory group established in \n     subsection (f)(2), develop and issue guidelines for a covered \n     agency to determine the maximum permitted loan amount based \n     on the value of the property for all covered loans made on \n     properties with an energy efficiency report that meets the \n     requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B); and\n       (B) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, issue \n     guidelines for a covered agency to determine the estimated \n     energy savings under paragraph (3) for properties with an \n     energy efficiency report.\n       (2) Requirements.--The enhanced energy efficiency \n     underwriting valuation guidelines required under paragraph \n     (1) shall include--\n       (A) a requirement that if an energy efficiency report that \n     meets the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B) is voluntarily \n     provided to the mortgagee, such report shall be used by the \n     mortgagee or covered agency to determine the estimated energy \n     savings of the subject property; and\n       (B) a requirement that the estimated energy savings of the \n     subject property be added to the appraised value of the \n     subject property by a mortgagee or covered agency for the \n     purpose of determining the loan-to-value ratio of the subject \n     property, unless the appraisal includes the value of the \n     overall energy efficiency of the subject property, using \n     methods to be established under the guidelines issued under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (3) Determination of estimated energy savings.--\n       (A) Amount of energy savings.--The amount of estimated \n     energy savings shall be determined by calculating the \n     difference between the estimated energy costs for the average \n     comparable houses, as determined in guidelines to be issued \n     under paragraph (1),\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n     and the estimated energy costs for the subject property based \n     upon the energy efficiency report.\n       (B) Duration of energy savings.--The duration of the \n     estimated energy savings shall be based upon the estimated \n     life of the applicable equipment, consistent with the rating \n     system used to produce the energy efficiency report.\n       (C) Present value of energy savings.--The present value of \n     the future savings shall be discounted using the average \n     interest rate on conventional 30-year mortgages, in the \n     manner directed by guidelines issued under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Ensuring consideration of energy efficient features.--\n     Section 1110 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, \n     and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3339) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``;

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the Protocol Amending the Convention between the United \nStates of America and the Kingdom of Spain for the Avoidance of Double \nTaxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on \nIncome and its Protocol, signed at Madrid on February 22, 1990, and a \nrelated Memorandum of Understanding signed on\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nJanuary 14, 2013, at Madrid, together with correcting notes dated July \n23, 2013, and January 31, 2014 (together the ``proposed protocol''). I \nalso transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the \nDepartment of State, which includes an overview of the proposed \nprotocol.\n  The proposed protocol was negotiated to bring United States-Spain tax \ntreaty relations into closer conformity with U.S. tax treaty policy. \nThe proposed protocol exempts from source-country withholding cross-\nborder payments of certain direct dividends, interest, royalties, and \ncapital gains, and updates the provisions of the existing convention \nwith respect to preventing abuse by third-country investors and the \nexchanges of information between revenue authorities. The proposed \nprotocol also updates the mutual agreement procedure by requiring \nbinding arbitration of certain cases that the competent authorities of \nthe United States and Spain have been unable to resolve after a \nreasonable period of time.\n  I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the \nproposed protocol and give its advice and consent to its ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 7, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/07/senate-section/article/S2824-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2014\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ.
