Mr. President, this week the Senate will consider a number \nof nominations.\n  Tonight we will vote, as I have just indicated, on Pamela Chen to be \na judge for the Eastern District of New York and Katherine Failla to \nserve as district judge for the Southern District of New York.\n  Later this week we are going to consider the nomination of Caitlin \nJoan Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This \ncircuit now has four vacancies. Ms. Halligan's colleagues say she has \n``a brilliant mind'' and ``an abiding respect for law.'' Those are \ndirect quotes. But despite her outstanding credentials and strong \nsupport from across the political spectrum, Republicans filibustered \nher confirmation last Congress.\n  President Obama is the only President in the 65-year history of the \nDC Circuit Court not to have a single judge confirmed to that court \nduring his first term. Remember, there are now four vacancies. Since \nshe was nominated, two additional vacancies have opened on the DC \nCircuit. The court desperately needs more judges.\n  This week the Senate will consider the nomination of John Brennan to \nlead the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Brennan's nomination is \nexpected to be reported out of the Intelligence Committee tomorrow.\n  Mr. Brennan served 25 years in the CIA in many extremely important \ndelicate roles and 4 years on the White House national security staff, \nwhere he played an instrumental role in finding Osama bin Laden and \ndecimating al Qaida. He is very qualified, he is a wonderful public \nservant, and he should be confirmed quickly.\n  This week will be a test of the Republicans' goodwill. My Republican \ncolleagues say they respect the Senate's responsibility to advise and \nconsent. My Republican colleagues say they don't plan to obstruct the \nconfirmation process for the sake of obstruction, but they filibustered \nPresident Obama's nominee for Secretary of Defense--for the first time \nin the history of the country, being a former Republican Senator--\ndelaying Senator Hagel's confirmation for at least 2 weeks.\n  Republicans say they will not filibuster, but their actions say \notherwise. Republicans say they are just requiring 60-vote thresholds, \nbut the difference between a filibuster and requiring a 60-vote \nthreshold on nominations is a distinction with no difference. In a \nnation founded on the principle of justice for all, requiring a 60-vote \nthreshold on nominations is unfair. It is unfair for all. It is \nextremely important that we adequately staff our Federal courts, and we \nhave not done that.\n  At a time when America faces so many threats abroad, it is crucial we \nhave a talented and dedicated individual such as John Brennan leading \nour Nation's most prominent intelligence agency. Yet Republicans again \nand again inject politics into the confirmation process, both when \nconsidering judicial nominees and, most recently, when considering \nCabinet nominees.\n  There was once a time when Republicans were the ones defending the \nright of the President to choose the players on his team. Back then it \nwas a Republican in the White House.\n  In 2001, the senior Senator from Utah touted the ``longstanding \ntradition in the Senate . . . [to] afford the President a significant \ndegree of deference to shape his Cabinet as he sees fit.''\n  Four years later, after President Bush was reelected, the senior \nSenator from Arizona pointed out that elections have consequences and \nsaid, ``The President has a right to put into place\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\nthe team he believes will serve him best.''\n  As we consider key nominations this week and in the future, I hope my \nRepublican colleagues honor the longstanding tradition of the Senate \nthat they have identified and we agree with. I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to consider that if the Senate fails to properly staff our \nnational security agencies or the Nation's judicial system, our \ninaction will also have consequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1076-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for what he \nsaid on these nominations. As he knows, we have an awful lot of them \nthat have come out, and then every time he has tried to move them \nquickly on the Senate floor there has been opposition from the other \nside.\n  It has been frustrating when we actually had nominations that waited \nmonths, or will have a cloture vote, and then they will get 90 or 95 \nvotes for confirmation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to explain to \neveryone within the sound of our voices how important the DC Circuit is \nto our country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it would be hard to state it any better \nthan the Senator from Nevada has. But so many of the issues we grapple \nwith every single day on this floor--regulatory issues, issues that \naffect the various departments of government--when there are appeals of \nthose issues, when there are questions of what the Departments do, they \ninvariably go to the DC Circuit. They don't go to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, as the distinguished Presiding Officer and \nthe distinguished majority leader know, takes only a tiny percentage of \ncases that are appealed. But every one of these major legal issues that \nare appealed are heard by the DC Circuit, and it is frustrating to know \nthere is a concerted effort on the other side to try to stop having a \nbalance in the DC Circuit.\n  Every one of us as lawyers would hope we could come into a courtroom \nand know that if we have a good case, we would win it; and if we have a \nbad case, we would lose but that the cards aren't stacked against us \nbecause we are a Republican or Democrat. Because of the makeup of the \nDC Circuit, more and more people are getting the view--rightly or \nwrongly--it is stacked. The efforts of the Republican Party to block \nanybody else from going down there except for people they have vetted \nincrease that impression that the court is stacked. That doesn't help \nthe system of justice in the United States. It actually doesn't help \nwhether you are a Republican or a Democrat because it destroys the idea \nof the impartiality of the courts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for permission to ask one more \nquestion of the senior Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Legal scholars have said, and I have read, that they \nbelieve the DC Circuit is just a little bit below the Supreme Court; \nthat it hears cases of such significance. That is why it was \nestablished some 65 years ago: to take care of cases the Supreme Court \ncouldn't.\n  Is that true?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is absolutely \ncorrect. I would even argue that in some areas it is more important \nthan the Supreme Court because on so many of the issues that go there, \nthey will have the final word. The Supreme Court could never hear all \nof the requests for appeals from the DC Circuit, and they become the \nfinal word.\n  So on the issues that involve average Americans based on what their \ngovernment does, they will be decided in that circuit court, not in the \nSupreme Court. So it is extraordinarily important that we have a \nbalanced court there.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1076-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1076-S1077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEALTHCARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the policy \nchanges and choices made in Washington and how they affect the spending \nand the well-being of so many people all around this great country. \nThere has been a great deal of talk recently about how we can get our \nout-of-control Washington spending under control. How can we curb \nspending?\n  We also need to keep in mind some of the policies of the Obama \nadministration and how they have impacted spending and how they have \ncreated economic conditions that have forced many of these hard choices \nto be made by American families. I believe our weak economic recovery \nis a result of bad policy choices that have cost Americans their jobs, \nand it has cost them dollars--money--they cannot spare.\n  The list of the administration's bad policy choices is long and, in \nmy opinion, right at the top of that list is the President's health \ncare law. Last week, we learned from a GAO study requested by Senator \nSessions that the President's health care law will add $6.2 trillion to \nWashington's debt. Of course, that is debt on the back of every young \nperson in America and on the back of future generations. It is a debt \nupon the entire Nation.\n  It is also adding to the financial burden in this country. Recently, \nthe Obama administration has released more rules for how this health \ncare law will be implemented. The new regulations that have just come \nout lay out something called ``essential benefits.'' These are the \ngovernment-mandated items that health care policies will now have to \noffer.\n  Along with other parts of the health care law, these new rules will \nraise the premiums American families pay for their health coverage. \nThat is not what the American people wanted, that is not what they were \npromised by the President, and that is not what they need during this \ndifficult economic time.\n  Remember, President Obama promised that under his health care plan \ninsurance premiums, he said, would go down $2,500 for the average \nfamily by the end of his first term. That has come and gone, but what \nthe President promised the American people has not happened. Instead, \npremiums have gone up by an average of more than $3,000 family.\n  As more provisions of the law kick in, I can tell you it is going to \nget worse. As the Obama administration puts out more regulations, \npremiums are going to continue to go up and up. The American people are \nin for a serious case of premium sticker shock.\n  This is especially true for young people, people in their twenties, \npeople in their thirties. That is not just my prediction. It is the \nwarning we are getting from State officials who actually supported the \nPresident's health care law. Of course, they supported it before they \nknew what was in it.\n  The State insurance commissioner in Oregon has said the new \nregulations could push up premiums for young consumers by as much as 30 \npercent next year. According to a recent piece in the Los Angeles \nTimes, that was not an accident. It was an intentional effect of trying \nto lower prices for older Americans by raising the prices for younger \npeople. In fact, the cost-shifting was a top priority of the AARP \nduring the debate.\n  Of course, I believe the administration was not honest about it. They \ndid not come out and tell young people: Hey, you are going to have to \npay a\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nhigher premium so someone else pays less. No. Democrats in Congress and \nthe White House tried to say young people were going to pay lower \nprices, but now we are seeing it was never true.\n  The premium increases are also going to be worse if you do not get \ninsurance through your employer. That is because you may end up in the \nindividual market. A recent Gallup poll found that fewer people are \ngetting their insurance through work. Just since 2008, the number has \ndropped significantly. Among people between the ages of 18 and 25 years \nold, only 32 percent now get their health insurance through work.\n  Healthier people--people who take the time to focus on staying \nhealthy--are actually going to pay more too. Even if you eat a good \ndiet, you exercise, you do the things people would be encouraged to do \nso they do not get sick, you are going to pay more under the \nPresident's health care law.\n  According to a new survey of insurance companies, younger and \nhealthier customers can expect premium increases of 169 percent, on \naverage, in 2014. That is in the individual market, that more people \nwill find themselves forced into as their employers drop coverage.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that even when you take into \naccount the subsidies some of these people will get under the law, \npremiums will still go up an average of 10 to 13 percent even after the \nsubsidies are applied.\n  If that happens, a family buying coverage on its own may end up \npaying $2,100 a year more because of the health care law. You might ask \nyourself, why are the premiums going up so fast? It is because of the \nlaw's new requirements.\n  For one thing, there is something called the essential health \nbenefits. We just got new rules on these from the administration. Those \nare the specific mandates that require insurance plans to cover a wide \nrange of services. For most consumers it is going to mean a more \nextensive and longer list of benefits. That might sound good, but they \nmay be for things the consumers do not want. It does not matter. Under \nthe law, the consumers have to pay for them. It is still higher costs--\nmuch higher costs. People cannot just get the insurance they and their \nfamily want, that is right for them, and they can afford. No, that is \nnot enough. They must buy Obama administration-approved health \ninsurance. That is what they have to buy. That is what the law says, \nand it is going to be much more expensive than what they might want, \nthey might need or they can afford and think is good for them.\n  Families are going to have to pay for insurance that covers the whole \nlaundry list of benefits, whether they want them or not. Why should the \ngovernment--Washington--tell a single 33-year-old man he has to pay for \novarian cancer screening? Why should someone without children have to \npay for a plan that covers pediatric eye exams? Even the American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology has said that requirement goes too far. They \nare worried that once insurance has to cover it, there will be overuse \nof comprehensive eye exams on children who do not even need them. Of \ncourse, that may happen. If it is covered by insurance, people are \ngoing to want more of it. That drives up health care costs, and health \ninsurance costs go up even more.\n  To make matters worse, the law requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to update the list of these benefits every year. These \nare the benefits you still may not want--certainly do not want to be \nforced to pay for--but you are stuck with them now. We all know this \nlist is not going to get any shorter. It is going to grow longer, and \nthe costs are going to continue to go up.\n  That is what has happened at the State level. Health insurance \nmandates in some States now include everything from circumcisions to \nbreast implant removal, and mandates add anywhere from 10 to 50 percent \nto the cost of insurance.\n  It is no way to run a health care program. Consumers should decide \nwhat benefits they want, what benefits they think they may need, not \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  Finally, I will give just one more example of how the new rules will \ndrive up premiums. This has to do with new age rating rules in the law. \nThe age rating limits the amount premiums can vary between healthy \nyounger individuals and unhealthy older consumers. This is the most \ndirect way Democrats are taxing the young to pay for everyone else.\n  Under the President's health care law, the premium charged to a \nsicker older person cannot be more than three times what a healthy 21-\nyear-old has to pay. So those younger people are going to end up paying \nmore. Rather than pay the higher cost, many younger people will just \nnot purchase insurance at all. They will just pay the law's tax penalty \ninstead. That is because it is still cheaper than the insurance \npremiums that have been driven up due to the President's health care \nlaw. That means premiums will go up even faster for the people left in \nthe insurance pool, and the whole thing will keep spiraling out of \ncontrol.\n  The White House says it will not budge on these age-rating rules. So \npeople in their twenties and thirties and early forties should just \nprepare themselves now for the premium hikes they are going to see \nunder the President's health care law.\n  Those are just a few of the new rules and just a few of the ways the \nhealth care law continues to raise costs and raise premiums for hard-\nworking Americans. It seems to me the President is still in his \ncampaign mode, so he will not admit it, but he is not fooling anybody.\n  I recently completed a statewide tour of Wyoming. I visited a dozen \ntowns across the State and met with hundreds of people. I can tell you, \nin those meetings, people still say the health care law is unworkable, \nit is unaffordable, and it remains very unpopular.\n  The people of Wyoming, as did people across the country, knew what \nthey wanted from health care reform. They wanted the care they need, \nfrom a doctor they choose, at lower costs. What they got were higher \npremiums, higher taxes, and more government control over their personal \nhealth care decisions.\n  When the new rules were released 1 week ago, HHS Secretary Kathleen \nSebelius said: ``Being sick will no longer keep you, your family, or \nyour employees from being able to get affordable health coverage.''\n  What she should have added was: The President's own health care law \nwill be the thing that keeps people from getting affordable coverage.\n  The law that was passed was the wrong solution and the wrong way to \nreform our health care in this country. Hard-working American families \ncannot afford it, and they deserve better.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, Congress failed to act to avoid \nindiscriminate across-the-board cuts from sequestration. These \nautomatic cuts are in the tens of billions of dollars at a time when \nour economy is finally recovering but remains fragile. Among those who \nwill have to endure these cuts are the overburdened Federal courts \nalready suffering from longstanding vacancies that number almost 90 and \nhave remained near or above 80 for almost 4 years. Budgetary cuts will \nmean more difficulty for the American people to get speedy justice from \nour Federal justice system.\n  Two senior district judges, one appointed by President Reagan and one \nappointed by President Clinton, wrote last week in U.S. News and World \nReport that sequestration will ``devastate the judicial branch.'' They \nwrote: ``[C]ourts may need to close periodically, furlough employees, \nand cut security, thereby, delaying proceedings. These realities, \ncombined with a reduction in supervision of persons on bond and \nconvicted felons who are released from prison, compromise public \nsafety.'' They conclude: ``[Our Federal courts provide access to \njustice, protect against abuses of power, and defend the Constitution. \nFailure to avert sequestration by March 1 undermines the ability of the \nFederal courts to fulfill this Constitutional mandate.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  As we hear these warnings from judges and other officials across our \nthree branches of Government, I hope Senators understand that \nsequestration is bad for the courts, bad for the economy, and bad for \nthe American people.\n  Over the past 4 years, unprecedented obstruction by Senate \nRepublicans has meant that all judicial nominees have become wrapped \naround the axle of partisanship. Senators from both sides of the aisle \nused to agree that Federal courts are supposed to be impartial and \noutside of politics. Yet, the actions of Senate Republicans over the \nlast 4 years have undermined that principle of our constitutional \nsystem and hurt the integrity of the judiciary. I hear this from judges \nappointed by Republican Presidents and those appointed by Democratic \nPresidents. They say the unprecedented delays that nominees face \npoliticize the courts and destroy the appearance of impartiality the \nFederal courts need. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said last \nyear that this extreme partisanship erodes the public's confidence in \nour courts and ``makes the judiciary look politicized when it is not, \nand it has to stop.''\n  This obstruction has also contributed to keeping judicial vacancies \nat a damagingly high level for over 4 years. Persistent vacancies mean \nthat fewer judges have to take on growing caseloads and make it harder \nfor Americans to have access to speedy justice. There are today 89 \njudicial vacancies across the country. By way of contrast, that is more \nthan double the number of vacancies that existed at this point in the \nBush administration.\n  Senate Republicans chose to depart dramatically from well-established \nSenate practices from the moment President Obama took office in their \nefforts to delay and obstruct his judicial nominations.\n  Until 2009, judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwith bipartisan support were generally confirmed quickly. Until 2009, \nwe observed regular order, we usually confirmed nominees promptly, and \nwe cleared the Senate Executive Calendar before long recesses. Until \n2009, if a nominee was filibustered, it was almost always because of a \nsubstantive issue with the nominee's record. We know what has happened \nsince 2009. The average district court nominee has been stalled 4.3 \ntimes longer and the average circuit court nominee has been stalled 7.3 \ntimes as long as it took to confirm them during the Bush \nadministration. No other President's judicial nominees had to wait an \naverage of over 100 days for a Senate vote after being reported by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Some Republicans have ignored the facts I just cited even though they \ncame from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS). No \ninvented statistic can change the fact that no president's nominees \nhave ever waited as long for a vote as President Obama's.\n  Senate Republicans have also claimed that President Bush had only 74 \npercent of his nominees confirmed during his first term. This is also \nnot true. President Bush nominated 231 men and women to serve as \ncircuit and district judges; of them, 205 were confirmed. That is a \nconfirmation rate of 89 percent. During President Obama's first term, \nonly 173 district and circuit judges were confirmed, and a much lower \npercentage. Contrary to the claims of Senate Republicans the Senate has \nconfirmed far fewer of President Obama's nominees and confirmed them at \na significantly lower rate at the same points in his and President \nBush's administrations. Senate Republicans talk about how much progress \nwe made during the 112th Congress, when we confirmed 113 of President \nObama's circuit and district nominees. But they ignore the fact that 19 \nof those nominees could and should have been confirmed during the 111th \nCongress, and the fact that the 60 confirmations they allowed in the \n111th Congress was the lowest total for a new president in over 30 \nyears. They ignore the fact that in President Obama's first year in \noffice they allowed just 12 of his circuit and district nominees to be \nconfirmed, which, according to CRS, was the lowest one-year \nconfirmation total since the Eisenhower administration when the Federal \nbench was barely one-third the size it is today. We have yet to make up \nthe ground we lost during those first 2 years. Looking only at the \nconfirmation total from last Congress while ignoring the historic \nobstruction of nominations that preceded it and the backlog that was \ncreated provides an incomplete and misleading picture.\n  There can be no question about the effect of the unprecedented effort \nby Senate Republicans to obstruct President Obama's judicial \nnominations. Despite bipartisan calls to address longstanding judicial \nvacancies, the delays and obstruction of judicial confirmations have \nled to judicial vacancies to the remaining near or above 80 for almost \n4 years.\n  During the vote on Judge Bacharach last week, some Senators defending \nthe filibuster that blocked his confirmation for 7 months claimed that \nit was just the usual Senate practice in a presidential election year. \nDuring the filibuster last year of Judge Bacharach, there was not even \na pretense of any substantive concern--Senate Republicans just decided \nto shut down the confirmation process and contorted the ``Thurmond \nRule.'' But personal attacks on me, trying to repackage their own \nactions as if following the Thurmond Rule, do not change the facts. The \nfact is that in the past six presidential election years, Senate \nDemocrats have never denied an up-or-down vote to a consensus circuit \nnominee; Senate Republicans cannot say that. Until last year, no \ncircuit nominee with bipartisan Judiciary Committee support had ever \nbeen successfully filibustered. Senators claiming to be upholding \nSenate tradition while engaging in a filibuster that had no precedent \nin Senate history are not supported by the facts.\n  After last year's filibuster, Judge Bacharach waited another 7 months \nbefore being allowed a vote on the merits.\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\nThe outcome of that vote was that he was confirmed unanimously. It is \nhard to understand why 7 months of delay were necessary. During the 7 \nmonths of additional unnecessary delay since his filibuster, Judge \nBacharach could have been working on behalf of the people of Oklahoma, \nKansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. Likewise there is no \nreason to delay further the confirmation of Caitlin Halligan, whose \nnomination to the D.C. Circuit was first reported nearly 2 years ago. \nSenate Republicans justified their filibuster of her nomination a year \nago by arguing that the Circuit did not need another judge. Since that \ntime, the number of vacancies on that court has doubled, and it is now \nmore than one-third vacant. It needs Caitlin Halligan. She is the kind \nof moderate, superbly qualified nominee who should easily be able to be \nconfirmed under any standard by which the Senate has considered \njudicial nominees in the past. It is well past time to walk back from \nthe precipice marked by the wrongheaded filibuster of Ms. Halligan. The \ncontinued filibuster of her nomination does harm to the Senate, to the \nimportant D.C. Circuit, and to the American people.\n  At a time when judicial vacancies have again risen to almost 90, we \nmust do more for our overburdened courts. It is past time for the \npartisan obstruction to end. We have a long way to go. After 4 years of \ndelay and obstruction, we remain far behind the pace of confirmations \nwe set during President Bush's administration, and there remain far too \nmany judicial vacancies that make it harder for Americans to have their \nday in court. During President Bush's entire second term, the 4 years \nfrom 2004 through 2008, vacancies never exceeded 60. Since President \nObama's first full month in office, and as far into the future as we \ncan see, there have never been fewer than 60 vacancies, and for much of \nthat time many, many more. The Senate must do much more to fill these \nvacancies and make real progress.\n  Senate Republicans claim that we cannot do more because President \nObama has not made a sufficient number of nominations. But it is Senate \nRepublicans themselves, and their unwillingness to work with a \nPresident who has reached out to them to submit recommendations and to \nwork with him, that has delayed many nominations.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has worked hard to solicit \nrecommendations from home State Senators, including those from the \nother party. This President has consistently selected qualified, \nmainstream nominees. For the judicial vacancies in States with 2 \nRepublican Senators, just 11 percent have a nominee. I urge Senate \nRepublicans to do a better job providing consensus recommendations and \nfulfilling their own constitutional responsibility to ``advise'' the \nPresident on nominations and work with President Obama to fill these \nvacancies.\n  The Senate today will finally vote on the nominations of Pamela Chen \nand Katherine Failla. Both nominees should have been confirmed last \nyear. Pamela Chen is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. She has \nworked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the district to which has now \nbeen nominated to be a judge for all but one of the last 14 years, \nrising from a line prosecutor to serve as chief of Civil Rights \nLitigation, deputy chief of the Public Integrity Section, and chief of \nthe Civil Rights Section, Criminal Division. Between January and April \n2008, she served as the deputy commissioner for enforcement at the New \nYork State Division of Human Rights. Previously, she spent 7 years as a \ntrial attorney and senior trial attorney in the Special Litigation \nSection of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. \nShe began her legal career as an associate in private practice. She \nearned her B.A., with honors, from the University of Michigan, and her \nJ.D. from Georgetown University Law Center. When confirmed, Pamela Chen \nwill be only the second female Chinese-American in U.S. history to \nserve on a Federal district court. She will also be one of only a few \nopenly gay Federal judges.\n  Katherine Failla is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York. Since 2000, she has served as an \nAssistant United States Attorney in that division, and since 2008 she \nhas served as the chief of the office's Criminal Appeals Unit. Prior to \nher government service, she was an associate in the New York office of \nMorgan Lewis & Bockius LLP. In her career, she has tried 10 trials to \nverdict. After law school, she clerked for the Honorable Joseph E. \nIrenas, U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey. She \ngraduated with honors from the College of William & Mary, and Harvard \nLaw School.\n  After today's votes, there are still another 15 judicial nominees \npending before the Senate. All of these nominees had to be renominated \nafter being returned at the end of the last Congress. It is unusual to \nhave such a backlog so early in a Congress, and this is the result of \nSenate Republicans' refusal to allow votes on 11 nominees at the end of \nlast year, almost all of whom had been reported with bipartisan \nsupport, and their refusal to consider another 4 who had hearings and \ncould have been expedited. I urge that the Senate act quickly on these \nlong-pending nominations. Further delay does not serve the interests of \nthe American people. Hardworking Americans deserve better.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [Feb. 27, 2013]\n\n                Sequestration Threatens American Justice\n\n              (By Charles N. Clevert, Joseph H. Rodriguez)\n\n       As senior U.S. district judges, we urge members of the \n     House and Senate to act by March 1 to halt sequestration--\n     looming, indiscriminate, 5.1 percent budget cuts for the \n     nation's federal courts. Crippling across-the-board budget \n     cuts would threaten constitutional rights, American justice, \n     and court security. Relatively little light has been shed on \n     the effects that these budget cuts would have on our federal \n     court system.\n       These cuts would devastate the judicial branch, which \n     receives a mere two 10ths of 1 percent of the federal budget. \n     Federal courts operate on a lean budget and have embraced \n     cost containment by measures including staff reduction below \n     authorized levels. Thus, we urge the House and Senate to act \n     quickly and reach a budget agreement that prevents \n     sequestration and all its attendant harms.\n       Lawmakers, businesses, and citizens alike must recognize \n     that budget sequestration imperils fundamental constitutional \n     rights and courts that protect those rights. The right to be \n     heard, the right to a speedy and public trial, and the right \n     to effective assistance of counsel in criminal cases are \n     cornerstones of our democracy. Sequestration could dissuade \n     attorneys from accepting appointments to represent indigent \n     defendants because of inadequate funding. Moreover, courts \n     may need to close periodically, furlough employees, and cut \n     security, thereby, delaying proceedings. These realities, \n     combined with a reduction in supervision of persons on bond \n     and convicted felons who are released from prison, compromise \n     public safety. Additionally, offenders with mental health \n     needs or drug and alcohol abuse problems would receive \n     inadequate monitoring and substandard treatment.\n       Access to justice is not a luxury. If budget cuts slam \n     courthouse doors and postpone trials, some criminal cases may \n     need to be dismissed. Therefore, trust and confidence in our \n     federal courts would be at risk. Additionally, limited funds \n     needed to pay citizen jurors and the priority that must be \n     given to criminal proceedings could delay civil cases as \n     well. At the same time, budget related delays would prevent \n     bankruptcy courts from functioning normally in providing \n     relief to struggling debtors and ailing businesses seeking \n     reorganization. These individuals, businesses, and employees \n     would be harmed and economic recovery will be slowed.\n       Cuts to courthouse security personnel and programs may be \n     as high as 30 percent. These cuts would compromise the safety \n     of all who visit or work in federal courthouses, including \n     witnesses, jurors, and judges. Recent tragic shootings at or \n     near courthouses in Delaware and South Carolina underscore \n     that concerns about courthouse safety are not theoretical \n     matters; cuts to funding for courthouse safety will only \n     deepen these concerns.\n\n  America's courts are the final line of protection for the legal \nrights of all. They provide access to justice, protect against abuses \nof power, and defend the Constitution. Failure to avert sequestration \nby March 1 undermines the ability of the federal courts to fulfill this \nConstitutional mandate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Gillibrand and Mr. Kirk\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\npertaining to the introduction of S. 443 are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Halligan Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to be a judge for the U.S. Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That is an important court, one of the \nmost important courts, one step below the Supreme Court.\n  I would note that the Senate has already once rejected proceeding \nwith consideration of this nomination and, in my opinion, for good \nreason. We do not do that lightly. We should not do that lightly. But \nit is an important question, and nominees do have to clear the Senate, \nand the Senate is not a rubber stamp.\n  Ms. Halligan has a well-documented record of advocating extreme \npositions on constitutional issues, pushing legal arguments beyond what \nI think is reasonable, including in cases involving Second Amendment \ngun rights, abortion, the death penalty, and others.\n  But one of the most troubling of her views pertains to the war on \nterror and the detention of enemy combatants. This is alarming not only \nbecause the arguments she has advanced in this regard are contrary to \nwell-settled law, but because the court she seeks to join the D.C. \nCircuit has a critical role in national security matters, including \ndeciding habeas petitions of terrorist detainees.\n  As a member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York's \nCommittee on the Federal Courts, she joined a 2004 report, the self-\ndescribed purpose of which was specifically to ``address, in \nparticular, the role the federal courts should play in striking [the] \nbalance [between, in this case, national security and civil liberties \nconcerns] with respect to the detention and trial of suspected \nterrorists or their accomplices designated as `enemy combatants' by the \nexecutive branch.''\n  The report comes to the untenable conclusion that the congressional \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force does not authorize the \nindefinite detention of enemy combatants.\n  These are prisoners of war. Not only did the Supreme Court hold that \nit does, in fact, authorize indefinite detention in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \nbut the Obama administration has argued for a broad construction of \nthat authority itself. And, in a series of rulings joined by judges \nacross the ideological spectrum, the D.C. Circuit has adopted, itself, \nthat broad definition.\n  The report also adopts--this is the bar association report. And I \nhave to say, lawyers and bar association committees, they sign on \nreports dealing with the national security of the United States of \nAmerica. They sign on reports dealing with how prisoners of war are to \nbe determined and handled. At a time of national crisis, when we are in \na national debate about that, they should know what they are talking \nabout, and this bar association did not.\n  The report also adopts the unsupported view that the war on terrorism \n``seems closer to a law enforcement effort than to a military \ncampaign.''\n  But I would say to that, the Congress voted and declared it to be a \nmilitary effort. Tell that to the soldiers in Afghanistan chasing down \nal-Qaida operatives, that it was not a war.\n  The report goes on. But this was part of the attempt at the time to \nundermine President Bush's ability to effectively manage the war \neffort. The report argues vigorously against the use of military \ncommissions--that is where you try prisoners of war for violations of \nthe rules of war, in military commissions--and maintains that the \npreferred place to try them are Article III civilian courts, normal \ncivilian courts, except in ``exceptional circumstances.''\n  They say, of course, to try them in a civilian court would provide \nthe terrorists--enemies of the United States, participating in a war \nagainst the United States--with all the same constitutional rights that \na person who defrauded the IRS or robbed a bank would have. But it is a \ndifferent situation. You do not give those kind of rights to people at \nwar with the United States, whose goal is to destroy the United States \nand to replace the government. That has never been the position in our \ncountry, nor in any other nation in the world that I am aware of. But \nthat is the position she signed on.\n  While Obama surrogates and supporters during the campaign often \nattacked Bush and made these kinds of allegations, the Obama \nadministration, after taking office, has been forced to abandon those \npositions. They are untenable.\n  One of the report's flawed arguments of why you should try unlawful \nenemy combatants--that is people at war against the United States in \nArticle III civilian courts is as follows: ``It seems self-evident that \nthe same [constitutional] protections [afforded ordinary criminals] \nshould presumptively extend to those individuals whom the government \nhas seized and proposes to detain for an extended, and perhaps \nindefinite, period of time because they are suspected of having engaged \nin conduct intended to further terrorist aims, thus violating \napplicable criminal laws.''\n  Well, applicable criminal laws were violated, but it was an attack on \nthe United States, not a normal crime. And the Nation made a very clear \ndecision on which I thought all of us were in agreement that we had \nmoved from a time of criminal activity to a time of war, and we acted \nin that fashion. So there is nothing self-evident about the position in \nthe report that an unlawful enemy combatant whose only connection with \nthe United States is his acts of war against it should be afforded the \nconstitutional due process rights of an American citizen who committed \nan crime.\n  Andy McCarthy, a former longtime Department of Justice veteran \nprosecutor, who tried the Blind Sheik case, said this:\n\n       The only thing the framers might have found more appalling \n     is the notion that the Constitution licenses lawfare--i.e., \n     that it permits the American people's courts (which, other \n     than the Supreme Court, are creatures of statute not required \n     by the Constitution) to be used by foreign enemies to put on \n     trial the armed forces of the American people over the manner \n     in which they conduct wartime combat operations that have \n     been authorized by the American people's representatives.\n\n  I think Andy McCarthy is right about that. I think that is basically \nwhat happened. I do not dispute it is fully acceptable for lawyers to \ndefend unpopular clients. However, it is curious to me that while this \nNation has hundreds of thousands of fine lawyers and thousands of \nproven prosecutors, the ones who seem to have a leg up--I am saying \nthis carefully because I have observed this now for 4 years. I think it \nis significant. The ones who seem to have a leg up in this \nadministration's nomination process are those who have challenged the \nlegal policies of the former President of the United States as he \nattempted to conduct a war to defend the United States against an enemy \ndedicated to its destruction.\n  Time and time again, these are the people who have been nominated for \nhigh Department of Justice offices and to the courts. The lifetime \nappointment to which Ms. Halligan has been nominated demands \nindependence and a commitment to the rule of law and not to a political \nagenda.\n  At her hearing, she did attempt to distance herself from the report, \nvariously claiming she had not seen it until just before the hearing \nand that she had not attended all the meetings at which the report was \ndiscussed. She admitted, however, that she could have requested that \nher name not be on the report, as did four other members of the \ncommittee, but she did not. She signed it.\n  In fact, according to her own testimony, she never took any action to \nrepudiate the report or its contents before her nomination or even \nbefore her hearing. The first time she expressed any disagreement with \nthe report, it seems, was at her confirmation hearing. Some call that a \nconfirmation conversion. A serious attorney would have\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\ntaken swift action to either remove their name from the report or to \nrepudiate it. No serious attorney would affix their name to a report on \nsuch important matters in a time of war without studying it carefully, \nsurely.\n  It can only be assumed the report represented her views on the role \nof a civilian Article III court with respect to detention and trial of \nenemy combatants. It would have done more for her credibility to own up \nto that fact, rather than paying lip service to what might be more \nhelpful during the confirmation process.\n  The report continues its irresponsible description of the al-Qaeda \nsupporter and convicted terrorist Ali al-Marri as a ``civilian in this \ncountry legally, [who] seems suspected of providing logistical support \nfor al-Qaeda sleeper cells: presumably criminal activity, if proven, \nbut not `combatant' activity under any likely definition of the term.'' \nAl-Marri eventually pleaded guilty to providing material support to al-\nQaeda and was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. In his guilty \nplea, he admitted that he attended terrorist training camps in the \nyears prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks; that he was instructed by \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, to enter the U.S. just \nprior to 9/11 and await further instruction from al-Qaeda; and that \nwhile here, he researched chemical weapons and communicated with al-\nQaeda members. Investigators also discovered that he had made several \nphone calls to Mustafa al-Hawasawi who had wired money to the 9/11 \nhijackers.\n  When al-Marri's case came before the Supreme Court, Ms. Halligan, as \na private practitioner, donated her legal services pro bono to co-\nauthor an amicus brief on his behalf. The brief argued the United \nStates lacked the authority to detain al-Marri as an enemy combatant, \nand that the AUMF did not authorize his seizure and indefinite military \ndetention, without criminal trial. At the hearing, Ms. Halligan \nclaimed--unconvincingly in my view--that the brief did not represent \nher personal views. But the fact remains that she chose to donate her \nprofessional legal services to defend a radical Islamic terrorist \ninstead of the millions of Americans who need legal representation, or \nvictims of terrorism in this country and all over the world, or women \nin Afghanistan fighting for equal rights, or those suffering from \nreligious persecution in Islamic countries. The fact that she would \nsign her name to the Bar report, and her decision to co-author and file \nan amicus brief in the al-Marri case, is a very serious matter. And \nthose actions cast doubt on her testimony that she was not aware of the \ncontents of the Bar report.\n  Much of Ms. Halligan's testimony did not match up with her record as \nan attorney both in private practice and public service. During her \ntestimony, she attempted to evade the activist views she spent her \ncareer advancing, claiming, for example, that she now embraces original \nintent as the preferred method of Constitutional interpretation. At the \nsame time, however, she was forced to admit that, prior to her \n``confirmation conversion,'' she had never once espoused such views. \nThat is not surprising, given her well-documented record over the \ncourse of many years of advocating for the restriction of Second \nAmendment rights, including in favor of liability for gun \nmanufacturers, for same sex marriage, for limiting the death penalty, \nfor back pay for unauthorized illegal alien workers, and for \naffirmative action. All positions utterly unsupportable by an original \nintent approach to constitutional interpretation.\n  Her attempts to distance herself from her record were simply \nunconvincing. There is no question where she stands on these issues. \nShe herself has said that the ``courts are the special friend of \nliberty . . . the dynamics of our rule of law enables enviable social \nprogress and mobility.''\n  Her testimony did nothing to convince me that her written record does \nnot paint the accurate picture of what her tenure on the bench would \nlook like if she were confirmed. We have judges who follow their oaths \nto serve under the Constitution and the laws of this country. They are \nnever above it. They are never free to alter the meaning of words to \nadvance a personal agenda.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I have some remarks I \nwould like to make before 5:30.\n  I do not object.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will try to not utilize the 30 seconds the Senator \nused in agreeing to this. But I would point out there are other \ndifferent complaints that we have about the circumstances of this \nnomination. I do think it is an extraordinary circumstance. I take that \ndecision seriously. There have not been many that I found that to have \noccurred.\n  Therefore, I will oppose the motion for cloture and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Alabama for taking only 30 \nseconds because of the 30 seconds I took to explain to him. I have \nthree parts to my little statement. I will speak briefly on each.\n  First, I rise in support of the nominations of Katherine Failla for \nthe Southern District of New York and Pam Chen for the Eastern \nDistrict. I have enthusiastic support for both of them. They are superb \nnominees to the Federal bench. Let me talk a little bit about each.\n  Similar to many proud New Yorkers, Chen was not born in New York \nCity. But she is now a valid and valuable member, not just of the New \nYork Bar but of our entire community. Chen was born in Chicago after \nher parents came here from China. She came by her zeal for public \nservice honestly because her father worked for the IRS for over 30 \nyears, while her mother was a professor of political science.\n  When I first met Chen, I do not think it took more than 5 minutes \nbefore she talked about how proud she was of her parents, how grateful \nfor the sacrifices they made so she and her brother could excel in \nlater life.\n  She graduated from the University of Michigan and then Georgetown Law \nCenter. As a young lawyer, she began as a litigator in private \npractice, and then began her illustrious career in public service by \njoining the Special Litigation Section of DOJ's Civil Rights Division.\n  Fortunately for the people of New York, she came to the Office of the \nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York--which serves \nprincipally Brooklyn and Long Island--in 1998, and has been there ever \nsince.\n  At one of the premier U.S. Attorney's offices in the Nation, she rose \nto be chief of the civil rights litigation unit and later the civil \nrights section in that office.\n  She has prosecuted all manner of public corruption, gang, narcotics, \nand terrorism cases.\n  She is one of those highly intelligent, analytical individuals who \nwas probably born to be a lawyer, and, once a lawyer, was almost \ncertainly destined to be a judge.\n  Born in Edison, NJ, she earned her B.A. from William & Mary, and her \nlaw degree from Harvard. After clerking for the Federal court in New \nJersey, she practiced in New York City with the law firm of Morgan, \nLewis & Bockius, and 6 years later joined the U.S. Attorney's office.\n  She has now served as a prosecutor for 12 years. In her work as head \nof the criminal appeals section, she defends some of the most important \ncriminal convictions in the Nation, including terrorism cases such as \nthe East African bombing case against bin Laden and his associates, \ncomplex white-collar cases, and RICO cases.\n  Her colleagues report to a person that her advice on legal arguments \nand matters of judgment is the most sought after in the whole * * *\n  Everyone attests to the fact she is fair, decent, honest, and very \nsmart. I wish to finally add that I look for three qualifications in a \nnominee: excellence, she clearly has that; moderation, she has that; \nand all else being present, diversity. Chen will be only the second \nfemale Chinese-American article III judge in U.S. history, making this \nday yet another step forward in our path to making the Judiciary \nreflect both the talent and depth of experience of our communities.\n  Katherine Failla is currently U.S. attorney in charge of the \nimportant and\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\nprestigious Criminal Appeals Unit in the Southern District of New York. \nShe is one of those highly intelligent, analytical individuals who was \nprobably born to be a lawyer, and once a lawyer, was almost destined to \nbe a judge.\n  She has served as a prosecutor for 12 years. Her colleagues report to \na person that her advice on legal arguments and matters of judgment is \nthe most sought after in the whole office. This is the Southern \nDistrict of New York. It is an amazing office.\n  She also came to her dedication to public service through a hard-\nworking family. This is evident through her siblings as well, a school \nteacher's aide and a submarine commander.\n  I ask that my colleagues vote for both of them shortly.\n\n\n                          Halligan Nomination\n\n  I also wish to say a few words this evening about the President's \nlongest standing nominee to any office, Caitlin Joan Halligan. The DC \nCircuit is currently one-third vacant; 4 of the 11 slots are without \nactive judges. What some people call the second most important court in \nthe country is firing only on two-thirds of its cylinders. Halligan is \none of the President's nominees for two of these four slots. Her \nnomination has been pending for 23 months.\n  Since her name has been sent to the Senate, she has not had an up-or-\ndown vote. She has never had an up-or-down vote despite the fact that \nher academic and professional credentials are superb: Princeton \nUniversity, GW Law School, prestigious clerkships on the DC Circuit, \nincluding Patricia Wald, the first female member of the court, and then \nto Justice Steven Breyer.\n  She has never had an up-or-down vote despite the fact that she has \nspent most of her career in public service as a prosecutor, first with \nthe Office of the New York Attorney General, now as assistant district \nattorney who serves as the general counsel for the Manhattan DA's \noffice.\n  She has never had an up-or-down vote despite the fact that she would \nbe only the sixth woman to serve on the court since its inception in \n1801. Two years ago, when her nomination was filibustered, many of my \ncolleagues cited the DC Circuit's relatively low caseload for the \nreason the Senate did not need to confirm another judge. But now, 2 \nyears later, there are only seven judges hearing cases on the court. \nThe caseload for judges has risen 21 percent since President Bush made \nhis last nomination to the court in 2006.\n  My colleagues know how difficult and time-consuming these cases are. \nI have great respect for my friend and colleague and the person I \nexercise with in the gym every morning, Jeff Sessions. But to say this \nis an extraordinary circumstance based on the smidgen of evidence he \nhas mentioned--please, please, please.\n  Let's hope there is not a concerted effort by the other side to keep \nthis important DC circuit empty--unfilled. It is unfair and it is not \nright to this fine women and to the need to proceed with justice in \nthese United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Pamela Ki Mai Chen, of New York, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, and the \nPresident shall be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n\n              Vote on Nomination of Katherine Polk Failla\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the virtues of traveling back home \nis to hear what the people are saying about us. And it isn't good. The \npeople are on anxiety overload. The purpose of my remarks is not to \nincrease anyone's anxiety but just to tell it the way it is.\n  How did we get to a place where we are having mindless, across-the-\nboard cuts in spending with absolutely no thought? It came about \nbecause the Republicans refused to increase the debt ceiling. We were \nabout to default on our obligations, after raising the debt ceiling \nmany times--18 times under Ronald Reagan. And Ronald Reagan warned us \nin those times never to play games with the debt ceiling. Well, the \nRepublicans did. They played games with the debt ceiling, and they did \nit because, if you follow what the Republican leader said, his highest \npriority was defeating President Obama. I am sure they thought that \nkind of chaos would lead the way. It didn't happen, clearly. Our \nPresident was reelected, and he was reelected with the big vote.\n  We got into this situation with the sequester because there were \ngames\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\nbeing played with the debt ceiling, and as a way to get out of it, we \ndid something we thought would never come to pass.\n  We said: OK, give us this ability to raise the debt ceiling so we can \npay our bills and not become a third-world nation and not lose our \ncredit rating even more than we have already lost it, and then we will \nlook at deficit reduction. If the supercommittee can't come up with a \ndeal, we will have these across-the-board cuts.\n  No one thought they would happen, and they are happening. And now \nwhat we hear is, oh, it is really no big deal. Our Republican friends \nare saying it is OK.\n  Maybe people watching this in their homes may not be touched by the \nsequester, but let me tell you who will be touched by the sequester, \nand let me make the argument that when these people are touched by it, \nwe are all touched by it. This is one Nation under God, and when we \nhurt our people, we get hurt.\n  Seventy thousand children will not get Head Start. Is that supposed \nto be good for the country? Ten thousand teacher jobs will be lost. Is \nthat supposed to be good for the country? How about 7,200 special ed \nteachers, teaching every day kids who have such a hard time just \ngetting dressed in the morning? Is that good for America?\n  I would argue that this list is terrible for our country. Maybe you \ndon't have a kid in Head Start. I don't. Maybe you don't know a special \ned teacher. The point is that we are one country, and we do best when \nwe help our most vulnerable.\n  How about this: 424,000 HIV tests conducted by the Centers for \nDisease Control will no longer happen. Is that good for the country, to \nhave HIV-infected people walking around not knowing they have HIV? How \nabout 25,000 fewer breast and cervical cancer screenings? Maybe it is \nnot your wife or your sister or your mom, but somebody's sister or \nsomebody's daughter is not going to find out she has breast cancer. \nTell me how that is good for this country.\n  I am not even talking about the cuts to defense, some of which I \nthink we can do but many of which don't make sense. I am just looking \nat the cuts to the most vulnerable people. Four million fewer meals \nwill be served to senior citizens. Does that make you proud, \nRepublicans? I hope you are proud. Programs such as Meals on Wheels are \ngoing to be impacted, and 600,000 women and children won't get \nnutrition assistance. There will be 1,000 FBI agents and other law \nenforcement personnel laid off or furloughed, and 1,000 criminal cases \nwon't be prosecuted. Is that good for America? Maybe your family wasn't \nthe victim of a crime. Maybe it is not your relative who happens to be \na law enforcement officer. But this is one Nation under God, with \nliberty and justice for all.\n  How does it make sense for these cuts to go into effect when all we \nhave to do to avert them is reform the Tax Code and take away those \njuicy little tax loopholes companies that ship their jobs overseas get? \nHow about asking someone who earns $2 million a year to pay the same \neffective tax rate as their secretary? What kind of a country is this? \nYou would rather have these kinds of brutal cuts to the least among us \nthan just have a fair Tax Code?\n  In the last 40 years only one party balanced the budget, and that \nparty is the Democratic Party. Bill Clinton and the Democratic \nCongress--the only party that ever balanced the budget. So spare me the \nlectures from my friends on the other side of the aisle about how they \nare the ones who know how to do it. No, they don't, because when you \nmake these mindless cuts and people are furloughed and they have less \nmoney to spend, they don't go to the corner store and take their family \nfor lunch or dinner. They don't spend as they would normally spend, and \nit is a trickle-down effect on this economy. As a matter of fact, Mark \nZandi, the respected, nonpartisan economist, said it is going to take a \nhalf a point off economic growth at a time when we are not growing that \nrobustly.\n  Here is the point. When President Obama inherited the job--because we \nelected him to it--he faced the $1.2 trillion deficit of George W. \nBush, who had turned the Bill Clinton surplus into raging deficits, and \nthe deficits are down now to $850 billion. So don't say we are not \nmaking progress. A Democratic President is making progress on the \ndeficit. But let's do the rest of this deficit cutting wisely, in a \nbalanced way. We have cut $1.7 trillion in spending and, yes, $700 \nbillion in revenue. We have raised taxes on those earning a lot of \nmoney. But there are a lot more cuts we have made than revenue \nincreases we have made.\n  So I come to the floor to say this is a self-inflicted wound. And if \nI hear anyone say: It doesn't really affect me, let me tell you that is \nnot true because when our kids are hurt, we are hurt. When our health \ncare system is hurt and people are walking around with diseases, we are \nall hurt. When our senior citizens don't get the meals, we are all \nhurt. Otherwise, what is the point in having a country if it is \neveryone for themselves? That isn't the greatness of America.\n  So I was proud to vote to avert the sequester. We had a majority vote \nbefore we left here for the weekend, but my Republican friends \nfilibustered that. We had over 50 votes to get rid of the sequester, \nand the Republicans filibustered. Enough already. I hope they will come \nto their senses so we can do this deficit reduction in a serious way \nthat makes sense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1083-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1083-S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now I wish to talk about climate change. It is one of the \nmost serious threats facing our Nation. All you really have to do is \nlook out the window to see it is already happening.\n  I would like to talk about a great thing that happened recently. When \nUSA TODAY, the Nation's largest newspaper in print form--more people \nread that paper than any other. They announced in a front-page story \nlast Friday, on March 1, that they are going to spend a year looking at \nthe issue of climate change.\n  This is the front page. They show that the temperatures are going up. \nThey talk about more asthma. But let's look at what they say because I \nam appalled that with all of this going on around us, we seem to have \nno way forward on this issue. I am going to be here every Monday after \nvotes to talk about this, and I urge every Member of the Senate, \nDemocratic or Republican, who cares about this issue to join me. We \nhave to wake up the American people to the fact that this Senate is \ndoing nothing. Even though I believe there is a majority for doing \nsomething, we don't have the 60 votes. So let's talk about it.\n  This is what USA TODAY says:\n\n       \"Why you should sweat climate change.''\n       More American children are getting asthma and allergies, \n     and more seniors are suffering heat strokes. [Already] food \n     and utility prices are rising. Flooding is overrunning \n     bridges, swamping subways and closing airport runways.\n\n  We know this is true.\n\n       People are losing jobs in drought-related factory closings. \n     Cataclysmic storms are wiping out sprawling neighborhoods. \n     Towns are sinking.\n\n  And Congress does nothing.\n  USA TODAY:\n\n       This isn't a science-fiction, end-of-the-world scenario. . \n     . . these scenes are already playing out somewhere in the \n     United States, and they're expected to get worse in the years \n     ahead.\n\n  People need to act quickly.\n\n       Climate change is not a place and time distant--it's here \n     and now.\n\n  That is a quote from Kim Knowlton, who is a health professor at \nColumbia University, and this was shown in USA TODAY.\n\n       The most recent decade was the Nation's hottest on record.\n\n  This isn't a guess, this is the truth.\n\n       The most recent decade was the Nation's hottest on record, \n     and 2012 was the hottest single year. The average U.S. \n     temperature has risen 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable \n     recordkeeping began in 1895--80% of that has occurred since \n     1980.\n       The economic costs of all these changes are enormous--not \n     only for those directly affected but for the nation's \n     taxpayers, who are stuck with the bills for disaster relief, \n     national flood insurance and drought-related crop losses.\n\n  Now, what are we supposed to do about this? Clearly, scientists tell \nus there is too much carbon pollution in the air, and I will show you \nwhere it is coming from. The electricity sector gives us 34 percent of \nthe carbon; the transportation sector, 27 percent of the carbon comes \nfrom there; the industrial sector, 20 percent; the agriculture\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nsector, 7 percent; residential and commercial building, 11 percent.\n  We know President Obama has done an amazing job in leading us, with \nMembers here in the Senate, bipartisan. Senators Snowe and Feinstein \nworked so hard on this. He said it is time for us to get better fuel \neconomy. Fuel efficiency is going to take carbon out of the air, and we \nare moving toward 55 miles per gallon. That is excellent. And we can \ncontinue to make great progress as we move toward plug-in hybrids--I \ndrive one of those myself--and eventually electric cars. I can tell \nyou, when you drive those cars, you don't visit those gas stations. It \nsaves you money. It is a win-win. The environment gets cleaned up. You \nsave money. It is all good.\n  We know the electricity sector is complicated, but what we want to \ndo--many of us here--is to say: If you put a price on carbon, it will \nmove us away from the dirtiest types of electricity production toward \nclean, clean electricity.\n  That is what we are trying to do. So Senator Sanders wrote a very \nstrong bill of which I am a cosponsor. It would put a price on carbon \nand we would take the funds we get from that price on carbon--I think \nit is $20 a ton when you start--and it will bring in many billions. \nWhat we will do with it is 60 percent of it will go to the people to \nsoften the blow of higher electricity prices until we have moved to \nclean energy. We have to move on this.\n  On residential and commercial buildings, I have a bill to move \nforward through the GSA, the biggest landlord in the country, and we \ncan move forward with economies to those buildings by making sure the \nwindows do not let in all that air or let all that heat escape, we can \nmake those weather-related improvements and we can encourage them to \nmove to solar and other ways. The industrial sector is the same. Once \nthere is a price on carbon, they will move toward putting solar and the \nrest.\n  In closing, we have one self-inflicted wound called the sequester. We \ncan get out of it easily by working together on deficit reduction in a \nbalanced way and stop these mindless cuts that hurt the people of our \nNation, the children of our Nation, the seniors of our Nation, law \nenforcement of our Nation--our busiest airports, trains, and the rest. \nWe can avoid all that if we are smart and we say we want a balanced \napproach.\n  I believe if we recognize what USA Today is saying, which is we \nshould sweat climate change because it is happening now, if we can come \ntogether we can move forward and do our part. We just heard, in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--I am proud to chair it--we \nheard from four scientists. They were asked if we do nothing what will \nhappen. They said parts of our Nation will not exist anymore. Imagine \nhearing people say no more Atlantic City, no more New Orleans. In \nFlorida--you wouldn't recognize it. That is the first answer. We did \nnot even get to what happens in the West.\n  We know from Senators such as Tom Udall what would happen to that \nbeautiful State of New Mexico. It would become a desert environment; no \nmore green, and the fires have already been starting. I am sad to say \nwe have done little to nothing. I can only say this President has done \nwhatever he could do. Any progress we have had has come from his \nexecutive orders and, I might add, the States.\n  My home State of California is moving forward, creating jobs in clean \nenergy, moving forward, being a model, and I am going to support them \nand our Governor, Jerry Brown. He gets this. It doesn't take a degree \nin climatology to see what is happening to our climate--and it is \nhappening. We understand it.\n  I saw a movie, ``Chasing Ice.'' O God, if you have not seen it, I \nsuggest you watch it. This is a great photographer who goes to four \ndifferent places, including Montana, Greenland, Iceland, and Alaska. He \nputs these cameras up there to watch the glaciers. You see what happens \nover 2 years. These glaciers are disappearing. This is not some kind of \ncry for attention on my part. I love my grandkids, and I want them to \nhave a planet that is habitable for them. They deserve that. They are \ngoing to look back to this time someday and say: My goodness, what were \nthey thinking?\n  It is not too late for us. With USA Today leading the way, I think we \ncan turn public opinion around and get going on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Gillibrand pertaning to the introduction of S. \n443 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize a milestone in Nevada \nhistory as my friend Rossi Ralenkotter celebrates 40 years with the \ntourism industry. As president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors \nAuthority, LVCVA, Rossi has been influential in transforming Las Vegas \ninto a globally recognized brand and an entertainment destination. I am \nproud to honor him today.\n  After moving to Las Vegas in 1951 and graduating from Bishop Gorman \nHigh School, Rossi served our Nation in the United States Air Force. \nUpon returning home to Southern Nevada, he entered the tourism \nindustry. Las Vegas hasn't been the same since.\n  Rossi championed the use of research and data in developing \nadvertising and marketing strategies for Southern Nevada. He helped \nestablish the LVCVA's research department in the early 1970's.\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nThis innovative approach transformed advertising and marketing for the \nLVCVA.\n  Rossi was part of the effort to bring professional sports to Southern \nNevada and he convinced the Triple-A baseball affiliate in Spokane, WA, \nto move to Las Vegas. He worked in partnership with other communities \nto bring NASCAR and the NBA All-Star Game to Southern Nevada. When the \nNational Finals Rodeo outgrew Oklahoma City, Rossi helped persuade the \nevent to make Las Vegas its new home.\n  By the 1990s, Rossi was overseeing incredible growth in Southern \nNevada's tourism industry and changing the face of Las Vegas from a \nregional gaming market into an international resort destination. Rossi \nwas part of the team that developed the most successful tourism ad \ncampaign in history. Today, Las Vegas is synonymous with ``What happens \nhere, stays here.'' Rossi was named Co-Brand Marketer of the Year by \nBrandweek magazine for his work with this advertising campaign.\n  Every resident of Clark County has benefited from Rossi's successful \nmarketing and branding effort. Tourism supports jobs for 370,000 \nSouthern Nevada residents and generates more than $41 billion for the \nlocal economy. Today, 20 of the world's 27 largest hotels and resorts \nare located on Las Vegas Strip. And our resorts count on Rossi and the \nLVCVA to help fill rooms. Under Rossi's leadership, Las Vegas has also \ntransformed itself from a weekend destination into the number one trade \nshow destination in North America for 18 consecutive years. With the \nslogan ``Vegas means business,'' Rossi and his team have attracted and \nsigned multiyear contracts to host major conventions from the Consumer \nElectronics Show to the International Apparel show known as MAGIC.\n  Rossi's magic touch and marketing brilliance caught the attention of \nnational leaders in the tourism industry. Last year, Rossi became the \nchairman of our Nation's largest tourism group, US Travel. He was \nappointed to the Commerce Department's Travel and Tourism Advisory \nBoard and serves as a delegate to the White House Conference on \nTourism. The American Marketing Association and the Travel and Tourism \nResearch Association have both presented Rossi with a Lifetime \nAchievement Award.\n  While everyone knows that ``What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,'' \nit is my honor to make sure that what has happened on Rossi's watch is \nproperly recognized. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I am proud to \ncongratulate Rossi Ralenkotter on 40 years in the tourism industry. All \nNevadans have benefited from his leadership at the LVCVA and I look \nforward to many more years of working together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1085-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            S. 415, THE SMALL BUSINESS DISASTER RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nLouisiana in introducing the Small Business Disaster Recovery Act. The \npurpose of this bill is to streamline certain burdensome procedures for \nsmall businesses that are affected by a Presidentially declared \ndisaster. This bill would complement provisions adopted by this body \nand enacted into law earlier this year that the Senator from Louisiana \nand I sponsored to improve FEMA procedures. Like the bill we are \nintroducing today, we derived these provisions from our States' \nexperiences with Hurricane Katrina. They will not cost anything, but \nthey will improve government services at times when they are most \ncritical.\n  Through two budget-neutral provisions, this bill continues to improve \nthe way we respond and recover from disasters using the lessons that we \nhave learned from past disasters. Current practice dictates that small \nbusiness owners can only use their homes as collateral for a post-\ndisaster loan. The legislation's first provision clarifies that the \ncollateral requirement for SBA disaster loans can include business \nassets of actual value other than a primary residence. This removes a \nkey obstacle to small business owners who want to restart operations \nafter a disaster but are unable or unwilling to use their homes when \nthey could conceivably provide sufficient business assets as collateral \nfor the loan.\n  The bill clearly states that these assets should be of equal or \ngreater value to the amount of the loan and ensures that the Small \nBusiness Administration is responsive to the needs of small businesses \nseeking disaster loans less than the maximum allowable. I encourage the \nSmall Business Administration to ensure that the asset requirements for \ncollateral are established in a way that minimizes any potential waste, \nfraud, and abuse. This bill will maintain the traditional standards for \nappropriate collateral assets, which includes commercial real estate, \nmachinery and equipment, business inventory, and furniture and \nfixtures.\n  The second provision included in this legislation addresses \nassistance provided by small business development centers, or SBDCs, to \nout-of-State businesses. It seeks to repeal processes that discourage \nSBDCs to work across State lines when doing so actually makes good \nsense. Sharing resources and knowledge across State lines is essential \nwhen disasters overwhelm local capacity or expertise. This legislation \nhas the support of the Association of Small Business Development \nCenters and the International Economic Development Council because it \nencourages such information and resource sharing.\n  I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Louisiana in \nencouraging States and SBDC networks to formalize partnerships across \nState lines before disasters strike. We are both aware that any action \nor decision that takes place prior to a disaster is an action that does \nnot waste time or resources during a time of crisis. The Emergency \nManagement Assistance Compact system shows how well this can work.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana and her staff for working with me \nand my staff to make sure that this legislation addresses the need for \nSBDCs to be properly reimbursed for work when they appropriately \nrespond to concerns in another state.\n  The reforms in this bill represent commonsense lessons that we have \nlearned from our constituents after experiencing the effects of some of \nthe most severe natural disasters in our Nation's history. I urge \nserious consideration of this legislation and invite other Senators to \ncosponsor this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1085-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1085-S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       OBSERVING RARE DISEASE DAY\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, since 2009, the last day of February \nhas been observed as National Rare Disease Day to raise awareness of \nand provide support for Americans living with a rare disease or \ndisorder.\n  By definition, each rare disease or disorder affects a small patient \npopulation, less than 200,000 people. However, the combined 7,000 \nindividual rare diseases affect nearly 30 million Americans. Sadly, \nchildren with rare genetic diseases account for more than half of the \nrare disease population.\n  Many of these rare diseases are serious, even life-threatening: \nepidermolysis bullosa; progeria; muscular dystrophy; sickle cell \nanemia; Tay-Sachs; cystic fibrosis; many childhood cancers; and \nfibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\n  Patients with rare diseases face unique challenges. Too many of these \nconditions lack effective treatments and cures. And too often people \nwith rare diseases experience challenges in obtaining an accurate \ndiagnosis. In addition, there is often difficulty finding physicians or \ntreatment centers with the necessary expertise in rare diseases or \ndisorders.\n  Great strides have been made in research and treatment as the result \nof the Orphan Drug Act, legislation passed in 1983 to encourage \npharmaceutical companies to bring treatments for rare diseases to \nmarket.\n  This year, the Rare Disease Day Resolution also pays tribute to the \n30th Anniversary of the Orphan Drug Act and calls for us to reflect \nupon the successes of that Act and the challenges to be addressed in \nthe future to prevent, identify, combat, and treat rare diseases.\n  Rare Disease Day is also an important opportunity to honor lifesaving \nadvances in science and research that continue to transform the \ndiagnosis, treatment, and standard of care for many orphan diseases, \nthanks in no small part to the advocacy efforts of the National \nInstitutes of Health, the medical community, patients and their\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\nfamilies, and rare disease organizations, especially the National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders.\n  By designating February 28, 2013, as Rare Disease Day, I hope we \ncreate greater awareness of these conditions, encourage accurate and \nearly diagnosis of rare diseases and disorders, and help demonstrate \nand support a national and global commitment to improve treatment \noptions for individuals with rare diseases and disorders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1086-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BARRY HORSTMAN\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Barry M. \nHorstman of Cincinnati, OH, for his dedication to his community and \ndistinguished career in journalism. Mr. Horstman passed away suddenly \nwhile working in the newsroom of the Cincinnati Enquirer on February \n25, 2013.\n  Known as a ``newsman's newsman,'' Barry Horstman developed a \nreputation as a tough but fair investigative reporter who showed his \ncommitment to his community by being relentless in his work.\n  Horstman's passion for journalism was inspired by his fourth grade \nteacher who encouraged him to write. In high school, he started a \ncolumn for the Western Hills High School newspaper called ``Straight \nfrom the Horstman's Mouth.'' He went on to earn a journalism degree \nfrom The Ohio State University.\n  While a student, Horstman worked at the Cincinnati Post, jumpstarting \nhis long and fruitful career in journalism. Horstman's career included \npositions as a Washington correspondent for Scripps Howard News \nService, a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, a reporter for the \nCincinnati Post, and a writer and supervisor for the Las Vegas Sun \nbefore he returned to his hometown to join the Cincinnati Enquirer in \n2008.\n  Barry covered me off and on for over 20 years, and even when I might \nhave wished his story had been written a little differently, I never \nquestioned his professionalism as a journalist, his commitment to \nreporting the facts as he saw them, and his decency and fairness as a \nperson.\n  A local history buff, Horstman wrote profiles of local Cincinnati \narea newsmakers that were compiled into a book published in 1999: 100 \nWho Made a Difference: Greater Cincinnatians Who Made a Mark on the \n20th Century. He was known for his high energy and enthusiasm in all \nendeavors, especially for taking fantastic vacations around the globe.\n  Horstman grew up on the west side of Cincinnati, raised in an \napartment above the Glenmore Bowl, the bowling alley managed and later \nowned by his father, Les. He was an avid runner and a talented bowler.\n  I honor Barry Horstman for his dedication to Cincinnati and \ncontributions to the field of journalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1086-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE \nORDER 13288 ON MARCH 6, 2003, WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES \n OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND OTHER PERSONS TO \nUNDERMINE ZIMBABWE'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS, AS RECEIVED \n           DURING RECESS OF THE SENATE ON MARCH 1, 2013--PM 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to require that the salaries of Members of Congress be \nsequestered during any sequester under the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I, like many of my colleagues, \nhave just flown in our Nation's airways, going through a fairly crowded \nairport in Florida, coming into a crowded airport here in Washington, \nand in 30 days those TSA lines are going to get longer.\n  For the international flights, I and others have worked very hard to \nget additional customs agents to cut the time it takes to process our \ninternational visitors. In airports such as Miami and Orlando where \nthere is quite a bit of international traffic, getting those additional \ncustoms folks has meant a great deal because we even had some airlines \nthat would come in, for example, to Orlando, and they would have to \nkeep the international passengers on the airplane for upwards of an \nhour before they could get off the airplane so that there was room, \nwith the personnel available.\n  Well, you see where I am going, because all of that is going to \nchange unless--as the Good Book says, come, let us reason together. \nUnless our sharply divided politics--be it partisan, be it \nideological--unless we can come together and reach consensus to stop \nthis ridiculous thing that went into effect last Friday called the \nsequester, which was never intended to go into effect, but because of \nthe inability of the parties to come together, in fact, it is in \neffect, and it is cutting, in an indiscriminate way, like a meat \ncleaver across the board.\n  In certain agencies, such as the Department of Transportation, it \neven gets exacerbated because the cuts can only occur in certain \naccounts. Thus, civilian employees are going to be furloughed.\n  It is also happening in the Department of Defense. In my State of \nFlorida alone, there are going to be 31,000 defense civilian employees \nwho are going to be furloughed. What does a furlough mean? It means \nthat after the 30-day notice, so about 30 days from now, that number of \nemployees--in this example, in the Defense Department--is going to be \nlaid off 1 day a week, under the law, for up to a maximum of 22 weeks. \nIs that in the interest of national security? Of course not.\n  Why is it exacerbated in the Department of Defense? Because the \nexisting appropriations law--remember, we are not operating on a \ncurrent law; we are operating on last year's appropriations\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\nlaw. That has so constrained the managers--in other words, the \nSecretary, the Deputy Secretary--that they can't move the money around, \nand what they are having to do is to take the sequester cuts out of \noperations and maintenance instead of out of acquisitions of systems or \nprograms. That is the worst possible place--out of operations and \nmaintenance.\n  Now, I am an optimist. I couldn't be in this business if I were not \nan optimist. I have ultimate faith in the American people. And I know \nevery one of these Senators here, from the extreme left to the extreme \nright, are all good people, and there can be consensus found if \neverybody would get out of their little silos and realize the greater \ngood.\n  Senator Claire McCaskill and I want to help them, so we are filing a \nbill today. Since this was never intended and all these civilian \nFederal employees are going to be furloughed, our bill will say that \nMembers of Congress will get docked the same percentage of their pay \nthat the furloughed workers are docked in the percentage of their pay.\n  Now, the question is, Will this pass? I hope it doesn't pass because \nI hope it is not necessary to pass. We have 30 days of notice before \nthe furloughs take place. I am certainly hopeful that happens by the \nend of this month, clearly by the time of March 27 when the existing \nappropriations bill--which is last year's appropriation--ceases to \nexist and the government can come to a screeching halt unless we \ncontinue the appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\n  I am hopeful our legislation will not pass, but somebody needs to \nunderstand how ridiculous this whole thing is. Conservatives want to \ncut spending. You can do it in a more intelligent and rational way. If \nwe are going to get serious about $4 trillion of deficit reduction over \nthe decade--and we have already enacted policies that will take us down \nabout 2.5 trillion of deficit reduction--we have about $1.5 trillion to \ngo in enacting policies over that decade and we ought to be able to do \nthat in a nanosecond.\n  Senator McCaskill and I want to try to help nudge the process along. \nWhat is good for the goose is good for the gander. You are going to \ndock all of these civilian employees who have lives, who have families, \nwho have children, who have expenses, who need to buy milk and so forth \nand so on. You are going to dock them their pay because of the \ninability of the Members of Congress to get together to do what should \nhave been done, by the way, a year and a half ago when this whole thing \nwas enacted. The meat cleaver sequester was put there because it was so \nridiculous that surely it would encourage, a year and a half ago, the \nsupercommittee of six from the House, six from the Senate, half and \nhalf of each party--surely it was going to encourage them to come \ntogether in agreement. All it needed was one vote. Instead of a 6-to-6 \ndeadlock it would have been 7 to 5. It did not happen, and here we are \na year and a half later.\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If you are going \nto dock Federal workers' pay because you are going to force them into a \nfurlough which was never intended, is not rational policy, is not good \nadministration, then you are going to be docked your own pay.\n  This is not pontificating. Again, I say I hope this never passes \nbecause I hope it is moot. But it is trying to bring into focus just \nhow ridiculous the goings-on here are right now. So I am very hopeful.\n  I say I love the Members of the Senate, every one of these Members of \nthe Senate. I have a great relationship with almost every one of these \nSenators. They are all good people. We need to come together, give a \nstrong statement of consensus building, and then send it down there to \nthe House and tell them they have to get off the dime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. King):\n  S. 443. A bill to increase public safety by punishing and deterring \nfirearms trafficking; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today I am proud to introduce modified legislation to \ncombat the practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking in \nfirearms. Since my initial introduction of the Stop Illegal Trafficking \nin Firearms Act at the very beginning of the 113th Congress on January \n22, I have had productive conversations with several Senators who share \nmy goal of reducing this destructive criminal conduct. Today I am \npleased to be joined by Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Kirk, \nSenator Gillibrand, and Senator Blumenthal. These Senators understand \nthe weaknesses in our current law and the challenges faced by law \nenforcement officials. I thank them for their commitment to this \nlegislation, for their support of law enforcement, and for their \ncooperation in making progress in our collective efforts to prevent and \nreduce gun violence.\n  I hope that as other Senators on both sides of the aisle become more \nfamiliar with our bipartisan proposal, they will understand how it \nprovides law enforcement with the tools they need to go after those who \nengage in the straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. The \npractice of straw purchasing is used for one thing to put firearms into \nthe hands of those that are prohibited by law from having them. Many \nare then used to further violent crimes.\n  I have heard again and again from Senators on both sides of the aisle \nthat keeping guns away from those who should not have them is a goal \nworth pursuing. This bill will further that effort and help answer the \ncall from Gabrielle Giffords and so many Americans for us to take \naction.\n  I want to commend the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, for \nher leadership on this matter and for her willingness to work across \nthe aisle to make real progress. She helped unite us to get this done. \nWithout her, we would not have made the progress we have, or be in \nposition to consider this comprehensive response to what law \nenforcement has told us they need.\n  This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue our \nconsideration of four measures to reduce gun violence. The issue of gun \ntrafficking and straw purchasing is before the Committee. I will amend \nmy original trafficking bill that is pending on the Committee agenda \nwith the text of this bipartisan compromise, which combines the \nproposals that I put forward with Senator Durbin at the beginning of \nthis Congress as well as proposals that have been championed by Senator \nGillibrand and Senator Kirk. Our substitute amendment will improve the \nlanguage already pending before the Committee. As I did before \nintroducing any measure related to gun violence this year, I also hope \nto continue my outreach to the Judiciary Committee's Ranking Member. I \ninvite Senator Grassley and other members of the Committee from both \nsides of the aisle to join with us so that I can report this measure \nwith strong bipartisan support and without delay for consideration by \nthe Senate.\n  Law enforcement officials have complained for years that they lack \nthe legal tools necessary effectively to combat illegal straw \npurchasing and firearms trafficking. Congressional inquiry during the \nlast Congress put a spotlight on the very difficult legal environment \nwithin which law enforcement officials currently operate. In fact, one \nof the whistleblowers who testified about the misguided tactics used by \nFederal law enforcement in firearms trafficking investigations in \nArizona described the current laws as ``toothless.'' If we are to \naddress gun violence, we should respond to this clear vulnerability \nthat is being exploited by criminals.\n  The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act will make important \nchanges to Federal firearms statutes that will better equip law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute the all-too-common \npractices of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. \nStraw purchases typically involve a person, who is not prohibited by \nFederal law, purchasing a firearm on behalf of a prohibited person, or \nat the direction of a drug trafficking or other criminal organization. \nThese practices result in the support of larger criminal organizations, \nand the illegally obtained guns are often sold and re-sold across state \nlines. This trafficking in firearms results in the proliferation of \nillegal firearms and gun violence in our communities. Straw\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\npurchasers circumvent the purposes of the background check system, and \nthey put law enforcement officials and law-abiding firearms dealers in \ndifficult positions. Gun trafficking and straw purchasing make our \ncommunities less safe.\n  Under current law, there is no specific statute that makes it illegal \nto act as a straw purchaser of firearms. Nor is there a law directly on \npoint to address the illegal trafficking of firearms. As a result, \nprosecutors must cobble together charges against a straw purchaser \nusing so-called ``paperwork'' violations such as misrepresentations on \na Federal form. These laws are imperfect, and do not give prosecutors \nthe leverage needed to encourage straw buyers, often the lowest rungs \non a ladder in a criminal enterprise, to provide the information needed \nfor investigators and prosecutors to go after those directing and \nprofiting from such activity.\n  The bipartisan bill we introduce today will add two new provisions to \nour Federal criminal code to specifically prohibit serving as a straw \npurchaser of firearms and trafficking in firearms. The bill establishes \ntough penalties for these offenses in an effort to punish and \nimportantly, deter this conduct. We need a meaningful solution to this \nserious problem. Talk about prosecuting mere paperwork offenses is no \nanswer.\n  Under current law, it is a crime to transfer a firearm to another \nwith the knowledge that the firearm will be used in criminal activity. \nThis bill would strengthen this existing law by prohibiting such a \ntransfer where the transferor has ``reasonable cause to believe'' that \nthe firearm will be used in criminal activity. We listened to concerns \nabout family members who give firearms as gifts and other transfers \nthat are not designed to get around the existing background check \nsystem. As a result, the bill contains important exemptions for the \ninnocent transfer of a firearm as a gift, or in relation to a \nlegitimate raffle, auction or contest.\n  Another key provision of our bipartisan bill is that it complements \nexisting law that makes it a crime to smuggle firearms into the United \nStates by specifically prohibiting the smuggling of firearms out of the \nUnited States. In light of what we know is occurring, particularly on \nour Southwest border, this is an important improvement to current law \nand another tool that was needed but missing over the last few years.\n  The provisions laid out in our legislation are focused, commonsense \nremedies to the very real problems of firearms trafficking and straw \npurchasing. Our bill does not affect lawful purchases from Federal \nfirearms licensees, and in no way alters their rights and \nresponsibilities as sellers of a lawful commodity. I hope Federal \nfirearms licensees welcome a stronger deterrent to keep criminal straw \npurchasers out of their business.\n  The problems of gun trafficking and straw purchasers, particularly \nalong the Southwest border, are matters we have been talking about for \nyears. Senator Durbin chaired a hearing on border violence back in \nearly 2009. Law enforcement officials have called for a firearms \ntrafficking statute that can be effective to go after straw purchasers. \nThat is something agents did not have when they initiated Operation \nWide Receiver during the Bush administration and later the disastrous \nFast and Furious effort. Their frustration with the limits of the \ncurrent law contributed to their looking for another way to make a \ndifference in their fight against gun trafficking. Their initiative was \na failure. What we need to do now is to create better law enforcement \ntools. I hope that those who have been concerned about Fast and \nFurious, whose investigation established that it was the local ATF \nagents in Arizona who initiated and so poorly implemented that effort, \nwill join with us to close the loophole in the law that Mexican drug \ncartels are continuing to exploit.\n  Our bill was drafted at the request of law enforcement. It will \nprovide needed tools to fight against the drug cartels and other \ncriminals who threaten our communities. It will not undermine the \nSecond Amendment rights of lawful gun owners. It has the support of \nmany law enforcement organizations--both leadership and rank and file. \nIndeed, the original bill I introduced with Senator Durbin has been \nsupported by the National Fraternal Order of Police, the National Law \nEnforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the Police Executive Research \nForum. I urge everyone who cares about keeping firearms out of the \nhands of criminals to join in this effort.\n  We have an obligation to find solutions to reduce gun violence and I \nthank these Senators for their strong leadership. We can do this in a \nway consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. I \nbelieve our bipartisan legislation meets those goals. As Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, a Senator, a Vermonter, an American, a father \nand a grandfather, I look forward to continuing our progress on this \nimportant legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks by thanking the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his very gracious \ncomments and for his extraordinary leadership on a bill that I believe \ncan bring all of us together.\n  I also want to thank our other cosponsors of the bill, particularly \nSenator Gillibrand, who has had a great interest in cracking down on \nthe practice of straw purchasing.\n  The practice of straw purchasing is intended to achieve one result--\nto put a gun in the hands of a criminal. These individuals are easily \nexploiting currently weak Federal laws to obtain guns.\n  Peter Forcelli, ATF Supervisory Special Agent and Fast and Furious \nwhistleblower, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \nin June of 2011 that: ``Some people view [the current penalties for \nstraw purchasing] as no more consequential than doing 65 in a 55 \nzone.''\n  These guns are frequently sold, resold, and trafficked across State \nlines, resulting in the proliferation of illegal firearms in our \ncommunities. This has also fueled the violence across our southern \nborder associated with Mexican drug cartels as well as gang violence in \nour cities.\n  Straw purchasing and gun trafficking put guns in the hands of \ncriminals. According to the ATF, of the nearly 94,000 firearms that \nhave been recovered in Mexico in the last 5 years, more than 64,000 \nwere sourced to the United States. Similarly, a large percentage of the \nguns used in crimes in our largest cities were trafficked across State \nlines.\n  The congressional inquiry into the ATF's Wide Receiver and Fast and \nFurious investigations revealed how difficult it is for law enforcement \nofficials to deter and punish these crimes effectively.\n  Current loopholes in Federal law make preventing and prosecuting \nthese offenses very difficult for law enforcement officials. Right now, \na straw purchaser can only be prosecuted for lying on a Federal form, \nwhich is treated as a paperwork violation.\n  Because straw purchasers by definition are nonprohibited persons and \ncan lawfully purchase a firearm, prosecuting these individuals is \ndifficult and any potential punishment is likely to be minimal.\n  Because of these weak laws, prosecutors have minimal leverage over \nstraw purchasers who, in turn, have little incentive to cooperate and \nassist law enforcement in investigating trafficking crimes and crimes \ninvolving gun violence. For years, law enforcement has been asking \nCongress for better tools to crack down on this type of criminal \nconduct.\n  It is time to give law enforcement the tools it needs to combat this \nactivity effectively.\n  Our bill reflects a combination of advice from law enforcement \nofficials and leadership by many Senators. It gives law enforcement \nofficials the comprehensive framework they have been seeking from \nCongress.\n  First, the bill creates new, specific criminal offenses for straw \npurchasing and trafficking in firearms. Instead of a slap on the wrist, \nthese crimes would be punishable by up to 25 years in prison.\n  The proposal also increases the punishment for an individual who \nserves as\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\nan organizer of a straw purchasing or trafficking enterprise.\n  This bipartisan bill also strengthens existing laws that make it \nunlawful to smuggle guns into the United States.\n  The bill protects legitimate private sales and is drafted to avoid \nsweeping in innocent transactions and placing unnecessary burdens on \nlawful private sales.\n  When buying from a private seller, the buyer is only in violation of \nthe new straw purchasing prohibition if the buyer purchases a firearm \nfor someone known to the buyer as a prohibited person, meaning a felon, \ndrug addict, someone subject to a domestic violence order, or someone \nwith serious mental illness.\n  When buying from a federally licensed firearms dealer, it is \nprohibited to buy a firearm on behalf of or for another person. This is \nconsistent with current law that requires a person buying from a dealer \nto certify that they are the ``actual buyer.'' It is important to note, \nhowever, that the bill also expressly exempts transactions like gifts \nand transfers that occur in raffles and auctions.\n  The bill is supported by numerous organizations, including the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the FBI Agents Association, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National \nLaw Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the Police Executive Research \nForum.\n  This bill helps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals without \ninfringing in any way upon the second amendment right of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this much needed legislation.\n  I am, again, very pleased to have been able to work under the \nleadership of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I am delighted \nhe is going to proceed to mark up our bipartisan compromise this week, \nand I thank him for the opportunity to work with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that \nevery mother in America is thinking about. Every parent in America who \nsaw what happened in Connecticut bleeds for this issue. We have to do \nsomething in our country about senseless gun crime. We have to do \nsomething about making sure criminals do not have easy access to \nweapons to shoot down our children and loved ones in the areas that \nshould be the safest places for them. We have seen these mass deaths, \nwhether at a school, whether at a university, whether in a movie \ntheater, whether in a community center; these crimes are happening over \nand over again.\n  I can tell you that from when I was first appointed to the Senate in \n2009, I have realized our State of New York suffers from grave gun \ncrime all across our State. We have gang violence. We have gun \ntrafficking. We have straw purchasing. Networks of weapons flow into \nour State. Eighty-five percent of the weapons used in crimes in my \nState come from out of State and 90 percent of those weapons are \nillegal.\n  I had to look into the eyes of parents who had just lost their \ndaughter because of a stray bullet from a gang member. Nyasia's parents \ndeserve an answer. The parents of the children in Connecticut deserve \nan answer.\n  I have good news today because the Senate is working on a bipartisan \nbill that is introduced today by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Leahy, to begin to solve this problem. This bill \nhas wide bipartisan support. It started out with Senator Mark Kirk and \nI working together. He has a real tough problem in Illinois with gang \nviolence that he wanted to address and crack down on. That bipartisan \nwork began to address other bipartisan work. The ranking member, \nSenator Grassley, was very interested in this bill and has been working \nwith us to shape the bill, make it stronger. Susan Collins, who has \nbeen a leader on this issue, began to work with us to shape this bill \nand make it better. Senator Leahy and Senator Durbin have been working \non the issue separately. We all joined forces to begin to write a bill \nthat can tackle this problem, to make it a stronger solution, a better \nsolution.\n  We now have cosponsors. We have the Presiding Officer right now, \nSenator Joe Donnelly. We have both Senators from Connecticut who must \nanswer the parents of their State, that they are doing something about \nthese senseless deaths. Senator Blumenthal, a former attorney general, \nknows what law enforcement needs to take on these criminals. Senator \nMurphy, Senator Klobuchar--also a previous attorney general--know what \nit takes to crack down on these kinds of crime and this senseless \ndeath. Senator King, an Independent, also signs on to this bill because \nhe knows it can do something to crack down on gun violence in this \ncountry.\n  Of all the laws on the books in this country today, not one Federal \nlaw says you cannot buy a truckload of guns, bring them to another \nState, and sell them to a criminal network. It is not even prohibited. \nYou would not believe it. How could that be true in a country such as \nours, where the Federal Government's No. 1 job is to protect our \nfamilies? That is what this bill does. It makes it a Federal crime to \ntraffic, to be a straw purchaser, to sell these guns to criminal \nnetworks with the intent of breaking the law.\n  The law enforcement agencies--whether it is ATF, NYPD, FBI--will now \nhave the tools they need on the Federal level to begin to tackle this \ncrisis.\n  I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle, if they want to do \nsomething about the senseless gun deaths in this country, this is a \nbill they can support. For all the law-abiding gun owners in this \ncountry who support the second amendment, as I do, they can look at \nthis bill and say: That is a bill we are supporting; that bill should \npass because it goes after the criminals and the illegal weapons that \nare the scourge of this country. Thirty people get killed a day because \nof gun violence--30 deaths. One is too many. When I look at Nyasia's \nparents, one is too many.\n  Enough is enough. I am certain that when this bill passes this \nChamber and when law enforcement begins to have the tools, we will save \nlives.\n  I thank my colleagues again for all the hard work they have done. I \nthank Senator Mark Kirk for his courage for being the first Republican \nto stand up to do a gun bill, the first bipartisan gun bill introduced \nin this Chamber.\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Stop Illegal \nTrafficking in Firearms Act of 2013, which I am proud to join in \nintroducing with Senators Leahy, Gillibrand, Durbin and Collins. There \nare an estimated 33,000 gangs with 1.4 million active members who live \nin our neighborhoods, towns and cities across the United States. With \nmore than 100,000 gang members, the city of Chicago has more gang \nmembers who terrorize its residents than any other city in the United \nStates. The Chicago Crime Commission also reported the existence of an \nadditional 15,000 gang members operating in our suburbs.\n  Gangs such as the Vice Lords, Gangster Disciples, and the Latin Kings \nare responsible for nearly 80 percent of the city's homicides, which \njust last summer amounted to 500 deaths in Chicago. These homicides are \nmost often perpetrated with illegal weapons. Law enforcement officers \nin Chicago confiscate an average of 13,000 illegal weapons each year. \nIt must end.\n  That is why I have joined this bipartisan group to take serious \naction to prevent weapons trafficking and straw purchasing, where a \nthird party member legally purchases a firearm then sells or trades it \nto a criminal who is legally barred from purchasing such a weapon. Our \nbipartisan, consensus legislation includes the Gun Trafficking \nPrevention Act, which Senator Gillibrand and I introduced earlier this \nyear, that would for the first time make it a Federal crime to traffic \nillegal guns. The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act also \nstrengthens the tools law enforcement need to crack down on straw \npurchasers, particularly those who transfer those weapons in \nfurtherance of crimes of violence or drug trafficking. This legislation \nalso calls upon the Sentencing Commission to substantially increase the \npenalties when these crimes are committed by individuals affiliated \nwith gangs and other criminal enterprises.\n  A portion of this new anti-illegal gun trafficking legislation is \nnamed after\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\nHadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who was shot and killed by gang gunfire \nin Chicago. For Hadiya and thousands of other victims, my hope is we \ncan break through the gridlock here in Washington to actually get \nsomething done to save lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. King):\n  S. 444. A bill making appropriations for the Department of Defense \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two separate \nproblems facing our Nation--the first is sequestration, which is \nunderway now and indiscriminately affecting a wide range of programs. \nThe second is the prospect of a long-term Continuing Resolution to fund \nthe Federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year, also not \nthe way we should be doing business. Both will result in damage to our \nmilitary readiness.\n  In order to tackle these two separate but equally devastating \nproblems, I am introducing two measures today.\n  The first bill, which I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nUdall, in sponsoring, will help mitigate the consequences of \nsequestration by providing Department and agency heads additional \nflexibility in implementing the cuts. The second bill, which I am \nintroducing with my colleague from my home state of Maine, Senator \nKing, will fund the Department of Defense for the remainder of the \nfiscal year at levels approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee \nin the funding bill that was reported unanimously by the Committee on \nAugust 2, 2012.\n  As Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has repeatedly warned, \nfailing to pass an annual defense appropriations bill and requiring the \nPentagon to operate under last year's law will continue to lead to \ndangerous absurdities that have ramifications that last far beyond the \nsix months left in this fiscal year.\n  Military readiness will suffer. A hollow force will be created. The \nPentagon will be unable to increase production rates for existing \nweapons, start new programs, or sign multiyear procurement contracts \nthat would provide significant savings for taxpayers.\n  When I questioned Deputy Secretary Carter on February 14, at a Senate \nAppropriations Committee hearing about what the continuing resolution \nmeans for the Navy and our domestic shipbuilding capability, he \ntestified that:\n\n       We're in the absurd position where we're five months into \n     the fiscal year and we have the authority to build the ships \n     that we built last year and no authority to build the ships \n     that we plan to build this year. That's crazy . . . and that \n     has nothing to do with sequester, by the way, that's the CR.\n\n  I have long argued that we need to bring the annual appropriations \nbills to the floor to be considered individually on their merits. I \nbelieve that CRs represent an abdication of our responsibility and \nshould be avoided altogether. But given where we find ourselves today, \nat the very least we should be able to come together to pass the full-\nyear Department of Defense funding bill and the Military Construction/\nVeterans Affairs appropriations.\n  With regard to sequestration, we have known this day could arrive for \na year and a half now. Yet, instead of working together to avert \nsequestration and replace it with a more rational alternative, the time \nhas been spent jockeying for partisan advantage and engaging in a blame \ngame. Last week, the Senate spent time voting against proceeding to \ndebate on two partisan proposals that both sides knew beforehand were \ndoomed.\n  The bill Senator Udall and I are introducing today is a bipartisan \neffort to mitigate the harmful effects of sequestration. As a result of \nsequestration, vital priorities such as defense, education, \ntransportation, and biomedical research, all face indiscriminate, meat-\nax cuts. No distinction is made between high-performing programs and \npoorly performing ones.\n  The legislation we introduce today seeks to fix that. Instead of \nmindless across-the-board budget cuts, this legislation provides the \nheads of Federal agencies and departments with the flexibility to \nimplement the savings targets required by the Budget Control Act until \nsuch time as a bipartisan agreement is reached to replace the sequester \ncuts or until Congress passes new appropriations bills for fiscal year \n2013 that meet the sequester levels.\n  The bill requires these agency and Department heads to submit their \nproposals to the Appropriations committees of both the House and the \nSenate for approval.\n  This approval is an important step in the process because these \nCommittees know the budget of each agency and can provide oversight of \nagency plans. This provides a strong incentive for each agency to put \nforth serious plans in order to avoid the across-the-board \nsequestration cuts that would otherwise take effect.\n  Let me emphasize that while our proposal is intended to mitigate the \nharmful and mindless across-the-board approach of sequestration, a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan approach to put our fiscal house in order \nmust remain a top priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both bills that we are introducing \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/04/senate-section/article/S1093-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 25.
