Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 11 a.m. this morning, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  At 11 a.m. the Senate will proceed to executive session, and we will \nhave five rollcall votes which will be to confirm three judges from \nFlorida, one from Vermont, and also a very important cloture vote on \nthe Rodriguez nomination, to be the Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we still have scores and scores \nof good men and women on the Executive Calendar waiting to be \nconfirmed. The delay by the Republicans is untoward. It has never \nhappened before, and we are working through these as quickly as we can. \nThe judges only take an hour of postcloture time, but the nominations \ntake 8 hours of postcloture time. We can yield back 4 hours, which we \ndo almost every time, but these stalling tactics by the Republicans \nhave added to our doing nothing here in the Senate not by hours or days \nor weeks but by months. It is so unfortunate. We have never had a \nsituation such as this before.\n  As everyone knows, we changed the rules as they related to judges, \nand thank goodness we did that. Justice can move forward in our country \nwithout the delay and obstruction that has taken place over the last \nnumber of years with Republicans holding up judges. We, through the \nchairman of the committee, have moved lots of judges. We now have four \ncircuit court judges we have to move toward, and we will do that, even \nthough each one of those takes 30 hours. We are nearly caught up with \ndistrict court judges, which speaks well for the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senators who are forwarding names to the President for \nsubmission to the committee.\n\n\n                        Workforce Investment Act\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to turn to the Workforce \nInvestment Act--a nice, important piece of legislation. It is a picture \nof what we should be doing here on legislation in general. The \nWorkforce Investment Act is a very complicated piece of legislation. We \nare not going to spend a lot of time on it, but that should not in any \nway take away from the importance of this legislation. It is very \nimportant legislation. It is an example of how we should be able to get \ndone in the Senate.\n  I commend Senators Murray, Harkin, and Alexander for working to get \nthis bill to us. They have spent untoward hours and hours of time to \nget us here. Everyone knows Lamar Alexander is a peacemaker, and I \nappreciate his work. I was told a few minutes ago that he came to the \nfloor and said: Why don't we go ahead on the appropriations bills and \non amendments that appear to be controversial, and we can have a 60-\nvote threshold on those? I suggested the same thing yesterday.\n  We voted here approximately 50 times. I have been forced to have, \nbecause of the McConnell rule, 60 votes\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\non anything that is the least bit controversial. Let's move through the \nappropriations bills. People on my side of the aisle want to do this, \nand I don't know why the Republicans would prevent us from doing that, \nbut that is where we are now.\n\n\n                             Voting Rights\n\n  I will talk to the press about the next issue in more detail at a \nsubsequent time, but I wish to congratulate Rand Paul, the junior \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  About 15 years ago, I offered an amendment on the Senate floor that \nsaid if someone has been convicted of a crime or felony and completed \ntheir sentence, if they go to jail, and their probation, if they got \nprobation, they should be able to vote, and that is what Rand Paul \nsaid.\n  Rand Paul offered legislation that said if it is a nonviolent crime, \nthey should be able to vote when they have completed their time. I went \na little farther than that with my legislation, but I appreciate his \nsuggestion. I will have more to say about that later, and I hope I \ndon't get him in trouble with the Republican caucus for congratulating \nhim.\n  This is something that is long overdue. As a country, we should allow \npeople who have served their time and penance, or however you want to \nstate it, the ability to vote. I have said it before, and I now have \nsaid it for a third time. I will have a lot more to say about it later \ntoday.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker).

Mr. President, for a number of years I have come to this \nfloor to talk about an issue I wish to bring up again this morning, and \nthe issue is for-profit colleges and universities.\n  Many people, when they hear me describe this, don't understand which \nschools I am talking about. It is not the public and private \nuniversities that you would think of automatically, such as the \nUniversity of Illinois and Northwestern University and others. It is \nthe for-profit world of higher education.\n  The for-profit colleges and universities are led by the Apollo Group, \nwhich owns the University of Phoenix, and is the largest; DeVry \nUniversity, which is based out of Chicago; Kaplan and Corinthian, and \nmany others.\n  They bring about 10 to 12 percent of all the high school graduates \ninto their for-profit colleges. They receive from the Federal \nGovernment 20 percent of all the Federal aid to education because the \ntuition they charge is very high, and these for-profit colleges have \nanother distinction--their students account for 46 percent of all \ncollege student loan defaults. They enroll 10 percent of the students \nand account for 46 percent of the student loan defaults.\n  What is going on here? What is going on here is they are charging \nthese students a high tuition for these for-profit schools, and they \nare not preparing them to go to work or at least not to work at jobs \nwhere they can pay off those student loans. As a result students will \ndrop out before they finish or they will finish with a diploma that is \nworthless. They can't find a job, they can't pay back their student \nloans, and now they are in the worst of all possible worlds--deep in \ndebt with no education to speak of.\n  The reason I am raising the point about the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities is because there have been several significant \ndevelopments. Education Management Corporation owns a group of schools \ncalled the Art Institutes. I have run into them in the Chicagoland \narea. Argosy is another one of these for-profit schools, as is ITT \nTech, and I mentioned Kaplan and Apollo.\n  Career Education Corporation has schools such as the American \nIntercontinental University and the Harrington College of Design. They \nsound very appealing.\n  I met one of the students who attended Harrington. Her name is Hannah \nMoore. She is a young woman from Chicago. She went to community college \nfor 2 years, and then she transferred into the Harrington College of \nDesign in the suburbs of Chicago to get a degree in design. When it was \nall over, after she received her degree, she could not find a job--not \nin that field. It turned out the degree was basically worthless.\n  When she left Harrington College of Design, she had a college debt of \n$125,000. She could not find a job, and she could not make the \npayments. She had to move back in with her parents because that is all \nshe could do, and because she could not keep up with the payments, her \ncollege loan debt grew to $150,000. Her father came out of retirement \nto help her pay for it.\n  Think about it. She did what she thought was a good thing in going to \ncollege, went to one of these worthless for-profit schools, and now her \nlife has literally changed forever because of this mountain of debt.\n  Then there is a group called Corinthian College, which I want to \nfocus on here. Corinthian College is based out of California. The local \ncollege's name, you may recognize, is Everest Colleges. We have 6 in \nIllinois, about 10 in Michigan, a dozen in California, and they are \nacross the United States.\n  It turned out that last year evidence surfaced that Everest Colleges \nwere falsifying the information they provided to the Federal \nGovernment. In some cases it turns out they even paid employers to hire \nEverest graduates for a short period of time so they could report to \nthe government that their graduates had found jobs, and then after the \nreport was made, the people were let go. They didn't have a job.\n  Everest was asked to send additional information to the Federal \nGovernment about this fraudulent practice, and for 5 months they failed \nto do it. Then last week the U.S. Department of Education said: Because \nEverest won't provide us with the data they are supposed to under the \nlaw, we are going to suspend new student loan money to them for 21 \ndays. Everest Colleges--or Corinthian, their parent corporation--\nannounced that because of this, they will not have enough money and may \nnot be able to continue their operations. The value of stock in this \ncorporation, Corinthian Corporation, went down to the range of 28 cents \nlast week. Nobody would loan them money.\n  Right now some 75,000 students across America are enrolled in Everest \nColleges with student loans, and there is a very good chance that \nEverest Colleges--Corinthian as we know it--will not survive.\n  My obvious question is: What will happen to these students? They have \nthe debt to go to this worthless school that appears to be going out of \nbusiness.\n  We are working with the U.S. Department of Education right now. I am \nconcerned about where these students are going to end up. I contacted \nthe community colleges in my State and said: Reach out to the Everest \nCollege students and see if you can rescue these kids.\n  But when we look at this and put it in perspective, we see this is \nonly one of many for-profit colleges and universities. Most parents and \nmost students don't know this whole brand of higher education is out \nthere. They think it is just like every other college. It is not, and \nwe are not doing a good enough job at the Federal level to regulate \nthese for-profit colleges and universities that are exploiting these \nstudents.\n  Let me tell my colleagues one story that was reported recently that I \nthink is horrible, involving Corinthian Colleges. It is an article \nwritten by David Halperin entitled ``For-profit College Enrolls \n`Exploits' Student Who Reads at Third-grade Level.''\n  A 37-year-old man with what appeared to be a developmental \ndisability--he was described as shaking, speaking haltingly, reading at \nan elementary school level--37-years-old--was allowed to enroll in \nEverest College's criminal justice program.\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n  According to the librarian who worked with him--and subsequently \nresigned because of the treatment of this man--the man was rarely able \nto comprehend sentences, was unable to sound out words, and does not \nhave the ability to read documents he was asked to sign. She was \nworried about his ability to even understand the debt he was signing on \nfor, the student loan debt at one of these Everest Colleges.\n  It apparently didn't matter to Everest. They were ready to sign him \nup into college. As long as this man was eligible to take out Federal \nloans, Everest was going to get paid. The man was just an ATM machine \nspitting out dollars to Everest Colleges.\n  Is that outrageous, to think they would lure someone with a \ndisability into signing up?\n  The list goes on and on, including Ashford University, another one of \nthese for-profit colleges and universities.\n  The obvious question we have to ask is this: When will our Department \nof Education and when will this Congress address this travesty? What is \nexisting across the United States with these for-profit colleges and \nuniversities is an outrage, and it is exploiting the students and their \nfamilies.\n  Sadly, a couple of weeks ago we tried to pass a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate so that students could renegotiate their student loans and \nbring down the interest rates. Every Democrat voted for it. We needed 5 \nRepublicans out of 45 to join us so that students in States such as New \nJersey and Illinois could renegotiate their student loan rates down and \nmake them more affordable. We got three Republicans: Senator Collins of \nMaine, Senator Corker of Tennessee, and Senator Murkowski of Alaska. We \nneeded two more to start the debate about renegotiating college loans.\n  I think we have to wake up here. This debt families across America \nare facing--44 million individuals paying college loans--is an outrage. \nPart of it was started by these for-profit schools, but another part of \nit just reflects a debt that is out of control, and we ought to be more \nsensitive to it.\n  We are going to call this again. Elizabeth Warren brought the bill to \nthe floor. This time we are going to hope that some of our Republican \ncolleagues go home to their States and in town meetings actually speak \nwith families who are paying college student loans. If they will, I \nthink they will understand they should join us in this effort: to give \nthese college students and their families a fighting chance to pay off \ntheir loans and to reform this higher education system to stop the \noutrageous conduct by these for-profit colleges and universities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last summer I said it felt as though \nthe White House had hung a ``Gone Campaignin' '' sign outside the Oval \nOffice. President Obama didn't seem the least bit interested in passing \nserious, bipartisan solutions for the middle class. It was all \ncampaigning, all the time.\n  On the rarest of occasions when he did come to Congress, it was for \ninternal campaign rallies with his party. Well, it has actually only \ngotten worse.\n  Since last summer he has barely picked up the phone and his bill-\nsigning pen is literally starting to rust. Here is the reason: This \nsummer the Democratic-controlled Senate seems to have put out a ``Gone \nCampaignin''' sign of its own. That is why the Democratic Senate has \nbecome a veritable graveyard of good ideas.\n  Most people assume the purpose of the Senate is to pass legislation \nto help the American people, but these days the Democrats who run the \nSenate seem to think their role is actually to just bury good \nlegislation. They are more interested in pleasing their far left \npolitical patrons--patrons who appear to oppose everything that could \nactually help the American middle class.\n  Case in point: The Republican-led House of Representatives has \nalready passed hundreds of pieces of legislation this Congress--\nlegislation introduced by Members of both parties, including dozens of \njobs bills, that remain stuck here in the Senate. That means President \nObama has not had to sign or veto them, and the Senate majority leader \nhas been all too happy to protect him from choosing between helping the \nfar-left fringe and the vast American middle. In other words, Senate \nDemocrats are on a mission this summer to obstruct solutions for the \nmiddle class at every turn and to prevent almost any serious \nlegislating from occurring at all--at all.\n  Over in the House the minority party has been offered more than 160 \nvotes on their amendments since last July. Here in the Senate the \nDemocratic leadership has blocked all but nine Republican rollcall \nvotes.\n  And it is not just Republican amendments getting squashed either. The \nDemocrats who run the Senate are so scared of legislating these days \nthey are blocking virtually every amendment on both sides. It has \ngotten to the point where one House Democrat, a Congresswoman from \nTexas, has now had twice as many rollcall votes on amendments since \nlast July--15--as the entire Senate Democratic caucus combined. One \nMember of the House in the minority party has had more votes than all \nof the Democratic Senators combined over the last year. Between the 55 \nSenate Democrats, they have had seven amendments in a year.\n  In other words, the majority leader is treating his one caucus even \nworse than he is treating us.\n  Even committee work can no longer escape the Democratic majority's \npolitical obsession. The majority shut down the committee process on \nimportant legislation that should have been and would have been \nbipartisan--bills about patents and appropriations.\n  This is the kind of stuff that makes Americans so very mad at \nWashington. I mean, how do we justify stifling the voices of so many \nSenators and the tens of millions of Americans they were sent here to \nrepresent? It is indefensible. It has gotten worse and worse under \ncurrent Democratic leaders.\n  Of course, every now and then, when we push hard enough, we are able \nto force our Democratic friends to allow a few--a few--bipartisan ideas \nto go through, such as the job training and workforce development bill \nwe expect to pass tomorrow. But, boy, that is the rare exception around \nhere--a very rare exception. Instead, we usually just see the game \nplaying on important issues.\n  On energy, Democratic leadership blocked every attempt to provide \nrelief to blue collar families who have been bulldozed by the \nadministration's elitist war on coal jobs. They will not help the \nmillions of Americans who struggle every single day with high utility \nbills, and they will not allow a serious vote on shovel-ready projects \nsuch as the Keystone Pipeline, either. Senate Democrats have blocked \njust about every effort to move forward on these issues. In so doing \nthe Democratic leadership actually embarrasses the handful of \nDemocratic Senators who still call for action on energy and Keystone--\neven veteran Members who chair committees. It just shows what little \ninfluence those Members actually have under the current Democratic \nleadership.\n\n  It all lays bare a very simple truth about today's Democratic Senate: \nIf the far left hates it, it ain't happening.\n  That is true with health care too. The middle class is being \nplummeted by ObamaCare. A recent study showed that an average 27-year-\nold Kentuckian from Taylor County saw his premiums skyrocket by almost \n60 percent this year. Constituents such as he are looking to Washington \nfor leadership and for solutions, but Senate Democrats will not even \nallow sensible bipartisan health care solutions to come to a vote.\n  Instead, we just get more politics, such as the legislation we hear \nmay be coming up later this week--a tactic designed by the Democratic \ncampaign committee to make Americans forget--forget--that Democrats \nvoted to raid Medicare--voted to raid Medicare--by $700 billion to fund \nnew ObamaCare spending. Every Democrat in the Senate, on Christmas Eve, \n2009, without exception, voted to take $700 billion out of Medicare to \nhelp fund ObamaCare.\n  Senate Democrats are actually trying to distract from their votes to \nraid Medicare by making it even harder to\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nsave and strengthen Medicare. But Americans will not forget that the \nsponsors of the proposal were the very same people who voted to raid \nMedicare in the first place, through ObamaCare.\n  And they will not forget what happened last week either when \nRepublicans advanced a series of bills aimed at increasing flexibility \nin the workplace and boosting upward mobility. We thought Democrats \nmight want to work with us in a bipartisan manner to move these bills \nforward, but apparently the far left will not let them. Democratic \nleadership will not even consider legislation I have introduced that \nwould help more moms and dads work from home while caring for young \nchildren. My bill aims to bring tax policy in line with what life is \nreally like for working parents, and it would help young families save \non child care costs too. But as I said, Senate Democrats have just gone \ncampaigning.\n  For the Democratic leadership, helping the middle class seems to be \nfar from priority one. But the middle class needs help right now, and \nthe only way to offer working moms and struggling college graduates \nreal solutions is to break through the Senate Democratic logjam.\n  There are two ways to accomplish that. Either our friends on the \nother side can get serious about working for the people who elected \nthem or the people who elected them can make the decision for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3906-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3906-S3907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday the White House held its Summit \non Working Families. On the summit's Web site, the White House notes: \n``Too many working Americans--both men and women--are living paycheck \nto paycheck, struggling to make ends meet and respond to the competing \ndemands of work and family.'' That, unfortunately, is the truth.\n  But what the White House does not acknowledge is how much its \npolicies have done to create that situation. Working families have not \nfared well under the Obama administration. Household income has fallen \nby $3,500 on the President's watch. Meanwhile, prices for nearly \neverything have risen. Food prices have gone up. Tuition costs are \nsoaring. Airline fares are rising. The cost of recreational activities, \nsuch as going to the movies, has risen. And energy prices are placing a \nhuge burden on American families.\n  Gas prices have nearly doubled since the President took office. Low-\nincome families in my State of South Dakota pay an average of 24 \npercent of their income on energy costs alone. And things are set to \nget much worse.\n  This month the President's EPA announced plans to implement a massive \nenergy tax on Americans. Thanks to this tax, energy bills could rise to \ncrippling levels for many families in the next few years. That is not \nwhat families need, especially--especially--when they are already \npaying huge amounts for health care.\n  ObamaCare was supposed to make things better for American families. \nThe President assured the American people that his health care law \nwould reduce premiums by $2,500. But since ObamaCare passed, not only \nhave premiums not fallen, they have actually risen--gone up--by $2,500.\n  Millions of Americans were forced off the health plans they were \npromised they could keep and into exchange plans that frequently cost \nmore money and offer less. Too many American families now have exchange \nplans with massive deductibles--some as high as $12,000 or more.\n  What middle-class family can afford to pay $12,000 a year for medical \ncare--$12,000 on top of their premiums? That is like having an \nadditional mortgage payment every single month. It is no wonder 54 \npercent of Americans do not think the President ``is able to lead the \ncountry and get the job done,'' according to a recent Wall Street \nJournal/NBC News poll.\n  So what can you do if you are a working family living paycheck to \npaycheck and struggling with the high cost of everything from health \ncare to gasoline? Well, over the past few years the answer has been not \nmuch because opportunities are few and far between in the Obama \neconomy. Instead of promoting policies to create jobs, too often the \nPresident has proposed policies that kill jobs.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has reported that \nObamaCare will cause 2.5 million full-time workers to leave the \nworkforce. Mr. President, 2.6 million Americans earning less than \n$30,000 are in danger of having their hours and wages cut thanks to \nObamaCare's 30-hour workweek rule. Mr. President, 63 percent of those \nworkers are women.\n  The President and his party have also pushed hard for a minimum wage \nhike the Congressional Budget Office said would destroy up to 1 million \njobs. Low-income Americans would be hit the hardest by that.\n  Then there is the President's national energy tax. In addition to \nraising energy bills for all Americans, the President's energy tax \nwould result in the loss of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of \nthousands, of jobs. The rule would gut the coal industry, putting tens \nof thousands of workers out of work there.\n  It is difficult to reconcile the President's ostensible commitment to \nfamilies with a policy that would put thousands and thousands of \nparents out of a job.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline would allow the President to put thousands \nof Americans to work. With a stroke of his pen, the President could \nsign off on this project and the 42,000-plus jobs it would support. \nInstead, he has ignored American workers and union leaders and chosen \nto pander to the wishes of his extremist environmental base.\n  The American people need jobs--steady, good-paying, long-term jobs \nwith opportunities for advancement. Democrats and the President are not \ngiving that to them. Instead of spending time on real job-creation \nmeasures, the majority leader has chosen to waste the Senate's time on \ngimmicky, politically motivated legislation.\n  If Democrats were serious about providing real relief to American \nfamilies, they would be working with Republicans on the many bills we \nhave proposed to spur job creation and to support American workers--\nbills such as Senator Collins' Forty Hours Is Full-Time Act, which \nwould repeal the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule, which is resulting in \nlower wages and fewer hours for American workers; or Senator Fischer's \nworkplace advancement amendment, which would further equip women with \nthe tools and knowledge they need to fight discrimination in the \nworkplace; and Senator Rubio's RAISE Act, which would amend the \nNational Labor Relations Act to allow employers to give merit-based pay \nincreases to individual employees, even if those increases are not part \nof a collective bargaining agreement; and Senator McConnell's Working \nParents Home Office Act, which would fix a flaw in the Tax Code that \nprevents men and women from claiming a home office deduction if their \nhome office has a baby crib so they can care for their child while they \nare working.\n  President Obama has talked about the importance of flextime for \nparents so they can adjust their work hours for parent-teacher \nconferences or soccer games. Well, Senator Lee has a bill that would \nhelp workers handle the constant challenge of work-life balance by \nallowing private-sector employers to offer all individuals who work \novertime a choice between monetary compensation and comp time. \nUnfortunately, like so many other Republican bills, the Lee Working \nFamilies Flexibility Act is buried in the majority leader's Senate \ngraveyard.\n  Traditionally thought of as a place where bills go to be debated, the \nSenate has, instead, become the place where bills go to die. But it is \nnot just bills that go to die here; it is the solutions to improve the \nlives of millions of Americans. In addition to the many Senate \nRepublican jobs bills that the majority leader has prevented from \nseeing the light of day, there are dozens--literally dozens--of House-\npassed jobs bills--several of them bipartisan--that the majority leader \nrefuses to bring up. The Senate historically has\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\nbeen a place where the voices of all Senators--Republican and Democrat, \nmajority and minority--have been heard. But lately, the Senate seems to \nhave become nothing so much as an arm of the Democrats' campaign \ncommittee. Democrats have brought up bills designed to win votes, not \nsolve problems.\n\n  The Democratic leadership has worked hard to protect its vulnerable \nMembers from ever having to take challenging votes. They do not want \nDemocrats in tough campaigns to have to choose between the American \npeople and the Democratic Party's far-left political base.\n  One of Congress's most basic duties is to consider appropriations, \nyet over the past 2 weeks the majority leader has pulled not one but \ntwo appropriations bills from committee consideration because he did \nnot want his Members to have to take votes on ObamaCare or on the \nPresident's national energy tax.\n  That is wrong. We are here to take tough votes. If you do not want to \nhave to take hard votes, do not run for the Senate. There is a lot of \nstuff that--amendments get offered by our colleagues on the other side \nthat I do not like to vote on either, but that is what we are here for. \nWe are here to debate. We are here to take votes. We are here to offer \namendments, to put legislation on the floor.\n  All of us have different ideas. I may not agree with some of the \nthings that are offered up by my colleagues on the other side, but the \nfact of the matter is, they have a right, on behalf of the constituents \nthey represent, to bring the issues to the floor that are important to \ntheir constituents, and for us to debate them, and for us to vote on \nthem.\n  In fact, the majority leader has exerted such tight control over the \nSenate that over the past year he has not only blocked almost all \nRepublican amendments, he has blocked almost all of his party's \namendments as well.\n  Since July of 2013--almost a year ago--the majority leader has \nallowed votes on just 9 Republican amendments, and just 7 Democratic \namendments--out of 1,500 amendments that have been filed on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Think about that. The world's greatest deliberative body--open to \namendment, open to debate--1,500 amendments get filed; Republicans get \n9 votes. I understand the whole idea, the political motivation of the \nleader in trying to protect his Members from having to take tough \nvotes. But how are you as a majority Member--how do the Democrats in \nthe Senate go back to their constituents at home and say: It is \nadvantageous for us to be in the majority in Washington, when you have \nonly had votes on seven amendments? Think about that. How do you, with \na straight face, go back to your constituents and say: Being in the \nmajority matters in the Senate, when Democrats here are only getting--\nin the last year--seven amendments voted on? It is outrageous. One a \nmonth--about one amendment a month--is what we are voting on here, \nroughly.\n  Senators were elected to speak for the people of their State and to \nmake sure their concerns are represented in the Senate. When Senators \ncannot add their voices to the process, the American people's concerns \nare not getting heard.\n  The American people have had a tough time getting their voices heard \nover the past few years. Over and over, they have made it clear they \nneed good jobs and more economic opportunity. Instead, they have gotten \n5\\1/2\\ years of higher costs and low job creation, and the jobs that \nare being created are not the kinds of jobs that were lost--the good-\npaying jobs that provide opportunities for advancement.\n  Republicans have proposed numerous bills to expand opportunities for \nAmerican families and workers. It is time for the Senate to vote on \nthese bills. The American people have spent enough time being ignored. \nIt is high time for the Senate to change the way it is conducting its \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3907-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3907-S3910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MINE BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday in Maputo, Mozambique, \nrepresentatives of many of the 161 countries that have joined the \ntreaty banning the production, stockpiling, export, and use of \nantipersonnel landmines convened the third review conference in the 15 \nyears since the treaty came into force.\n  The impact of that treaty, once ridiculed as a naive dream by many in \nthe U.S. defense establishment, has been extraordinary. The vast \nmajority of landmine use and production has stopped. New casualties \nhave dropped significantly. Many countries have cleared the mined areas \nin their territories.\n  Of the 35 countries that have not yet joined the treaty, including \nthe United States, almost all abide by its provisions. We can be proud \nthat the United States has been the largest contributor to programs to \nclear mines and to help mine victims. Those programs have saved \ncountless lives. In fact, the Leahy War Victims Fund was first used in \nMozambique.\n  But I remember during the negotiations on the treaty how officials in \nthe U.S. administration at the time urged, even warned, their \ncounterparts in other countries, including our NATO allies, against \nsigning the treaty. In the end, every member of NATO except the United \nStates joined it.\n  Some in our government said it was a meaningless gesture that would \naccomplish nothing. I think they resented that other governments, \nespecially Canada, and nongovernmental organizations from around the \nworld could achieve something outside the U.N. negotiation process, \nwhich had utterly failed to address this problem.\n  Instead, the treaty has already accomplished more than most people \nexpected, thanks to the extraordinary advocacy of the International \nCampaign to Ban Landmines and three-quarters of the world's \ngovernments, many of whose people have suffered from the scourge of \nlandmines.\n  But the problem is far from solved. There are still thousands of \ndeaths and injuries from mines each year, and most are innocent \ncivilians.\n  Twenty years ago this week, in a speech at the United Nations that \ninspired people around the world, President Clinton called for a global \nban on antipersonnel mines. I was proud of President Clinton for doing \nthat, but his Presidency, his administration, was outmaneuvered by the \nPentagon, and it failed to join the treaty. Then, during the 8 years of \nthe last Bush administration, nothing happened. In fact, during those \nyears, the White House reneged on some of the pledges of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  When President Obama was elected, I thought we would finally see the \nUnited States get on the right side of this issue. After all, we fought \ntwo long wars without using antipersonnel mines. All our NATO allies \nand most of our coalition partners have banned them.\n  But that has not happened.\n  Now we rightly condemned, and I do condemn, the Taliban for using \nvictim-activated IEDs, which are also banned by the treaty, but we \nstill insist on retaining our right to use antipersonnel mines.\n  Eighteen years ago, President Clinton charged the Pentagon to develop \nalternatives to antipersonnel mines. Instead, the Pentagon has fought \nevery attempt to get rid of these indiscriminate weapons, even if they \ndo not use them.\n  As I have said many times, no one argues that antipersonnel mines \nhave no military utility. Every weapon does. Poison gas has a military \nutility, but we outlawed it a century ago. Are we incapable of \nrenouncing, as our closest allies have, tiny explosives that are the \nantithesis of precision-guided weapons, weapons we have rightly not \nused during two long wars, weapons that kill children and innocent \ncivilians, and weapons that should bring condemnation to anybody using \nthem?\n  We talk about the importance of avoiding civilian casualties. We all \nbelieve in that. We have seen how civilian casualties can turn a local \npopulation against us. We do not export antipersonnel landmines. We do \nnot use them. We can drive a robot on Mars by remote control, but we \nsay we cannot solve this problem. It begs credulity.\n  This is not an abstract issue. This girl is who I am talking about. I \nhave met countless people like her. She is lucky. She survived, even \nthough without hands and legs. Many others like her bleed to death.\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n  I have been to clinics in poor countries where, instead of soccer \nballs, they make artificial limbs like these. We support them with the \nLeahy War Victims Fund. I am glad we can help, but I wish there was \nabsolutely no need for that.\n  I visited a young girl in a hospital after the Bosnia war. Her \nparents had sent her away so she could be safe. The war ended. The \nsoldiers returned home. She was running down the road calling out to \nher parents, and she stepped on a mine. Both her legs were blown off. \nThe war was over, but not for her.\n  We recently sent people to that part of the world after flooding. \nWhy? Because thousands of landmines still in the ground had washed up \nand moved around. Schoolchildren now face the danger again, because \neven though they had mapped where the landmines were that was before \nthe floods.\n  As in the past, the White House hides behind their failure to act by \npointing at North Korea. Who is not concerned about North Korea? But \nare we so dependent on antipersonnel landmines that we cannot develop \nwar plans to defend South Korea without them? I reject that just as \nformer commanders of our forces in South Korea rejected it long ago.\n  Last week, after a cursory 2-minute debate that inaccurately \ndescribed the landmines in the Korean DMZ as U.S. mines, which they are \nnot, and that inaccurately asserted, based on erroneous press reports, \nthat the White House is about to join the mine ban treaty, which it is \nnot, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee adopted by voice \nvote a prohibition on the use of funds to implement the treaty.\n  The amendment's sponsor even claimed that the one thing--the only \nthing--stopping a North Korean invasion is U.S. antipersonnel mines. \nBalderdash. Did the Pentagon tell them that? Of course not. I wonder \nhow many, if any, Members of that subcommittee have even read the \ntreaty.\n  One would think, 61 years after the Korean war, that the Pentagon \nwould not still be arguing that the defense of South Korea depends on \ntiny, indiscriminate explosives that would pose a threat to U.S. forces \nif we counterattacked. It makes you wonder.\n  This country, with the most powerful army, that spends far more money \non its armed forces than any country in the world, has to rely on \nantipersonnel landmines? Oh, come on.\n  President Obama can still put the United States on a path to join the \ntreaty, but time is running out. It will require some revision of our \nKorea war plans. That can be done in a manner that protects the \nsecurity of South Korea and our troops. It needs to be done, because \nwithout the participation and support of the United States, the most \npowerful Nation on Earth, no international treaty can achieve its \npotential.\n\n  I commend the participants at the Maputo review conference. I regret \nthe United States is there only as an observer, as it has been since \nthe Ottawa process began 18 years ago. We sit on the sidelines as \nthough we have no role in this. What a missed opportunity, what a stain \non the country that should be the moral leader.\n  The next review conference is in 2019, the 25th anniversary of \nPresident Clinton's speech. What an anniversary it would be if that \nnext review conference were held in Washington, with the United States \nattending as a party to the treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a June 22 article in the Boston Globe \nand a June 23 article in the New York Times on this subject be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, June 22, 2014]\n\n          Formerly a Leader on Land Mine Ban, Obama Now Balks\n\n                           (By Bryan Bender)\n\n       Washington.--In 2005, then-Senator Barack Obama wrote to a \n     constituent that he would use his influence to help advance \n     an international treaty banning land mines, decrying what he \n     called the ``horrific injuries and loss of life'' among \n     civilians long after wars end.\n       But in his five-plus years as president, Obama has not \n     asked the US Senate to ratify the pact signed by 161 other \n     nations, showing an unwillingness to take on military \n     officials who assert that the devices, which the Pentagon \n     last used in battle in 1991, are still needed. Instead, his \n     administration has repeatedly delayed a review of the issue \n     initiated early in his first term.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who has spent \n     more than two decades directing federal funding to clear \n     minefields and provide victims with wheelchairs, prosthetics, \n     and job training, is so frustrated at Obama's lack of action \n     that he is complaining bitterly and publicly about it.\n       ``I think of children who have gone to something shiny on \n     the side of the road thinking it was a toy and instead having \n     their legs blown off,'' Leahy said in a blunt floor speech in \n     late March, the first in a series he has delivered to focus \n     attention on the issue. ``President Obama, you know what you \n     should do.''\n       Indeed, what is most vexing to many treaty supporters is \n     that the United States has done more than other countries to \n     address the problem, but still hasn't taken up the treaty.\n       In addition to spending more than $2 billion over the last \n     two decades to reduce the threat and aid victims, the United \n     States has halted the production and export of so-called \n     ``persistent'' or ``dumb'' mines that have no disarming \n     mechanism and can remain a danger for unsuspecting villagers \n     for decades.\n       ``The United States has actually probably lived up to about \n     90 percent of the requirements of the treaty,'' said Lloyd \n     Axworthy, the former foreign minister of Canada who hosted \n     the treaty negotiations, expressing incredulity that the \n     United States has nonetheless long resisted giving up the \n     weapons.\n       Although it was among the first to call for a treaty \n     banning land mines, the United States is now the only member \n     of the NATO military alliance that has not joined the pact. \n     The only other nation in the Western Hemisphere to refuse is \n     Cuba. When treaty signatories meet on June 23 in Mozambique \n     to discuss ways to accelerate the destruction of mines as \n     well as strengthen the pact, the United States will attend \n     only as an observer.\n       ``It was US leadership that really got the ball rolling,'' \n     said Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of \n     America Foundation, who was a key organizer of the original \n     movement to ban the weapons. ``But the United States is \n     shamefully behind the curve.''\n\n\n                         The killing continues\n\n       In late May, a six-year-old girl was killed and five other \n     villagers wounded in Myanmar when they came upon a land mine \n     near the border with Thailand.\n       The same week the US State Department dispatched a ``quick \n     reaction force'' to Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina where \n     flooding had dislodged land mines left over from the civil \n     war in the former Yugoslavia.\n       Advocates for the ban believe America's continued \n     reluctance to embrace the treaty is slowing momentum to \n     render politically unacceptable a weapon that kills or \n     injures an estimated 10 people every day in the 60-some \n     countries where they remain in the ground. For example, US \n     allies Ukraine and Finland have recently signaled they might \n     withdraw from the treaty out of military necessity.\n       Three dozen countries still remain outside the treaty, \n     according to a recent report by the Arms Control Association, \n     a nonprofit advocacy group, including the United States, \n     China, Russia, India, and Pakistan. Together they \n     collectively account for an estimated stockpile of 160 \n     million landmines, while experts say there is no reliable way \n     to estimate how many landmines are still littering global \n     battlefields.\n\n\n                       At first, some high hopes\n\n       The ``Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \n     Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines \n     and on Their Destruction'' was proposed in 1997, requiring \n     member nations to no longer use land mines, destroy all \n     remaining supplies, and remove those planted on their \n     territory.\n       The so-called Ottawa Treaty was heralded as the first \n     global arms treaty to emerge from civil society, as opposed \n     to governments. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, \n     a coalition of 1,400 nongovernmental organizations from \n     around the world--led by American Jody Williams--was awarded \n     the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for spearheading the effort, which \n     also benefited from high-profile advocates like the late \n     Princess Diana.\n       The treaty's unique evolution is viewed as a possible \n     reason why the American military brass is still resisting; \n     the thinking goes that commanders fear that giving up land \n     mines could encourage similar efforts by human rights groups \n     to seek to ban other types of controversial weapons, such as \n     drones.\n       The United States initially was a leading advocate of the \n     pact; then-US President Bill Clinton called the land mine \n     problem ``a global tragedy.''\n       ``In all probability, land mines kill more children than \n     soldiers, and they keep killing after wars are over,'' \n     Clinton said.\n       But he opted not to sign the treaty and seek its \n     ratification after US military leaders insisted that they \n     needed time to develop alternatives to mines.\n       The Bush administration also adhered to that position, \n     while the US Army began developing so-called ``smart'' mines \n     as a replacement, devices officials say are now ready to be \n     part of the arsenal.\n       One alternative, called the Spider, is designed to detonate \n     only by command and to self-defuse after a limited period. It \n     is designed and built in part by Textron Systems\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n     in Wilmington, Mass. Textron officials did not respond to a \n     request for comment.\n       When Obama came into office in 2009 there were high hopes \n     that he would seek to join the treaty; he instead ordered up \n     a review that has gone on for five years.\n       Asked about the assessment, Edward Price, a spokesman for \n     the White House's National Security Council, said, ``We are \n     pressing forward to conclude our review of US land mine \n     policy'' but declined to provide details.\n       ``The United States shares the humanitarian concerns of the \n     parties to the Ottawa Convention,'' Price added, noting that \n     ``the United States is the single largest financial supporter \n     of global humanitarian demining efforts.''\n       A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lieutenant Commander Amy \n     Derrickfrost, defended the military's position. She said that \n     in addition to ending the use of so-called ``dumb'' mines in \n     2010, the US military also no longer uses plastic mines, \n     which cannot be identified with a metal detector or other \n     mine surveillance technologies.\n       But the military continues to say that it must have the \n     ability to use anti-personnel land mines.\n       ``I consider them to be an important tool in the arsenal of \n     the armed forces of the United States,'' General Martin \n     Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a \n     congressional hearing in March, especially on the Korean \n     penninsula, where they are intended to help blunt an invasion \n     by the North Korean army.\n       The Pentagon position has its share of supporters on \n     Capitol Hill, including Representative Randy Forbes, a \n     Virginia Republican, who calls land mines ``vitally important \n     to the defense of South Korea.'' Fearing that Obama will sign \n     the treaty, he has proposed an amendment to a new defense \n     bill that would prohibit the administration from implementing \n     the treaty.\n       Many observers, however, remain surprised at the extent of \n     opposition at the Pentagon to the treaty.\n       ``Some of the guys that wrote the [Korean] war plans were \n     advocates of the mine ban,'' said retired Army Lietenant \n     General G. Robert Gard, who traveled to South Korea in the \n     late 1990s at Leahy's request to make an assessment.\n       Gard, who is chairman of the Center for Arms Control and \n     Nonproliferation, a nonprofit think tank, said commanders \n     asserted ``we could accomplish the things that land mines \n     were purported to do for us by other means.''\n       A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam Wars, Gard believes \n     that the continued Pentagon resistance is driven by fear that \n     giving in could embolden human rights groups to try to ban \n     other weapons.\n       He described the argument: ``If you give in to those flaky \n     nongovernmental organizations they will try to to make us get \n     rid of other weapons we really need.''\n       Meanwhile, the ongoing land mine policy review--the third \n     such assessment since the Clinton years--has treaty advocates \n     such as Williams, the peace prize recipient, deeply \n     frustrated.\n       She said in an e-mail that she ``does not understand why \n     this review has taken place at all and even less do we \n     understand or accept why it has taken five years already and \n     President Obama still seems unable to bring it to a \n     conclusion that can be shared with the American public.''\n\n\n                         `Life forever ruined'\n\n       The gruesome photographs, blown up to nearly life size for \n     maximum effect, line a small, cluttered office of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee. One depicts a pair of legless men \n     looking up from their wheel chairs, another a woman hobbling \n     along with the help of a stick.\n       The images were all captured by Leahy, an amateur \n     photographer who has personally chronicled dozens of innocent \n     war victims from Central America to Southeast Asia.\n       His crusade against land mines began more than two decades \n     ago in a jungle village in Nicaragua, at the height of its \n     civil war.\n       ``There was a little boy, probably 12 years old, one leg, \n     homemade crutch. He'd lost his leg from a landmine,'' Leahy \n     recalled in an interview in his Senate office, where some of \n     his war victim photos hang at eye level above his desk.\n       Leahy asked the boy if he was injured by the forces loyal \n     to the Sandinista government or the so-called Contra rebels. \n     ``Well, he had no idea. He just knew that his life was \n     forever ruined.''\n       Leahy later used his perch on the panel overseeing the \n     State Department budget to establish a US fund to help the \n     most vulnerable victims of war, which was later named the \n     Leahy Victims Fund. He also provided money for mine clearance \n     groups around the world.\n       Leahy later proposed legislation prohibiting the United \n     States from exporting land mines. To help convince a \n     skeptical Senate, he persuaded DC Comics to publish a Batman \n     comic edition in which the caped crusader, in his effort to \n     rescue a child, had to walk through a minefield.\n       The last panel depicted the child reaching for a shiny \n     object and being warned by Batman not to pick it up before \n     there was a ``Kaboom.''\n       Leahy provided a copy of the special issue to every \n     senator; his legislation passed by voice vote without \n     opposition. He now remains optimistic that if Obama would \n     sign the land mine treaty and send it to the Senate for \n     ratification it has a good chance of garnering the required \n     two-thirds, or 67 votes, to pass--despite the overall \n     partisan rancor.\n       ``I don't want to sound like I am on a crusade but nothing \n     has gripped me as much since I have been here,'' Leahy said, \n     tearing up when recalling how he lifted a Vietnamese landmine \n     victim into his wheelchair. (``He grabbed my shirt, he pulled \n     me down, and he kissed me''.)\n       ``This is today's poison gas,'' Leahy said. Failing to join \n     the treaty, he believes, ``is a moral failure of our \n     country.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2014]\n\n         Treaty Is Making Land Mines Weapon of Past, Group Says\n\n                          (By Rick Gladstone)\n\n       Despite the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the \n     armed uprising in Ukraine and turmoil in other hot spots in \n     the Middle East and Africa, one of war's most insidious \n     weapons--antipersonnel land mines--have been largely outlawed \n     and drastically reduced, a monitoring group said in a report \n     released Monday.\n       In the 15 years since a global treaty prohibiting these \n     weapons took effect, the use and production of the mines has \n     nearly stopped, new casualties have plummeted, and more than \n     two dozen countries once contaminated by land mines buried \n     since old wars have removed them, said the report by the \n     group, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.\n       ``The Mine Ban Treaty remains an ongoing success in \n     stigmatizing the use of land mines and mitigating the \n     suffering they cause,'' said Jeff Abramson, the project \n     manager of Landmine Monitor, the group's research unit.\n       The group, which won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its \n     work, released the report to coincide with the Third Review \n     Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, which convened Monday in \n     Maputo, Mozambique, where representatives from its 161 \n     signers and other participants will spend five days \n     discussing how to further strengthen enforcement of the \n     agreement.\n       Antipersonnel mines are hidden explosive devices that are \n     buried in the ground and designed to be detonated when a \n     person steps on or near them, causing indiscriminate death \n     and grievous injury. They can lie dormant for decades, long \n     after a conflict has ended. Many of their victims are \n     children.\n       The United States, which was among the original countries \n     to call for a treaty banning mines and has done much to help \n     other countries purge them, has not signed the treaty. It is \n     among the 36 countries that have not signed it and is the \n     only NATO member outside the treaty. (Russia and China also \n     have not signed.)\n       An American delegation is attending the Maputo conference \n     only as observers.\n       Human rights advocates criticize the United States for what \n     they call a conspicuous lapse that may be dissuading other \n     countries from joining the treaty.\n       The Obama administration, which says it has been evaluating \n     the treaty's provisions since 2009, has issued conflicting \n     signals about its intentions.\n       ``It's going to be embarrassing for the U.S. to have to \n     explain to the high-level officials at the summit meeting why \n     it has been reviewing its land mine policies for five years \n     without making a decision,'' said Stephen Goose, the \n     executive director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch \n     and the chairman of the United States Campaign to Ban \n     Landmines, a coalition of groups that has been pressing the \n     United States to join.\n       American defense officials have resisted a blanket \n     renunciation of land mines. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional hearing in \n     March that he considered such weapons ``an important tool'' \n     in the American arsenal, citing as an example their use in \n     South Korea to deter an invasion from North Korea.\n       Others, however, have expressed frustration over what they \n     regard as an inexcusable American refusal to join the treaty. \n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and a prominent \n     supporter of the treaty, has pressed the administration in \n     speeches this year to endorse it.\n       ``If land mines were littering this country--in \n     schoolyards, along roads, in cornfields, in our national \n     parks--and hundreds of American children were being \n     crippled'' like children in Cambodia, Mr. Leahy said in an \n     April 9 statement, ``how long would it take before the White \n     House sent the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate for \n     ratification.''\n       Despite its apparent reluctance to join the treaty, the \n     United States has spent more than $2 billion in the past two \n     decades to help clear mines and aid victims, more than any \n     other country.\n       The United States also has stopped production and export of \n     so-called dumb mines that cannot be disarmed, and it no \n     longer uses plastic materials that can foil metal detectors \n     used to decontaminate mine-infested areas.\n       The report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines \n     said that only five countries--Israel, Libya, Myanmar, Russia \n     and Syria, all nonsigners of the treaty--had used \n     antipersonnel land mines since 2009.\n       But it also reported that Yemen, which has signed the \n     treaty, disclosed last November that it violated its pledge \n     against land mine use in 2011.\n       The report said global stockpiles of mines had dropped \n     sharply, with 87 signers of the\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\n     treaty having completed their promised destruction of a total \n     of about 47 million mines, since the treaty took effect. \n     Twenty-seven nations contaminated with mines have proclaimed \n     themselves mine-free during that period.\n       Casualties from leftover mines have also declined by more \n     than half since the treaty took effect, the report said. Yet \n     in the roughly 60 countries where contamination from land \n     mines and other explosive remnants of war remains a problem, \n     an estimated 4,000 people a year are killed or wounded.\n       The report said nearly half the victims were children. In \n     Afghanistan, it said, children constitute 61 percent of all \n     such casualties since 1999.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I inform the Senate that the three judges \nfrom Florida we are about to vote on have the support of Senator Rubio \nand I. It is as a result of a bipartisan process. It is actually a \nnonpartisan process as to how we select our judges in Florida. Senator \nRubio and I appoint a judicial nominating commission in the three \njudicial districts in Florida. They then, when there is a vacancy of a \njudge or U.S. attorney or U.S. marshal, receive the applications, do \nthe interviews, and make--for one vacancy--three recommendations. \nSenator Rubio and I then take these three recommendations, the two of \nus together interview the applicants. The arrangement we have with the \nWhite House--and of course we know the President could select whomever \nhe wants, but the White House has graciously agreed, and this has been \na longstanding practice with the Federal judge selections from Florida, \nthe White House has agreed they will pick from among the three we send.\n  Senator Rubio and I send comments to the White House about the three, \neven though what we primarily do is tell the White House if we have an \nobjection to any one of the three who come through the judicial \nnominating commission process.\n  Therefore, what we do is we take politics out of the selection of \njudges.\n  I highly recommend to the Senate Paul Byron and Carlos Eduardo \nMendoza, both of the Middle District, and Beth Bloom of the Southern \nDistrict.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3910-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh).\n  Morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3910-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3910-S3911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF PAUL G.

Madam President, there are two things I wish to address \nhere briefly on the floor of the Senate. The first, strangely enough, \nhas to do with an editorial that appeared in the New York Times this \nweekend.\n  I remember one of the people who was influential to me when I was \ncoming up through the political system in Bexar County, TX, and in \nAustin, and now working here in Washington and back home in Texas. One \nof my mentors said: Don't ever get into a fight with somebody who buys \nink by the barrel.\n  That seemed like pretty sage advice, but maybe it is a little dated \nthese days because so much of what we see in the news is not in written \nnewsprint itself.\n  The point is, the editorial in the New York Times this weekend I am \nreferring to was talking about criminal justice reform, a topic that in \nrecent months has produced some genuine bipartisan legislation. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of one of those reform bills, along with my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse.\n  Our bill would allow low-risk Federal prisoners to earn credit toward \ncompleting a portion of their sentence outside of prison walls--for \nexample, through home confinement, through halfway houses or community \nsupervision.\n  Strangely enough, the Times editorial praises our bill as an example \n``of significant progress toward a legislative solution.''\n  Unfortunately, it then proceeds to blame Senate Republicans, \nincluding me, for stalling progress on the bill and preventing a vote \non the sentencing bill introduced by the distinguished majority whip, \nDick Durbin of Illinois.\n  The strange thing about it is, as every Senator and everybody within \nthe sound of my voice knows, it is Majority Leader Reid who determines \nwhat legislation comes up on the Senate floor, and this editorial \ndidn't mention him at all. An amazing oversight. The last time I \nchecked, the majority leader was the only person in the Chamber with \nthe power to schedule a vote on any legislation he wants, and he can do \nso whenever he wants.\n  So for the record, I wish to correct the error in the New York Times \neditorial. I strongly support criminal justice reform, including \nsentencing reform. My concerns about the sentencing reform bill \ncosponsored by Senator Durbin and Senator Lee are that I believe the \ncriteria it uses are excessively broad in deciding whose prison terms \nto shorten. But I think those are the sorts of things that could be \nworked out through an open amendment process on the Senate floor. And--\nI am sure we all agree on this--we don't want to prematurely release \ndangerous, higher level drug traffickers. That is my concern, that the \nbill is overly broad and would include them. Those kinds of concerns \nshould not be taken lightly--and I am sure they are not--and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to address them.\n  To reiterate, my opinions about the sentencing bill have nothing to \ndo with the majority leader's prerogative to schedule a vote. He could \nschedule that vote anytime he wants. I would like to think the New York \nTimes editorial board is knowledgeable enough to know that, but \napparently they need a reminder.\n\n\n                           Immigration Policy\n\n  In the last week I have come to the floor a number of times to talk \nabout the humanitarian crisis in South Texas. This of course is caused \nin large part by 52,000 unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central \nAmerica, who have shown up on America's doorstep, on our border, saying \nthey want to live in the United States. It is estimated those numbers \ncould rise to as many as 60,000 to 90,000 this year alone and maybe \ndouble next year unless something is done.\n  I have to say I am somewhat encouraged because the Obama \nadministration is finally acknowledging--somewhat belatedly, but \nfinally they are acknowledging their policies may have contributed to \nthis crisis in the first place.\n  This past weekend Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh \nJohnson published what he called an open letter to the parents of \nchildren crossing our Southwest border. This letter ran as an op-ed in \nSpanish language media outlets, and it warned parents of the \nextraordinary dangers facing Central American migrants who travel \nthrough Mexico, including the danger of kidnapping, sexual assault, \ntorture, and murder.\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Johnson also made clear that the \nchildren who have been pouring into South Texas will not be eligible \nfor the Obama administration's so-called deferred action programs. This \nis what he said:\n\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\n\n       There is no path to deferred action or citizenship, or one \n     being contemplated by Congress, for a child who crosses our \n     border illegally today.\n\n  In other words, Secretary Johnson's op-ed implicitly acknowledged \nthat President Obama's policies have created a perception that children \nwho make it across the border will be allowed to stay. I must say it is \na very dangerous perception and one that simply has to be corrected, \nnot only for the sake of U.S. border security and for the rule of law \nbut for the sake of the very children who now constitute the \nhumanitarian crisis on our southwestern border.\n  In discussing this matter with a number of our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis, it has been observed that the drug cartels, which \nused to just traffic in drugs, now traffic in people. They have changed \ntheir business model. Essentially, they control the corridors by which \ndrugs, people, and weapons traverse Mexico and, in this instance, come \nfrom Central America.\n  The fact is there should be a lot of concern on our part that this \nflood of unaccompanied children will prove to be a distraction from the \ninterdiction of dangerous drugs coming across the same borders. In \nfact, in the Rio Grande sector of the Border Patrol, in the Rio Grande \nValley, as the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee knows, there has actually been a drop in the number of drug \ninterdictions coming across the southwestern border in part because the \nBorder Patrol and other law enforcement have been diverted to deal with \nthis humanitarian crisis.\n  I see the chairman on the floor, and it looks as though he has a \nquestion on his mind. I yield to him for a question if he has one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nthoughtful comments.\n  When I was Governor, and long before that, and certainly in the \nSenate, I have liked to focus on underlying causes, not just the \nsymptoms or problems but how do we solve the underlying challenge that \nis before us.\n  In this case we focus so much on the border and what we are doing on \nthe border. We have tens of thousands of men and women arrayed there, \ndrones, all kinds of technology to stop people from coming in. It is \nimportant for us to defend and secure our borders. The Senator from \nTexas has been a champion for that, and I would like to think I have as \nwell, also, having been to Guatemala and El Salvador in the last couple \nof months, and Mexico and Colombia, trying to understand what is the \nunderlying cause here.\n  As the Senator from Texas knows probably better than most of us, a \nbig part of the underlying cause is the lives the folks are being \nforced to live in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. As we squeeze \nthat bubble in northern Mexico to try to go after the narco drug lords, \nwe squeeze that bubble and they go somewhere else--they head south. \nThey have made life miserable in those countries for a lot of people.\n  So as we secure our borders and do all the work there, sending a \nstrong, clear message, as Secretary Johnson has said, to those parents \nof those in Guatemala and El Salvador, it is also important to figure \nout how we partner with Colombia and those folks in Mexico and \nGuatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, to improve the hellacious lives \nmany are living, with a lack of hope, lack of safety, lack of jobs, \nlack of opportunity, lack of education. We can do that. We can do that \nwhile at the same time securing our borders. We have to do both. And \nthe underlying cause is important.\n  I have no questions, but I want to thank the Senator for his thoughts \nthis evening, for yielding, and for giving me a chance to join him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee is exactly right to say we can't just look at the border in \ndealing with this crisis.\n  My friend Henry Cuellar from Laredo, TX, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, likened this to a football game. He said: You can't \nonly do goal line defense. We need to find ways of deterring people \nfrom leaving their homes in the first place and coming to the United \nStates.\n  I know Vice President Biden was in Guatemala this last week and \nSecretary Johnson was in the Rio Grande Valley, and I know they are \nlooking at all of this. There is no simple, single-shot answer to it. \nBut the fact is there are a lot of people who want to come to the \nUnited States, for obvious reasons.\n  But I look at it as even though we are a nation of immigrants, we are \na nation of legal immigration, one of the most generous in the world. I \nthink we naturalize roughly 800,000 people a year now because they want \nto become American citizens through the legal system.\n  But to have this mass of humanity come at such a great flood and in \nsuch a short period of time, particularly as unaccompanied minors, \nthreatens to capsize the boat. It creates a lot of hardship in local \ncommunities, States, and places around the country we wouldn't expect \nto be dealing with this, because they are going to have to be taken \ncare of. We are committed to making sure these children are taken care \nof, but we have to send a message very clearly that if you are a parent \ncontemplating this circumstance, you should not send your children, \nparticularly on the perilous and dangerous journey leading from Central \nAmerica.\n  I have mentioned in recent days a book written in 2013 called ``The \nBeast'' by a courageous Salvadoran writer named Oscar Martinez. Mr. \nMartinez, a journalist, traveled I think eight different times with the \nmigrants from Central America and wrote in this book about their \nexperiences and, unfortunately, the unspeakable brutalities these \nmigrants encounter on a daily basis--again, because they are traveling \nthrough a smuggling corridor controlled by the cartels, in this \ninstance the Zetas. The Zetas are a spinoff of the Sinaloa cartel. They \nused to traffic in drugs, but now they realize they can make money off \nthese migrants--and they do, in terrible sorts of ways. Of course they \nare lawless, and the brutalities they exact on these migrants are \nshocking.\n  For example, Mr. Martinez in his book ``The Beast'' tells a story of \none migrant woman who was raped on the dirt-and-straw floor of a \ncardboard shack before being strangled to death in a Mexican town along \nthe Guatemalan border. This woman's picture was subsequently published \nin a local newspaper on a half page, with two other pictures of \ntortured bodies. In the meantime, an epitaph was written on a small \ncross that read: The young mother and her twins died November 2008.\n  I realize this is shocking and really horrible, and we prefer not to \neven think about it. But I think we need to acknowledge--and certainly \nthe parents who send their young children unaccompanied on this long, \nperilous journey need to understand--what they are vulnerable to.\n  The dangers of the trans-Mexican migration journey have become far \nworse over the past decade as powerful drug cartels have effectively \ntaken over the human trafficking business. As Caitlin Dickson in the \nDaily Beast reported yesterday:\n\n       While the journey north was always treacherous and costly, \n     in the hands of the cartels it has become deadlier than ever. \n     The entire border, and the routes leading up to it, are \n     controlled by some combination of Los Zetas, Sinaloa, and \n     Knights of Templar cartels, along with a few smaller groups--\n     making it impossible to cross without their permission.\n\n  What they have to pay to exact their permission is a tax or a fee--\nbasically, protection money--to allow them to pass more or less safely \nthrough their territory. As I have said many times, there is nothing at \nall humane about encouraging mothers, daughters, fathers, and sons to \nput their lives in the hands of such vicious criminals. Yet when the \nPresident has talked as he has over the years about dealing humanely \nwith migrants, he acts as if the decision to demonstrate more and more \nleniency or deferred action when it comes to our enforcement or \nimmigration laws is itself a humanitarian act. Yet perversely what it \ndoes is it encourages this sort of illegal immigration and encourages \nmothers and fathers to subject their children to these tremendous \nbrutalities.\n\n  I can only hope the ongoing crisis we are seeing now along the \nsouthwestern border will dispel any illusions that\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\nsomehow by saying, well, we will not enforce our immigration laws as to \nthis class of individuals, we are going to pick and choose or we have \ndeported too many people, so we are going to quit deporting people--\nthese actions and inactions have consequences, and this is the sort of \nconsequence that sort of action produces. I hope it will dissuade the \nPresident from announcing yet another unilateral suspension of \nimmigration enforcement later this summer.\n  There are various stories written and rumors told that the President, \nif immigration reform doesn't pass this year in Congress, will take \naction unilaterally through an Executive order. He has encouraged that \nperception, saying, ``I have a pen and I have a phone,'' and he has \nissued a number of Executive orders in a number of different areas, but \nI hope the President doesn't compound the problem by further sending \nthe message that he is going to unilaterally suspend enforcement of our \nimmigration laws because the consequences will be big and they will \nfurther jeopardize the health, welfare, and well-being of the people he \nthinks he is trying to help.\n  I would ask the President: What is more important, is it political \nposturing--trying to show to an important constituency that you are \nsympathetic to their concerns--or are we going to focus primarily on \npeople's lives and their welfare?\n  Given all that has happened in this humanitarian crisis, how on Earth \ncould the President possibly justify another unilateral change in \nimmigration enforcement that will likely lead to another surge like we \nhave seen on the border.\n  It is pretty simple. Unless we send a clear message that our borders \nare being enforced and that our laws are being upheld, we will continue \nto face crisis after crisis after crisis. Meanwhile, untold numbers of \nmigrants will continue suffering and dying in Central America and \nMexico just trying to get here or get here--showing up on our \ndoorstep--and overwhelm our capacity to deal with them in a responsible \nway.\n  I yield the floor, and I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceed to do call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Colleagues, there is an unprecedented crisis unfolding \non our border. The crisis threatens the very integrity of our national \nborder, our laws, and our system of justice. It is something I have \nbeen talking about for a number of years, but it has reached unusual \nand dangerous proportions. It is a crisis of this administration's own \nmaking and a crisis the administration's policies continue to \nencourage.\n  America deserves leaders in the executive branch who will stand up \nand say clearly: The crisis must end now. The border is closed. Please \ndo not come unlawfully to America. If you do come unlawfully, you will \nbe deported. This is what we expect from our Chief Executive, the chief \nlaw enforcement officer in America and, for that matter, the head of \nHomeland Security, the office in charge of Border Patrol and ICE \nofficers.\n  But President Obama and Secretary Johnson at the Department of \nHomeland Security refused--just refused--to plainly make this \nstatement. How can they not? It is their duty. It is the law of the \nUnited States, and it is causing people around the world, particularly \nin Central America, to believe they can come unlawfully to America. It \nis encouraging this to happen. They are getting wrong messages from the \nleadership in our country.\n  So let's review the evidence.\n  On March 20, 2014, the University of Texas at El Paso did a study \nthat was funded and supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity Science and Technology Directorate, and it states that ``both \nBorder Patrol and ICE officers agreed that the lack of deterrence for \ncrossing the U.S./Mexican border has impacted the rate at which they \nhave apprehended UACs.''\n  UACs are unaccompanied alien children.\n\n       Officers assert that ``UACs are aware of the relative lack \n     of consequences they will receive when apprehended at the \n     U.S. border.''\n\n  Get this: Officers are certain the UACs are aware of this.\n\n       UTEP [University of Texas El Paso] was informed that \n     smugglers of family members of unaccompanied alien children \n     understand that once a UAC is apprehended for illegal entry \n     into the United States, the individual will be reunited with \n     a U.S.-based family member pending the disposition of the \n     immigration hearing.\n\n  There will be some sort of hearing set for them.\n\n       This process appears to be exploited by illegal alien \n     smugglers and family members in the United States who wish to \n     reunite with separated children. It was observed by the \n     researchers that the current policy is very similar to the \n     ``catch and release'' problem that the Department of Homeland \n     Security faced prior to the passage of the Intelligence \n     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n\n  If we catch somebody in the United States unlawfully, they will be \ngiven some minimal process and then released on bail and told to return \nback to court in so many weeks or months. In many cases, they do not \nshow up. They enter the country unlawfully against the laws of the \nUnited States. They are apprehended but released--and why would they \nshow up?\n  Recently Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley questioned 230 \nillegal immigrants about why they came. These are particularly related \nto children, and 95 percent said they believed they would be allowed to \nstay and take advantage of the ``new'' U.S. ``law'' that grants a free \npass or ``permiso'' being issued by the U.S. government to adults \ntraveling with minors and unaccompanied children.\n  So this is what they said 95 percent of the people who came illegally \nbelieve. This memo that leaked out of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity continued:\n\n       The information is apparently common knowledge in Central \n     America and is spread by word of mouth and international and \n     local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed \n     stated that their family members in the United States urged \n     them to travel immediately, because the United States \n     government was only issuing immigration `permisos' until \n     the end of June 2014.\n\n  On June 10, 2014, newspapers in Honduras and Guatemala quoted \nSecretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson as saying this--this is what \nhe is being quoted as saying in Central America: ``Almost all agree \nthat a child who crossed the border illegally with their parents or in \nsearch of a father or a better life, was not making an adult choice to \nbreak our laws, and should be treated differently than adult violators \nof the law.''\n  This conveys a message. Isn't it clear that people who are not \nstudents of the esoteric aspects of American law would hear the \nSecretary of Homeland Security basically saying if you are a young \nperson and you come you will be treated differently? Then they hear \nthey will be given a ``permiso'' and allowed to stay and be taken care \nof, that there is no risk or danger in coming to the United States \nunlawfully.\n  On June 13, the Washington Post published an article entitled \n``Influx of minors across Texas border driven by belief they will be \nallowed to stay in U.S.'' How hard is it to reverse that belief? We \nhave not done it.\n  On June 19, Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas said, ``As \nlong as they know they are going to be released and allowed to stay \nhere, they are going to keep coming.'' Isn't that true?\n  The New York Times quoted one teenager from Honduras whose mother had \nsent for him: ``If you make it, they take you to a shelter and take \ncare of you and let you have permission to stay.''\n  Records show the administration knew this surge we are seeing at the \nborder, which is unprecedented in our history, was coming, and they \nknew of it for some time and did nothing to stop it or to send the \nmessage: Don't do this. Do not come to America unlawfully. Make your \napplication if you feel you are justified in coming, and it will be \nprocessed in regular order. Indeed, the administration sought, rather \nthan to stop this dramatic surge, to accommodate it.\n  Even before the public became aware of the beginning of the surge of \nthis nature at our border, on January 29 of this year, the Federal \nGovernment--\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\nget this--posted an advertisement seeking bids from a contractor to \nhandle 65,000 ``unaccompanied alien children'' crossing the southern \nborder. This was in January.\n  In 2011 we had approximately 6,000 coming into the country \nunlawfully. So in January of this year they posted an advertisement to \nhandle 65,000. So this raises serious questions. Why would the \nadministration claim to be surprised by the current influx of \nunaccompanied minors when they were taking bids in January for a \ncontract to handle the exact situation--almost the exact number--we are \nseeing? This year it is expected to hit about 90,000 children; whereas, \nin 2011 it was 6,000. Projections from official sources say we may hit \n130,000 next year. How did the administration anticipate the very \nnumbers it seems we have at least to date?\n  In March of this year the Department of Health & Human Services \nestimated in its fiscal year 2014 budget proposal that the number of \nunaccompanied illegal alien children apprehended in 2014 this year \nwould rise to 60,000, which is up 814 percent from the 6,560 who were \napprehended in the United States only 3 years ago.\n  Over the weekend the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \npublished an ``open letter to the parents of children crossing our \nSouthwest border'' on a Spanish language wire service. I had demanded \nof him in the Senate Judiciary Committee that he send a clear message, \nand he actually refused to do so. I had to ask him about three or more \ntimes before he would finally say: It is unlawful to come here, and \nthat is the reason you shouldn't. He said: You shouldn't come because \nit is dangerous. He said: You shouldn't come. It is not a good idea. \nBut he was not simply saying: Do not come unlawfully.\n  In newspapers in Central and South America and on Univision's Web \nsite the letter noted, in part, that the Senate comprehensive \nimmigration bill ``provides for an earned path to citizenship, but only \nfor certain people who came into this country on or before December 31, \n2011.''\n  The Senate bill died in the House and will not become a law, and it \nwas wrong to have done that very thing. That is what the law said, but \nit wasn't passed. But the very fact that Mr. Johnson is advertising in \nforeign countries an earned path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \nundermines his primary responsibility, which is to enforce the law. The \nmost primary responsibility for Mr. Johnson is not to see how many \npeople he can apprehend and actually go through the cost and process of \ndeporting; the primary job is to deter criminal activity to begin with, \nto send a message and back it up that people cannot come successfully \nillegally. Don't come. Then you will see a large dropoff instead of \nthis 800-percent increase we see today.\n\n  Human beings are rational actors, and if they believe the United \nStates is granting citizenship to illegal aliens who arrived before \n2012, it stands to reason that the U.S. Government will move that date \nback if more illegal aliens arrive in the years to come. Why wouldn't \nthey think they would be given amnesty too? That is what happened in \n1986--amnesty was given. There were 3 million people who were given \nlegal status, and the message was heard.\n  Some say that today, we have over 11 million illegal aliens in the \ncountry.\n  Even a 2009 internal Department of Homeland Security report on \napproaches for implementing immigration reform recognizes this \nfundamental fact. This 2009 report said:\n\n       Virtually all immigration experts agree that it would be \n     counterproductive to offer an explicit or implied path to \n     permanent resident status (or citizenship) during any \n     legalization program. That would simply encourage the fraud \n     and illegal border crossings that other features of the \n     program seek to discourage. In fact, for that reason and from \n     that perspective, it would be best if the legislation did not \n     even address future permanent resident status or citizenship.\n\n  That is from an official government report.\n  Contrary to the administration's claims that illegal immigrants are \nacting on mere rumor and misinformation, it is the sad reality of lax \nenforcement plus the lack of a clear message that is driving the surge. \nThe reality is if you get into the country today, you are not going to \nbe deported. That is true.\n  A leaked May 30 internal memo written by the top border official, \nDeputy Chief Ronald Vitiello, said:\n\n       Currently only 3 percent of apprehensions from countries \n     other than Mexico are being repatriated to their countries of \n     citizenship, which are predominately located in Central \n     America.\n\n  I repeat, only 3 percent are being repatriated back home.\n  According to the former head of Enforcement and Removal Operations \nfor ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Gary Mead:\n\n       It's taking a year or more in some places for people to \n     come up on a hearing and many times, they don't have an \n     attorney, or they've lost an attorney, and they get an \n     extension, and maybe it's two years before they have a \n     hearing. And in the interim period, they enroll in school, or \n     they get a job, or they are reunited with family members, and \n     then they are no longer an enforcement priority.\n\n  That is significant. Even if after 2 or 3 years a judge finally \norders removal--assuming the individuals show up in court at all--many \nillegal immigrants simply ignore that order, and having been here for a \nperiod of years, no one makes them leave.\n  As former ICE Director John Sandweg said: ``If you are a run-of-the-\nmill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close \nto zero.''\n  Yesterday, Byron York published in the Washington Examiner the \nfindings of Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center \nfor Immigration Studies, which shows that the United States deported a \ntotal of 802 minors to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in 2011, \n677 in 2012, and down to 496 last year. Weighed against the tens of \nthousands pouring in, it is clear that once again the reality on the \nground--not merely rumor, talk, or policy--of the lax enforcement has \ninfluenced decisionmaking in Central America.\n  It is obvious to me. I have been a Federal prosecutor. You have to \nsend the message, and if the message is heard that if you violate a \ncertain law, you will be disciplined, the number of people who violate \nthe law will drop. If you never enforce speeding tickets, people will \nspeed. If you enforce them systematically, people will slow down.\n  York quotes ex-ICE official Gary Mead:\n\n       If you're getting 90,000 a year, or 50,000 a year, or even \n     25,000 a year, and you only remove 1,200, you're not \n     eliminating the backlog.\n\n  How obvious is that?\n  Additionally, those here illegally have taken advantage of an asylum \nsystem that is easily open to abuse and that the administration has \nsought to widen rather than narrow. This asylum question is very \nserious. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte recently stated:\n\n       Many of the children, teenagers, and adults, arriving at \n     the border are able to game our asylum and immigration laws \n     because the Obama administration has severely weakened them \n     and many thousands have already been released into the \n     interior of the United States. What does President Obama plan \n     to do with those who have already been released from custody?\n\n  That is a good question. We have a situation now where illegal \nimmigrants seek out and turn themselves in to the Border Patrol \nofficer. They come across the border and go straight to them and turn \nthemselves in. That is a fact. What happens then? They are taken \nfarther into the United States to be reunited with family members, \napply for a job, attend school, have children in U.S. hospitals, and \nstay in the United States--whether through skipping court hearings, \nreceiving asylum, or simply ignoring orders to leave.\n  We can all expect that 5 or 10 years from now--and correct me if I am \nwrong--politicians in this body will probably say these illegal \nimmigrants ``came here through no fault of their own'' and are entitled \nto citizenship. Is this a policy of a great nation? It is a policy of a \nnation that believes and advocates for open borders, but it is not a \npolicy that is compatible with a system of law, duty, and order.\n  If people apply and wait in line, why should other people be able to \ncome from the outside, break in line, move ahead of them unlawfully, \nand then ultimately receive the very thing they sought unlawfully? The \nchaos continues.\n  Indeed, the President actively continues to incentivize even more \nillegal immigrants. That is the effect of what\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nhe has accomplished here. He reauthorized his DACA program--based on a \nbill that did not pass the Senate or the House--for 2 years, which is a \npolicy that exempts whole classes of certain individuals, particularly \nyoung people, from the immigration laws of the United States. He held a \nWhite House ceremony in the White House honoring 10 DACA recipients. \nDACA recipients are people who enter the country illegally. He also \nunilaterally authorized an additional 100,000 guest workers, and now \nthe Justice Department is hiring lawyers to represent unaccompanied \nalien children in immigration court to maximize the number of those who \nwill receive permission to stay in the country.\n\n  Claims that DACA--this policy of nonenforcement unilaterally carried \nout by the President of the United States not to enforce the law--does \nnot apply to these new arrivals is simply a distraction. DACA is a \nunilateral action that established the precedent that those who come to \nAmerica at a certain age will receive special exemptions from the law. \nThat is what it says.\n  ICE officers report they are often forced to release even high-risk \nindividuals of unknown ages and dates of entry who simply assert DREAM \nAct privileges.\n  In the internal Border Patrol memo, Deputy Border Patrol Chief \nVitiello stressed the only way to stop the flow is to show potential \nillegal immigrants that there will be real consequences for their \naction. He said:\n\n       If the U.S. government fails to deliver adequate \n     consequences to deter aliens from attempting to illegally \n     enter the U.S. the result will be an even greater increase in \n     the rate of recidivism and first-time illicit entries.\n\n  Our immigration system is unraveling before our very eyes. It is \nunbelievable. The American people have been denied the protections they \nare entitled to under our immigration system. Washington is failing the \ncitizens of this country in a most dramatic and open way. Laws are \npassed by elected representatives of the people. We have passed laws \nthat say you can't come to America without permission, and you need to \nfile your papers and follow the rules. It is unlawful to just walk \nacross the border because you want to come to this country. That is not \nlawful in this country.\n  I am calling on all the leaders and officials in this town to take \nthe firm, bold, and decisive steps that are necessary to restore order \nand restore our borders. It is important for the children who are at \nrisk. Many of them are having a difficult time. They have run out of \nmoney and the coyotes and smugglers have taken their money and \nmistreated them. We have heard a lot of horrible stories.\n  What is the best way to fix this problem? The best way to fix it is \nto have the President of the United States and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security say we are not going to accept you coming unlawfully. \nPlease do not come. Don't do it. Make your application like everybody \nelse. Wait your turn like everybody else. We are not against \nimmigration or young people, but it is unacceptable to have a lawless \nsystem--as we have today--that is placing children at risk and \noverwhelming our enforcement officers.\n  One TV program today said the Border Patrol officers, instead of \ndoing their duty, are changing diapers. We have gone from 6,000 to \nmaybe 90,000 to 100,000-plus next year. The cost of the budget item \nlast year for these kinds of things was about $800 million. I think \nthey are now saying they need $2.28 billion a year just to handle this \noverflow. We don't have money to do that. It is not the right thing. It \nis dangerous for children, it is corrosive of the law.\n  The President must send a clear message: Do not come. Please follow \nthe law, and if you come anyway, contrary to the law, you will be \napprehended, you will be deported, and you will be required to return \nhome.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I would like to discuss the \nnomination of Leon Rodriguez to be the Director of the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Service. Mr. Rodriguez was appointed on December 19 and \napproved by the Judiciary Committee on April 3rd by a vote of 11-7.\n  I want to explain my opposition.\n  First and foremost, Mr. Rodriguez lacks adequate immigration \nexperience to lead this agency. I only say that because his nomination \ncomes on the heels of potentially sweeping immigration reform \nlegislation. When we read his responses to my questions, it becomes \nclear that he has little appreciation for what this job as director \nentails. He basically says that he has a lot of studying to do. I \nthink, with the situation of immigration in this country--the need for \nimmigration reform--that we need to do better than have a director of \nthe agency who says he has a lot of studying to do.\n  Second, his previous experience with Casa de Maryland is a concern as \nwell. He was a member of the board of directors there from 2005 to \n2007. The mission of Casa de Maryland is to help improve quality of \nlife and fight for equal treatment for low-income Latinos. There is \nsurely nothing wrong with that. That is a very noble cause. But if we \npeel back their mission statement, we will see that the activities they \nare involved in are a lot greater than just improving the quality of \nlife for low-income people. They aid people here illegally in finding \nemployment and gaining legal status in this country. They provide legal \nservices to do so, and they fund day labor centers that focus on \nensuring undocumented workers can find work on a daily basis. And, of \ncourse, that entails the use of taxpayers' money to accomplish that \ngoal.\n  Their efforts are in direct conflict with the mission of the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service. That agency has to ensure the \nintegrity of immigration programs and benefits. Casa de Maryland \nbelieves that anyone, even those who are here in contravention of our \nlaw, should be eligible for benefits. The organization has pushed for \ndriver's licenses for people here unlawfully. They have worked to \nundermine REAL ID, a Federal law that needs to be fully implemented by \nthe States. They have organized rallies that promote legal status for \npeople who have broken the law. They have trained undocumented workers \nto understand their rights and published a cartoon pamphlet advising \npeople not to speak to law enforcement when approached. They go so far \nas to encourage them not to even provide their names.\n  Mr. Rodriguez claimed that he had no knowledge of this pamphlet put \nout by Casa de Maryland. Yet, he was on the board at the time the \npamphlet was published and disseminated.\n  Mr. Rodriguez doesn't disavow their work or their contempt for law \nenforcement. In fact, he stated in one response that he was \n``supportive of the use of local tax measures to support the day labor \ncenters'' that Casa de Maryland established.\n  So it is concerning that he could bring this same philosophy to an \nagency whose mission is to oversee legal immigration in the United \nStates. And we all know that we are a welcoming Nation of immigrants \nbecause about a million people come here every year legally, and they \nare welcomed, and our laws allow that.\n  Now, a third reason to oppose him is my concern about Mr. Rodriguez's \ncommitment to responding to congressional oversight, and my colleagues \nknow how strongly I feel about Congress's doing its constitutional job \nof oversight; in other words, to be a check on the executive branch of \ngovernment, to make sure that the laws are faithfully executed. Despite \nassurances given during his hearing, Mr. Rodriguez repeatedly failed to \nprovide responsive answers to many of my questions. Mr. Rodriguez was \nnot responsive to the questions I posed even in writing. While he \nrepeatedly stated he would review the programs and policies if \nconfirmed, Mr. Rodriguez claims not to be privy--that is his word--to \ninternal functions or have knowledge of how the agency works. He \nrefused to provide his opinions on very critical matters facing the \nagency, and I will give my colleagues examples.\n  In his initial responses he stated the following response not once, \nnot twice,\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nbut 17 times: ``If confirmed, I will certainly commit to a careful \nstudy of this program to determine any additional appropriate steps \nforward, including any possible changes to address this matter.''\n  We are talking about a person who gives that response, and he is \ndirecting an agency of 18,000 people. He is not going to be ready to go \nto work on day one, and they need somebody who is ready to go to work \nyesterday.\n  The second time around asking questions, he responded a bit \ndifferently in each question, but always alluded to the fact that he \nwas ``not privy to the internal factors upon which USCIS and its \nleadership base its decisions.''\n  I wish to give my colleagues one example. I asked about whether drunk \ndrivers or sex offenders should be eligible for legal status and \nimmigration benefits. He responded in both instances saying, ``In most \ncases, individuals who have been found guilty of a serious crime should \nnot receive immigration benefits.''\n  Well, that is a big question mark. What does he mean by ``in most \ncases''? I would read that this way: So when should these individuals \nbe allowed to receive benefits and legal status? That is the question \nthat is unanswered by his response.\n  By not answering the questions about felons, drunk drivers, or even \ngang members, he is essentially toeing Casa de Maryland's line that no \none should be deported.\n  He could not offer an opinion of his own or elaborate when such \npeople should get benefits. He said he would be forthcoming with \nCongress, but his repetitive answers show, No. 1, he is avoiding the \nquestions, and No. 2, he has a lot of studying to do before he takes \nthis job.\n  A fourth reason: He wasn't forthcoming with his views on what we call \naround here DACA, the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program that \ngrants work authorizations and stays of deportation for anyone under \nthe age of 31.\n  One of the most pressing items on the agency's plate right now is \nwhether we are going to renew the President's DACA directive. In his \nhearing and twice afterwards in questions for the record, I asked Mr. \nRodriguez about his plans with DACA and whether he would expand the \nprogram. I couldn't get a straightforward answer from him. I asked if \nhe had any discussions about the program, and he stated that he was \nonly ``generally aware'' of the renewal process. He clearly knew the \nagency published a renewal form for public comment, yet he claimed to \nhave little knowledge or opinion on the matter.\n  What is more, I am told by employees within the agency that he has a \nperson at the table who is reporting to him directly on the agency's \ndecisions. I am told he has a conduit during discussions on the \ndeferred action program. It is not clear how much he is driving the \npolicies, but it concerns me that he claims no knowledge of this \nmatter.\n\n  Had Mr. Rodriguez been more forthcoming, we would also know what is \nin store for the President's directive. Will he simply renew it, or \nwill he expand it, as many believe is the plan? Congress should know \nthis man's views on those very important matters.\n  In connection to DACA, I asked about information sharing with USCIS \nand other Federal entities. My colleagues know I rely on whistleblowers \nfor a lot of information. Just recently, a whistleblower brought me a \ncase in which the FBI asked for information on a DACA applicant. The \nFBI agent, in an email, said this:\n\n       I am checking to see if there was any information available \n     regarding fugitive ``john smith''? We would love to get him \n     in custody. I was interested in knowing where he submitted \n     his fingerprints and if he left a home address.\n\n  Now, that is the Federal Bureau of Investigation doing its work. Here \nis what the USCIS provided in response to the FBI:\n\n       We cannot confirm that a DACA request has been filed \n     without reason to believe that the requestor would represent \n     an enforcement priority. However, according to your email, \n     the agent can see what form was filed. As such, you could \n     also direct him to our website for additional publicly \n     available information regarding immigration forms.\n\n  The USCIS's response to the FBI was essentially this: Sorry. We can't \nhelp you. We must protect the confidentiality of the applicant. That is \nnot quoting anybody; that is the hypothetical answer I think our \nimmigration agency gave to the FBI.\n  But this isn't the only case we have like this. I have been informed \nabout the lack of information sharing by the USCIS since DACA began in \n2012. I asked Mr. Rodriguez about his commitment to provide law \nenforcement with information on people who apply for immigration \nbenefits. Now, I didn't ask about the statutory or regulatory hurdles \nin information sharing, but he refused to answer. I asked about his \ncommitment to making sure people who defraud the government--or who are \nlawfully denied benefits--are turned over to law enforcement for \nremoval. In one instance, he said it depended on the person's \ncircumstances.\n  The immigration agency is part of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Its core mission is, as we would expect, to protect the \nhomeland. Yet, this agency has a culture that I call ``getting to \nyes.'' In other words, cut a whole bunch of red tape and don't worry \nabout what the law says. Just get people approved to be in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. Rodriguez's nonresponsive answer on this matter of ``getting to \nyes'' concerns me, because it is not consistent with the mission of the \ndepartment. I wanted a firm commitment he would change that culture, \nand I couldn't get that from him.\n  Let me also address his connection to Mr. Perez, former head of the \nCivil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, now the Secretary \nof Labor. Mr. Perez, of course, was involved in the Department's \ndecision to decline the prosecution of the New Black Panther Party \nvoter intimidation case.\n  During his hearing, Mr. Rodriguez admitted he was aware of emails \nbetween political employees and career prosecutors discussing the \ndecision to decline to prosecute that case. At that time, Mr. Rodriguez \nwas serving as Mr. Perez's chief of staff and personally assisted in \npreparing Mr. Perez for his testimony before Congress. Yet, after Mr. \nPerez testified that the political appointees were not involved in the \ndecision when Mr. Rodriguez said that they were involved in that \ndecision, Mr. Rodriguez made no effort to correct the testimony after \nthe fact.\n  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service can be a very powerful \nagency. They grant benefits to foreign nationals and are implementing \nthe President's weak prosecutorial discretion initiatives. This agency \nwill have a lot of responsibility if an immigration reform bill is \npassed by Congress. We are talking about 12 to 30 million undocumented \npeople applying for benefits if this legislation is passed. They will \ncarry out an administrative amnesty if a bill is not passed.\n  Under President Obama, this agency has implemented very controversial \npolicies and practices. Many of the policies this agency has undertaken \nwere included in the July 2010 internal memo I obtained entitled \n``Administrative Alternatives to Comprehensive Immigration Reform.'' \nThat sounds a little bit like ``I have got a pen and a phone, and if \nCongress won't, I will.'' The purpose of the memo was to ``promote \nfamily unity, foster economic growth, achieve significant process \nimprovements and reduce the threat of removal for certain individuals \npresent in the United States without authorization.'' The memo \nhighlighted creative ways to achieve ``meaningful immigration reform \nabsent legislative action.''\n  Remember when the President said: I have got a pen and a phone, and \nif Congress won't, I will.\n  That is a perfect example of it.\n  While the administration suggested this memo was only an internal \ndeliberative document concocted by some bored bureaucrats, the \nDepartment has already undertaken many of these proposals. They will do \neven more under the new Director's leadership if the President decides \nto act unilaterally regarding immigration.\n  Remember the President who said: I have a pen and a phone, and if \nCongress won't, I will.\n  The agency's culture of ``getting to yes'' must change before any \nlegalization program is carried out. The Homeland Security inspector \ngeneral has reported on this culture. Their own internal watchdog, the \nIG, admonished the leadership for appearing to pressure line \nadjudicators to ``get to yes.'' Their report clearly shows that the \nimmigration service has a lot of work to do to\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nget rid of the ``get to yes'' culture that has pervaded this agency in \nrecent years.\n  The fact that one-quarter of the immigration service officers felt \npressured to approve questionable applications and 90 percent of the \nrespondents felt they did not have sufficient time to complete \ninterviews of those who seek benefits certainly warrants significant \nchanges be made immediately. It does not appear Mr. Rodriguez is \ninclined to do that.\n  This culture stems from the leadership suggesting that line \nadjudicators lean toward approval and focus on eligibility and less on \nfraud. Unfortunately, I did not get any sense from Mr. Rodriguez that \nhe was committed to changing the culture.\n  Mr. Rodriguez's appointment to this agency concerns me a great deal. \nI hope my colleagues, before voting this afternoon, will have that same \nconcern. I question his experience and his managerial judgment to lead \nan agency of 18,000 Federal employees. Unfortunately, I doubt his \nsincerity in working with Congress on oversight requests. I wish he had \nbeen more forthcoming.\n  For these reasons and others, I oppose the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, later this afternoon the Senate will vote \non Leon Rodriguez as head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. While I am unable to support this nomination, this is the \nprime time to raise some of the issues that are happening on the \nsouthwest border. I will summarize some of my remarks.\n  We have an incredible situation, as we all know, happening on the \nborder today. We have had thousands of kids cross the border. In fact, \nfrom October 1 to mid-May, there were 148,017 apprehensions. Of those, \na significant number--this is just the Rio Grande Valley in Texas--a \nsignificant number of those were unaccompanied minors. In fact, there \nwere so many that we did not have the capacity to deal with them there, \nand many, to the great chagrin of many in Arizona, were shipped to \nArizona to process and then released into the custody of a guardian or \nsomeone.\n  The Border Patrol and others are trying to make the best of a very \ntragic and unfortunate circumstance. I do not think anybody faults them \nfor the big burden they have. I think they are doing the best they can.\n  But what the situation really points out is that not only do we have \ninsufficient resources on the border itself to deal with those trying \nto cross, but once people get here, we have insufficient resources, \ninfrastructure, and policies to actually deal with them in a timely \nfashion. They are actually released--most of them--and asked to appear \nat a later date. It is estimated that quite a few do not. In fact, very \nfew will show up at their court date.\n  What are we to do here? Obviously those of us who have dealt with \nthis situation for a long time--those of us from border States--have \nadvocated broad legislation to deal with border security, a guest \nworker plan, mechanisms to deal with those who are here illegally now, \nemployer enforcement--many items. But if we cannot get to that yet--I \nwish we could, but if we cannot get to that yet, then we need to have \nbetter policies for dealing with those who have come across the border \nand whom we are going to hold. If we are going to grant them asylum--or \nsome of them--then that needs to be done. If not, we cannot just assume \nthat we are going to release them and assume they will come back for \ntheir court date or at their appointed time.\n  So this is a situation with which we have to deal. One thing we need \nto address immediately is to try to stem the tide of those who are \ncoming. Interviews suggest overwhelmingly--in fact, in one case there \nwere 250 crossers during a 1-week period or a 2-week period into Texas. \nI believe 95 percent of them indicated that the main motivation for \nthem coming across the border--this is largely unaccompanied minors--\nwas that they would be granted some kind of legal status that would \nallow them to stay. This is contrary to our law. This is contrary to \nthe President's deferred action program. To qualify for that program, \nyou would have had to have been here for 7 years. You cannot just \narrive today or yesterday or tomorrow and qualify for this program. Nor \nwas this contemplated by any legislation that has been passed by either \nbody. The legislation we passed in the Senate does not allow those who \ncome now to stay. You will have had to have been here since, I believe, \nDecember of 2011.\n\n  But what is happening is cartel members, human smugglers, and others \nare misinterpreting or willingly telling people they will receive some \nkind of legal status when they come. Too many people believe that, \nparticularly from the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and \nGuatemala.\n  Some suggest it is just economic conditions or violence in those \ncountries that is driving people northward. That, no doubt, has some \ntruth to it. There are some who come for those reasons. But we have \nseen a massive spike just in the last couple of months that cannot be \nexplained by economic conditions or violence in those countries. It is \nbecause they believe they will be afforded some legal status.\n  Senator McCain, I, and many others in this body have raised this with \nthe administration and have asked the administration to make it clear \nthat those who come now will not be allowed to stay.\n  I have a letter that has been--I think this is an advertisement or \nhas been translated into Spanish. It is being circulated in the \naffected countries from Secretary Jeh Johnson at the Department of \nHomeland Security. It is a good letter. It says the right things. I am \nglad we have taken that step. Vice President Joe Biden was in those \ncountries telling those in charge and others that those who come now \nwill not be allowed to stay; they will be deported. That is good. We \nneed to keep that up. But what we really need right now is for \nPresident Obama himself to make such a statement. In all deference to \nthe Vice President and the Secretary of Homeland Security, they simply \ndo not carry the weight of the President of the United States making a \nstatement and then following up that statement with a concerted effort \nin those countries to let people know they should not come north. That \nwould make a tremendous difference. I call upon the President to make \nsuch a statement and to follow up that statement with efforts in those \ncountries to make sure people understand this.\n  First and foremost, we need to stem the tide of those coming. It is \nestimated that this year there could be as many as 90,000 unaccompanied \nminors who come across the border. That figure may be higher next year. \nWe have to stem that tide and then quickly figure out how we can deal \nwith those who cross the border and whom we apprehend. We simply do not \nnow have the infrastructure or policies that allow us to deal with them \nin a rationale, humane way.\n  I would call upon the President to make such a statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Walsh pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 483 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Resolutions Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WALSH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes \nin a colloquy with a number of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I come to the floor today with the ranking member of \nthe Senate energy committee to discuss the issues of the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  I turn to my colleague from Alaska to invite her to share with the \nSenate some of her observations, considerations, and concerns as we \nseek approval of an opportunity to create more jobs in America and \nimprove our economy, as well as energy security for our country. I turn \nto the Senator from Alaska and ask her concerns, comments, and \nsolutions that she may have regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that my friend and colleague from Wyoming \nis helping to lead this discussion about the Keystone XL Pipeline and \nreally to encourage the Senate to move on it, to do something on this \nrather than just talk about it.\n  We are sitting here Tuesday afternoon. We had a series of votes on \njudges here this morning, and it looks like we are going to have some \nmore this week. But from the view of so many around this country who \nare worried about jobs, worried about the economy, worried about what \nis happening with the IRS, with the VA--and not to mention what has \nhappened on the world scene--it looks like we are going to have yet \nanother unproductive week in the Senate.\n  Since we are here and we have time, I can't think of a better time on \na better issue to take up than this Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The bill that we are asking to be brought up is Senate bill S. 2280. \nIt was introduced by our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven. \nHe introduced it on May 1.\n  It was placed on the legislative calendar a few days later. It has 55 \ncosponsors. When we talk about bipartisan issues and initiatives within \nthe Senate, 55 is a very good number. It includes 11 Democrats, \nincluding the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  We are well behind the House of Representatives, though, on this \ninitiative. They passed a Keystone bill over 1 year ago, but we have \nbeen working in the energy committee. We had a Keystone bill that was \nreported out of the energy committee just last week.\n  We passed an original bill on a bipartisan basis. It has not yet been \nfiled, but it is virtually identical to Senator Hoeven's bill, which we \nare discussing today.\n  But I did vote. I know my colleague from Wyoming and I know the \nPresiding Officer voted for Senator Landrieu's original bill. I did so \nbecause I think it is good policy to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nI committed at that hearing, and I certainly commit now, that I am \ngoing to do everything I can to help advance this initiative. If and \nwhen her bill is placed on the calendar, I intend to support that as \nwell.\n  But the problem that we have--and it should be no surprise to most--\nis no matter how many Keystone bills are added to the calendar, it \nappears that the majority leader is going to ignore them. It doesn't \nmatter how long Keystone has been under review, it doesn't matter how \nmany new jobs will be created, and it doesn't matter that the delays \nare political and not substantive.\n  The fact of the matter is we cannot get to that point where we can \ntake up this important initiative. The majority leader could have \noffered us a vote on Senator Hoeven's bill at any point over these past \n6 weeks, but he has chosen not to.\n  It seems very clear to me that he has no intention of moving to it, \nespecially if we just kind of sit back on this and don't push. It may \nbe that is the will of some in this body--that they don't want us to do \nanything, they don't want us to push forward. But I think that is \ncontrary to the will, to the wish of 56 Members of this Chamber, and it \nis contrary to our national interests.\n  It is interesting to note Democrats were not always opposed to \nimporting crude oil from Canada, as they would appear today. Back in \n1970 the Nixon administration announced that it would place a quota on \nCanadian oil imports, and it was none other than Senator Ted Kennedy \nwho led the fight against this decision.\n  Senator Kennedy said in a Senate hearing in March of 1970:\n\n       The reason why Canadian oil has never been restricted in \n     the past is obvious. Canadian oil is as militarily and \n     politically secure as our own and thus there can be no \n     national security justification for limiting its importation.\n\n  Those were pretty telling words back then, and I think they still \nhold true today. It wasn't only Ted Kennedy. There were other Democrats \nwho opposed the Nixon administration's restriction on trade with \nCanada: Senator Proxmire of Wisconsin and Senator McIntyre of New \nHampshire.\n  I think we have had such an opportunity on this floor to debate the \nmerits of the Keystone XL Pipeline and to debate not only how many \ngood-paying jobs it can bring to us but how it can help this Nation and \nCanada as we work to promote our North American energy independence.\n  Our energy partnership with Canada has taken decades to develop. It \nhas had some rocky times, but all good and worthy relationships take a \nlittle bit of work to maintain.\n  So if the Obama administration is unwilling to do the hard work of \ndiplomacy and make this remarkably easy decision--approving a job-\ncreating and a security-enhancing pipeline--then I think it is time for \nCongress to act. That is why a few of us have gathered here today to \nmove this issue forward, to do more than just talking about it, but to \nget the Senate to the point where we might actually have an opportunity \nto vote on it and do some good for this country.\n  So we are sitting here waiting. We have an opportunity to do it, and \nI think we should end the delay. I think we should move forward with \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree, Mr. President. Just think about what happened \nlast week. Extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a \nterrorist group, attacked the largest oil refinery in Iraq. This \nterrorist group was actually kicked out of Al Qaeda for being too \nextreme.\n  It is a striking reminder to all of us--all of us in this Chamber and \nall of us in this Nation--how important it is for the United States to \ntake swift action to increase energy production here in North America. \nEnergy security is key.\n  President Obama essentially conceded the point last week during a \npress conference when he announced he was sending troops back into \nIraq. He was asked what Iraq's civil war is in terms of national \nsecurity interests to the United States, and he gave a couple of \nreasons:\n\n       Obviously issues like energy and global energy markets \n     continue to be important.\n\n  Despite the urgency, the President refuses to take steps to reduce \nthe effect that Iraq's oil can have on American national security in \nthe future. The President admits energy is a national security interest \nbut he refuses to do anything about it that is meaningful.\n  What do the President and the administration think should happen? The \nPresident was asked a week or so ago, as a result of a huge spike in \noil prices per barrel of oil as a result of what was happening with \nISIS in the Middle East: What about all of this?\n  He said he was concerned, but he said: The gulf should pick up the \nslack and produce more oil. Not North America, not the United States. \nThe gulf. He was talking about the Persian Gulf should pick up the \nslack.\n  Vice President Biden put out a plan last week to support energy \nproduction--but not in the United States, in the Caribbean.\n  America shouldn't be asking for more energy from the Caribbean or the \nPersian Gulf. We should be producing more energy on our own, in our own \ngulf coast, offshore, on Federal lands, in Alaska.\n  That is why last week the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \npassed legislation approving construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nThe bill passed the committee. The ranking member said there was \nbipartisan support. Even Democrats voted for it. That bill would send \noil from Canada into States such as North Dakota. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota is here on the floor. It will send oil from Canada and \nNorth Dakota to refiners in Texas and Louisiana.\n  Last week Democrats in the committee voted for this bill and talked \nabout how important it is. The Keystone XL Pipeline application has \nbeen pending for more than 5 years. The State Department has done five \nenvironmental reviews of the project. All five have found the Keystone \nXL Pipeline will cause no significant environmental impact. We should \nnot delay this project any longer. Democrats should push their party \nleaders to vote on this bill.\n  I am disappointed--I know my colleagues are--that Senate Democrats up \nto this point have chosen to block this important bill. I think it is \noutrageous the way a small group of Democrats refuse even to consider \nhaving a debate on this vital measure--energy security for our country, \nenergy at home.\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\n  America needs the jobs. We need the energy. According to the U.S. \nState Department, this bill would support thousands and thousands of \njobs. Energy is a national security issue for the United States, and \nthis bill would help produce energy here in North America--not what the \nPresident said, where they will pick up the slack in the Persian Gulf.\n  The bill is on the calendar right now. The Democratic majority leader \ncan bring it up for a vote, and we are going to ask him to do so today. \nThe Chair of the Energy Committee should call on the majority leader \nand demand that he act on the bill.\n  We are here in the Senate and we get elected to the Senate to vote. \nThe Keystone XL Pipeline is important. This bill is important. \nDemocrats who want to vote against it can make their arguments and cast \ntheir vote.\n  So I turn to my friend and colleague, the Senator from North Dakota--\na Senator who has been an incredible leader, a former Governor of his \nState, a Senator who knows the issue well, who knows the value of \nAmerican energy--U.S. energy, North American energy--the impact on \njobs, the impact on the economy, the impact of energy as a geopolitical \nweapon in what is happening around the world.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from North Dakota if he thinks there is \nany reason whatsoever to delay action on this bill or if we should move \nahead.\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma has also joined us. So there are \nobviously significant and growing voices coming to the floor to say it \nis time to vote now, not additional delay, not additional studies, not \nadditional talk. It is time to vote.\n  I turn to my friend and colleague from North Dakota, the former \nGovernor of North Dakota--I think the longest serving Governor in the \nhistory of the State--for his impression of why it is time to vote \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the esteemed Senator from Wyoming \nnot only for being here today to talk about this important issue but \nfor his tremendous leadership on energy issues.\n  Wyoming produces an incredible amount of energy for this country, and \nthe Senator from Wyoming well knows that you not only have to produce \nthat energy, you have to get it to market, and you need pipelines to \nmove oil and gas to market. We move some by truck, some by train. But \nwe can't move everything by truck and by train. We have to have \npipelines, and that is what this is all about.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is the latest, greatest technology that is \nthe most efficient and the safest way to move this product to market. \nIt will actually result in less greenhouse gas than if we don't build \nthe pipeline, as was determined by the administration's own \nenvironmental impact statement produced by the Department of State.\n  I have some additional comments I wish to make on this important \nissue, but first I would turn to the esteemed Senator from Oklahoma and \nask that he provide some of his comments and insights from a State that \nproduces an incredible amount of energy, and where actually hydraulic \nfracturing started in this country and has been done safely since I \nthink the 1950s; somebody who understands not only that we have to \nproduce energy so we can get to energy independence, but that we have \nto have the infrastructure to move that product safely to market.\n  With that, I turn to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and ask \nhis thoughts on this important issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do appreciate that. I might elaborate a \nlittle bit.\n  Oklahoma is not just the place where they first started hydraulic \nfracturing, it was done in Oklahoma in 1948, and, according to Lisa \nJackson, who was the Obama-appointed EPA Director, never has there been \na confirmed case of groundwater contamination.\n  I know we are getting strapped for time here and I regret that. I \ndraw the Presiding Officer's attention to the chart I am holding up \nhere.\n  It happens that Cushing, OK, is considered to be the crossroads of \nthe pipelines throughout the United States. In Cushing, OK, we had I \nguess the only trip President Obama has ever made to Oklahoma. He came \nto Oklahoma. Looking in the background, there are all the tubes up \nthere to dramatically make a statement. And that statement:\n  I'm directing my administration to cut through the red tape, break \nthrough the bureaucratic hurdles, and make this project a priority, to \ngo ahead and get it done.\n  That is what the President said in Oklahoma. I wasn't there, but that \nis what he said. That is a direct quote. Then he did everything he \ncould do to destroy the Keystone Pipeline.\n  He made the statement down there: I'm not going to do anything to \ncreate a problem for the southern leg that goes from Cushing down into \nTexas. Well, there is a reason for that. The reason is, he couldn't do \nit. The reason he is stopping up there, because it crosses the country \nline from Canada into the United States. He has some jurisdiction \nthere. But there is nothing he could do to stop it. So he came down to \ntell us that he wasn't going to do that.\n  I have to say to the President: People in Oklahoma aren't that dumb. \nThey know you didn't have that authority or you would have stopped it.\n  The portion between Canada and Cushing is the part that remains \nstalled. At this point I think the reason is one guy named Tom Steyer. \nLet me introduce him.\n  First, we always hear a lot of things about the Koch brothers and \nother people who are putting money in or are concerned about it. This \nactually is a statement made by this very wealthy person. I am sure he \nis a nice person. Tom Steyer is a multibillionaire. He is very liberal. \nHe is from the State of California. He is a good friend of the junior \nSenator from California, and he has made the statement that he is going \nto put up $100 million to spend in campaigns of people who would do two \nthings: one, try to resurrect the issue of global warming--which is \ndead. I can remember when global warming would be polled as the No. 1 \nor No. 2 problem in the country. Right now, according to last week's \nGallup poll, it is No. 14 out of 15. So that is a dead issue.\n  But $100 million would do two things: first, to resurrect that issue; \nsecondly, to stop the Keystone Pipeline.\n  A few weeks ago he said explicitly--and these are his words, not \nmine:\n\n       It is true that we expect to be heavily involved in midterm \n     elections. We are looking at a bunch of races. My guess is \n     that we will end up being involved in eight or more races.\n\n  We just learned this week that as the President marks his 1-year \nanniversary of his climate action plan, Tom Steyer is going to meet \npersonally with him. So there is $100 million at work right there, if \nthat is what it takes for a meeting. And we all know what the cost \nwould be.\n  This is very important. One thing that has not been refuted, way back \nin the beginning of the whole global warming thing they talked about \nthe cost is going to be somewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion \na year. The Wharton Economics Foundation, MIT, Charles Rivers, everyone \nagreed with that.\n  The Keystone Pipeline, which Tom Steyer wants to stop, would create \n42,000 jobs, and tens of thousands more would be supported in the \nmanufacturing sector. But Keystone is just the tip of the iceberg.\n  If we look at this chart, No. 3, we can see all of the domestic \nenergy resources being developed around the country right now. We are \ngoing through a shale revolution in America, and the only thing that is \ngetting in the way is the Federal Government.\n  This is interesting: In the last 6 years, oil production on private \nand State lands is up 61 percent. On Federal land, however, oil \nproduction is down 6 percent. Now how could that be?\n  This map shows throughout the United States--not all in the western \npart. Look at New York and Pennsylvania. This is where the development \nis coming from, all of it on State and private land, an increase in 5 \nyears, 5\\1/2\\ years, of 61 percent. At the same time, on Federal land \nit is down by 6 percent.\n  The IFC International, a well-respected consulting firm, released a \nreport last month which said U.S. companies would need to invest $641 \nbillion of infrastructure over the next 20 years to keep up with the \ngrowing oil and gas production.\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\n  What does it mean for jobs? According to the analysis, the spending \non these new pipelines alone will create 432,000 direct jobs. And that \nis based on a conservative estimate. That does not assume we develop \nall of the resources in our country. If that were included, it would be \na lot more.\n  So keeping this from happening would be a great impact for imposing \nanti-energy, global warming policies. We need to build the Keystone \nPipeline and provide regulatory certainty for the entire energy \ninfrastructure sector. Without it, we will never reach energy \nindependence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the colloquy has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 33 minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side. But the question of the colloquy time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent I be given 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What time do we have the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 4:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the reason we were very careful with the time. \nAnd we gave my good friends--and they are my good friends--a lot of \nextra time.\n  I will allow the Senator to proceed for 1 minute. But after that, we \nneed equal time on this. So I give 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator asked for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I could ask my friend if we could compromise: 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me think it over. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate my good friend from California thinking it \nover.\n  Anyway, 432,000 direct jobs. And when we stop and think about it, \nkeeping it from happening would have the impact and effect of stopping \nus from becoming oil independent. We could do that.\n  The Keystone Pipeline needs to be built. We all know about the jobs. \nMore importantly, there is not a single good reason why it shouldn't \nhappen.\n  Tom Steyer's goal is to stop the oil in Canada from being developed, \nbut he can't do it. We have seen this just in the last week. The \nCanadians have conversations going with China to have them accept it if \nwe don't complete our Keystone Pipeline.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2280\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \nCalendar No. 371, S. 2280, to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline; that \nthere will be up to 4 hours of debate and that the Senate then proceed \nto vote on passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I wish to explain how I \ncome to my conclusion at the end by saying a couple of things.\n  I see that my dear friend--and these are all my friends whom I \nparticularly enjoy working with--I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he \nsaid Tom Steyer is from California. This is correct. So is Justice \nKennedy, and so is Richard Nixon, who signed the Clean Air Act. Richard \nNixon signed the Clean Air Act, and I was a cosponsor of that act. And \nRepublican Herbert Walker Bush signed the Clear Air Act Amendments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield to that point, because I was a \ncosponsor of that act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield.\n  The fact is that Republican objections to controlling carbon \npollution took that all the way to the Supreme Court.\n  Another thing on which I need to correct the record is my friend \nSenator Barrasso talked about our President as if our President doesn't \ncare about our being energy self-sufficient. The United States is \nproducing more oil at home than it is buying from the rest of the world \nfor the first time in nearly two decades. Let me repeat that. The \nUnited States is producing more oil at home than it is buying from the \nrest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. And \nPolitiFact marked that as true and accurate.\n  I want to say to my friend who has left the floor, Senator \nMurkowski--another good friend of mine--we offered a vote on Keystone \nas part of Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman's bill on energy \nefficiency, and we said we would treat it the way Mitch McConnell \nrecommends treating controversial amendments. We offered a 60-vote \nthreshold. Now they come to the floor decrying the fact that we didn't \noffer a vote, but we did.\n  Here is the point: Whenever America considers building a major \ninfrastructure project, we make sure there is a process in place, and \nwe have done that since 1968. It is a well-established process, and \nthat process was updated by George W. Bush in 2004. So this unanimous \nconsent request that would approve the pipeline would bypass the entire \nprocess we have set up in this country for these kinds of major \ninfrastructure projects that has been in place since 1968.\n  We need to know whether the building of this pipeline is in the \nnational interest, and it is critical that the process not be \ncircumvented because there are major issues on behalf of America's \nfamilies. Frankly, the request that is before us would cut short the \nprocess that protects our families. So rhetorically I ask, why would \nanyone want to do that? They talk about a lot of jobs. That is in great \ndispute. The permanent jobs are like 35. So let's be clear. It is about \nother things. It is about special interests. That is what it is about. \nThere is a lot of money that follows this pipeline.\n  Now I want to talk about the human health impacts. Tar sands is one \nof the filthiest kinds of oil on the planet--filthy dirty oil. That is \nwhy Senator Whitehouse and I called on the State Department to conduct \na comprehensive health impact study--because the pipeline itself is one \nthing; it is the type of oil that is going through the pipeline, this \ndirty, filthy tar sands oil.\n  If you don't believe me, ask our health professionals. A Gallup Poll \nfound 12 years in a row that the most trusted profession is America's \nnurses. National Nurses United--the Nation's largest professional \nassociation of registered nurses, with 185,000 nurses--also called for \na health impact study of Keystone because we know if this pipeline is \nbuilt, immediately we will see a 45-percent increase in the tar sands \ncoming in. Eventually we will see a 300-percent increase in the \nfilthiest, dirtiest of oils coming into our country. We also know this \noil has higher levels of dangerous oil pollutants and carcinogens \nbecause we documented that in our own country where they burn tar sands \noil.\n  Mr. INHOFE. A parliamentary inquiry, I ask of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Our point is, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is reserving the right to object. I would ask her does she \nobject.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I complete my remarks before I make a \ndecision on the pending request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. A further parliamentary inquiry: Is the time unlimited to \nfinish remarks before objecting or not objecting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reservation for the right to object occurs \nat the suffering of other Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I didn't understand what the Chair said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no right to reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Then I would ask unanimous consent that I \ncomplete my remarks--the other side had many minutes--and then object.\n  And I would also ask the Chair, do we not have time on our side at \nthis point in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does, but there is a unanimous \nconsent request pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. Well, just to allay my friend's concern and his \nexcitement about whether or not I will object, I will absolutely \nobject. I do object because we know that misery----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Misery follows the tar stands from extraction, to \ntransportation, to refining, to waste storage.\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nWe are going to show you some pictures, folks, in case you don't know \nwhat it looks like when you refine this oil. We are going to show you \nphotos from Port Arthur, TX.\n  This is what it looks like. There is a playground where this filthy, \ndirty stuff is burned. This is not a good place to be. We had people at \na press conference with the nurses from Port Arthur, TX, and they \nbrought us these pictures and said this is what it is like when they \nburn the tar sands.\n  Now let's talk about the types of cancers that are linked to these \ntoxic chemicals, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n  Why would anyone want to short-circuit a process? Just because the \noil companies want it? We have to think about our people. Tar sands oil \nfrom the Keystone Pipeline will flow to our gulf refineries, increasing \nthis toxic air pollution that already plagues communities such as Port \nArthur, TX. I ask you to meet with some of those kids, meet with some \nof their parents, meet with some of those health professionals, and \nthey will tell you the asthma rates that are happening, the respiratory \nillnesses, the skin irritations, the cancer. All they talk about is the \npipeline. What about what flows through it? What about the toxins that \nget burned into our air?\n\n  We know a pipeline does burst. We know a pipeline does burst. We have \nseen many of those incidents, and we know one did burst with tar sands \noil in Kalamazoo, MI. They still haven't cleaned up the river--3 years, \nthey still haven't cleaned it up. And we know that the pipeline goes \nthrough communities and environmentally sensitive areas in six States.\n  Why would my friends want to bypass a process that is going to look \nat the potential damage to the health of our citizens, to the safety of \nour drinking water, and the effect on kids and asthma and cancer?\n  And let's not forget the tar sands waste, by the way. Here is a \npicture of that, in case my friends don't know what it looks like. This \nis called petcoke, petroleum coke. Already, because we have increased \ntar sands importation, it is lining up around our cities--in Chicago, \nin Detroit--massive open piles of tar sands, waste products known as \npetcoke, billowing black clouds containing heavy metals. There was a \nstory that was told to our committee. Children playing baseball have \nbeen forced off the field to seek cover from the clouds of black dust \nthat pelt homes and cars.\n  So you have problems when you extract, you have problems when you \ntransport, you have problems when you refine, and you have problems \nwhen you store the waste. Why do my colleagues want to bypass a process \nthat has been put in place since 1968 so we can look at the impact on \nour people? Petcoke dust is particulate matter. It is among the most \nharmful of all air pollutants. When inhaled, these particles can \nincrease the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate \nbronchitis and other lung diseases, and reduce the body's ability to \nfight infections.\n  Do you know the Federal Government has said that asthma is a national \nepidemic? I am quoting. It affects 1 of every 12 people or 26 million \nAmericans. I know if I asked people in this Chamber--which I cannot do \nbecause it is against the rules of the Senate--to raise their hands if \nthey have asthma or they know someone who has asthma, I guarantee half \nof the people in the room would raise their hands.\n  We don't need more asthma. We have a very important system in place \nto look at the effects of tar sands oil, and I don't think we should be \npushing this project forward. Exposing Americans to pollutants linked \nto cancer and respiratory illness is not in the national interest.\n  Lastly I want to talk about the climate change impacts. For those \npeople who are listening to the news, they must be surprised to see how \nmany former Republican Environmental Protection Agency officials have \ncome out and said to their colleagues who are here now: Wake up. \nClimate change is here, it is real, and human activity is adding to it.\n  The planet is in trouble. Tar sands oil has at least 17 percent more \ncarbon pollution than domestic oil. The State Department concluded even \nin their flawed study that the annual carbon pollution from just the \ndaily operation of the pipeline, should it be built, will be the \nequivalent of adding 300,000 new cars on our roads.\n  So why do we want to short-circuit a process which has been in place \nsince 1968 and which was then renewed by George W. Bush in 2004 to \nprotect our people from just this kind of a project?\n  If you walk up to an average American and say ``Should we build the \nKeystone Pipeline?'' they will say ``Pipeline? A pipeline is a \npipeline.'' But when you explain the kind of oil you are putting \nthrough the pipeline, that is a different situation because this is the \nfilthiest, dirtiest oil--more carbon intensive. The oil is linked to \nall kinds of illness.\n  I stood next to people from Canada, doctors who were so glad I was \nraising these issues. Even the newspapers in Alberta have called for a \nmuch better study on health impact.\n  So outside of this Chamber more and more Republicans are coming out \nin support of doing something serious about climate change.\n  My friend showed a picture of Tom Steyer. Let me thank him from the \nbottom of my heart. This is someone who is a very successful \nbusinessperson who realized he has to step up to the plate and preserve \nthe planet for his kids and his grandkids. Thank you, Tom Steyer.\n  Just last week four former Republican EPA Administrators who served \nunder Presidents Nixon, Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and George \nW. Bush spoke out on the need to address climate change.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse, my subcommittee chair on the committee, \nwho called these four incredible--it was an iconic moment, frankly. \nLet's see if I remember them all. There was Ruckelshaus, who started \noff with Nixon. There was Christie Todd Whitman, who worked for George \nW. Bush. There was William Reilly, who worked for George Herbert Walker \nBush. Then there was Mr. Thomas, who worked for Ronald Reagan--Ronald \nReagan. There they sat, and there they spoke, and there they said very \nclearly: Wake up, Republicans. This is a serious matter.\n  Now today a bipartisan group of former Treasury Secretaries released \na report showing that the U.S. economy is already feeling the negative \nfinancial impacts of climate change. These respected leaders say \nclimate change is real and we must act.\n  So why would we want to short-circuit a critical review process when \napproval of the Keystone Pipeline would be a major step in the wrong \ndirection? It is the equivalent of 300,000 cars added back on our roads \nafter we struggled so hard to clean up carbon pollution.\n\n  Another concern that remains to be addressed is the Keystone \nPipeline's impact on national security. I met with a former SEAL Team 6 \nleader, and he was involved in the assessment of the Keystone tar sands \npipeline and the risk of that pipeline becoming a high-profile target \nvulnerable to attack. They concluded it absolutely was a high-profile \ntarget, and it would be vulnerable to an attack that could trigger a \ncatastrophic tar sand spill.\n  As I said, the last tar sand spill 3 years ago in Michigan has still \nnot been cleaned up. This stuff is filthy, dirty oil--the dirtiest. Why \non Earth would we want to see an eventual 300-percent increase in the \nimportation? The nurses don't want it and the public health doctors \ndon't want it. They came to the press conference with us. We cannot \nafford to take a shortcut in the Keystone tar sands pipeline review \nproject when so much is at stake--the health of our communities and the \nimpact on climate change.\n  Finally, I have a picture that I show a lot these days, and it is a \npicture of what it looks like when you throw the environment under the \nbus. This is a picture of a province in China where the people walk out \nwith masks over their faces because everybody says: Who cares? We can \njust do anything we want. Who cares?\n  I recently went to China. Over the course of 2 weeks, I never saw the \nSun. I did not see the Sun. On one day when we had a little bit of Sun \npeeking through--I mean barely at all--the people there got so excited. \nThe people who work in our embassy there get hazardous duty pay because \nit is so dangerous for their families. They can't go out and breathe \nthe air because they can get sick.\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\n  We can have economic growth and a clean environment. You know why? We \ndid it in the 1970s when everybody objected to the Clean Air Act. You \nshould have seen the folks come to the Senate floor. You should have \nheard the Chamber of Commerce railing against the Clean Air Act. You \nknow what happened since then? Tens of millions of jobs have been \ncreated. The air is clean. Thousands and millions of lives over time \nhave been saved. Heart attacks, asthma attacks, and cancer have \nreduced. We can quantify it.\n  When colleagues come here and try to do something to bypass a \nprocedure to protect human health and the environment, you can count on \nme standing right here. I am proud to do it.\n  I can report that California--under the great leadership of our \nGovernor Jerry Brown--is moving to clean energy. We are moving to \nthousands and millions of new jobs. We have added more jobs over the \nlast couple of reporting periods than any other State. We are balancing \nour budget. We have a surplus because we are moving to energy \nefficiency, and that means people are going to work.\n  I understand that my friend from New Hampshire is interested in \nmaking a few remarks, so at this time I wish to say to my Republican \nfriends that it is with great respect and friendship, truly, that we \nsee the world differently, and that is OK. That is what makes this the \ngreatest country on Earth. We can come here and speak out.\n  I wish to say to the American people today that this rush to build \nthe pipeline before the process is completed is dangerous to the health \nof people and to the health of the planet and to the importance of our \nnational security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from \nCalifornia giving me an opportunity to respond.\n  As those of us on the floor probably remember, several weeks ago we \nwere talking about trying to address the Energy Efficiency and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act, also known as Shaheen-Portman, an \neffort that Senator Portman and I had worked on for 3\\1/2\\ years to try \nand put in place a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy for this \ncountry. The bill has no mandates in it and no new spending. It has the \nsupport of over 260 groups--everybody from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nto the National Association of Manufacturers to the NRDC to several \ntrade unions, companies from Johnson Controls to Honeywell, the \nAmerican Chemistry Council. It has the support of a broad coalition of \npeople.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, if \nthe legislation of Senator Portman and myself were to pass this year, \nby 2030 it would help create 192,000 jobs, save consumers $16.2 billion \na year, and it would be the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off \nthe road.\n  As part of that discussion, we actually had what we thought was an \nagreement to have a vote on Shaheen-Portman on a date certain that \nwould have a 60-vote threshold and also have another vote on the \nKeystone Pipeline on a date certain. All the Senators would know when \nthe vote would take place, and again it would have a 60-vote threshold. \nSadly, some of the sponsors of that legislation who worked with us to \ntry and get a bill put forward refused to vote to consider the bill, \nand it went down. It is unfortunate because we could have had a vote on \nthe Keystone Pipeline at that time. It was an agreement I thought we \nhad all agreed made sense.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2262\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate resume consideration of S. 2262, the \nShaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill; that the motion to commit be \nwithdrawn; that amendment Nos. 3023 and 3025 be withdrawn; that the \npending substitute amendment be agreed to; that there be no other \namendments, points of order, or motions in order to the bill other than \nbudget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that there \nbe up to 4 hours of debate on the bill equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; that the \nbill be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that if the bill is \npassed, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 371, S. \n2280, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Republican leader, but no later than Thursday, \nJuly 17, 2014; that there be no amendments, points of order, or motions \nin order to the bill other than budget points of order and the \napplicable motions to waive; that there be up to 4 hours of debate on \nthe bill equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill; finally, that the bill be subject to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do reserve the right to object. I have \nlistened carefully to my very good friend from California, and it \naffects my decision as to whether to object.\n\n  The reason the American people are no longer interested in all the \nhype and all the world coming to an end on global warming is for four \nreasons. No. 1, according to the IPCC--let's keep in mind, the IPCC, \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the science that is \nbehind this opinion. They even admit today that there has been no \nwarming in the last 14 years. This is not just a report from the IPCC \nbut Nature magazine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator state the inquiry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding is the Senator is using the time of the \nSenators on this side of the aisle to make a speech before he objects. \nAm I correct? Is it our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that the Senator object, and then Senator Shaheen \nhave the rest of the time because we are running out of time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to reserve \nthe right to object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I recall that a few minutes ago, the distinguished \nSenator from California reserved the right to object and gave her \nreasons. Is that incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was under Democratic control at that \ntime.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Very well. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I wish to say I am disappointed we can't move forward \nto address the concern on both voting on the Keystone Pipeline as well \nas the concern Senator Portman and I have to consider the Shaheen-\nPortman energy efficiency bill.\n  Shaheen-Portman is legislation that would go very far to address our \nenergy needs. After all, energy efficiency is the first fuel. It is the \ncheapest, fastest way to deal with this country's energy needs. It has \nsupport from those people who believe in fossil fuels and from those \npeople who support alternatives, such as wind and solar. It is \nsomething everybody benefits from, and it is something that would move \nus in a direction that would help address the pollution we are seeing--\nnot just from carbon but from so many other pollutants that are being \nthrown into the air. It is a reasonable way to address both our \nconcerns as well as the concerns of those people who support the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  Let's have this vote--up or down--with a 60-vote threshold. I believe \nwe have strong bipartisan support for Shaheen-Portman. We saw that in \nthe motion to proceed when it got more than 70 votes here on the floor. \nWe had strong bipartisan cosponsors on the legislation. I think we \ncould have those votes now, everybody would be happy, and let the votes \nfall where they may.\n  I am disappointed to hear the objection. I hope we will have an \nopportunity to reconsider, and I hope we can all agree that there is a \nbenefit to both sides of the aisle in voting on both of these issues in \na way that gives the American people some idea of where we stand.\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Happily.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I am obviously not as schooled in the procedures of the \nSenate, but I want to better understand what happened here. Obviously \nthe Senator moved to bring forward a bill she and Senator Portman \nworked tirelessly on, which is critical to jobs in America and to \nenergy efficiency, while also agreeing to allow a number of amendments, \nwhich included an amendment this Senator would have loved a vote on, \nthe Keystone Pipeline. Obviously I don't believe the Senator and I \nshare the same opinion, but I think it is important to have a \ndiscussion about it.\n  With all of the discussion about how we are not moving legislation \nforward in the Senate, I am curious as to why someone would object to \nthat consideration and moving that bill forward. It seems as though it \nis a reasonable and appropriate consequence.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I know my colleague from California wishes to answer, \nbut I will say that I share the Senator's disappointment. I think this \nwas a great opportunity for us to address both energy efficiency in the \nShaheen-Portman legislation and to also get a vote on the Keystone \nPipeline, which is something we discussed several weeks ago when the \nenergy efficiency legislation came to the floor. I thought we had an \nagreement where we would vote on the bill and then separately vote on \nKeystone, and they would both have a 60-vote threshold. Sadly, some of \nthose sponsors of the legislation didn't vote for it when the bill was \nfilibustered, and so it did not pass. I am hopeful we can still bring \nit back. I am happy to bring it back in a way that allows us to have \nthe same 60-vote threshold for a vote on the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to say through the Chair, I spoke for quite a \nwhile on why I feel it is not good governance to come to the floor and \nask unanimous consent to move to a bill and to short circuit a process \nthat is in place and has been in place since 1968. The process was \nrenewed by President George W. Bush to make sure when we build an \nAmerican infrastructure project that it is safe, that it is in our \nnational security interests, that public health is considered, and all \nthe rest.\n  I have said all along on an amendment of controversy--I am ready to \nvote on the Keystone Pipeline, and I support Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman's bill. What a great bill. What a win-win. Senator \nShaheen is willing to take a 60-vote threshold for that, and those of \nus who worry about the pipeline are willing to vote with a 60-vote \nthreshold. That is the way to go.\n  The minority leader, the Republican leader Senator McConnell, said it \nover the years over and over. Whenever there is controversy, if people \nfeel it is controversial, have a 60-vote threshold. He said that I \ndon't know how many times, but I have the quotes. All of a sudden, when \nit comes to repealing President Obama's Climate Action Plan or \nKeystone, somehow that doesn't qualify as controversial from his point \nof view, but the thing about ``controversial'' is it is in the eye of \nthe beholder. I don't think it is controversial to raise the minimum \nwage. It hasn't been raised in years, but my friends on the other side \ndon't like it. They demand 60 votes. So we had a 60-vote threshold.\n  That is where we are, and that is why we are in this mess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate today for voting on \nthe confirmation of Leon Rodriguez to be Director of the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS. This is a vital leadership \nposition within the Department of Homeland Security, responsible for \nadministering and processing asylum and refugee applications, \nimmigration benefits, and naturalization and visa petitions, including \nthe EB-5 Regional Center Program.\n  Mr. Rodriguez's confirmation comes at a critical time. Nearly 1 year \nafter the Senate's historic vote on the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, House Republicans have \nfailed to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and have maintained a \nstatus quo that leaves our immigration system in tatters. We are now \nseeing the human cost of this inaction, as tens of thousands of young, \nunaccompanied alien children flood our Southwest border. Many of these \nchildren fled their homes to escape unimaginable violence, only to \nendure a harrowing journey and, once here, yet another humanitarian \ncrisis. House Republicans must act to fix our broken immigration \nsystem, as we did in the Senate 1 year ago this week. Until then, our \nborders will be undermanned, our immigration courts overwhelmed, our \neconomy will lag, and millions of people who have lived and worked in \nour country for years will be left in limbo.\n  Although he will face these extraordinary challenges, I am confident \nthat Mr. Rodriguez will ably lead USCIS. He currently serves as the \nDirector for the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services. He previously served as the Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General and Chief of Staff for the Justice Department's Civil \nRights Division. Prior to joining the administration, Mr. Rodriguez was \nthe county attorney for Montgomery County, Maryland. Before that he was \nin private practice here in Washington. He has vast leadership and \nmanagement experience, spanning both public and private practice, and \noften intersecting with issues of national origin and immigration \nstatus, making him extremely qualified to lead USCIS effectively.\n  Mr. Rodriguez understands the need for both a comprehensive and \ncompassionate response to the humanitarian crisis facing children \nseeking refuge in our country. With parents who fled an oppressive \nregime in Cuba, and grandparents who fled anti-Semitism and poverty in \nTurkey and Poland before that, Mr. Rodriguez understands the challenges \nand remarkable potential of immigration, both for the immigrant and for \nour country. This process begins with the fair, swift adjudication of \nasylum, refugee, and visa petitions.\n  Mr. Rodriguez also understands how important the USCIS-administered \nEB-5 jobs program is to States like Vermont. This important economic \nprogram has transformed parts of our State, providing much-needed \ncapital and creating jobs. I have spoken to Mr. Rodriguez about the \nchallenges facing the program, including long application processing \ndelays that have threatened to undermine important projects. He is \ncommitted to working with us in Congress to strengthen the program and \nmake it permanent.\n  He has the strong support of law enforcement, including the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, as well as a coalition of 37 Latino \norganizations from across the country. I too support Mr. Rodriguez. I \nwas proud to advance his nomination through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Senate floor. He is uniquely suited to lead this \nimportant office, and I look forward to seeing the progress to come at \nUSCIS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Leon Rodriguez, of Maryland, to be \nDirector of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nDepartment of Homeland Security?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Pryor) and \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran) and the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Johanns).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 44, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 211 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Baldwin\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Walsh\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Cochran\n     Johanns\n     Pryor\n     Schatz\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased, although not surprised, with \nthe latest news that Vermont's children rank as the healthiest. Recent \ndata released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows \nthat Vermont ranks at the top or near the top of the list on a variety \nof metrics, including a child's access to health care, and percentage \nof children who exercise regularly. We all know that healthy habits \nbegin in childhood, and Vermont has worked for years to ensure that all \nVermont children have access to healthy beginnings.\n  Vermont has long been a trailblazer on health care, particularly for \nchildren. Recognizing that access to health care for children and \npregnant women is critical to a healthy society, Vermont created the \nDr. Dynasaur Program in 1989 to help families who could not afford \nhealth insurance but could not qualify for Medicaid. The program was \nsuch a success, Governor Howard Dean expanded Dr. Dynasaur in 1991 to \ncover all children and teens. Governor Dean's success with the program \nand leadership on the issue paved the way for Congress to create the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Vermont has taken other steps as well to ensure all children can grow \nup healthy. In addition to having one of the lowest rates of uninsured \nchildren, Vermont has worked hard to give children access to healthy \nmeals at school. Vermont brings local food into schools and teaches \nchildren about healthy eating through the Farm to School Program. And \nin order to make sure all children have access to school meals, Vermont \ngives those eligible for reduced-price lunches those meals for free. By \nworking in a coordinated fashion across agencies and with advocacy \ngroups, Vermont reaches out to children in need to help those families \nreceive access to health care, nutrition assistance, and other vital \nsafety net programs.\n  Unfortunately, there are still some troubling national trends related \nto children's health of which Vermont is not immune. Larger serving \nsizes and greater access to junk food combined with sedentary \nlifestyles have contributed to the steady rise in childhood obesity \nrates. Additionally, we are seeing a rise in the number of children \nliving in poverty and without consistent access to nutritious food and \nhealth care. If we fail to reverse these trends, we are setting our \nchildren up for health problems that will last well into adulthood.\n  We must continue to support the efforts of our States and so many \nfamilies who are trying to help their children make healthy choices. \nInstead of working to undermine the efforts we have made to ensure \nchildren can eat nutritious meals in school or to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act, or reducing eligibility in the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children Program or other nutrition \nprograms, we should be working together to ensure all American children \nhave the chance to succeed.\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nVermont has shown tremendous leadership in this area, and I hope we can \nall learn from its model.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Washington Post article, \n``Best state in America: Vermont, for its healthy kids,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 21, 2014]\n\n          Best state in America: Vermont, for its healthy kids\n\n       A lifetime of good health starts in childhood. Health \n     insurance, access to health care and regular exercise make \n     for fit kids with long life expectancies. And nowhere in \n     America are kids healthier than in Vermont.\n       Across a range of metrics, the Green Mountain State excels, \n     according to the latest data collected by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention. Fewer than one in four \n     Vermont children are overweight or obese. More than 81 \n     percent have access to medical and dental care. Nearly 99 \n     percent have health insurance. And one-third of all Vermont \n     children report exercising at least 20 minutes a day.\n       Vermont's relatively small and prosperous population makes \n     it easier than in some other states for officials to reach \n     out to potentially vulnerable children, said Cathy Hess, \n     managing director for coverage and access at the National \n     Academy for State Health Policy. What's more, Vermont has \n     been a pioneer in children's health reform.\n       The state's Dr. Dynasaur program, created in 1989, covered \n     tens of thousands of low-income children long before the \n     federal Children's Health Insurance Program came into being. \n     Congressional authors modeled the federal program in part on \n     Vermont's plan.\n       Vermont policymakers have also worked for years to build \n     partnerships between public and private institutions to \n     promote children's health. There's the Vermont Child Health \n     Improvement Program, run through the University of Vermont; \n     Children's Integrated Services, run through the state \n     Department for Children and Families, which works to connect \n     low-income families with young children to social services; \n     and the Blueprint for Health, established in 2006 to improve \n     health-care services and control costs.\n       ``They're focusing on the child and the family, and not so \n     much trying to fit the child in different bureaucratic \n     holes,'' Hess said.\n       Other states can brag about their successes: Children in \n     West Virginia, Missouri, Tennessee and Oklahoma report \n     getting more exercise than their compatriots in Vermont. Kids \n     in Utah and Colorado are less likely to be obese or \n     overweight. And Hawaii and Massachusetts insure a greater \n     proportion of their children.\n       States with higher percentages of low-income families tend \n     to fall at the less healthy end of the spectrum, especially \n     if those families are minorities with less access to health \n     care. Nearly 40 percent of children in Louisiana and \n     Mississippi are obese or overweight. Only 56 percent of \n     children in Nevada and 59 percent in Idaho have access to \n     medical and dental care. Just 18 percent of Utah children say \n     they get 20 minutes of daily exercise.\n       Perhaps those states should study Vermont's model. The \n     Green Mountain State is a lap ahead of the rest of the field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3926-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Lance Corporal Adam Wolff\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

He was 25 years old. Adam was a native \nof Eldon, IA, and lived in Cedar Rapids. Eldon is home to the house \ndepicted in Grant Wood's famous painting ``American Gothic,'' which has \ncome to symbolize a certain indomitable American spirit. Certainly \nthere can be no greater representation of the spirit of self-sacrifice \nthat has preserved American liberty through the generations than \npatriots like Lance Corporal Wolff. We can never repay him for his \nsacrifice, but we as a country must remember him and all those who have \ngiven their lives in defense of freedom. My thoughts and prayers go out \nto his family and friends who are feeling his loss very deeply, \nparticularly his father Nicholas, his mother Deborah, and his siblings. \nWe cannot begin to comprehend their loss, but they should know that \nAdam's service and sacrifice have earned the gratitude of an entire \nnation.\n\n\n              Chief Warrant Officer Two Randy L. Billings\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to remember the life and \nsacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army CW2 Randy L. Billings. Randy \ndied December 17, 2013, of injuries he sustained when his helicopter \ncrashed in Zabul Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Randy was born September 1, 1979, in Poteau, OK, and later moved to \nHeavener, OK. After graduating Heavener High School in 1997, he joined \nthe military and served our country for 16 years.\n  While attending flight school to Rucker, AL, Randy met his wife \nAshley. Bonding through a mutual enjoyment of the outdoors, they were \nmarried in 2008.\n  In September 2009, Randy transferred to the 3rd Assault Helicopter \nBattalion, 1st Aviation Regiment, 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, and 1st \nInfantry Division in Fort Riley, KS.\n  The couple made a home in Manhattan, KS, but they planned to move \nsouth after he retired from the military and start a family.\n  Ashley and her family are suffering their second loss to war. Ashley \nBillings' brother died in a 2004 helicopter crash in Iraq. ``It's much \nharder because we've been through this before,'' she said. However, \nthey were comforted by the knowledge that Randy ``loved what he did and \nwas going to do it right.''\n  On December 17, 2013, Randy tragically died of injuries he sustained \nwhen his Black Hawk U-60 helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan. \nFive other soldiers on board were killed alongside of Randy.\n  His uncle Hurschel Billings said, ``He really loved it. Every time he \ncame back, he couldn't wait to go back.'' He served two tours in Iraq \nand two in Afghanistan. ``He died loving what he does. Serving the \ncountry.''\n  ``He was just one of the nicest people you could possibly be around . \n. . He was the definition of what a hero is. He served his country \nwell,'' said Amanda Morrison, Billings' cousin.\n  A memorial service was held January 4, 2014, at Cornerstone Baptist \nChurch in Inverness, FL, and he was buried at Florida National \nCemetery. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin ordered flags on State property \nto fly at half-staff from 3-6 January, 2014.\n  ``He's pushed me to be a better person for myself every single day of \nmy life,'' his wife Ashley said. ``That's the kind of person he was.''\n  Chief Warrant Officer Billings' wife Ashley Billings resides in \nManhattan, KS; mother Eva Cooper in Poteau, OK; and father Robert \nBillings in Heavener, OK.\n  Today we remember Army CW2 Randy L. Billings, a young man who loved \nhis family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3926-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING TOM CARPER\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, I wish to speak about the importance \nof a level playing field for Minnesotan miners and American steel. My \nState's iron ore mines and the thousands of Minnesota jobs they support \nare the backbone of the Iron Range. It started in the days when miners \nlike my grandfather worked in the underground mines with picks and \nshovels and continues today in open-pit mines with giant electric \nshovels and haul trucks.\n  Through the generations, these Minnesotans have earned a reputation \nfor possessing a strong work ethic. They have proven that our miners on \nthe range can compete with anybody in the world on a level playing \nfield. Unfortunately, that fairness is being compromised by foreign \ntrading practices that are putting steelworker jobs in jeopardy.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently investigating the \ntrading practices of countries that are dumping steel products in the \nU.S. market. This flood of foreign oil country tubular--OCTG--goods is \ncausing our Nation's steel industry to lose sales and market to \nunderpriced foreign competitors. An example is South Korea, which is \nthe world's largest steel industry but has no domestic OCTG market. The \nresult is Korean producers exporting more to the United States, \ncreating a drop in the price of steel.\n  While the U.S. demand for OCTG products is increasing, American \nproducers are not seeing the benefits. In fact, they are losing sales \nto foreign competitors, with imports of OCTG doubling since 2008 and \nincreased by 61 percent this year compared to the previous year. This \nis already having an impact in American facilities with reduced hours \nand the threat of layoffs for workers.\n  Dumping of steel products has nationwide economic implications. The \nOCTG steel produced for the U.S. energy market accounts for \napproximately 10 percent of domestic steel production. U.S. OCTG \nproducers directly employ nearly 8,000 workers across the country, and \nevery one of those jobs in turn supports another 7 jobs in the supply \nchain. Here in Minnesota, where the steelmaking process begins, there \nare more than 10,000 high-quality, steel-related jobs.\n  That is why I recently joined 58 of my colleagues in sending a \nbipartisan letter to the Secretary of Commerce expressing concern at \nthe antidumping investigation of OCTG imports from South Korea. The \nletter asks the administration to more closely examine these imports \nfor any misrepresentations in origin and nature of the products and to \ntake action against any unfair dumping practices.\n  We all know our industries need to be competitive--but they also need \nto be competing on fair terms. It is critical that our trade laws serve \nas the last line of defense for American companies and workers. I will \ncontinue fighting to ensure that we have a level playing field for this \nMinnesota industry vital to the economic prosperity of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3927-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PENNSYLVANIA'S ACA MARKETPLACE\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Health Marketplace `Working' for Enrollees\n\n\n                68% had premiums of $100 or less: report\n\n                            (By Steve Twedt)\n\n       Pennsylvanians who selected midrange coverage ``silver'' \n     plans in the new private health insurance marketplace created \n     as part of the federal Affordable Care Act paid an average \n     monthly premium of $60 with tax credits, according to a new \n     report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Overall for all four plans--bronze, silver, gold and \n     platinum--68 percent of enrollees had premiums of $100 or \n     less after factoring in tax credits and 47 percent found \n     plans with premiums of $50 a month or less, the report said.\n       ``What we're finding is that the marketplace is working for \n     Pennsylvanians,'' said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell in a \n     release. ``Consumers have more choices, and they're paying \n     less for their premiums.''\n       More than 300,000 Pennsylvanians have signed up for a \n     marketplace health plan since enrollment began Oct. 1. \n     Nationally, the number of enrollees has surpassed 8 million \n     who HHS says have collectively saved nearly $1.2 billion in \n     premiums from what insurers had originally sought.\n       The exchanges are an integral part of the 2010 Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, designed to give people, \n     and particularly the uninsured, access to low-cost health \n     insurance.\n       The tax credits for lower income enrollees are a major \n     factor in plan affordability, as the HHS report said; \n     Pennsylvanians who were eligible for tax credits saw their \n     monthly premiums decrease by 74 percent, from $330 to $84.\n       Information about the tax credits, including eligibility \n     requirements, can be found at the IRS website: www.irs.gov/\nuac/Newsroom/Questions-and-Answers-on-the-Premium-Tax-Credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3927-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3927-S3928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LITTLE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to recognize Little League \nInternational on its 75th anniversary. Little League International was \nfounded in Williamsport, PA, in 1939 by Carl Stotz as a means for area \nyouth to learn the sport at a time when they were considered too young \nto play organized baseball. The basic goal of Little League was, and \nremains, to introduce children to a game that teaches its set of \nvalues, including courage, character and loyalty, that will guide them \nthroughout their lives. Congress recognized the valuable role Little \nLeague has played in America's communities when it unanimously granted \nLittle League a Federal charter on July 16, 1964. That charter was \nsigned into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson the very next day.\n  Over the course of its 75 years, Little League Baseball has become \nthe world's largest organized youth sports program, growing from 3 \nteams in 1939 to nearly 200,000 teams located in all 50 States and more \nthan 80 countries worldwide. Each year, more than 2.4 million children \nparticipate in Little League Baseball in various divisions, including \nbaseball, softball, and a challenger division for physically and \ndevelopmentally challenged children. Some notable Little League alumni \ninclude former U.S. President George W. Bush, two Vice Presidents, \nnumerous U.S. Senators and Representatives, two Nobel Prize laureates, \nand a Medal of Honor recipient. Also, several professional athletes and \nHall of Fame baseball players began their journey in Little League. In \nkeeping with the tradition of our national pastime, thousands\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nof games are played throughout the summer months at various levels of \ncompetition. These events bring together children from the \ninternational community and foster principles that transcend cultural \nor regional differences.\n  Since the very first game was played on June 6, 1939, Little League \nInternational has made an invaluable contribution to the lives of \nmillions of children across the globe. I wish Little League \nInternational all the best as it continues to grow and fulfill its \nmission by laying a strong foundation for today's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3928-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRAULATING SOUTHEAST ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the hard \nwork of the students and faculty of the Southeast Island School \nDistrict, their local community members, and their Superintendent, \nLauren Busch.\n  In response to high food costs, the school district sought funding \nand community support to build greenhouses for students at each of its \nfour schools: Thorne Bay, Coffman Cove, Naukati, and Barry Stewart. \nStudents and community members found funding, purchased and constructed \ngreenhouses and are now using locally sourced biomass to heat them.\n  While building a few greenhouses may not sound like much to those in \nthe lower 48, things are different in Alaska. High transportation \ncosts, high energy costs, the lack of access to raw materials, and \nsometimes severe weather all combine to make for a high cost of living. \nThis makes this district-wide greenhouse project a tremendous \nachievement.\n  A central part of my job is to explain how different Alaska is to my \ncolleagues here and to help them understand these high costs our Alaska \ncommunities face. These are the central challenges of our State and, in \none project, have been smartly and creatively addressed through the \nSoutheast Island School District greenhouse program. In addition, the \nprogram also teaches students many other valuable skills, including \nentrepreneurship.\n  I am proud to congratulate these hard-working and resourceful \nAlaskans and I wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3928-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3928-S3929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VAN BUREN COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Van Buren County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$13 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \nsuccess that the Van Buren County Hospital has had in securing funds \nfor wellness activities and facilities expansions through programs I \nfought for as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nBonaparte to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Van Buren County has earned \n$55,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Van Buren County has received $2,722,823 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Van Buren County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $144,729.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Van Buren County has received more than $5 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Van Buren \nCounty's fire departments have received over $2,000,000 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Van Buren \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing more than \n$350,000 in grants for community wellness activities.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. However, I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nhave had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens with disabilities: \nequal opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic \nself-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since passage of the ADA, I \nsee remarkable changes in communities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just \nin curb cuts or closed captioned television, but in the full \nparticipation of people with disabilities in our society and economy, \nfolks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute their talents \nand to be fully included. These changes have increased economic \nopportunities for all citizens of Van Buren County, both those with and \nwithout disabilities, and they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Van Buren County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Van Buren \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3929-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3929-S3930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FLOYD COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Similarly, \nschools in Floyd County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $55,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nFloyd County has received over $2.8 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities.

Madam President, today I rise to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of Lake City, SD. In \n1885, Marshall County separated from Day County and became a separate \nentity. A man named Stout bought the Lake City area land and divided it \ninto lots to be sold to Lake City settlers. When the railroad came \nthrough in 1914, residents voted to split from Eden City and create the \ntownship of Lake City in Marshall County. This close-knit community \nwill celebrate its centennial July 4-5, 2014.\n  Part of a resilient community, the residents of Lake City have \novercome several large fires. The largest of these broke out in 1949 \nand quickly spread to the local pool hall and then throughout the town. \nAfter this, and every other fire, the people of Lake City came together \nand rebuilt their town.\n  On Friday night the celebration will kick off with a street dance. \nFestivities will continue the following day with a parade, team \nwatermelon-eating contest, a tug-of-war competition, and many other \nfun-filled activities. That evening, another street dance will bring \nthe event to a close.\n  Today, this small town in Marshall County symbolizes what it means to \nbe a South Dakota community. I am proud to honor the successes of Lake \nCity and to offer my congratulations to the residents of the town on \nthis historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3930-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDEN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, I wish to recognize Wibaux County \nin eastern Montana on the occasion of its 100th birthday. Founded by \nbold pioneers at the turn of the century, Wibaux is living proof of the \nstrength of the American prairie spirit.\n  The county was founded in August of 1914 by Pierre Wibaux, a \nFrenchman who left the family textile business to try to tame the Wild \nWest. When those like Wibaux first settled in eastern Montana, they \nbrought with them a strong work ethic. That resilience became apparent \nwhen Wibaux's W-Bar Ranch grew to cover 70,000 acres in Wibaux County. \nThe lively community attracted Theodore Roosevelt, whose famed ranch \nwas nearby across the North Dakota border.\n  Since its founding, Wibaux County has undergone many changes. Farmers \nhave experienced agricultural booms, and the local schools are known \nstatewide for academic and athletic excellence. The discovery of oil in \nthe region as well as the recent introduction of hydraulic fracking \nhave transformed the local economy and brought the county into the \ninternational spotlight. Through it all, the people who call the county \nhome share the core values of service, honesty, and the willingness to \nhelp a neighbor in need.\n  Perhaps the greatest quality of the county is its kind citizens who \nare always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor. The residents of \nWibaux County still exhibit the same generosity, diligence, and drive \nthat Pierre Wibaux and other pioneers brought to the area 100 years \nago.\n  I congratulate Wibaux County on 100 wonderful years. We look forward \nto the next century being as exciting as the last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3930-5", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 316) to \nreinstate and transfer certain hydroelectric licenses and extend the \ndeadline for commencement of construction of certain hydroelectric \nprojects.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1044.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to review and support H.R. 3930, the National \n     Commission on the Structure of the Army Act of 2014; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 69\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 3930 was introduced on January 27, 2014, and \n     seeks to establish the National Commission on the Structure \n     of the Army to undertake a comprehensive study of the \n     structure of the Army; and\n       Whereas, the focus of this study is to determine two \n     factors, which include the proper force mixture of the active \n     component and reserve component, and how the structure should \n     be modified to best fulfill mission requirements in a manner \n     that is consistent with available resources; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3930 also directs the commission to give \n     careful consideration in evaluating a structure that meets \n     current and anticipated requirements of combat commands, \n     achieves a cost-efficient balance between the regular and \n     reserve components with particular focus on fully burdened \n     and lifestyle costs of Army personnel, and ensures that the \n     regular and reserve components possess the capacity needed to \n     support homeland defense and disaster assistance missions in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3930 further provides for sufficient numbers \n     of regular members of the Army to provide a base of trained \n     personnel from which the personnel of the reserve components \n     could be recruited; maintains a peacetime rotation force to \n     support operational tempo goals of a ratio of one to two for \n     regular members and a ratio of one to five for members of the \n     reserve components; and further maximizes and appropriately \n     balances affordability, efficiency, effectiveness, \n     capability, and readiness; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3930 further prohibits the use of any funds \n     made available for the 2015 Fiscal Year for the Army to \n     divest, retire, or transfer any aircraft of Army assigned \n     units of the Army National Guard as of January 15, 2014, or \n     to reduce personnel below the authorized end strength levels \n     of three hundred fifty thousand members of the Army National \n     Guard as of September 30, 2014: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to review and support \n     H.R. 3930, which would, if enacted, be known as the National \n     Commission on the Structure of the Army Act of 2014; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-259. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to ensure \n     proper expenditures and the restoration of the Gulf Coast for \n     the benefit of all the citizens of the United States; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 50\n\n       Whereas, on April 20, 2010, an explosion occurred on the \n     mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon which \n     resulted in the fire that eventually sank the rig, killing \n     eleven crewmen, and destroying Louisiana's delicate coast and \n     industries that rely on the coast with an estimated 4.1 \n     million barrels of oil released over an eighty-seven day \n     period from the Macondo well five thousand feet below on the \n     ocean bottom; and\n       Whereas, this incident has had a long-lasting impact on the \n     state's natural resources, including land, water, fish, \n     wildlife, fowl, and other biota, and likewise on the \n     livelihoods of Louisiana's citizens living along the coast; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act also known \n     as the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321, provides for \n     administrative and civil penalties for parties responsible \n     for unauthorized discharge of pollutants into United States \n     waters as occurred during the Deepwater Horizon disaster; and\n       Whereas, these fines estimated between $5.4 billion and \n     $21.1 billion would ordinarily be deposited into the Oil \n     Spill Liability Trust Fund pursuant to the Clean Water Act; \n     however, congress passed the Resources and Ecosystems \n     Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies \n     of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE) that requires \n     eighty percent of the fines to be deposited into the Gulf \n     Coast Restoration Trust Fund (trust fund) for restoration \n     efforts in the five coastal states damaged by the spill: \n     Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; and\n       Whereas, the monies from the trust fund will be principally \n     divided into three funding mechanisms, the Direct Component \n     that evenly distributes thirty-five percent to the five \n     affected states; the Comprehensive Plan Component that \n     directs thirty percent to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem \n     Restoration Council to implement a comprehensive Gulf Coast \n     wide recovery plan; and the Spill Impact Component that \n     distributes thirty percent to the affected states based upon \n     a formula calculated on the miles of coastline affected by \n     the oil spill, distance from Deepwater Horizon, and the \n     average 2010 population; and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, Louisiana has recent experience in \n     administering restoration and recovery programs in the wake \n     of disasters such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and \n     Isaac and has learned the value of real-time audit practices \n     in terms of ensuring proper expenditures, providing guidance \n     to program administrators, and assuring transparency of \n     decisions for the public; and\n       Whereas, auditing after the fact provides little assistance \n     for parish and county governments with minimal resources to \n     recoup\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n     large sums in the case of improper expenditures; and\n       Whereas, the RESTORE Act provides for up to three percent \n     for administrative costs; there remains uncertainty whether \n     those funds are only for the cost of the United States \n     Treasury Department administering the RESTORE Act and whether \n     those funds can be utilized by state and local governments \n     for real-time audits: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary for the proper allocation of resources on \n     the federal, state, and local level to fund real-time audit \n     practices in developing, planning, constructing, and \n     executing projects funded by the RESTORE Act's Gulf Coast \n     Restoration Trust Fund to ensure proper expenditures and the \n     restoration of the Gulf Coast for the benefit of all the \n     citizens of the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-260. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to review the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision Social Security benefit \n     reductions and to consider eliminating or reducing them by \n     enacting the Social Security Fairness Act of 2013; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States of America has \n     enacted both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing \n     the spousal and survivor Social Security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned \n     Social Security benefit for any person who also receives a \n     public pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, congress enacted these reduction provisions to \n     provide a disincentive for public employees to receive two \n     pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit earned by \n     the spouse even though the spouse paid Social Security taxes \n     for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it makes the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of the Social \n     Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts over thirty thousand \n     Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, the WEP negatively impacts over thirty thousand \n     Louisianans; and\n       Whereas, in certain circumstances both the WEP and GPO can \n     be applied to a qualifying survivor's benefit, each \n     independently reducing the available benefit and in \n     combination eliminating a large portion of the total Social \n     Security benefit available to the survivor; and\n       Whereas, the calculation characteristics of the GPO and the \n     WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on employees \n     working in lower-wage government jobs, like policemen, \n     firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise their quality of life; and\n       Whereas, individuals drastically affected by the GPO or WEP \n     may have no choice but to return to work after retirement in \n     order to make ends meet, but the income earned during this \n     post-retirement employment may cause additional reductions to \n     the Social Security benefits to which the individual is \n     entitled; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals affected by both GPO and WEP \n     have significantly less money to support their basic needs \n     and sometimes must rely on government assistance programs to \n     bridge the gap; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by taking away \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by the GPO and WEP \n     is growing daily as the baby boomers attain retirement age \n     and advances in health care increase longevity; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by \n     congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States of America to \n     review the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision Social Security benefit reductions and \n     to consider eliminating or reducing them by enacting the \n     Social Security Fairness Act of 2013 (S. 896 and H.R. l795); \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-261. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to review the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision Social Security benefit \n     reductions and to consider eliminating or reducing them; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States of America has \n     enacted both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing \n     the spousal and survivor Social Security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned \n     Social Security benefit for any person who also receives a \n     public pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a worker who \n     has worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, congress enacted these reduction provisions to \n     provide a disincentive for public employees to receive two \n     pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit even \n     though their spouses paid Social Security taxes for many \n     years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on hundreds of \n     thousands of citizens and undermines the original purpose of \n     the Social Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, according to the Social Security Administration, \n     in 2013, at least 614,644 individuals nationally were \n     affected by the GPO; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, according to the Social Security Administration, \n     in 2013, at least 1,549,544 individuals nationally were \n     affected by the WEP; and\n       Whereas, in certain circumstances both the WEP and GPO can \n     be applied to a qualifying survivor's benefit, each \n     independently reducing the available benefit and in \n     combination eliminating a large portion of the total Social \n     Security benefit available to the survivor;

and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, individuals drastically affected by the GPO or WEP \n     may have no choice but to return to work after retirement in \n     order to make ends meet, but the earnings accumulated during \n     this return to work can further reduce the Social Security \n     benefits the individual is entitled to;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana expressing sympathy in \n     support of the families of victims of massacres and \n     atrocities perpetrated against the Armenian people in \n     Azerbaijan and requesting that the President of the United \n     States and the Congress exert all available influence on the \n     government of Azerbaijan to cease the falsification of the \n     historical facts and bring to justice those responsible in \n     Azerbaijan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 166\n\n       Whereas, the Armenian populated area of Nagorno-Karabakh is \n     located between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of \n     Azerbaijan; and\n       Whereas, in 1920 the Soviet Union forcibly established \n     control over the areas of Armenia and Azerbaijan; and\n       Whereas, the Soviet Union created the Nagorno-Karabakh \n     Autonomous Oblast within Azerbaijan in 1923 and this region \n     became a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 1988, the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh \n     peacefully demonstrated against Azerbaijan for the right of \n     self-determination and individual freedom from repression and \n     discrimination; and\n       Whereas, in February 1988, in the seaside town of Sumgait \n     in Soviet Azerbaijan a pogrom targeted the Armenian \n     population when mobs composed of largely ethnic Azerbaijans \n     formed groups which attacked and killed hundreds of Armenians \n     on the streets, in their apartments in a situation that was \n     allowed to continue by Soviet and Azerbaijan officials for \n     three days before government forces imposed a state of \n     martial law and curfew bringing the crisis to an end; and\n       Whereas, the crimes committed against Armenians in Sumgait \n     remain unpunished thereby opening the door for similar \n     atrocities against the Armenian people starting in the \n     capital Baku and spreading to other areas of Azerbaijan and \n     Nagorno-Karabakh; and\n       Whereas, Azerbaijan seeks to avoid responsibility for the \n     violence and atrocities by falsifying historical events and \n     by portraying the involvement of Soviet troops to Baku to \n     restore order on the seventh day of the Armenian atrocities \n     as a crackdown on the alleged independence movement in \n     Azerbaijan; and\n       Whereas, it is well known that there was no large scale \n     movement for independence in Azerbaijan due to the fact in a \n     March 1991, referendum that more than 94% of the Azerbaijan \n     constituencies favored preserving the Soviet Union; and\n       Whereas, Azerbaijan continues to distort events of other \n     atrocities, including the events in the village of Khojaly in \n     which Azerbaijan troops fired on their own population and the \n     deportation of Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabakh: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby express sympathy in support of the families of \n     victims of massacres and atrocities perpetrated against the \n     Armenian people in Azerbaijan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate requests that the President of \n     the United States and the Congress exert all available \n     influence on the government of Azerbaijan to cease the \n     falsification of the historical facts and bring to justice \n     those in Azerbaijan who are responsible for the Armenian \n     massacres in Sumgait, Baku, Kirovabad, Maragha, Nagomo-\n     Karabahk, and of the citizens of Khojaly; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States of America, \n     the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and each member of \n     the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-263.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being on objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Integration Act of \n     2014''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Olmstead v. L.C., \n     527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that the unnecessary segregation of \n     individuals with disabilities is a violation of the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).\n       (2) Under Olmstead, individuals generally have the right to \n     receive their supports and services in home and community-\n     based settings, rather than in institutional settings, if \n     they so choose.\n       (3) Olmstead envisioned that States would provide \n     appropriate long-term services and supports to individuals \n     with disabilities through home and community-based services \n     and end forced segregation in nursing homes and other \n     institutions.\n       (4) While there has been progress in rebalancing State \n     spending on individuals with disabilities in institutions as \n     compared to home and community-based settings, more than 75 \n     percent of States continue to spend the majority of their \n     long-term care dollars on nursing homes and other \n     institutional settings, and the number of individuals with \n     disabilities under age 65 in nursing homes increased between \n     2008 and 2012.\n       (5) As of June 2013, there were more than 200,000 \n     individuals younger than age 65 in nursing homes - almost 16 \n     percent of the total nursing home population.\n       (6) Thirty-eight studies published from 2005 to 2012 \n     concluded that providing services in home and community-based \n     settings is less costly than providing care in a nursing home \n     or other institutional setting.\n       (7) No clear or centralized reporting system exists to \n     compare how effectively States are meeting the Olmstead \n     mandate.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENSURING MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE \n                   CARE IN A HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (80), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (81), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (81) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(82) in the case of any individual with respect to whom \n     there has been a determination that the individual requires \n     the level of care provided in a nursing facility, \n     intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, \n     institution for mental disease, or other similarly \n     restrictive or institutional setting--\n       ``(A) provide the individual with the choice and \n     opportunity to receive such care in a home and community-\n     based setting, including rehabilitative services, assistance \n     and support in accomplishing activities of daily living, \n     instrumental activities of daily living, and health-related \n     tasks, and assistance in acquiring, maintaining, or enhancing \n     skills necessary to accomplish such activities, tasks, or \n     services;\n       ``(B) ensure that each such individual has an equal \n     opportunity (when compared to the receipt and availability of \n     nursing facility services) to receive care in a home and \n     community-based setting, if the individual so chooses, by \n     ensuring that the provision of such care in a home and \n     community-based setting is widely available on a statewide \n     basis for all such individuals within the State; and\n       ``(C) meet the requirements of section 1904A (relating to \n     the provision of care in a home and community-based \n     setting).''.\n       (b) Requirements for Community Care Options.--Title XIX of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is amended \n     by inserting after section 1904 the following new section:\n\n\n         ``provisions related to home and community-based care\n\n       ``Sec. 1904A.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide for additional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor \norganizations, Super PACs and other entities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join with several Democratic \nSenators to reintroduce the DISCLOSE Act, renewing--for the third \ntime--our fight to curtail some of the worst abuses resulting from the \nSupreme Court's decision in Citizens United. Republicans mounted \nfilibusters of this commonsense bill when it was first introduced in \n2010 and then again when it was reintroduced in 2012. This was the case \neven though Republicans claim to support disclosure.\n  Earlier this month, I chaired a hearing on a proposed constitutional \namendment to repair the damage done by Citizens United and a series of \nother flawed Supreme Court decisions that have eviscerated our campaign \nfinance laws. At this hearing, even Floyd Abrams, the noted First \nAmendment attorney who testified against the proposed amendment argued \nthat he supported greater disclosure. And yet, Republicans have already \nfilibustered this bill twice and are likely to continue filibustering \nit. I am hoping that Republicans have come to their senses after seeing \nhow Citizens United has allowed unlimited, undisclosed money to pollute \nour elections.\n  Since that decision, our elections have been defined by corporations \nand billionaires spending vast amounts of secret money to influence \nelections. In the 2012 election cycle, spending from undisclosed \nsources exceeded $310 million, a massive increase from the $69 million \nfrom undisclosed sources in the previous presidential election cycle in \n2008. And this number will only increase. No one doubts that.\n  While states like Vermont and Congress continue their heavy lift of \npassing a constitutional amendment to address the flawed Supreme Court \ndecisions that have gutted our campaign finance laws, the Senate can \ntake more immediate action today. By passing the DISCLOSE Act, we can \nrestore transparency and accountability to campaign finance laws by \nensuring that all Americans know who is paying for campaign ads. This \nis a crucial step toward restoring the ability of Vermonters and all \nAmerican voters to be able to speak, be heard and to hear competing \nvoices, and not be drowned out by powerful corporate interests.\n  We know disclosure laws can work because they do work for individual \nAmericans donating directly to political campaigns. When you or I give \nmoney directly to a political candidate, our donation is not hidden. It \nis publicly disclosed. Yet those who oppose the DISCLOSE Act are \nstanding up for special rights for corporations and wealthy donors that \nyou and I do not have.\n  Recently, the Washington Post documented a trend whereby politically \nactive organizations manipulate and use\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\ntheir tax-exempt status to keep its donor lists private even though \nthese organizations are pouring millions of dollars of undisclosed \nmoney into our elections. The increase of secret money can only harm \nour political process. The DISCLOSE Act would fix this problem. This \nbill would require any organization spending money on political ads, \nincluding 501(c)(4)s and Super PACs, to disclose donors who had given \n$10,000 or more. This is a commonsense transparency measure that \neveryone should be willing to support.\n  When the race is on for secret money and election campaigns are won \nor lost by who can collect the largest amount of unaccountable, secret \ndonations, it puts at risk government of, by and for the people. In a \ndemocracy, our ballots should be secret not massive corporate campaign \ncontributions. Disclosure of who is paying for election ads should not \nbe kept secret from the public.\n  Vermont is a small state. It would not take more than a tiny fraction \nof the corporate money flooding the airwaves in other states to \noutspend all of our local candidates combined. I know that the people \nof Vermont, like all Americans, take seriously their civic duty to \nchoose wisely on Election Day. Like all Vermonters, I cherish the \nvoters' role in the democratic process and am a staunch believer in the \nFirst Amendment. The rights of Vermonters and all Americans to speak to \neach other and to be heard should not be undercut by corporate \nspending.\n  I hope that Republicans who have seen the impact of waves of \nunaccountable corporate campaign spending will join us to take up this \nimportant legislation. I hope Republican Senators will let us vote on \nthe DISCLOSE Act and help us take an important step to ensure the \nability of every American to be heard and to be able to meaningfully \nparticipate in free and fair elections.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2520. A bill to improve the Freedom of Information Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, is \none of our Nation's most important laws, established to give Americans \ngreater access to their government and protect their ability to hold \ngovernment accountable. In keeping with my commitment to support this \nlaw and expand its mission, today I join with Senator John Cornyn to \nintroduce bipartisan legislation that will improve the implementation \nof FOIA.\n  I have sought for decades to make our government more open and \ntransparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these \nefforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several \nimprovements to FOIA: the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform \nto FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the \ntransparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA \nAct, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed \nagency delays in processing requests.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act we are introducing today will make \nadditional improvements to the law. It will enshrine into law the \npresumption of openness that the President laid out on his first day in \noffice. He said, ``The Freedom of Information Act should be \nadministered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness \nprevails.'' Our bipartisan legislation will require that Federal \nagencies consider the public interest in the disclosure of government \ninformation before invoking a FOIA exemption. It will provide \nadditional independence for the Office of Government Information \nServices, OGIS, created by the OPEN Government Act in 2007, and reduce \nthe overuse of Exemption 5 to withhold information by adding a public \ninterest balancing test.\n  There has been significant progress in improving the FOIA process \nover the years, but I am concerned that the growing trend towards \nrelying upon FOIA exemptions to withhold large swaths of government \ninformation is hindering the public's right to know. According to the \nOpenTheGovernment.org 2013 Secrecy Report, Federal agencies used \nExemption 5 more than 79,000 times in 2012--an incredible 41 percent \nincrease from the previous year. This does not exemplify the \npresumption of openness that we expect from our Government, and that is \nwhy Senator Cornyn and I are introducing the FOIA Improvement Act \ntoday.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans understand that a commitment to \ntransparency is a commitment to the American values of openness and \naccountability, and to the public's right to know what their government \nis doing. I value the strong partnership that I have formed with \nSenator Cornyn on open government matters. Ensuring an open government \nshould be a nonpartisan issue, and I invite all Members to support the \nFOIA Improvement Act of 2014.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of our \ngreatest treasures in this country: our public lands. Growing up in \nButte, MT, I woke up every day under the morning shadow of the \nContinental Divide, part of the Deerlodge National Forest. When I was a \nkid, my dad would take me fishing on the Big Hole River. On the living \nroom wall in my parents' home, there were pictures of three people: a \npicture of Jesus, a picture of JFK, and a picture of George Meany. I \nhave carried the values my parents instilled in me to this day.\n  I grew up in a Catholic home similar to Montana writer Norman \nMaclean, who wrote in his famous book ``A River Runs Through It'' that \nhis father, a Presbyterian minister, ``told us about Christ's disciples \nbeing fishermen, and we were left to assume, as my brother and I did, \nthat all first-class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly \nfishermen, and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.''\n  As an adult serving in the Montana National Guard, I would ride my \nmountain bike almost daily all over trails in\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nthe Helena National Forest that connect our streets in the capital city \nof Helena. One day my granddaughter Kennedy will fish and bike these \nsame lands and waters. These places all have one thing in common beyond \nbeing gorgeous and being in Montana; they belong to you and me. We all \nown them. They are part of what makes living in Montana and in America \nso special. Other countries and other States have lost this heritage \nbut not in Montana.\n  Maintaining and improving access to these lands is one of the most \nimportant things we can do. That is why today I submitted legislation \nto make it harder to sell off this land. My bill will create a budget \npoint of order in the Senate to block attempts to sell off public land \nto pay for Congress's bills.\n  There is no question that Washington has a spending problem. Since \narriving in the Senate, I have proposed several ways to rein in out-of-\ncontrol spending. But selling off our kids' and grandkids' heritage is \na terrible idea. Jeopardizing the countless jobs that rely on our \noutdoors is also a terrible idea.\n  There is a theory circulating in some parts of the West that the \nFederal Government has a continuing duty to dispose of its lands in \nWestern States. What this really means is handing over our most popular \nrecreation areas to the highest out-of-State bidder. That is good for \ncopper barons and trophy-home developers, but it is bad for us.\n  This theory is as radical as it is wrong, as court rulings have \nrepeatedly found, but it is getting real traction.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have passed a budget \nthat could sell off millions of acres of public land--our land--in \nMontana.\n  I want you to know that I will fight any similar attempts in this \nChamber. I want my granddaughter Kennedy to grow up in Montana with the \nsame easy access to streams and forests I enjoyed, whether she wants to \nhunt, hike, fish or bike.\n  We also need to get our forests healthy and working again, creating \ngood jobs and making our forests more resilient to wildfires.\n  Like many Montanans, I am frustrated with how long it takes to \nconduct a timber sale or complete an environmental analysis of \npotential projects. Even simple projects get tied up in court, and our \nrural communities and the land itself suffer for it.\n  But the solution isn't to hand the keys over to special interests and \nwalk away. The solution is to manage the land--from the ground up.\n  In Montana, tourism is critical to our economy. Outdoor recreation \nsupports 64,000 jobs and generates over $5.8 billion in revenue \nannually. Cutting off access or selling the land to out-of-State \ndevelopment is a direct threat to jobs in Montana.\n  Turning over land in the State is just one step away from \nprivatizing. There is no question that private land is the misguided \nultimate goal of many who don't understand our outdoor heritage in the \nWest.\n  In the year 2000 I led the response of the Montana National Guard to \nthe wildfires that consumed over 1 million acres of Montana land. The \nDepartments of Agriculture and Interior have spent about $1.8 billion \nannually to fight wildfires in the past 5 years. States simply cannot \nafford that pricetag. One bad wildfire season could bankrupt a State.\n  I want to share a little more about what is at stake.\n  Under the Ryan budget in the House of Representatives, with an \nauction of our public lands, Montana hunters could lose access to elk \nwallows of the Pioneer Mountains. You might hear elk bugling on \nTenderfoot Creek in the Little Belt Mountains, but it could be on \nprivate land instead of land protected by the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Montanans could be shut out of the Missouri River Breaks, locked out \nof putting a canoe in or hunting a mule deer or sheep.\n  We could lose the Rocky Mountain Front, facing padlocks and orange \nsigns instead of open space and the chance for a bighorn sheep tag.\n  Under the House plan, anglers in Montana could lose the headwaters of \nRock Creek or the Smith River and the chance to sink a perfect fly from \na streamside the public owns.\n  Despite years of effort to secure access, we could be shut out of \nland around the Three Dollar Bridge south of Bozeman that helped kids \nlike me--growing up, fishing in our own blue-ribbon streams. The same \nthing could happen to the centennials and swan.\n  We could lose the best eastern Montana has to offer, from the monster \nbucks and turkeys in the Custer National Forest to the duck factory of \nthe BLM's prairie potholes.\n  Under the House plan, we could be facing closed roads, closed trails, \nand closed land in the Gallatin National Forest that thousands of \nMontanans worked together 20 years ago to keep open and keep public \nforever.\n  Montana is the last best place because we can hunt, fish, hike, and \nplay on the land that we all own. I will fight to keep it that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/24/senate-section/article/S3945-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3375.
