Mr. President, I am going to begin a brief discussion \nalong with two of my colleagues who will appear shortly, Senator Breaux \nfrom Louisiana and Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia, on what we \nhave called the families-first agenda that we developed to lay out what \nwe think we would like to accomplish in the months ahead and also in \nthis and the following Congress.\n  Before I do that, however, I wanted to share with my colleagues \nsomething that I will share at greater length at a later time.\n\n  Yesterday, we voted on the minimum wage. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion back and forth on the issue of the minimum wage, and the \nopposition to the minimum wage from some is that it will cost jobs; \nfrom others, that there ought not be a minimum wage.\n  There has been a lot of controversy about it. The Congress I think in \nits good judgment decided after about 7 years that another adjustment \nshould be made; the last adjustment was made in the latter part of \n1989. But we will still have some discussion about it because there \nneeds to be a conference and, I expect, more debate in the Chamber \nabout the minimum wage.\n  Last evening, I found something that I want to share with my \ncolleagues which I think contributes to the debate some. It is a piece \nwritten by Edward Filene. Some will remember, especially in \nMassachusetts and others around the country, the name Filene because \nFilene is the name that is attached to department stores, Filene's \nBasement among others.\n  Edward Filene, September 1923, a businessman of some significance at \nthat time, wrote the following. And this is only the last paragraph. I \nintend to share this at greater length with my colleagues at a \ndifferent time.\n  ``The Minimum Wage,'' Edward Filene says in 1923.\n\n       In this connection, I will call attention to a result which \n     cannot be ignored--to the man who has produced the best \n     commodity for the price of its kind in the world, produced in \n     quantities never before dreamed of\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n     and produced it so cheap that it can be sold in competition \n     with the cheap labor of Europe--so cheap, indeed, that no \n     country can make it to compete with him. I refer to Henry \n     Ford. He has produced twelve hundred thousand automobiles a \n     year--eight a minute--has financed his whole business from \n     the profits, and has become the richest man in the world. And \n     the minimum wage he pays is so high that if it were proposed \n     in Massachusetts, those who advocated it would be set down as \n     crazy. Even at his high minimum wage, he has been able to \n     employ the lame, the crippled, the blind of the community not \n     as a charity but at a profit. The statistics in his \n     autobiography covering these facts are amazing. The \n     demonstration of the possibility of the minimum wage speaks \n     louder than my words and I hope it may be borne in mind in \n     any decision of the minimum wage question.\n  This was September 1923, by Edward Filene, a businessman of some \nsignificance, then. I wanted to share this, which I think is a \nwonderful piece about the minimum wage written some 70 years ago, but I \nthink it is still relevant today with respect to the questions that we \nface.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7679-7", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7680-S7682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAMILIES-FIRST AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe agenda. We discussed it some yesterday. I want to discuss it \nadditionally today. Senator Reid, from Nevada, and myself were asked by \nthe Democratic leader to begin work with our caucus to develop an \nagenda. It is easy to discern quickly in this Chamber what someone \nstands against, what someone opposes, what a party opposes. That takes \nvery little skill, to oppose anything. It takes very little skill to be \nnegative. So the political system and the give-and-take of politics has \nthose who are proposing things and those who are opposing them.\n  Again, it is easy to discern quickly who opposes what. The question, \nhowever, for us in our country, is not what do we oppose; the question \nis, really, what do we support? What is it that we believe can be done \nto advance the interests of this country?\n  As I indicated yesterday, the standard by which we ought to judge \nthat is, at the end of the day, have we done things in this country, in \nthe public and private sector, to increase the standard of living in \nAmerica? Do we have people who have an opportunity for better jobs at \nbetter pay? Are their children going to better schools? Are we driving \non better roads? Are we able to acquire better products?\n  The most important ingredient in all of that, the thing that is the \nlinchpin of opportunity, is: Do we have an economy that is growing? Do \nwe have an economy that is producing new jobs and is capable of \nproducing new jobs at a decent income at a sufficient pace to keep \nabreast of the increase in population and to keep the American people \nunderstanding there is an opportunity and hope ahead?\n  As I begin discussing the families-first agenda that we have put \ntogether, let me say the first and most important element of what we \nstand for as Democrats is economic opportunity and economic growth. It \nis the legacy of the Democratic Party. We have been the party that \npushes insistently to expand this country's economy and therefore \nexpand opportunities, not just for some, but for all in America.\n  I must say, my own view of the current economic situation is, while \nthis administration has done a remarkable job in a range of areas, it \nhas not had the kind of cooperation I would like to see from those who \nconstruct monetary policy at the Federal Reserve Board. It certainly \nhas not seen much cooperation from Wall Street.\n  We have, it seems to me, an economic strategy, especially in the area \nof monetary policy, that shortchanges our country today. As Mr. Rohaytn \nfrom New York says, the minute you get some prevailing wind, we see a \nFederal Reserve Board decide to drop anchor.\n  It makes no sense to create a false choice, saying we must choose \nbetween either inflation or growth. It makes no sense to believe if we \nhave decent growth that provides decent expansion and therefore more \njobs at better income, that we will necessarily stoke the fires of \ninflation. That is nonsense. Inflation is down. It has been coming down \n5 years in a row. If you believe Mr. Greenspan, that the CPI overstates \ninflation by a percent and a half, then you have to conclude there \nis almost no inflation in America today. If that is the case, why do we \nsee this rate of economic growth targeted at an artificially low rate, \nwhich means the false choice is answered, by those who provide answers, \nthat we will continue to fight an inflation that does not exist? The \ncost of fighting that inflation will be lost opportunity for American \nfamilies and lost jobs and a less bright economic future.\n\n  I am going to talk about the families-first agenda, but I will come \nto the floor and talk about this at some length. Last week, what did we \nsee? We saw a news report at the end of last week that said \nunemployment is going down again, unemployment has dropped. What did \nWall Street do? What did the bond market do? What did the stock market \ndo? It had an apoplectic seizure. Good economic news for Wall Street \nmeans bad times.\n  What on Earth is going on? Is there a cultural divide here somewhere, \nthat good economic news, good news for American families, creates \nseizures on Wall Street? Do they not connect with this country at all? \nDropping unemployment is good news. When unemployment goes down, you \nwould expect people on Wall Street to celebrate a bit. When economic \ngrowth rates are up, you would expect Wall Street to believe that is \ngood for our country.\n  Get a life, would you, in New York City. Get a life about these \nthings. Why is it every time we get a piece of good news, the folks on \nWall Street have a seizure? Why is there a chasm between Wall Street \nand Main Street about what Wall Street believes is a fundamentally \nunsound policy for them? I want to come and speak about that at some \nlength, because it seems to me this is out of step with what we need \nfor our country in terms of economic growth and opportunity. If every \ntime we begin to see some progress in creating the kind of economic \ngrowth we need, not 2.2 percent a year, not 2.5 percent a year, but \nmore robust economic growth that produces the jobs and opportunity--if \nevery time that happens we see the bond market go into a pretzel stance \nand have a seizure of some sort, there is something fundamentally wrong \nwith what is going on in this country. But if the first obligation and \nthe first important fight for us as Democrats is to create an economy \nthat expands and grows and provides opportunities for working families, \nwe have a range of other policies that we believe are important that \nhelp accomplish that.\n  We put together, with the help of a lot of people over a period of a \nyear in the Senate and then working together with Members of the U.S. \nHouse, and then with the White House, an agenda that is called \n``families-first.'' It is called families-first because, when \neverything is settled, when all the dust begins to settle and the day \nis done, the question of whether we have been successful as a country \nis measured by whether we have done something that improves the lives \nof American families. Have we increased the standard of living in this \ncountry?\n  First, we believe, in a families-first agenda that there is a \nresponsibility for Government. Government has a responsibility to \nbalance the budget, pay for what it consumes, not leave a legacy for \nits grandchildren to pay for what their grandparents consume.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to balance the budget. We \nbelieve the budget ought to be balanced with hard choices, the right \nway. The budget deficit has come down very, very substantially in the \nlast 3 years, and that is because a lot of folks in this Chamber have \nbeen willing to make tough decisions. We would reach out and hope for \ncooperation with others, to say, yes, balancing the budget matters, and \nit is one of the first items on our agenda.\n\n  Second, economic opportunity: We stand for helping small businesses \nthrive and create jobs in our country, and pursue policies to make that \nhappen. People who risk their economic livelihood, go to work in the \nmorning, keep their businesses open all day, and who are trying to make \na profit, they matter to this country. They provide jobs in this \ncountry. And we want policies that are friendly to that kind of \ninvestment and that kind of commitment that Americans make in creating \njobs and building businesses.\n  Investing in our communities, in the infrastructure, building the \nroads, building the infrastructure this country needs, repairing the \ninfrastructure,\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nbuilding schools, those are the kinds of things that need to have \nattention as well, and that is in our families-first agenda.\n  We talk about individual responsibility: welfare reform. Senator \nBreaux will speak this morning, and no one has worked harder or longer \non welfare reform than the Senator from Louisiana. Our approach has \nbeen called work first. We believe those who are able-bodied have a \nresponsibility to work. We want to put them from the welfare rolls over \nto the payrolls.\n  We also believe that deadbeat dads ought to take responsibility and \npay for the care of their children. Why should the dads out there have \nchildren and then abandon them and then say to the other taxpayers of \nAmerica, ``You take care of those kids.'' Our proposal says to deadbeat \ndads, ``It is your responsibility as well to take care of those kids.''\n  Our agenda calls for a national crusade to end teenage pregnancy in \nthis country, which causes a whole series of other social problems. \nThat is something Americans could and should unite against and decide, \nin a massive education program, that teenage pregnancy retards, rather \nthan advances, the interests of this country.\n  Personal security. It is hard to feel like your country is advancing \nif you and your family do not feel safe. We believe putting more cops \non the street is good public policy, and President Clinton's proposal \nis now in effect and there are more cops on the street, more police on \nthe beat. We would continue to enhance that.\n  Keeping kids out of the streets and out of gangs and a whole series \nof policy initiatives to do that are important.\n  Cleaning drugs out of our schools is important. We believe that \neveryone on parole and probation in America ought to be drug tested \nwhile on parole and probation.\n  We propose in the families-first agenda retirement security, pension \nreform and protection, allowing people to take their pensions with them \nwhen they change jobs, stiffer penalties for those who abuse the \npensions and crack down on companies who use pension money \ninappropriately, money people have saved for their retirement that the \ncompanies would then misuse. There would be tough penalties in those \ncircumstances.\n  We would expand pension coverage, including expanding opportunities \nfor IRA investments.\n  Health care security. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which we have now \npassed 100 to 0 in the Senate but is not now law, is a central part of \nwhat we ought to do. And a kids first health plan which we believe \nought to be advanced.\n  Educational opportunity. Our party has always stood for education: \n$10,000 tax deductions for college and job training and a Project Hope \nscholarship project, 2 years of college for kids with good grades.\n  Mr. President, the families-first agenda is an approach that talks \nabout the requirements of all levels of government and all Americans to \njoin together to do the things, the sensible things, that will make \nthis a better country.\n  We are not talking about spending substantial amounts of new money. \nThat is not what these programs are about. These programs are about \ntrying to determine how we advance this country's interests so that at \nthe end of the day, the American people can say our country is growing, \nit is moving, it is providing hope and opportunity for our family and, \nyes, for every family. That is what the families-first agenda is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield to my colleague from \nLouisiana, if he is ready to speak.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will start by \ncongratulating the Senator from North Dakota for his comments in \noutlining what I think is a realistic and doable agenda; that is, the \nfamilies-first agenda. I think that we as Democratic Members can be \nvery proud of putting forth an agenda that is realistic, it is doable, \nit is not slogans, it is not pie in the sky, it is not sound bites, it \nis not ideas that have been proposed by public relations firms after \ndoing polling when they look forward to concentrating on the next \nelection, as opposed to trying to look at the real needs of real \nAmericans in the real world.\n  I think the families-first agenda is, in fact, an agenda that talks \nabout real problems and coming up with real solutions that are \nachievable, because while we can talk about slogans and goals, our \nbusiness in this body is to legislate in a way that has a real effect \non people.\n  I think that some of the early statements we have had in this \nCongress about things that should be done have been received by many \npeople with a great deal of concern as to whether they are really ever \ngoing to happen. As we move to the end of this Congress, I think a lot \nof Americans have said, ``Well, you know, I heard about contracts and I \nheard about proposals to amend the Constitution and to do all types of \nthings, and it never happened.'' The reason it never happened is \nbecause they were unrealistic goals in the first place.\n  What we have to deal with is what is doable, what is accomplishable \nand how to take those step-by-step efforts to reach the goals that \npeople expect us to achieve. That is why I think the agenda that the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota has outlined is one that is \nrealistic. It is one that the average family, when they sit around the \ndinner table at night talking about their concerns and what they would \nlike to see happen, are items they talk about: security, a reasonable \npaycheck, reasonable health insurance, a reasonable opportunity to send \ntheir children to college.\n  They are not talking about philosophical ideas. They are not talking \nabout major amendments to the Constitution, which has served us very \nwell for over 200 years. They are talking about real-life problems that \nthey face every day, and they just wish that Congress could work \ntogether in getting some of these things done.\n  I think progress is being made. The minimum wage legislation that was \npassed, I think, was very positive. We continue to work on the so-\ncalled Kennedy-Kassebaum health care program, which would be a major \naccomplishment and one that I think is very doable.\n  I am pleased to say that I think we can get something done on that \nlegislation in this Congress. We are very, very close and optimistic \nabout it. It is going to take some compromise on both sides, but I \nthink the end result will be much better in having something done than \nit will be in not accomplishing it and just blaming the other side for \nfailure, which we do far too often around here.\n  I would like to concentrate on one of the items that is part of the \nfamilies-first agenda, and that is real welfare reform. One of the \nproblems, I think, that has prevented us from accomplishing it so far \nis the insistence by many on the Republican side of trying to put \ntogether a piece of legislation that we basically are close to agreeing \non, welfare reform, and tying it to something we do not agree on, and \nthat is Medicaid. By doing so, we guarantee that nothing will happen on \neither one of the two bills, as far as getting something adopted.\n  I was encouraged to see this morning in Commerce Daily the fact that \nthere has been what is reported as a general consensus by House \nRepublicans to push ahead on welfare reform by itself. I think that is \nsomething that our colleagues in the Senate should also consider.\n  If we are very close to reaching an agreement on one major reform of \nan entitlement program, why not go ahead and accomplish it, why not go \nahead and do it, why not give the American people a real welfare reform \npackage that we all can say we joined hands and came up with an \nagreement that makes sense?\n\n  There are some, I think a diminishing minority, who say, ``No, we're \ngoing to have to tie welfare reform to Medicaid reform.'' Why? I do not \nknow. Perhaps some want to do that just so they will have the President \nveto it and then have a political issue.\n  But I do not think there is a great deal more to be gained by blaming \neach other for our failures. I think most people in this country \noutside of Washington would like to see both sides work together and do \nwhat we can agree on, set aside what we cannot agree on for later \ndebates and later\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nwork, even into the next Congress, if necessary.\n  So I think that the suggestion by House Republicans in growing \nnumbers and apparently being discussed by a number of Republican \nSenators on this side to do what we can do, that being welfare reform, \nand doing it separately makes a great deal of sense. I am absolutely \nconvinced that if we are able to come to the Senate floor on a welfare \nreform package, that we can reach an agreement. I think we are very, \nvery close, and I think that is something that clearly should be done.\n  We all know that Government cannot provide all the solutions to all \nof our problems all of the time. That is why I think that the consensus \nthat is developed on welfare reform makes so much sense. We all agree \nthat welfare reform requires work. The goal of welfare reform should be \ngetting people off welfare. The goal of welfare reform should be ending \nwelfare and putting people into jobs in the private sector and, when \nnecessary, with some Government help and assistance.\n  First of all, we can all agree that real welfare reform is about \nwork. We also, I think, all agree that welfare cannot be forever, that \nthere has to be a time limit, there has to be a termination. I think we \nall understand that, if people think there is no end to what they may \nbe receiving, in fact there will not be the incentives to move into the \nprivate sector in the work programs.\n\n  So, first, I think welfare has to have time limits. It has to be \nabout work. But it also has to be, Mr. President, about protecting \ninnocent children. I do not think there is anyone in this body who \nwould say that we want to be so tough on work that we adversely affect \ninnocent children who did not ask to be brought into this world. They \nare here in many cases as innocent victims. We ought to make sure that \nany reform also protects children while it is very tough on work \nrequirements and very tough on the parents.\n  So I think we have a consensus that is right here. It is right at our \nfingertips. And there is no reason why we should not go ahead and do \nwhat is doable and what we can accomplish and then we can all take \ncredit for it politically. This is an election year. I think that when \nwe go back home and say that together Republicans and Democrats have \nworked out a plan to end welfare as we know it, the American people \nwill say, ``Thank goodness. They have gotten something accomplished.''\n  I think there is a great deal of agreement on how to go about doing \nit. It is not total agreement. There are still major items that need to \nbe worked out. But I think that it is very clear that we can accomplish \nthis. I think every indication is that the President wants to sign a \nwelfare reform bill but knows that the current Medicaid plan is not yet \nready.\n  We have Republican Governors who just, apparently, yesterday, in \ntalking with their Republican Senate colleagues, talked about the fact \nthat they are very displeased with the Medicaid plan that has come out \nof the Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve. So if you have \nDemocratic Governors saying, ``Look, I don't think this is ready yet. \nWe don't like it,'' and you have Republican Governors who have to run \nthe program saying, ``No, we don't think this product is what we \nwant,'' that sends us a message. Let us set that aside, continue to \nwork on it, but go forward with that which we can agree on. And that \nmeans the welfare plan.\n  I think, if we were able to separate it, we could get that \naccomplished. If we tie them together, we are dooming welfare reform to \ndefeat. Maybe some people think that is a good idea politically because \nthen we can blame the other side. They will blame us and everybody will \nblame each other. The American public outside Washington will say, \n``What are they talking about? They should be talking about getting \nsomething done, not blaming the other side for failure.'' Failure is \nnot politically acceptable in the area that I come from. I think we do \nmuch better when we get something accomplished.\n  The Work First Act that we have, as Democrats, offered as part of \nthis package, I think, is a major step in the right direction. Can it \nbe further improved? Probably. I am willing to work in that regard. But \nI think it makes some principal points that I think are the essence of \nreal reform. Assistance is conditional. It is not really an \nentitlement. People have to be able to move into the work force or \nperform community service. That is real reform. It is limited. There is \nan actual time limit on how long a person or their family can be on \nwelfare. The general consensus is that 5 years is an acceptable amount \nover a lifetime. We know it cannot be forever, and our bill says that.\n  It requires teen parents--which is a major problem--to live at home \nor live in an adult setting. Children who are having children cannot be \nleft on their own without adult supervision. Our legislation requires a \nteen parent to live at home and to attend school as a condition to \nreceiving welfare benefits. But we also say that to the innocent child, \nand many of them are babies out there, that we are going to guarantee \nthat there be child care and health care for those children.\n\n  I want to be as tough as I possibly can on the parent because they \nare the ones who brought the child into the world. They have a \nresponsibility. They have to live up to it. But there are the innocent \nchildren that we, as a society, have to say we are going to reach out \nto and make sure they are given child care so the parent can go to work \nand they are going to have health care so they can remain healthy and \ngrowing children.\n  We also want to make sure that at times when there is a recession \nthey are not left high and dry, that funding will be available for \nchild care and for health care. We want to give the States all the \nflexibility they need. What works in my State of Louisiana may not be \nacceptable in California or New York or Florida or any of the other \nStates. What they do in their States may not fit my State. So we want \nto give the Governors in the States a tremendous amount of flexibility.\n  I think the bottom line in all of this is that we have a program that \ncan change the welfare system in our country to bring about real reform \nand at the same time save a great deal of money. Our plan is projected \nto save nearly $50 billion. That is real reform. At the same time, it \nprotects the needs of innocent children. So we have a good program.\n  So I urge today that as part of the family-first agenda that we have \nput out on the table--one ingredient is the welfare reform package--but \nmy plea to our colleagues is to not let other issues doom welfare \nreform to defeat, do not tie welfare to things that we do not have an \nagreement on. I think that would be a very, very serious mistake.\n  I think our Finance Committee has done some good work, quite frankly, \nin a bipartisan fashion. The chairman of the committee, Senator Roth, \nwas able to work with those of us on the Democratic side to add some \namendments to the package that make it a better package, one that is \nmore acceptable to the administration and one that can actually become \nlaw with a few additional minor changes.\n  But the only way we can fail in this effort is to desire failure. I \nthink, unfortunately, there are some in the Congress who would like to \nsee that happen. I suggest that that is not the way to go. So let us \nget on with what we can accomplish, do what we can do, and then I think \nthe American public will be able to say that Congress had the \nopportunity to do what was right, met that challenge, and did exactly \nthat in welfare reform, a good place to start.

I think our business is relatively easy here, or \nought to be. I really think there are\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nonly two things we ought to do from the side of the aisle that I \nrepresent. We are interested in paycheck security, health care \nsecurity, retirement security. Those have a variety of things that go \nalong with them which we think are important for family values, for \nfamily safety, and obviously family security.\n  I think there are two pieces of legislation that ought to be signed \ninto law by the President, ought to be passed out of this body. There \nis no reason why they cannot be. I stand here this morning as the \njunior Senator from West Virginia in some sense of frustration and \nwonderment, really putting myself in the place of American citizens \nwondering why it is not more certain and why there is not a more clear \ncourse.\n  I think if either of these bills fails to pass this session of \nCongress, both Houses, and on to the President, then I think the \nAmerican people have real reason to wonder why they put us here. I \nspeak, of course, of two pieces of legislation which we have already \npassed. The first one was passed the other day, the minimum wage \nincrease. There was a 74 to 24 vote on that. Some might say, well, that \nwas not as strong as it appeared because minimum wage was encased in a \nsmall business package, had that title. But there cannot be any doubt \nabout the fact that the minimum wage increase did pass. It has passed \nthe Senate. So has the Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance bill, more \nproperly the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill that passed by 100 \nto 0.\n  I really think it is embarrassing to our body, to all 100 of us, that \nthere is a real cloud of uncertainty as to whether or not these are \ngoing to become law. They have passed through here. The plot keeps \nthickening as we hear about efforts to delay, to entangle these pieces \nof legislation, to complicate them. Each of these pieces, of course, \nhave enormous benefits for millions of hard-working American families. \nTherefore, it seems to me incontrovertible that the good will on both \nsides should prevail.\n  On our side, we talk about putting families first. I think they are \nthree good words, it is a good phrase. It is clear. It is what we mean. \nIt means enacting the minimum wage increase and it means enacting the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n  In West Virginia tens of thousands of wage earners, in fact, 24 \npercent of all our wage earners in the State, will benefit from the \nminimum wage law. I am not necessarily happy to say that that many of \nthem would be affected, but that is what I have to say because that is \nthe fact. Over two-thirds of them are adults, and most of them are \nwomen, many of them, most of them, have responsibilities for children.\n\n  I had a remarkable conversation, at least to me, last week with one \nof these people who is a graduate, lives in a small community in West \nVirginia, who is a graduate of the University of Indiana, has a B.A. \nfrom the University of Indiana, and moved to West Virginia because she \nliked the lifestyle. She works as a waitress. She has a 10-year-old \ngirl, her husband has left her, and child support is minimal. She can \nnow earn $2.13 an hour because of the tipping matter under the present \nlaw we have passed here in the Senate. So her salary--as she said, tips \ndo make up the difference. If you do allow that to happen, then, in \nfact, she could go from $8,500 a year to $10,700 a year. When you add \non top of that the earned income tax credit for which she is eligible, \nshe could make $3,000 plus from that, which would put her above the \npoverty level.\n  Now, that is a momentous fact, taking a program already existing, and \nthe minimum wage which we passed, that we take a woman who lives in \npoverty, officially, a proud person, well-educated, interested in the \narts, with a brilliant 10-year-old daughter, who I had a chance to talk \nwith, who is an exceptional gymnast, for whom she can do nothing \nbecause there is no margin whatever in her life financially, being able \nto help her. She brings to mind, and many others who I have talked to \nwho are working, who are not on welfare, who are working because of \ntheir desire to achieve self-esteem through work rather than being on \nwelfare.\n  I cannot understand why there would be any reason to either block the \nappointment of conferees, or whatever it would be, to keep the minimum \nwage bill from passing. It means an enormous amount to people in my \nState and every single State, most of whom are adult, most of whom are \nwomen, most of whom have children.\n  Then, I think, finally, there is no excuse if the Congress fails to \npass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. We said from the very beginning, after \nthe failure of the Clinton health care bill, that we should concentrate \non what we can agree on. That is what we started out with on Kassebaum-\nKennedy, concentrating on what we can agree on. We have to do it \nincrementally. I understand that and I applaud that. This is a bill on \nwhich we so agreed. In fact, the vote was 100 to 0.\n  Then MSA's, medical savings accounts, was put in in the House and put \nin over here in a rather odd manner at the last moment. That we did not \nagree on. Everything else we did agree on. Now that is being, I think, \nsort of relegated to the possibility of a bill that will not pass this \nCongress because of the disagreement on that. On the other hand, there \nwas an agreement at the beginning. The whole spirit of everything was \nthat we would agree with what we could agree on, and we did so in such \na magnificent form that we passed it 100 to 0 here.\n  We should do that, putting families first, which means getting back \nto the basics of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and getting this bill into \nlaw. If it means we have to take a moratorium on our August recess, I \ndo not care what it takes, we ought to be able to pass the minimum wage \nbill and the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill.\n  It is a ``no brainer,'' Mr. President. I submit that with all \nsincerity, two pieces of legislation, and there are many more that I \nhave in mind, but here are two pieces of legislation, both of which \nhave passed by overwhelming margins in this body, both of which can be \nconferenced successfully, if we only have the will to do so, both of \nwhich would enormously help put American working families first.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it \nappropriate for me to begin 20 minutes, which was to be under my \ncontrol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7682-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7683-S7685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I had an interesting presentation here \nthis morning, built around what apparently is going to be a \nPresidential campaign theme, putting families first. Mr. President, we \ncannot but be reminded of a book written by President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore which was a prelude to the 1992 Presidential campaign. \nThe book, Mr. President, was entitled ``Putting People First,'' very, \nvery familiar to this new theme we have heard here this morning, \nputting families first.\n  I will read from this publication, ``Putting People First,'' now \nalmost some 4 years old, a very interesting piece on page 15 of \n``Putting People First.'' It says, ``Middle-class tax fairness.'' Now, \nthis was the President's ``contract with America,'' putting people \nfirst.\n  He says, ``Middle-class tax fairness: We will lower the tax burden on \nmiddle-class Americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair \nshare.'' I repeat, ``We will lower the tax burden on middle-class \nAmericans * * * Middle-class taxpayers will have a choice between a \nchildren's tax credit or a significant reduction in their income tax \nrate.''\n  It goes on to say, on page 101 ``Treat families right,'' in this book \nentitled ``Put People First.'' It says, ``Grant additional tax relief \nto families with children.''\n  Mr. President, since the publication of the book and the election of \nPresident Clinton, the average American family is paying somewhere \naround $2,000 to $2,600 in additional taxes out of their checking \naccount as a result of the election of President Clinton. Corporate \ntaxes are up 55.4 percent and personal taxes are up 25.3 percent. In \nother words, the exact opposite has occurred since the publication of \nthe President's book, ``Putting People First.''\n  It does begin to raise some pretty serious questions as to what do \nthey mean when they say ``Put families first.'' If they mean the same \nthing\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nthey meant when they published ``Putting People First,'' every American \ntaxpayer better duck, because the promise to lower taxes became an \naction of increasing taxes to the highest level in American history.\n  I read from an editorial published by Bruce Bartlett: ``Last week I \ndisclosed that total taxes, Federal, State, and local, as a share of \ngross domestic product were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 at 31.3 \npercent. In 1992, total taxes as a share of GDP equaled 30 percent. In \nother words, it is up 1.3 percent.'' That is just a huge, huge sum of \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, the Federal tax take is expected to shoot up this year \nby another 5.4 percent. Mr. President, the book ``Putting People \nFirst,'' promised to lower taxes, and resulted with the election. The \nAmerican people elected President Clinton based on these promises, and \nwhat happened to them was that they were confronted with the highest \ntax increase in American history.\n\n  Over a 7-year period, it was almost $500 billion. That translates to \nan individual family, since President Clinton has been elected, in \nhaving to pay another $2,000 of Government costs. The cost of \nGovernment has been pushed out another 3 days. American families, \ntoday, work from January 1 to July 3, giving July 4 in America today an \nextraordinary meaning.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, we were promised, in ``Putting People \nFirst,'' that taxes would be lowered. As I have said here over and \nover, as have others, taxes were raised and the effect was to reduce \nthe amount of income in families' checking accounts. Now we come \nforward this morning with a promise to put families first, and an \noutline of a series of programs that represent and policy goals that \npurport to say what putting families first means.\n  Mr. President, according to the House Budget Committee and the \nCongressional Budget Office, this new agenda of putting families first \ncould cost another $500 billion. So if you combine putting people first \nwith Families First, you are going to end up with families finding \nthemselves with less and less resources in their own checking accounts \nto do the kinds of things they are supposed to do. Putting people first \nlowered their checking accounts by about $2,500, and now we are told we \nwill put families first, and we are going to have another $2,500 out of \nyour checking account.\n  Mr. President, you know, if you really want to put families first, or \npeople first, it really is not all that complicated. Mr. President, \nwhat is a very simple and clean cut goal for everybody in the Congress, \nwhether you are Republican, Democrat, or an Independent, it is pretty \nsimple. We ought to set as a goal trying to leave in the neighborhood \nof around $7,000 in the families' checking accounts instead of pulling \nit and shipping it off to Washington. The Balanced Budget Act, which \nwas passed by this congressional majority, went a long way toward \naccomplishing that goal. That act would have put between $2,000 and \n$4,000 into the checking accounts of every family, lower interest \nrates, lower payments, and tax savings. It would have accomplished \nabout half of a meaningful goal. If we want to put families first, we \nought to leave the money with the families who earn it. We ought to \nleave them the ability to do the kinds of things they want to do to set \ntheir own priorities.\n  Mr. President, let us take a look at this average family. I have a \npretty good idea in the State of Georgia, and I think that is probably \nabout the case all across the country. Mr. President, the average \nfamily in Georgia makes about $45,000 a year. Today, by the time they \nhave paid their Federal taxes, by the time they have paid their State \nand local taxes, by the time they have paid their Social Security and \nMedicare taxes, by the time they have paid their share of the higher \ninterest rates on the national debt, by the time they have paid their \nshare of the cost of Government regulation, they end up with less than \nhalf the total income that they earn to take care of their families.\n  Mr. President, that is inexcusable--the fact that we have come to the \npoint in the United States that the Government takes over half of the \nhard-earned wages of a working family.\n  Now, I argue that that policy has had a very negative effect on the \nAmerican family. I argue that there is no force in America, including \nHollywood, that has so affected the average family as their own \nGovernment. It is not complicated. If the Government is going to take \nhalf of everybody's paycheck and move it to Washington to be \nwonderwonked by the wizard bureaucrats here to decide what the \npriorities are, you have pushed the family to the wall. So the \nsuggestion we are hearing from the other side is let us take more out \nof that paycheck, let us design a group of new programs that we will \nplan here in Washington to manage your family. I think families first \nneeds a little asterisk that says, ``as designed by the Federal \nGovernment.''\n\n  Our argument would be to leave the wages earned by a family in the \nchecking account of that family, and let them decide what the \npriorities of that family ought to be. A meaningful objective would be, \nif you really want to put families first, to leave the wages they earn \nin their checking accounts.\n  Now, Mr. President, the efforts on the part of the congressional \nmajority, the Republican Congress, were to do just that. We did put \nfamilies first. We did have tax credits for children. We did remove the \ntax penalty for being married. We did help people on Social Security. \nEvery action we took was to leave more resources in the checking \naccounts of the families. That is how you put families first--leave the \nresources with them so that they can manage their affairs.\n  We read over and over that the American family is anxious today, that \nthere is a deep anxiety in the families. Even at a time when we have a \nreasonably decent economy, they are still very worried, nervous, and \nbothered. Mr. President, it is because we are not leaving enough \nresources in that family. We are not leaving them the resources to do \nthe things they are supposed to do. America counts on the American \nfamily to get the country up in the morning, to house it, to school it, \nto feed it and shelter it, to take care of its health, to provide for \nthe spiritual growth necessary to take on and lead the country, and we \nhave made it virtually impossible for the family to do the job that \nAmerica asks of it.\n  The other side has come forward, as a follow-up of putting people \nfirst, which really meant we are going to tax you more. That is what \nthis book ended up doing. It ended up reducing the resources in the \naverage family by about $2,600. Now we get families first. We are told \nby the Congressional Budget Office that all that array of Government \nmanagement of the American family will cost them yet another $2,500 to \n$3,000. That is going in the wrong direction. Every proposal we have \nhad from the other side, whether it is under the label of putting \npeople first, or the label of families first, the bottom line is that \nWashington is first. Washington is first. We are going to design the \nway you run your family. We are going to design a program that manages \nyour health care. We are going to design a program that manages the \nrelations between you and your employer. But most of all, we are going \nto tax you more. So we have come to the point, between putting people \nfirst and families first, of the highest tax level in American history, \nand the highest tax burden on families in American history.\n  So if you are going to put the family first, it is pretty simple: \nLower their taxes, and leave more resources in their checking accounts. \nLook at the comparison, Mr. President. Just look at the comparison. \nThey come up with putting people first, and every family pays an \nadditional $2,500 in taxes. The Republican majority came up with the \nBalanced Budget Act. The Balanced Budget Act would have lowered the \npressure on that family between by about $2,000 and $4,000, depending \non who the family was. Lower interest payments and lower tax levels \nacross the board, more resources in the family. We are coming to a new \nelection. We have a new program entitled ``Put Families First,'' and we \nlook at the tab of what that is going to cost--another $2,000 to $3,000 \nfor each American family. I argue, Mr. President, that that has the \nexact reverse consequences.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in conclusion, I just wanted to \nunderscore\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\nthat the only way we are going to relieve the burden on the American \nfamily today is to lower the tax level and allow them to keep the wages \nthey earn, which allows them to fulfill the duties and responsibilities \nthat they have.\n  I argue that both putting people first, which resulted in the largest \ntax increase in America history, and now followed by putting families \nfirst, which will call for yet another tax increase, is not the \nprescription for the American family.\n  If you look at the last 25 years and what has happened to the \nAmerican family, as its tax level has pushed upward and upward, you \nhave seen increasing behavior and increasing conditions in the American \nfamily that are the exact opposite of that which we would like to \nachieve.\n  If you really want to say put families first, then lower the economic \nburden, lower the economic pressure, and let the wage earner keep their \nwages, and let the wage earner and family do that which they set as \ntheir own priorities of the American family.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7683-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. Section 303 of the CAA directs that the Executive \n     Director of the Office of Compliance (``Office'') shall, \n     subject to the approval of the Board of Directors (``Board'') \n     of the Office, adopt rules governing the procedures for the \n     Office, and may amend those rules in the same manner. The \n     procedural rules currently in effect, approved by the Board \n     and adopted by the Executive Director, were published \n     December 22, 1995 in the Congressional Record (141 Cong. R. S \n     19239 (daily ed., Dec. 22, 1995)). The proposed revisions and \n     additions that follow amend certain of the existing \n     procedures by which the Office provides for the consideration \n     and resolution of alleged violations of the laws made \n     applicable under Part A of title II of the CAA, and establish \n     procedures for consideration of matters arising under Part D \n     of title II of the CAA, which is generally effective October \n     1, 1996.\n       A summary of the proposed amendments is set forth below in \n     Section II; the text of the provisions that are proposed to \n     be added or revised is found in Section III. The Executive \n     Director invites comment from interested persons on the \n     content of these proposed amendments to the procedural rules.\n\n       II. Summary of proposed amendments to the procedural rules\n\n       (A) A general reorganization of the rules is proposed to \n     accommodate proposed new provisions, and, consequently, to \n     re-order the rules in a clear and logical sequence. As a \n     result, some sections will be moved and/or renumbered. Cross-\n     references in appropriate sections will be modified \n     accordingly. These organizational changes are listed in the \n     following comparison table.\n\n        Former section No.                              New section No.\nSec. 2.06  Complaints.........................................Sec. 5.01\nSec. 2.07  Appointment of the Hearing Officer.................Sec. 5.02\nSec. 2.08  Filing, Service and Size Limitations of Motions, Briefs, \n  Responses and Other Documents...............................Sec. 9.01\nSec. 2.09  Dismissal of Complaint.............................Sec. 5.03\nSec. 2.10  Confidentiality....................................Sec. 5.04\nSec. 2.11  Filing of Civil Action.............................Sec. 2.06\nSec. 8.02  Compliance with Final Decisions, Requests for EnforSec. 8.03\nSec. 8.03  Judicial Review....................................Sec. 8.04\nSec. 9.01  Attorney's Fees and Costs..........................Sec. 9.03\nSec. 9.02  Ex Parte Communications............................Sec. 9.04\nSec. 9.03  Settlement Agreements..............................Sec. 9.05\nSec. 9.04  Revocation, Amendment or Waiver of Rules...........Sec. 9.06\n\n       (B) Several revisions are proposed to provide for \n     consideration of matters arising under section 220 (Part D of \n     title II) of the CAA, which applies certain provisions of \n     chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code relating to Federal \n     Service Labor-Management Relations (``chapter 71''). For \n     example, technical changes in the procedural rules will be \n     necessary in order to provide for the exercise by the General \n     Counsel and labor organizations of various rights and \n     responsibilities under section 220 of the Act. These proposed \n     revisions are as follows:\n       Section 1.01. ``Scope and Policy'' is proposed to be \n     amended by inserting in the first sentence a reference to \n     Part D of title II of the CAA in order to clarify that the \n     procedural rules now govern procedures under that Part of the \n     Act.\n       Section 1.02(c) is proposed to be amended to make the \n     definition of the term ``employee'' consistent with the \n     definition contained in the substantive regulations to be \n     issued by the Board under section 220 of the CAA.\n       Section 1.02(i) is proposed to be amended to redefine the \n     term ``party'' to include, as appropriate, the General \n     Counsel or a labor organization.\n       A new section 1.02(j) defining ``respondent'' is proposed \n     to be added. (The addition of subsection (j) will result in \n     the subsequent subsections being renumbered accordingly.)\n       Section 1.05 ``Designation of Representative'' is to be \n     revised to allow for a labor organization to designate a \n     representative.\n       Section 1.07(c), relating to confidentiality requirements, \n     is proposed to be amended to include a labor organization as \n     a participant within the meaning of that section.\n       Section 7.04(b) concerning the scheduling of the prehearing \n     conference is modified to substitute the word ``parties'' for \n     ``employee and the employing office''.\n       (C) Modifications to subsections 1.07(b) and (d), \n     concerning confidentiality requirements, are proposed in \n     order to clarify the requirements and restrictions set forth \n     in these subsections, and to make clear that a party or its \n     representative may disclose information obtained in \n     confidential proceedings for limited purposes under certain \n     conditions.\n       (D) Section 2.04 ``Mediation,'' is proposed to be amended \n     in certain respects.\n       In section 204(a) the language ``including any and all \n     possibilities'' would be modified to read ``including the \n     possibility'' of reaching a resolution.\n       Section 204(e)(2) is proposed to be modified to allow \n     parties jointly to request an extension of the mediation \n     period orally, instead of permitting only written requests \n     for such extensions.\n       Section 2.04(f)(2) is proposed to be revised to explain \n     more fully the procedures involving the ``Agreement to \n     Mediate''.\n       A new subsection 2.04(h) is proposed regarding informal \n     resolutions and settlement agreements. (The subsections \n     following the newly added subsection 2.04(h) would be \n     renumbered accordingly.)\n       (E) Subpart E of the Procedural Rules had been reserved for \n     the implementation of section 220 of the CAA. The Board has \n     recently published proposed regulations pursuant to\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\n     section 220(d) (142 Cong. R. S5070 and H5153 (daily ed., May \n     15, 1996)) and section 220(e) (142 Cong. R.. S5552 and H5563 \n     (daily ed., May 23, 1996)) to implement the applied \n     provisions of chapter 71. In light of those proposed \n     regulations and the proposed modifications of the procedural \n     rules discussed herein, it is not necessary to reserve a \n     subpart for procedures specific to the implementation of \n     section 220.\n       (F) As discussed above, Subpart E is no longer reserved for \n     procedural rules implementing section 220 of the CAA. \n     However, as part of the general reorganization of the \n     procedural rules, Subpart E will be entitled ``Complaints,'' \n     and will consist of sections 206, 207, 209 and 210 moved from \n     Subpart B and renumbered as shown in the comparison table, \n     above.\n       In addition to proposed modifications to section 5.01 \n     (formerly section 206) required by the implementation of \n     section 220 (e.g. provision for the General Counsel to file \n     or amend complaints and the addition of references to labor \n     organizations as parties), section 5.01(e) is proposed to be \n     amended to state how service of a complaint will be \n     effectuated and section 501(f) is proposed to be amended to \n     provide that a failure to file an answer or to raise a claim \n     or defense as to any allegation(s) in a complaint or amended \n     complaint shall constitute an admission of such allegation(s) \n     and that affirmative defenses not raised in an answer shall \n     be deemed waived. A respondent's motion for leave to amend an \n     answer will ordinarily be granted unless to do so would \n     unduly prejudice the rights of the other party or unduly \n     delay or otherwise interfere with or impede the proceedings.\n       Section 5.03 (formerly section 2.09) is proposed to be \n     revised to reflect the General Counsel s role under section \n     220 of the CAA and to provide that a Hearing Officer, not the \n     Executive Director, may approve the withdrawal of a \n     complaint.\n       (G) Section 7.07, relating to the conduct of hearings, is \n     proposed to be revised to include a new subsection (e), \n     providing that ``[a]ny objection not made before a Hearing \n     Officer shall be deemed waived in the absence of clear \n     error.'' The current section 7.07(e) will be renumbered \n     section 7.07(f), and it is proposed to be amended to provide \n     that if the representative of a labor organization, as well \n     as that of an employee or a witness, has a conflict of \n     interest, that representative may be disqualified.\n       (H) Subpart H, relating to proceedings before the Board, is \n     proposed to be amended in the following ways.\n       (1) A new subsection 8.01(i) is proposed to allow for \n     amicus participation, as appropriate, in proceedings before \n     the Board, in a manner consistent with section 416 of the \n     CAA.\n       (2) A new section 8.02 ``Reconsideration'' is proposed to \n     allow for a party to seek Board reconsideration of a final \n     decision or order of the Board. The sections following \n     section 8.02 in Subpart H would be renumbered accordingly.\n       (3) Section 8.04 ``Judicial Review'' is proposed to be \n     revised to state that the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit shall have jurisdiction, as appropriate, \n     over petitions under section 220(c)(3) and section 405(g) or \n     406(e) of the Act.\n       (I) A new section 9.02 ``Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and \n     Other Filings; Violation of Rules; Sanctions'' is proposed to \n     be added.\n       (J) A section had been reserved in the procedural rules for \n     a provision on ex parte communications. The text of the \n     proposed rule, which will be found at section 9.04 of the \n     amended rules, is set forth in Section III, below.\n       (K) It is proposed that the opening sentence of section \n     9.05(a) (formerly 9.03(a)), ``Informal Resolutions and \n     Settlement Agreements'' be modified to make it clear that \n     section 9.05 applies only where covered employees have \n     initiated proceedings under the CAA.\n\n          III. Text of proposed amendments to procedural rules\n\n     Sec. 1.01  Scope and policy\n       These rules of the Office of Compliance govern the \n     procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged \n     violations of the laws made applicable under Parts A and D of \n     title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. The \n     rules include procedures for counseling, mediation, and for \n     electing between filing a complaint with the Office of \n     Compliance and filing a civil action in a district court of \n     the United States. The rules also address the procedures for \n     the conduct of hearings held as a result of the filing of a \n     complaint and for appeals to the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well \n     as other matters of general applicability to the dispute \n     resolution process and to the operations of the Office of \n     Compliance. It is the policy of the Office that these rules \n     shall be applied with due regard to the rights of all parties \n     and in a manner that expedites the resolution of disputes.\n     Sec. 1.02(c)\n       Employee. The term ``employee'' includes an applicant for \n     employment and a former employee, except as provided in \n     section 2421.3(b) of the Board's rules under section 220 of \n     the Act.\n     Sec. 1.02(i)\n       Party. The term ``party'' means: (1) the employee or the \n     employing office in a proceeding under Part A of title II of \n     the Act; or (2) the labor organization, individual employing \n     office or employing activity, or, as appropriate, the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part D of title II of the Act.\n     Sec. 1.02(j)\n       Respondent. The term ``respondent'' means the party against \n     which a complaint is filed.\n     Sec. 1.05  Designation of Representative.\n       (a) An employee, a witness, a labor organization, or an \n     employing office wishing to be represented by another \n     individual must file with the Office a written notice of \n     designation of representative. The representative may be, but \n     is not required to be, an attorney.\n       (b) Service where there is a representative. All service of \n     documents shall be directed to the representative, unless the \n     represented individual, labor organization, or employing \n     office specifies otherwise and until such time as that \n     individual, labor organization, or employing office notifies \n     the Executive Director of an amendment or revocation of the \n     designation of representative. Where a designation of \n     representative is in effect, all time limitations for receipt \n     of materials by the represented individual or entity shall be \n     computed in the same manner as for unrepresented individuals \n     or entities with service of the documents, however, directed \n     to the representative, as provided.\n     Sec. 1.07(b)\n       Prohibition. Unless specifically authorized by the \n     provisions of the CAA or by order of the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer or a court, or by the procedural rules of the Office, \n     no participant in counseling, mediation or other proceedings \n     made confidential under section 416 of the CAA \n     (``confidential proceedings'') may disclose the contents or \n     records of those proceedings to any person or entity. Nothing \n     in these rules prohibits a bona fide representative of a \n     party under section 1.05 from engaging in communications with \n     that party for the purpose of participation in the \n     proceedings, provided that such disclosure is not made in the \n     presence of individuals not reasonably necessary to the \n     representative's representation of that party. Moreover, \n     nothing in these rules prohibits a party or its \n     representative from disclosing information obtained in \n     confidential proceedings for the limited purposes of \n     investigating claims, ensuring compliance with the Act or \n     preparing its prosecution or defense, to the extent that such \n     disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the \n     aforementioned purposes and provided that the party making \n     the disclosure takes all reasonably appropriate steps to \n     ensure that persons to whom the information is disclosed \n     maintain the confidentiality of such information.\n     Sec. 1.07(c)\n       Participant. For the purposes of this rule, participant \n     means any individual, labor organization, employing office or \n     party, including a designated representative, that becomes a \n     participant in counseling under section 402, mediation under \n     section 403, the complaint and hearing process under section \n     405, or an appeal to the Board under section 406 of the Act, \n     or any related proceeding which is expressly or by necessity \n     deemed confidential under the Act or these rules.\n     Sec. 1.07(d)\n       Contents or records of confidential proceedings. For the \n     purpose of this rule, the contents or records of counseling, \n     mediation or other proceeding includes the information \n     disclosed by participants to the proceedings, and records \n     disclosed by either the opposing party, witnesses or the \n     Office. A participant is free to disclose facts and other \n     information obtained from any source outside of the \n     confidential proceedings. For example, an employing office or \n     its representatives may disclose information about its \n     employment practices and personnel actions, provided that the \n     information was not obtained in a confidential proceeding. \n     However, an employee who obtains that information in \n     mediation or other confidential proceeding may not disclose \n     such information. Similarly, information forming the basis \n     for the allegation of a complaining employee may be disclosed \n     by that employee, provided that the information contained in \n     those allegations was not obtained in a confidential \n     proceeding. However, the employing office or its \n     representatives may not disclose that information if it was \n     obtained in a confidential proceeding.\n     Sec. 2.04(a)\n       (a) Explanation. Mediation is a process in which employees, \n     employing offices and their representatives, if any, meet \n     separately and/or jointly with a neutral trained to assist \n     them in resolving disputes. As parties to the mediation, \n     employees, employing offices and their representatives \n     discuss alternatives to continuing their dispute, including \n     the possibility of reaching a voluntary, mutually \n     satisfactory resolution. The neutral has no power to impose a \n     specific resolution, and the mediation process, whether or \n     not a resolution is reached, is strictly confidential, \n     pursuant to section 416 of the Act.\n     Sec. 2.04(f)(2)\n       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the \n     mediation, the neutral will ask the parties to sign an \n     agreement prepared by the Office (``the Agreement to \n     Mediate'') . The Agreement to Mediate will set out the \n     conditions under which mediation will occur, including the \n     requirement that the participants adhere to the \n     confidentiality of the process. The Agreement to Mediate will \n     also provide that the parties to the mediation will not seek \n     to have the counselor or the neutral participate, testify or\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n     otherwise present evidence in any subsequent civil action \n     under section 408 of the Act or any other proceeding.\n     Sec. 2.04(h)\n       Informal Resolutions and Settlement Agreements. At any time \n     during mediation the parties may resolve or settle a dispute \n     in accordance with section 9.05 of these rules.\n     Sec. 5.01 (formerly Sec. 2.06)  Complaints\n       (a) Who may file.\n       (1) An employee who has completed mediation under section \n     2.04 may timely file a complaint with the Office alleging any \n     violation of sections 201 through 207 of the Act.\n       (2) The General Counsel may file a complaint alleging a \n     violation of section 220 of the Act.\n       (b) When to file.\n       (1) A complaint may be filed by an employee no sooner than \n     30 days after the date of receipt of the notice under section \n     2.04(i), but no later than 90 days after receipt of that \n     notice.\n       (2) A complaint may be filed by the General Counsel after \n     the investigation of a charge filed under section 220 of the \n     Act.\n       (c) Form and Contents.\n       (1) Complaints filed by covered employees. A complaint \n     shall be written or typed on a complaint form available from \n     the Office. All complaints shall be signed by the covered \n     employee, or his or her representative, and shall contain the \n     following information:\n       (i) the name, mailing address, and telephone number(s) of \n     the complainant;\n       (ii) the name, address and telephone number of the \n     employing office against which the complaint is brought;\n       (iii) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) \n     involved in the conduct that the employee claims is a \n     violation of the Act;\n       (iv) a description of the conduct being challenged, \n     including the date(s) of the conduct;\n       (v) a brief description of why the complainant believes the \n     challenged conduct is a violation of the Act and the \n     section(s) of the Act involved;\n       (vi) a statement of the relief or remedy sought; and\n       (vii) the name, address, and telephone number of the \n     representative, if any, who will act on behalf of the \n     complainant.\n       (2) Complaints filed by the General Counsel. A complaint \n     filed by the General Counsel shall be typed, signed by the \n     General Counsel or his designee and shall contain the \n     following information:\n       (i) the name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office and/or labor organization alleged to have violated \n     section 220 against which the complaint is brought;\n       (ii) notice of the charge filed alleging a violation of \n     section 220;\n       (iii) a description of the acts and conduct that are \n     alleged to be violations of the Act, including all relevant \n     dates and places and the names and titles of the responsible \n     individuals; and\n       (iv) a statement of the relief or remedy sought.\n       (d) Amendments. Amendments to the complaint may be \n     permitted by the Office or, after assignment, by a Hearing \n     Officer, on the following conditions: that all parties to the \n     proceeding have adequate notice to prepare to meet the new \n     allegations; that the amendments, as appropriate, relate to \n     the violations for which the employee has completed \n     counseling and mediation, or relate to the charge(s) \n     investigated by the General Counsel; and that permitting such \n     amendments will not unduly prejudice the rights of the \n     employing office, the labor organization, or other parties, \n     unduly delay the completion of the hearing or otherwise \n     interfere with or impede the proceedings.\n       (e) Service of Complaint. Upon receipt of a complaint or an \n     amended complaint, the Office shall serve the respondent, or \n     its designated representative, by hand delivery or certified \n     mail, with a copy of the complaint or amended complaint and a \n     copy of these rules. The Office shall include a service list \n     containing the names and addresses of the parties and their \n     designated representatives.\n       (f) Answer. Within 15 days after receipt of a copy of a \n     complaint or an amended complaint, the respondent shall file \n     an answer with the Office and serve one copy on the \n     complainant. The answer shall contain a statement of the \n     position of the respondent on each of the issues raised in \n     the complaint or amended complaint, including admissions, \n     denials, or explanations of each allegation made in the \n     complaint and any affirmative defenses or other defenses to \n     the complaint.\n       Failure to file an answer or to raise a claim or defense as \n     to any allegation(s) shall constitute an admission of such \n     allegation(s). Affirmative defenses not raised in an answer \n     shall be deemed waived. A respondent's motion for leave to \n     amend an answer will ordinarily be granted unless to do so \n     would unduly prejudice the rights of the other party or \n     unduly delay or otherwise interfere with or impede the \n     proceedings.\n     Sec. 5.03 (formerly Sec. 2.09)  Dismissal of complaints.\n       (a) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss any claim that the Hearing Officer finds \n     to be frivolous or that fails to state a claim upon which \n     relief may be granted, including, but not limited to, claims \n     that were not advanced in counseling or mediation.\n       (b) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss a complaint because it fails to comply \n     with the applicable time limits or other requirements under \n     the Act or these rules.\n       (c) If the General Counsel or any complainant fails to \n     proceed with an action, the Hearing Officer may dismiss the \n     complaint with prejudice.\n       (d) Appeal. A dismissal by the Hearing Officer made under \n     section 5.03(a)-(c) or 7.16 of these rules may be subject to \n     appeal before the Board if the aggrieved party files a timely \n     petition for review under section 8.01.\n       (e) Withdrawal of Complaint by Complainant. At any time a \n     complainant may withdraw his or her own complaint by filing a \n     notice with the Office for transmittal to the Hearing Officer \n     and by serving a copy on the employing office or \n     representative. Any such withdrawal must be approved by the \n     Hearing Officer.\n       (f) Withdrawal of Complaint by the General Counsel. At any \n     time prior to the opening of the hearing the General Counsel \n     may withdraw his complaint by filing a notice with the \n     Executive Director and the Hearing Officer and by serving a \n     copy on the respondent. After opening of the hearing, any \n     such withdrawal must be approved by the Hearing Officer.\n     Sec. 7.04(b)\n       Scheduling of the Prehearing Conference. Within 7 days \n     after assignment, the Hearing Officer shall serve on the \n     parties and their designated representatives written notice \n     setting forth the time, date, and place of the prehearing \n     conference.\n     Sec. 7.07(e)\n       (e) Any objection not made before a Hearing Officer shall \n     be deemed waived in the absence of clear error.\n     Sec. 7.07(f)\n       (f) If the Hearing Officer concludes that a representative \n     of an employee, a witness, a labor organization, or an \n     employing office has a conflict of interest, he or she may, \n     after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, \n     disqualify the representative. In that event, within the time \n     limits for hearing and decision established by the Act, the \n     affected party will have a reasonable time to retain other \n     representation.\n     Sec. 8.01(i)\n       The Board may invite amicus participation, in appropriate \n     circumstances, in a manner consistent with the requirements \n     of section 416 of the CAA.\n     Sec. 8.02  Reconsideration.\n       After a final decision or order of the Board has been \n     issued, a party to the proceeding before the Board, who can \n     establish in its moving papers that reconsideration is \n     necessary because the Board has overlooked or misapprehended \n     points of law or fact, may move for reconsideration of such \n     final decision or order. The motion shall be filed within 15 \n     days after service of the Board's decision or order. No \n     response shall be filed unless the Board so orders. The \n     filing and pendency of a motion under this provision shall \n     not operate to stay the action of the Board unless so ordered \n     by the Board.\n     Sec. 8.04  Judicial review.\n       Pursuant to section 407 of the Act,\n       (a) the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n     Circuit shall have jurisdiction over any proceeding commenced \n     by a petition of:\n       (1) a party aggrieved by a final decision of the Board \n     under section 406(e) in cases arising under part A of title \n     II, or\n       (2) the General Counsel or a respondent before the Board \n     who files a petition under section 220(c)(3) of the Act.\n       (b) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall \n     have jurisdiction over any petition of the General Counsel, \n     filed in the name of the Office and at the direction of the \n     Board, to enforce a final decision under section 405(g) or \n     406(e) with respect to a violation of part A or D of title II \n     of the Act.\n       (c) The party filing a petition for review shall serve a \n     copy on the opposing party or parties or their \n     representative(s).\n     Sec. 9.02  Signing of Pleadings, Motions and Other Filings; \n         Violation of Rules; Sanctions.\n       Every pleading, motion, and other filing of a party \n     represented by an attorney or other designated representative \n     shall be signed by the attorney or representative. A party \n     who is not represented shall sign the pleading, motion or \n     other filing. The signature of a representative or party \n     constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has \n     read the pleading, motion, or other filing; that to the best \n     of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed \n     after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is \n     warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the \n     extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and \n     that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as \n     to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase \n     in the cost of litigation.

If a pleading, motion, \n     or other filing is signed in violation of this rule, a \n     Hearing Officer or the Board, as appropriate, upon motion or \n     upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who \n     signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate \n     sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other \n     party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses \n     incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or \n     other filing, including a reasonable attorney's fee. A \n     Hearing Officer or the Board, as appropriate, upon motion or \n     its own initiative may also impose an appropriate sanction, \n     which may include the sanctions specified in section\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n     7.02, for any other violation of these rules that does not \n     result from reasonable error.\n     Sec. 9.04  Ex parte communications.\n       (a) Definitions.\n       (1) The term person outside the Office means any individual \n     not an employee or agent of the office, any labor \n     organization and agent thereof, and any employing office and \n     agent thereof, and the General Counsel and any agent thereof \n     when prosecuting a complaint proceeding before the Office \n     pursuant to sections 210, 215, or 220 of the CAA.

If a proceeding is then pending before \n     either the Board or a Hearing Officer, and if the Board or \n     Hearing Officer so orders, these materials shall then be \n     placed in the record of the proceeding. Upon order of the \n     Hearing Officer or the Board, the parties may be provided \n     with a full opportunity to respond to the alleged prohibited \n     ex parte communication and to address what action, if any, \n     should be taken in the proceeding as a result of the \n     prohibited communication.\n       (3) Any Board member involved in a rulemaking who knowingly \n     receives a prohibited ex parte communication shall cause to \n     be published in the Congressional Record a notice that such a \n     communication has been received and a copy of the \n     communication and of any response thereto (if written) or \n     with a memorandum stating the substance of the communication \n     and any response thereto (if oral). Upon order of the Board, \n     these materials shall then be placed in the record of the \n     rulemaking and the Board shall provide interested persons \n     with a full opportunity respond to the alleged prohibited ex \n     parte communication and to address what action, if any, \n     should be taken in the proceeding as a result of the \n     prohibited communication.\n       (4) Any Board member or Hearing Officer who is or may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding or a \n     rulemaking and who knowingly receives a prohibited ex parte \n     communication and who fails to comply with the requirements \n     of subsections (1), (2), or (3) above, is subject to internal \n     censure or discipline through the same procedures that the \n     Board utilizes to address and resolve ethical issues.\n       (e) Penalties and Enforcement.\n       (1) Where a person is alleged to have made or caused \n     another to make a prohibited ex parte communication, the \n     Board or the Hearing Officer (as appropriate) may issue to \n     the person a notice to show cause, returnable within a stated \n     period not less than seven days from the date thereof, why \n     the Board or the Hearing Officer should not determine that \n     the interests of law or justice require that the person be \n     sanctioned by, where applicable, dismissal of his or her \n     claim or interest, the striking of his or her answer, or the \n     imposition of a some other appropriate sanction, including \n     but not limited to the award of attorneys' fees and costs \n     incurred in responding to a prohibited ex parte \n     communication.\n       (2) Upon notice and hearing, the Board may censure or \n     suspend or revoke the privilege of practice before the Office \n     of any person who knowingly and willfully makes, solicits, or \n     causes the making of any prohibited ex parte communication. \n     Before formal proceedings under this subsection are \n     instituted, the Board shall first provide notice in writing \n     that it proposes to take such action and that the person or \n     persons may show cause within a period to be stated why the \n     Board should not take such action.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1894, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1894) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call the Senate to order, under the \nprevious order, pursuant to the provisions of rule 19, paragraph 1(b), \nand ask that the proceedings be in accordance thereof for the purposes \nof consideration of the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID.

That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am saddened that this bill has been \ndelayed so far. There are inquiries now coming from Members who are in \nthe area affected by Hurricane Bertha. So I am quite hopeful that the \nSenate will proceed to consider this bill expeditiously.\n  I think Senator Inouye, who is the cochairman managing this bill, \nagrees with me that we could finish this bill today with the \ncooperation of the Senate. It is going to be my intention to urge the \nSenate to do that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4439\n\n(Purpose: A technical amendment to realign funds from Army and Defense \n Wide Operations and Maintenance accounts to the Overseas Contingency \n                       Operations Transfer Fund)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I, at this time, Mr. President, send to the desk a \ntechnical amendment to realign funds from the Army and Defense \noperation maintenance account, and ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4439.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 1, strike the number ``$17,700,859,000'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``$17,696,659,000''.\n       On page 9, line 11, strike the number ``$9,953,142,000'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``$9,887,142,000''.\n       On page 12, line 22, strike the number ``$1,069,957,000'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``1,140,157,000''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be temporarily laid aside so that we can proceed with our \nopening statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the passage of Senate bill 1745 \nyesterday, the National Defense Authorization Act for 1997, we are now \nturning to the consideration of the defense appropriations bill for \nnext year.\n  As I said, I believe the Senate can quickly dispose of this bill, \nwhich is Senate bill 1894. We have, in nearly every case, followed the \ninitiatives that have been adopted by the Senate in the authorization \nbill.\n  I know there are some individual objections to portions of the bill, \nbut as in the case last year when Senator Inouye and I presented an \noriginal bill to the Senate due to the need to complete preparations on \nthis bill prior to the July 4th recess, we could not be sure that the \nHouse version of the bill would pass in time for the Defense \nSubcommittee to take up that bill. This Senate bill passed the \nsubcommittee and full Appropriations Committee with only one minor \nadjustment, and reflects bipartisan work effort and total support by \nour Appropriations Committee.\n  Before turning to some of the details of the bill, I want to once \nagain this year express my appreciation to my good friend from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye. We have been partners in bringing this bill to the \nfloor of the Senate for many years. And, as I said, this bill again \nreflects our joint judgment.\n  In total, the bill accommodates the 602(b) allocations provided \npursuant to the joint budget resolution. The amount is $244.74 billion \nin new budget authority and $242.98 billion in outlays. Our bill before \nthe Senate, Mr. President, exactly meets those limits. The bill \nprovides for about $1 billion more than the level of appropriations for \n1996. But I call to the attention of the Senate that this bill includes \nall estimated funding for contingency operations such as Bosnia.\n  Again, that is another footnote to this bill. We have men and women \nin the field. We cannot afford to not get this bill passed by the \ndeadline of September 30. In order to get this bill through conference \nand back to the Senate in time that it can be presented to the \nPresident and hopefully have him sign it, and then have time to act \nbefore September 30 in the event that he does not decide to sign it, we \nhave to get this bill done. We have to get it to conference before the \nAugust recess.\n  We have worked to accommodate many of the priorities presented in the \nArmed Services bill. As I said, there are a few differences, however, \nthat I should note.\n  The bill provides $475 million for shortfalls in defense health \nprograms. Our subcommittee conducted a hearing in May on this subject. \nThe additions we have made fully cover the failure of the \nadministration to fully budget for health care for our military \npersonnel, their families and retirees.\n  Second, we provide an additional $180 million for the Bosnia \noperation through December 20 of this year. As I said, that is the \nestimate that reflects the DOD's current best estimate for the charges \nwhich will be incurred through the Presidential deadline for withdrawal \nof those troops.\n  Third, we provide $150 million for the Army's peer review breast \ncancer research program and $100 million for a new peer review prostate \ncancer research program. In both instances, we have substantial \ninvolvement of military personnel in those two dread diseases, and we \npropose to commit some of the Defense Department's money to proceed \nwith research to try to deal with those scourges.\n  We have proposed to continue the Department's support for the defense \nmissions of the Coast Guard and propose to transfer $300 million of the \nfunds involved, or at least the services that would be funded by that \nmoney, to the Coast Guard. This is the same level as is the case under \nthis current year, 1996. The transfer was $300 million.\n  We have included an additional $119 million in the counterdrug \nprogram. This was specifically requested by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the \nnew administration coordinator of the counterdrug program.\n  We have considered closely as well the statement of administration \npolicy concerning the House bill. The House bill was reviewed by the \nadministration. They have given us their comments, and this bill \nreflects a genuine effort on the part of our committee to address the \nconcerns raised by the President's senior advisers concerning \nprovisions of the House bill. We worked in preparing this bill to \nassess the real funding problems of the military and have sought to \nallocate the increase afforded by the congressional budget resolution \nto the most urgent personnel and operational requirements.\n  We next worked to fund the priorities identified by each of the \nservice chiefs. We took their counsel seriously, and this bill reflects \ntheir input. The statement of administration policy on this bill which \nwe received last night is really from the OMB, and it notes that some \nof the items in the bill are not included in the President's defense \nplan, and that is correct. Congress rejected for 1996 and again in 1997 \nthe reductions to defense spending proposed by the administration. The \nresolution adopted by Congress earlier this year provides $30 billion \nmore than President Clinton's budget for the fiscal years 1997, 1998, \n1999, and 2000.\n  In testimony before our subcommittee, each of the service chiefs \nhighlighted the shortfalls in their budget and provided the committee \nwith their priorities at our request. While not every item in this bill \nis included in the Clinton 5-year plan, virtually every major increase \nspecifically funds priorities identified by one of the service chiefs. \nAgain, I want to point out that was our request. It was not a \nvolunteered statement by the service chiefs, but we asked them to \nidentify their priorities, and we have funded, to the best of our \nability, the priorities identified by each of the service chiefs.\n  There are two specific increases not in the President's 5-year plan \nthat I want to highlight. First, we provided an additional $759 million \nto continue the modernization of the National Guard and Reserve. This \nannual bipartisan effort to meet the needs of the Reserve components \nshould be in this budget. It is right to do so. We need these funds to \nassure that we have an active Guard and Reserve component. We rely very \nheavily, more than at any\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\ntime in the past, on our Guard and Reserves.\n  Second, I joined Senator Dole, Senator Thurmond, Senator Lott, and \nmany others in recommending a significant increase in spending for \nnational missile defense. Now, the proposed increase in this bill \nreflects a balanced effort to accelerate these systems to counter the \ntheater and national threats, threats that our military and our Nation \nface today. For my State of Alaska, and I believe Hawaii also, \ndeploying a capable defense missile system is a pressing and immediate \npriority. A recent national intelligence estimate exempted Alaska and \nHawaii from its consideration of a national missile defense requirement \nand specifically stated that their estimate concerning the threat to \nthe United States could not be applied to Alaska and Hawaii. We are \nwithin the threat from existing systems now.\n\n  Senator Inouye and I have looked for opportunities to save the \ntaxpayers money in this bill, and let me point out that we have \nincluded new multiyear procurement authority for several systems, \nincluding the DTG-51 destroyer program. The Navy estimates that we will \nsave nearly $1 billion over the next 4 years on that destroyer alone. \nWe fully funded the C-17 multiyear contract which was authorized \nearlier this year.\n  Those and many more details of the bill are explained in our report \nwhich has been available to every Member of the Senate since June 21. \nThese were our objectives, and I hope the bill will enjoy support of a \nlarge bipartisan majority.\n  Again, I urge the Senate to proceed expeditiously on this bill. Let \nus finish it today. We have a series of amendments we are prepared to \naccept, and I think we can move along very quickly if we have the \ncooperation of the Senate to do so.\n  Let me turn now, Mr. President, to my good friend. I might state for \nthe information of the Senate that Senator Graham of Florida wished to \nmake a statement to introduce a bill. We wanted to lay down our bill as \nindicated under the agreement, but it is my intention to yield such \ntime, following the comments of the Senator from Hawaii, to Senator \nGraham so he might make a statement, introduce a bill, on the condition \nwe recover the floor as soon he has completed his statement.\n  Let me, if I may, yield the floor to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Chair.\n  I begin by commending our subcommittee chairman, the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for putting together what I \nconsider to be a very good bill, a bill that all of us should and could \nsupport.\n  As the chairman indicated, last month the Senate adopted the \nconference report on the budget resolution, and that measure directed \nthe Appropriations Committee to increase defense budget authority by \n$11.2 billion. The subcommittee's share of that increase is $10.1 \nbillion. Chairman Stevens, acting in conjunction with the subcommittee, \nwas tasked to determine how this increase should be allocated. I \nbelieve, as my colleagues review the bill, they will see that the \nsubcommittee, under the leadership of Senator Stevens, used this \nincrease very judiciously.\n  The bill provides many improvements to the administration's budget \nrequests. For example, the bill increases funding for operation and \nmaintenance by $500 million to protect readiness. We speak of \nreadiness, Mr. President. This is necessary if we are to implement \nreadiness. It includes such items as $280 million for barracks \nrenovation and repair; $150 million for ship depot maintenance and to \nfund 95 percent of the Navy's identified requirements; $148 million for \nidentified contingency costs, as the chairman clearly pointed out, in \nthe case of Bosnia; and $119 million for the President's counterdrug \ninitiative; $50 million to clean up the environment, protect endangered \nspecies.\n  We also add $590 million, Mr. President, to fully fund health care \ncosts identified by the Surgeon General and DOD Health Affairs \nSecretary. This will allow our men and women in uniform access to \nhealth care that they deserve.\n  Third, as the chairman pointed out, we recommend $150 million for \nbreast cancer research, $100 million for prostate cancer research, and \n$15 million for AIDS research. I think all of us can be very proud of \nwhat the Army Institute of Research has done in the area of AIDS.\n  The bill also provides $300 million for the defense missions of the \nCoast Guard.\n  Fifth, the chairman has added $40 million to examine alternative \ntechnologies to dispose of chemical weapons. Mr. President, this bill \nhas fully provided for the pay and allowances of our military \npersonnel, including a 3-percent pay raise and a 4-percent increase in \nquarters allowances.\n\n  One can gain an appreciation from these few examples that the \ncommittee has responded to the needs of our men and women in uniform. \nThe bill also provides $44.1 billion for procurement of equipment, \nwhich is an increase of $6 billion above the request of the President. \nThis increase will provide for many of the high-priority needs \nidentified by our commanders in the field. But the total is still $1.7 \nbillion below the level recommended by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  As the committee reported the bill, this bill adds $525 million to \ninitiate a 4-year multiyear contract for the Navy's Aegis destroyer \nprogram. According to the Navy, this recommendation will save our \ntaxpayers $1 billion.\n  This bill also adds $163 million to improve the Navy's EA-6B \nelectronic jamming aircraft, and this will allow the Air Force to \nretire the EF-111, saving hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Funding of $759 million is included for equipment for our National \nGuard and Reserve forces to the level authorized by the Armed Services \nCommittee. Our Guard and Reserve commanders will decide what specific \nequipment to purchase.\n  The funding added by the committee for modernization responds to the \nconcerns expressed by many of our military leaders that action is \nneeded to ensure our forces are equipped with the world's best \nequipment. This bill also provides the level approved by the Senate for \nballistic missile defense, $3.4 billion. While some of my colleagues \nmay oppose this, I note that the Senate voted for this level last \nmonth.\n  The administration identified several issues in the House bill that \nit opposes. The committee has responded to nearly all of its concerns, \nrejecting restrictive legislative provisions and funding administrative \npriorities.\n  Chairman Stevens has done a masterful job in keeping this bill clean. \nIt safeguards our national defense and the priorities of the Senate, \nand rejects controversial riders. As I indicated in my opening, this is \na very good bill and I am strongly in favor of his recommendations. I \nsincerely believe it should have the bipartisan support of the Senate.\n  In closing, may I note the following. I am certain there are many in \nthis Chamber who will criticize the fact that we have appropriated \nfunds over and above the amount requested by the administration. For \nthat matter, I should note if it were not for this subcommittee, the C-\n17 program would be dead. Today it is hailed by all as being the big \nworking ship, the ship that is necessary, the plane that will carry the \ncargo for us. If it were not for Chairman Stevens and this \nsubcommittee, the V-22 Osprey would be a dead bird. It is now \nconsidered the highest priority by the Marines.\n  The great hero of Desert Storm was the F-117, the Stealth fighter, \nthe fighter that was able to knock out all the radar stations that made \nit possible for our bombers to come in. If it were not for this \nsubcommittee, the F-117 would not have been operating in Desert Storm.\n  I would say we can take full credit for insisting upon modernizing \nthe National Guard airlift with the C-130-H after the Air Force \ncanceled that. Here is another historic footnote. If it were not for \nthe action of this subcommittee, in all likelihood the central command \nwould have been wiped out in 1990, just before Desert Storm. And we \nwould have retired General Schwarzkopf just before Desert Storm.\n\n  I think we can take credit for saving the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences.\n  This subcommittee was instrumental in upgrading the Patriot missile \nprogram, a program that we were ready to wipe out. It was not perfect, \nbut the\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nPatriot saved many American lives during Desert Storm.\n  So I just wanted to note a few of these items to indicate that, yes, \nwe have taken the initiative to recommend items over and above that \nrequested by the administration because, in our judgment, we felt these \nsteps had to be taken. With that, once again I congratulate my chairman \nfor having done a tremendous job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing persons assisting the defense subcommittee be afford the \nprivilege of access to Senate floor during consideration of this bill, \nS. 1894: Susan Hogan, Darryl Roberson, Candice Rogers, Mike Gilmore. \nThere will be another list I will submit.

Mr. President, today the Senate will consider S. 640, the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1996. This measure, similar to water \nresources legislation enacted in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992, is \ncomprised of water resources project and study authorizations and \npolicy modifications for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works \nProgram.\n  S. 640 was introduced on March 28, 1995, and was reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to the full Senate on November \n9, 1995.\n  Since that time, additional project and policy requests have been \npresented to the committee. Some have come from our Senate colleagues--\nmany have come from the administration.\n  We have carefully reviewed each such request and include those that \nare consistent with the committee's criteria in the manager's amendment \nbeing considered along with S. 640 today. Mr. President, let me take a \nfew moments here to discuss these criteria--that is--the criteria used \nby the committee to judge project authorization requests.\n  On November 17, 1986, almost 10 years ago, President Reagan enacted \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Importantly, the 1986 act \nmarked an end to the 16-year deadlock between Congress and the \nexecutive branch regarding authorization of the Army Corps Civil Works \nprogram.\n  In addition to authorizing numerous projects, the 1986 act resolved \nlongstanding disputes relating to cost-sharing between the Army Corps \nand non-Federal sponsors, waterway user fees, environmental \nrequirements and, importantly, the types of projects in which Federal \ninvolvement is appropriate and warranted.\n  The criteria used to develop the legislation before us are consistent \nwith the reforms and procedures established in the landmark Water \nResources Development Act of 1986.\n  Is a project for flood control, navigation, or some other purpose \ncost-shared in a manner consistent with the 1986 act?\n  Have all of the requisite reports and studies on economic, \nengineering and environmental feasibility been completed for a project?\n  Is a project consistent with the traditional and appropriate mission \nof the Army Corps?\n  Should the Federal Government be involved?\n  These, Mr. President, are the fundamental questions that we have \napplied to each and every project included here for authorization.\n  As I noted at the outset, water resources legislation has been \nenacted on a biennial basis since 1986, with the exception of 1994. As \nsuch, we have a 4-year backlog of projects reviewed by the Army Corps \nand submitted to Congress for authorization. Since 1993, the committee \nhas received more than 250 project and study requests totaling an \nestimated $6.5 billion.\n  This legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Army to construct 32 \nprojects for flood control, port development, inland navigation, storm \ndamage reduction and environmental restoration. The bill also modifies \n39 existing Army Corps projects, authorizes 27 project studies, and \neliminates portions of 15 projects from consideration for future \nfunding.\n  Also included are other project-specific and general provisions \nrelated to Army Corps operations. Among them is a provision to \nauthorize borrowing authority in amounts sufficient to cover the full \ncosts of modernizing the Washington Aqueduct water treatment facility. \nIn total, this bill authorizes an estimated Federal cost of $3.3 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, S. 640 contains important policy changes. First, we \nhave included a provision proposed by the administration to clarify the \ncost-sharing for dredged material disposal associated with the \noperation and maintenance of Federal channels.\n  Currently, Federal and non-Federal responsibilities for construction \nof dredged material disposal facilities vary from project to project, \ndepending on when the project was authorized, and the method or site \nselected for disposal.\n  For some projects, the costs of providing dredged material disposal \nfacilities are all Federal. For others, the non-Federal sponsor bears \nthe entire cost of constructing disposal facilities. This arrangement \nis inequitable for numerous ports.\n  In addition, the failure to identify economically and environmentally \nacceptable disposal options has reduced operations and increased cargo \ncosts in many port cities. Regrettably, this is the case for the Port \nof Providence in Rhode Island.\n  Under this provision, the costs of constructing dredged material \ndisposal facilities will be shared in accordance with the cost-sharing \nformulas established for general navigation features by section 101(a) \nof the 1986 Water Resources Development Act. This would apply to all \nmethods of dredged material disposal including open water, upland and \nconfined.\n  We have also expanded section 1135 of the 1986 Act in this bill. \nCurrently, section 1135 authorizes the Secretary of the Army to review \nthe structure and operation of existing projects for possible \nmodifications--at the project itself--which will improve the quality of \nthe environment. The 1986 act authorizes a $5 million Federal cost-\nsharing cap for each such project and a $25 million annual cap for the \nentire program.\n  The provision included in this bill does not increase the existing \ndollar limits. Instead, it authorizes the Secretary to implement small \nfish and wildlife habitat restoration projects in cooperation with non-\nFederal interests in those situations where mitigation is required off \nof project lands.\n  Third, we have included a provision to shift certain dam safety \nresponsibilities from the Army Corps to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA]. This change, proposed by Senator Bond and \nsupported by the two agencies, authorizes a total of $22 million over 5 \nyears for FEMA to conduct\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\ndam safety inspections and to provide technical assistance to the \nStates.\n  Also included here is a provision which addresses the \nadministration's proposal to discontinue Army Corps involvement with \nshore protection projects. The provision amends existing law to \nspecifically include beach protection, restoration and renourishment \namong shoreline protection activities traditionally performed by the \nArmy Corps. I plan to work with Senators Mack, Bradley, and others to \nbuild on this provision as S. 640 advances.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes Everglades restoration \nprovisions. On June 11 of this year, the administration submitted its \nproposal to restore and protect the Everglades.\n  While I join Senators Mack, Graham and many others in support of Army \nCorps efforts to reverse damage done to this important natural \nresource, I was unable to support certain elements of the \nadministration's proposal.\n  In particular, I am unable to endorse a blanket authorization for \nfuture projects needed to restore water flows and water quality. It is \nnot responsible to leap blindly into this important initiative, by \nauthorizing unlimited funding, without knowing what the overall costs \nwill be.\n  Instead, we have provided an expedited process for project \ndevelopment, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, that \nwill preserve the current momentum for restoration. I look forward to \nworking with the Florida delegation and the administration on this \ninitiative as the bill advances.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me state clearly that a provision \nsubmitted by the administration to modify cost-sharing for the \nconstruction of flood control projects has not been included.\n  In summary, the administration has proposed that the current cost-\nsharing ratio of 75 percent Federal and 25 percent non-Federal be \nchanged to an even 50-50 cost-share.\n  This proposal has been made for budgetary reasons. However, we have \nnot been presented with any estimates on resulting budget savings in \nthe outyears. We do not know how much money, if any, this proposal \nwould save in the long run.\n  Moreover, we do not know what impact this cost-sharing change would \nhave on the flood control program. While I support the general notion \nof increasing non-Federal involvement for these types of projects, I \ncannot support this significant change to the 1986 act without knowing \nthe long-range effects.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is vitally important for countless \nStates and communities across the country.\n  For economic and life-safety reasons, we must maintain our harbors, \nports and inland waterways, our flood control levees and shorelines, \nand the environment.\n  Despite the fact that this package represents a 4-year backlog of \nproject authorizations, it is consistent with the overall funding \nlevels authorized in previous water resources measures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is about to consider the Water \nResources Development Act of 1996. This is an important bill. A great \ndeal of work has been done to get this legislation to the floor today. \nEveryone involved in this process has been diligent in assuring that \nonly worthy projects are included. Sound criteria have been \nconsistently applied so that each project has a Federal interest and a \ngood benefit to cost ratio.\n  But I have a larger concern about this bill. It is the issue of our \nspending priorities. Briefly stated, at a time when we are trying to \ncut spending in order to balance the budget, we should not be \nauthorizing so much new spending on water resource projects.\n  This legislation authorizes more than $3.3 billion in new Federal \nspending. And while investing in our infrastructure, including \nnavigation, flood control, coastal and storm protection, is important, \nit is not the only demand being made on our taxpayers.\n  We are in the midst of one of the most critical balancing acts in our \nNation's history--balancing the budget. We are facing some very tough \nchoices. The question facing us is whether modernizing an existing lock \nis more important than protecting Medicare, or whether deepening an \nexisting channel will be of greater benefit to the people of this \ncountry than promoting education programs?\n  Less than a month ago, the Senate passed a budget resolution that \nwould cut funding for the Army Corps of engineers by nearly $1 billion \nover the next 5 years. Yet this bill adds more than $3 billion in new \nspending for the corps.\n  How can we ever get the budget in balance if we continue to say yes \nto projects we do not have the money to build? How will we ever get to \nbalance if one day we vote to cut spending and the next day we vote to \nincrease spending?\n  In my judgment, while the projects in this bill are largely worthy \nones, we simply cannot afford them.\n\n\n finding a solution to the flooding of the james river in south dakota\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since 1993 the James River has flooded \nnearly 3 million acres of valuable farmland in my State. This flooding \nhas cost South Dakota producers millions of dollars in lost revenue and \ngreatly diminished the value of their land by washing away valuable \ntopsoil.\n  Clearly, the extreme wet conditions of the last 4 years have \ncontributed to these floods. However, Mother Nature does not bear sole \nresponsibility for the flooding. The problem has been exacerbated by \nthe James River management policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Mr. President, it is unfair and unacceptable to ask producers to \ncontinue to bear economic losses that could be mitigated by a more \nreasonable corps river management policy. In recognition of this fact, \nI recently introduced legislation that, among other things, would \nensure that South Dakotans are included in the revision process of the \nJamestown dam and Pipestem dam operations manuals. By assuring \nconsideration of down river interests in South Dakota, this legislation \nwould provide landowners along the James River with a measure of \nsecurity against future high water flows and induce the Federal \nGovernment to assume greater responsibility for the damaging effects of \nits river management policies.\n  Specifically, this legislation would give landowners the opportunity \nto sell easements on their land to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if \nthey so desire. Local producers who wish to grant these easements not \nonly will be reimbursed for the loss of productivity on their flooded \nland, but also will retain their haying and grazing rights. Thus, the \nland will continue to provide value to farmers in relatively dry years. \nThose who do not wish to grant the corps these easements will be under \nno obligation to do so.\n  It was my intention to attach this legislation to the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, which was developed by the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. While receptive to this approach, the committee \nexpressed its desire to allow the corps to examine a range of \nsolutions, including structural and nonstructural efforts, to reduce \nthe flooding and/or mitigate the damage suffered by landowners. I \nappreciate the desire to examine all options before settling on a final \nsolution, as long as this evaluation is accomplished in a reasonable \nperiod of time and includes a review of the use of easements.\n  During committee deliberations, Senator Pressler objected to the \ninclusion of language explicitly directing the corps to evaluate the \npurchase of easements from willing sellers. While I would have \npreferred to include such language in the bill, the compromise \nprovision directs the corps to examine all options, including the \npurchase of easements from willing sellers. It is my expectation and \nunderstanding that the corps will assess the feasibility of allowing \nSouth Dakotans to sell easements, and thus gain some financial relief, \nas one means of mitigating the damage caused by the flooding, as part \nof its evaluation of structural and nonstructural solutions to the \nflooding and its associated damage.\n  The Water Resources Development Act should set in motion a process \nthat will lead to the corps providing relief to landowners affected by \nthe frequent flooding of the James River in South Dakota. This problem \nwill only be solved through a number of actions, including, I hope, \nboth allowing the landowners along the river to sell easements to the \ncorps and changing the\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\noverall management of the Jamestown and Pipestem dams. I will continue \nto urge the corps to take seriously the concerns of South Dakotans as \nthis process continues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to discuss a specific provision in \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1996 which addresses the \nWashington Aqueduct--the public water system for the Metropolitan \nWashington area that is owned by the Federal Government and \nadministered by the Corps of Engineers.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the conditions at the Washington \nAqueduct gained national attention when the Environmental Protection \nAgency issued a boil-water order in December 1993 for the Metropolitan \nWashington region. There was significant concern that the water supply \nfor the Nation's Capital was contaminated. Thankfully, extensive \ntesting conducted by the EPA and independent authorities concluded \nequipment failure followed by human error affected the results of the \nwater quality testing. While, there was no contamination, it was a loud \nwake-up call for the region.\n  I commend the Environmental Protection Agency for their precautionary \nsteps and quick response to this situation. This incident brought to \nlight the significant capital improvements that are needed at the \nfacility to meet current Federal drinking water standards.\n  While the Washington Aqueduct provides a local service to the \nDistrict of Columbia and northern Virginia jurisdictions, this system \nis owned by the Federal Government and it is critical to providing \nservices to the Congress and other Federal facilities in the region. \nSince 1853, all activities relating to the maintenance and operation of \nthe system have been administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  In an effort to accelerate the needed capital improvements to the \nsystem, I authored legislation to grant the Corps of Engineers access \nto borrowing from the Treasury to underwrite the cost of these \nimprovements. This approach did not relieve the local water customers \nof any of their existing responsibilities. The customers of the \nWashington Aqueduct--the District of Columbia, and the Virginia \njurisdictions of Arlington and Falls Church--would continue to bear all \nthe costs of these improvements through higher water rates. This \nadditional revenue would be used to repay the loans from the Treasury \nover a reasonable period of time.\n  Mr. President, that is a description of my earlier proposal to \nrespond to the situations at the Washington Aqueduct. I regret that in \nthe 2 years that I have been pursuing this approach the administration \ncontinues to oppose this solution. The administration's proposal is \nsimply to dispose of this antiquated facility.\n  I strongly reject that position because it fails to address any of \nthe legitimate issues at hand. First, I believe the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to ensure an uninterrupted, safe supply of \ndrinking water to the Federal community, including the Congress. \nSecond, if the corps and the customers decide to explore the potential \nfor non-Federal ownership, we must devise a workable approach that \nenables the capital improvement program to go forward.\n  Although I have serious reservations about transferring ownership to \na non-Federal entity because of the potential to expose the system to \nterrorist actions, I want to move forward with modernizing the system. \nThis legislation ensures that critically needed capital improvements \nare made and sets forth a framework which allows the corps and the \naqueduct customers to reach agreement on the future of the Washington \nAqueduct. Again, at no cost to the Federal Government.\n  The approach in the Chairman's amendment accomplishes that goal and I \nappreciate his support.\n  Mr. SIMON. Is the chairman aware that the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers Division Restructuring Plan calls for the closure of the \nNorth Central Division Office, in Chicago, IL? My colleague and I are \nparticularly concerned that the Great Lakes region is losing skilled \npersonnel at a time when waterway issues are requiring the increased \nattention of the corps.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I might add that it simply does not make sense to \nhave Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, and Upper Mississippi River issues \nhandled by an office that not only has no institutional knowledge and \nexpertise in these areas, but also is not even located in the Great \nLakes basin.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have indeed seen a draft of the Army corps \nrestructuring plan. I believe it is true that the restructuring plan \ninvolves closure of the North Central Division Office.\n  Mr. SIMON. The chairman is also aware that in response to the \nrestructuring plan we sought to include language in the Senate version \nof the Water Resources Development Act, S. 640, to preclude the closure \nof the North Central Division Office.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Indeed, you both have been diligent in that regard. I \nhave been reluctant to include the proposed amendment here because I \nbelieve it is a matter better dealt with on the relevant appropriations \nlegislation. It is my understanding, however, that there are plans to \ninclude similar language in the House version of the WRDA bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Should similar language be adopted in the House, \nwill you commit to giving it your close and careful consideration in \nconference?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Indeed. I would, however, like to work carefully with the \nchairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Domenici, as his subcommittee had jurisdiction \nover the original language that mandated the restructuring plan.\n  Mr. SIMON. I sympathize with your concerns over the jurisdictional \nissue. It is my understanding, however, that Senator Domenici does not \nobject to our addressing this problem on the WRDA bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I am pleased we could work together. My colleague \nand I appreciate your assistance on a matter of critical importance to \nthe State of Illinois.\n\n\n                      dam safety amendment to wrda\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Chairman Chafee \nand Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner, chairman of the subcommittee of \njurisdiction for their efforts to put together this very difficult \nlegislation. Flood damage prevention and navigation are of particular \nimportance to the people of Missouri given our unique reliance on the \ninland waterway system. Both the benefits of this system and its \nshortfalls have been highlighted by the recent record flood events in \n1993 and again this spring. Though substantial progress has been made, \nthere remains much hard work to be completed.\n  Of considerable concern to me are the crippling effects the \nPresident's budget is placing on our Nation's effort to protect lives \nand property from flooding. Clearly, the President does not consider \nthe missions of flood control and navigation to be a priority and \nthrough various policy positions and inadequate funding requests, our \ninland waterway system, the economic activity that depends on it, and \nthe people who live near it are at risk. Those of us who represent \nregions that rely on flood protection and the competitive international \ntrade advantages provided by the critical corps navigation programs \nmust continue to oppose the administration's intention to let them \nwither on the vine.\n  This legislation includes an important Missouri project and many \nothers. Since 1928, the corps has spent $33 billion for flood control \nprojects. In that time, $275 billion in damages have been prevented. \nThis does not account for the massive economic development that flood \nprotection permits. I would have thought the political leadership of \nthe administration would be trying to promote these important missions \nof safety, economic development, and international competitiveness \ninstead of trying to undermine the successful mission and efforts of \nthe Corps of Engineers.\n  The cheapest way to move a ton of grain in the world is by barge on \nthe Mississippi River. Senators who are concerned about \ncompetitiveness, promoting trade opportunities, protecting jobs, and \ngrowing the economy recognize the benefits of promoting water resources \non our inland waterway system. Half our Nation's grain is shipped by \nbarge and this cost advantage contributes to the fact that we are \nexpecting a record $60 billion in agricultural exports this year with a \n$30 billion trade surplus. As I have said before,\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\ntrying to update our water infrastructure to capture the growing Asian \nmarket is not pork as OMB would suggest--``its the economy, stupid.''\n  On another matter, I am very proud to have included in the managers \npackage of amendments language I drafted to encourage more effective \napproaches to dam safety. As people in Missouri know well, the power of \nwater and its potential for causing loss of life and property is a \nprofound reality. The National Inventory of Dams includes roughly \n75,000 dams. Over 95 percent of these dams are State regulated. Of \nthese dams, over 9,000 are considered ``State high hazard'' dams which \nmeans that dam failure may result in significant loss of life or \nproperty. Many of these dams are considered ``unsafe'', or susceptible \nto failure due to deficiencies.\n  Thousands of citizens in every State are dependent on dams for water \nsupply, flood control, irrigation, and recreation. High safety \nstandards for these dams can keep them from failing and causing \ndevastating environmental and property damage, economic hardships, and, \nin the worst case, loss of life. My State of Missouri has 3,500 dams on \nthe inventory of which 650 are high hazard.\n  Deterioration of the infrastructure is a major concern and problems \nincrease as dams decay with age. It has been determined that the life \nof a dam is 50 years. The majority of dams in this country are quickly \napproaching this age and rehabilitation of these structures is a major \nconcern. In 1994 alone, 273 documented failures occurred across the \nNation. This included 250 during the Georgia flood where lives were \nlost and where States reported downstream repair costs of over $50 \nmillion. In the 1970's, a dam failure in Idaho cost 11 lives and a West \nVirginia dam failure was responsible for killing 125 people.\n  Recent studies by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials show \nthat about half the States have shown program improvement progress \nwhile half have either remained constant or regressed in the last 10 \nyears. With the recent economic climate, even those State programs \nshowing improvement are struggling to keep up with growing \nresponsibilities.\n  There is currently no statutory national dam safety program. Two laws \nenacted by previous Congresses have since expired. The Federal \nEmergency Management Agency coordinates the implementation of \nguidelines pursuant to Executive order to implement a program to \nencourage coordination among Federal and State dam safety personnel and \nactivities but a more aggressive partnership is needed.\n  The legislation reauthorizes several previously enacted provisions \nand codifies the interagency working groups who have expertise in \nissues of dam safety. The lead agency will be FEMA, whose stated goal \nis ``to make mitigation the cornerstone of the Federal multi-hazard \nemergency management system.'' This approach promotes a focus on taking \nrelatively inexpensive preventative approaches that can preclude \nexpensive and fatal disasters.\n  The legislation authorizes matching funds of up to $4 million per \nyear over 5 years as an incentive for States to adopt dam safety \nprograms. It further authorizes research in dam safety technology to \ndiscover methods to make new dams more reliable; to assess more \nreliably the condition of existing dams; and to prolong the reliable \nlife of existing dams. Also included are funds to train State dam \ninspectors. In short, this program is meant to share the considerable \nlevel of Federal expertise and modest dollars to maximize the \neffectiveness of States to improve their programs and reduce exposure \nto dam failure.\n  This incentive and partnership-based approach is not a Federal \nmandate and does not interfere with the Federal responsibility to \nensure the safety of Federal dams. It does not provide for Federal \ninspection of non-Federal dams and does not authorize any funds for \nconstruction and rehabilitation which explicitly and appropriately \nremain the responsibility of the States.\n  This approach has the support of the Federal agencies, the National \nGovernors Association, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials \nwho brought these recommendations to the Congress, the National \nAssociation of Civil Engineers, and others.\n  I am pleased to note that the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure adopted companion language in their markup of WRDA \nlegislation on June 30.\n  I thank representatives of the ASDSO and ASCE for working closely and \ndiligently with my office in pursuit of these commonsense provisions to \nimprove dam safety. Brad Iarossi with the Maryland Department of \nNatural Resources has been of invaluable assistance as this process has \nmoved forward. Again, I appreciate the assistance of Chairman Chafee, \nChairman Warner and Senator Baucus and their able staff in bringing \nthis legislation before the Senate.\n\n\n              Lower Fox River Sediment Remediation Project\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the chairman of the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee is well aware of the concerns that Senator \nFeingold and I have raised about the concentration of contaminated \nsediments in the Lower Fox River of Wisconsin.\n  As a result of a high concentration of PCB's and other toxic \npollutants in the sediment of the Lower Fox River, the area has been \ndesignated by the International Joint Commission as 1 of 43 toxic \nhotspots in the Great Lakes. Most of these 43 hotspot areas are \ncharacterized by contamination which cannot be cleaned up through \nexisting routine programs. Because the contaminated sediments at these \nsites oftentimes disperse throughout the Great Lakes ecosystem, it is \nbelieved that remediation is critical for environmental restoration of \nthe Great Lakes.\n  The Fox River is known to be the biggest source of PCB loadings into \nGreen Bay, a fact which has been documented by the Green Bay mass \nbalance study conducted by EPA between 1988 and 1992. Further, it is \nbelieved that the Fox River may also be the biggest source of PCB \ncontamination to Lake Michigan. Specifically, the Green Bay mass \nbalance study, conducted by EPA, estimated the volume of contaminated \nsediment with high concentrations of PCB's to be 7 to 9 million cubic \nmeters. It is clear that the potential for continued dispersion of the \nsediments throughout the Great Lakes ecosystem is great.\n  To address the problem, a partnership has been formed in Wisconsin \nwhere the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, local governments, \nPOTW's and area businesses are working together to analyze and \ncharacterize the contamination, and to plan for the remediation of the \nsites. Given the urgency of the clean up, the group is seeking to \nproceed with remediation using a consensus-based process, in order to \navoid any delays that may be associated with litigation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I concur with the Senator from Wisconsin's \ncharacterization of the urgency of clean up on the Lower Fox River. Not \nonly is the contamination from the Fox River believed to be the biggest \nsource of PCB loading to Lake Michigan, but it may easily become the \nbiggest source of contamination for the entire Great Lakes system. It \nis widely understood that a large storm event in the region could \nresuspend those contaminated sediments in the Fox River to disperse \npollutants more broadly into the food chain of the Great Lakes.\n  I would ask the chairman of the Environment Committee if he would \nagree that there is an urgent need for clean up at the Fox River site, \nand that a consensus-based clean up process should be encouraged?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would say to both Senators from Wisconsin that I share \ntheir concern about the contaminated sediment problems in the Fox \nRiver. I agree that there does appear to be an urgent need for cleanup. \nFurther, I would agree that a consensus-based process for remediation \nshould be encouraged, and may lead to a more timely remediation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Given the urgent need for remediation, Senator Feingold and \nI had requested that the Committee authorize the Corps of Engineers to \nhelp in the clean up of the Fox River, thereby becoming a partner in \nthe effort to remediate the contamination using a consensus-based \nprocess. Specifically, we requested that the Lower Fox River sediment \nremediation project be authorized under Section 312(b) of the 1990 \nWater Resources Development Act (P.L. 101-640), which authorizes funds \nfor environmental dredging projects within and adjacent to ongoing Army\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nCorps navigation projects. The Fox River is currently an authorized \ncorps project. Long-range Army Corps plans include a continued corps \ninvolvement in the ongoing operation and maintenance of the water \nregulation portion of the project. However, the Army Corps does not \nmaintain the waterway for navigation purposes and has recommended an \nend to its role in the navigation portion of the project. The corps is \ncurrently in negotiations with the State of Wisconsin to effect \ndeauthorization of navigation.\n  In response to my and Senator Feingold's request to authorize the \nArmy Corps to clean up the contaminated sediments along the Fox River, \nChairman Chafee and other members of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works expressed strong reservations. I wonder if the chairman \nwould discuss briefly his concern with our proposal.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senators from Wisconsin have indeed been diligent \nwith regard to including a provision in this bill to address the Fox \nRiver matter. However, I am convinced that under these circumstances, \nassigning the Army Corps with these responsibilities is inappropriate.\n  While it is true that existing water resources law authorizes the \nSecretary of the Army to remove contaminated sediments in conjunction \nwith operation and maintenance of ongoing navigation projects, the law \nestablishes conditions which must first be met. First, section 311 (c) \nof the 1990 WRDA requires a joint plan to be developed by the Secretary \nof the Army and interested Federal, State, and local officials. \nRegrettably, we do not have such a plan for the Lower Fox River. \nSecond, it is required that the remediation be done, as stated a moment \nago, in connection with ongoing operation and maintenance of a \nnavigation project. It is my understanding that the corps no longer \nperforms operation and maintenance activities along the Lower Fox. \nThird, the law requires that the method to be used for dredged material \ndisposal and the specific responsibilities of the Secretary and other \ninvolved parties be provided prior to authorization. The 1990 Water \nResources Development Act also requires that sources of funding for the \nwork be identified. Again, regrettably, none of these conditions are \nmet with respect to the Lower Fox.\n  Without having a clear understanding of the exact responsibilities of \nthe Secretary, I would also be concerned about potential liability \nproblems the corps might face once they get involved.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I know that the Senator is aware that a provision was \nincluded in the House version of the water resources bill authorizing \nthe Lower Fox River sediment remediation project. I would ask for the \nSenator's commitment to give that provision strong consideration in \nconference, or to work with Senator Kohl and myself to find another \nvehicle to address this urgent matter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will say to the Senators from Wisconsin that I will \ngive the House Fox River provision my strong consideration in \nconference, and will continue to work with them to find the most \nappropriate way to address the pressing contamination problems of the \nFox River.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, included in S. 640, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, is a provision which provides for the reallocation of \na sufficient amount of existing water supply storage space in Broken \nBow Lake to support the Mountain Fork trout fishery on a permanent \nbasis. The bill also requires releases of water from Broken Bow Lake to \nbe undertaken at no expense to the State of Oklahoma to mitigate the \nloss of fish and wildlife resources in the Mountain Fork River as \nrecommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation [ODWC] began \nstocking trout in 12 miles of the lower Mountain Fork river in December \n1988. I worked on legislation in 1992, Public Law 102-580, section \n102(v), which authorized the reallocation of unobligated water supply \nstorage for the purpose of maintaining the trout fishery. As a result, \nit is estimated the trout fishery generates over $1 million annually in \naggregate benefits to the economy of southeastern Oklahoma.\n  It is the intention of this bill that water releases be made from the \nMountain Fork Dam to mitigate the loss of 26 miles of high-quality \nsmall mouth bass waters destroyed when the Broken Bow Dam was \nconstructed. A 1960 U.S. Fish and Wildlife mitigation recommendation \nfor a 100 cubic-feet-per-second instantaneous release from Broken Bow \nDam is being released approximately 8 miles downstream and gauged 12 \nmiles downstream rather than at the dam, as originally recommended. \nWith slight modification, implementation of the 1960 USFWS mitigation \nrecommendation would provide releases necessary to maintain the fishery \nin its present capacity.\n  Under a reasonable worst-case scenario, maintaining the Mountain Fork \nfishery requires release of approximately 38,454 acre-feet through the \nspillway and 41,259 acre-feet released through hydro generation. It is \nmy understanding that over 90 percent of Broken Bow water storage \ncapacity is uncontracted. Thus, mitigating the loss of the small mouth \nbass fishery through maintenance of the trout fishery does not \nadversely affect the water supply needs of local municipalities or \nhydro generation.\n  Finally, it is not the intent of this legislation to interrupt \nmaintenance of the Mountain Fork trout fishery as it has been \nmaintained since 1992. The purpose of this legislation is to partially \nmitigate the loss of fish and wildlife resources in the Mountain Fork \nRiver as recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional \nDirector in 1960.\n  The Mountain Fork trout fishery could not be properly maintained \nwithout cooperation between the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife \nConservation, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Southwestern Power \nAdministration. I, along with the people of McCurtain County, \nappreciate their hard work to maintain this project.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this water resources bill includes many \nprovisions of great importance. Perhaps none of the provisions is more \nimportant to the State of Wisconsin than the transfer of land in the \nKickapoo River Valley from the Corps of Engineers to the State of \nWisconsin, for the purpose of creating the Kickapoo Valley Reserve.\n  We in the Senate spend a great deal of time arguing about the \nappropriate role of the Federal Government. I know that my colleagues \nof all ideological stripes can list specific instances in which Federal \nintervention has caused undue pain and suffering to individuals or \ncommunities. Today with this bill, and the Kickapoo Valley, WI, \nprovision included therein, we have begun the process of rectifying a \nwrong that was done the people of Southwestern Wisconsin 3 decades ago.\n  In the mid 1960s, Congress authorized the Corps of Engineers to build \na flood control dam on the Kickapoo River at LaFarge in Vernon County, \nWI. In order to proceed with the project, the Corp of Engineers \ncondemned 140 farms covering an area of about 8,500 acres. To LaFarge, \na community of only 840 people, the loss of these farms dealt a \nsignificant economic and emotional blow.\n  With the loss of economic activity, the community eagerly awaited the \ncompletion of the dam, and the creation of a lake that promised to \nprovide some economic benefits in the form of recreational and tourism \nactivities. But because of budgetary and environmental concerns, the \nproject never happened. And the people of LaFarge were left holding the \nbag.\n  But the passage of this bill today represents a milestone in the \ncooperative effort of the citizens of the Kickapoo River Valley, the \nState of Wisconsin, the Ho Chunk Nation, and local environmental \nleaders to turn this bad situation into an outstanding success for the \ncommunity, the State, and the Federal taxpayers.\n  The Kickapoo Valley, WI, provision of this water resources bill would \nmodify the original LaFarge Dam authorization, returning the federally \ncondemned property to the State of Wisconsin. Anticipating this action, \nthe State legislature and Governor Thompson have already acted to \nauthorize the use of this 8,500 property as a State recreational and \nenvironmental management area. Further, in recognition of the cultural \nand religious significance of this area to the Ho Chunk People, \nagreement has been reached with the Ho Chunk Nation to transfer\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nup to 1,200 acres of that area to the Secretary of Interior in trust \nfor the Ho Chunk Nation.\n  While this legislation does not include all of the things that my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and I have wanted in terms \nof funding for infrastructure improvements in the area, it does address \nthe most crucial aspect of this matter, which is the land transfer. \nThis measure is long overdue, and it is my sincere pleasure to be able \nto return this remarkable piece of property back to local control.\n\n\n                         columbia river channel\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the top marine transportation priority \nfor my region is the project to deepen the Columbia River deep-draft \nchannel from 40 to 43 feet. Local sponsors of the project include three \nOregon ports: Astoria, Portland, and St. Helens; and four Washington \nports: Longview, Kalama, Woodland, and Vancouver. The project enjoys \nstrong support within the Oregon and Washington congressional \ndelegations.\n  Port and regional interest is so keen because some of the ships \ncalling in the Columbia River now exceed the 40-foot draft of the \nexisting channel. If the channel comes to be viewed in the world \nshipping community as too shallow for the larger, more efficient \nvessels, our region's reliance on trade and distribution as economic \nmainstays will be at risk.\n  On June 27, Mr. President, the biggest container vessel ever to call \nin the Columbia River, the Ever Ultra, took on more than 2,100 \ncontainers in Portland. If loaded fully, the Ever Ultra would have \nneeded a channel nearly 42 feet deep. This class of vessel will operate \nout of the river at low-water periods by leaving light loaded, but the \nvessel owners clearly view this as a test of the Columbia River port \nmarket. As world trade mushrooms in the years ahead, there will be more \npressure on these vessels, and the channel as well, to operate at full \ncapacity.\n  At stake is more than $15 billion in annual trade and more than \n46,000 jobs in the region. Obviously, the job impact climbs even higher \nwhen you consider job impacts throughout the region. Exports crossing \nthe Columbia River docks originate around the country, coming from the \nMidwest and northern tier States. Thus, the trade impacts of the \nchannel reverberate throughout the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, let me cite just one regional example: An estimated \nthree-quarters of Montana wheat is exported through the Columbia River \nsystem. Montana grain growers acknowledge that bottlenecks in the \nColumbia River Channel hamper their efforts to bet their grain to \nmarket. The same is true for States around the west that rely on the \nchannel as the gateway to the international marketplace. Columbia River \nports handle grain from throughout the Midwest and products from around \nthe rest of the country.\n  Restrictions on channel draft mean lost business opportunities. for \ngrain vessels, a foot of draft equates to 2,000 tons of cargo, valued \nat $324,000. For container cargo, that same foot of draft equates to \n$2.5 million in cargo value. When vessels leave light loaded or without \ntaking a full load so that they do not exceed channel depth, that is \nthe value of cargo left behind for each foot of draft sacrifices.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and I have \nworked diligently with the committee on moving this project ahead. \nIncluded in this year's water resources bill is language directing the \ncorps to move ahead with technical improvements on turns in the lower \nColumbia River. But I want to put the Senate on notice that more needs \nto be done on this project. I have discussed the importance of the \nColumbia River Channel deepening with the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee as he assures me the committee is well \nversed in the importance of this navigation improvement project.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise to join with the Senator from \nOregon in expressing my understanding of the vital importance of the \nColumbia River Channel deepening project. I have also expressed to my \ncolleague my willingness to help keep review of the project moving \nahead as swiftly as possible in the years ahead. I will do all that I \ncan to urge the Corps of Engineers to complete its feasibility study on \nschedule so that Congress can address the merits of this project \nwithout any delay. I have given that commitment to my colleagues from \nOregon and I am happy to repeat it during this debate today.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. \nThis project has been one of the top priorities in my recent years in \nthe Senate. This past year, the Columbia River was the largest volume \nexport port on the west coast and its significance means the impacts \nare felt well beyond my State and region. I appreciate having the \nchairman of the authorizing committee recognize this importance and \ncommit to timely consideration of the Columbia River Channel \nimprovement project in the future.\n\n\n          Water Resources Development Act and the La Farge Dam\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe inclusion of language deauthorizing the La Farge Dam and Lake \nproject in the 1996 Water Resources Development Act Reauthorization \n[WRDA] and extend my thanks to the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. \nChafee], the Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], and the Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Warner] for their assistance in incorporating these \nprovisions. I want to recognize the efforts of all the individuals who \nhave worked so hard over the last year on this legislation, including \nState Senator Brian Rude, Ho Chunk Nation President Chloris Lowe, State \nRepresentative DuWayne Johnsrud, Ron Johnson, the chair of the Kickapoo \nValley Governing Board, Lou Kowalski, formerly of the St. Paul District \nCorps of Engineers, and Alan Anderson of the University of Wisconsin \nExtension. Finally, I want to extend my gratitude for the commitment \nand perseverance of the Wisconsin delegation. As a delegation, my \ncolleagues from Wisconsin in the other body--Representatives Gunderson \nand Petri--the senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], and I \nintroduced identical legislation on the 1st day of the 104th Congress \nin our respective bodies--S. 40 and H.R. 50--to address this unfinished \nbusiness the Federal Government began in our State in 1962. We \nsupported legislation to address this issue in the 103d Congress--S. \n2186 and H.R. 4575. The House of Representatives included H.R. 4575 in \nthe WRDA bill that passed on October 3, 1995. Senate action on this \nmeasure was not completed in the closing days of the 103d Congress.\n  In this Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nincluded the land transfer portion of my bill as part of the WRDA bill \nit introduced on March 28, 1995. That bill was favorably reported by \nthe committee on August 2, 1995.\n  Today marks a major step toward ending the conflict and controversy \ncreated by the proposed construction, and later abandonment, of the La \nFarge Dam project. More than 30 years ago, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers planned to build a dam across the Kickapoo River, near the \nvillage of La Farge, located in the southwestern portion of the State. \nIn fact, Mr. President, I believe there is scarcely a person over 30 \nyears of age in my State that has not heard about the La Farge Dam. The \ndam was supposed to provide flood control in an often flooded valley. \nLocal residents were assured of the economic benefits in tourism \ndollars that the planned lake and other authorized improvements would \nbring to the area.\n  Federal legislation authorizing the La Farge Dam passed in 1962, and \nconstruction began in 1971. The Federal Government condemned the \nproperty and displaced 144 families. However, the project was never \ncompleted. Construction ended in 1975 following a dispute over the \nproject's environmental impact statement. Mr. President, the La Farge \narea is ecologically sensitive and is a truly beautiful area of my \nState, filled with unique natural features such as: Sandstone cliffs, \nhearty forest lands, and scenic valleys. It is also home to many rare \nplants and several State threatened and endangered animals.\n\n  When construction stopped, the proposed dam was only 61 percent \ncomplete. The area, already struggling economically prior to the dam's \ndevelopment, was devastated. By 1990, it was estimated that annual \nlosses resulting from the cessation of family farm operations and the \nunrealized tourism benefits that had been promised with the\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\ndam totaled more 300 jobs and $8 million for the local economy per \nyear. In fact, the only remaining legacy of the dam project is a \nfragmented landscape. It is dotted with scattered remains of former \nfarm homes, and a 103-foot-tall concrete shell of the dam, with the \nKickapoo River flowing unimpeded through a 1,000-foot-gap.\n  When the 144 families were forced to leave their homes in the 1960's, \nmany left the region entirely. Those who stayed in the area lost \nincome, and the land they once owned was removed from the local tax \nbase. Businesses, which once relied on these customers, suffered, and \nthe school system lost property tax funding along with approximately \none-third of its students. Today, the median income of the La Farge \narea is only slightly above half of the State average, and the \nheartfelt bitterness toward what was widely considered an irresponsible \nFederal boondoggle will only begin to be tempered now that plans for \nFederal deauthorization are in progress with the passage of this \nmeasure.\n  For the past 5 years, under the sponsorship of Governor Thompson, \nmembers of the local community, the Army Corps of Engineers, University \nof Wisconsin-Extension, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, \nWisconsin Department of Transportation, Wisconsin State Historical \nSociety, the Governor's office, State legislators, Wisconsin \nenvironmental groups, members of the congressional delegation, and, \nmost recently, the Ho Chunk Nation have collaborated to develop a plan \nto reclaim the dam area and manage it under a combination of State and \nlocal control.\n  The Wisconsin State Legislature passed legislation in 1994 to \nestablish the Kickapoo Valley Reserve. State law now provides that the \ndeauthorized land will be managed under the auspices of the newly \ncreated Kickapoo Valley Governing Board. This entity is prepared to \naccept ownership on behalf of the State of Wisconsin upon Federal \ndeauthorization of the land.\n  The Governing Board is required to preserve and enhance the unique \nenvironmental, scenic, and cultural features of the Kickapoo Valley, to \nprovide facilities for the use and enjoyment of visitors to the area, \nand to promote the area as a destination for vacationing and \nrecreation.\n\n  Strong environmental protection provisions are included in the State \nlaw, including limits on development and an outright ban on any mining \nactivities. The State has also made a financial commitment to support \nboth the administration of the governing board and the reserve at a \ncost of more than $300 thousand per year. In addition, the State will \npay local property taxes and aid to local school districts.\n  At the time of the August 1995 WRDA markup, representatives of the Ho \nChunk Nation, a Wisconsin Native American tribe, contacted the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs and my office raising concerns about the proposed \ntransfer. The area which is now the La Farge Dam property at one time \nbelonged to the Nation under two treaties with the Federal Government \nin 1825 and 1827. In a later treaty of 1837, the tribe was required to \ncede this property to the United States. Because these lands had been \nthe Nation's, both at the time of and prior to its treaties with the \nFederal Government, there are nearly 400 tribal archeological sites in \nthis area. These include 150 prehistoric campsites, 18 prehistoric \nvillages, rock shelters, petroglyphs, and burial mounds. In \ndeauthorizing the dam project, and opening the property to public use, \nthe Nation wanted to be certain that sites they believe to be \nculturally and religiously significant within this area were protected \nfrom desecration or other improper use.\n  Upon learning of the tribe's concerns, my office began a dialog with \nall the parties to determine how to transfer the property and insure \nthat the tribal archeological sites were protected.\n  The result is truly landmark legislation. When this project is \ndeauthorized, a portion of the more than 8,500 acre property now owned \nby the corps--some 1,200 acres--will be transferred to the Ho Chunk \nNation. The remainder will be given to the State of Wisconsin. The \nparties will be required to sign a memorandum of understanding [MOU] to \njointly operate the area as the Kickapoo Valley Reserve, a public \noutdoor recreational and educational area. This site in Wisconsin, \nwhich was untouched by the glaciers and contains this wealth of \narcheological sites, will create a ecologically and historically \nsignificant State reserve. In addition to its ecological significance, \nthe reserve is also unique in a number of other ways. It will be the \nfirst time in our State's history and, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, nationally that a tribe and State will work together \nto pursue natural resource objectives for a particular piece of \nproperty in this fashion. Moreover, the day to day management of the \nreserve will be conducted by a governing board made up of local \nresidents, not administered by the State Department of Natural \nResources--a first in Wisconsin.\n  I was disappointed that we were unable to reach agreement under this \nlegislation to include authorizations for improvement projects at this \nsite, which were included both in the original La Farge Dam project as \nproposed by the corps and in my bill. These improvements include: \nReconstruction of the three roads; construction of an education and \ninterpretative complex that includes buildings, parking areas, \nrecreational trails, and canoe facilities; remediation of old \nunderground storage tanks and wells on the abandoned farms; and a \ncomplete inventory of the archeological sites as required by the \nNational Historic Preservation Act.\n  These projects provide hope for the area and fulfillment of Federal \npromises made long ago. It is my understanding that the House has \nincluded authorizations for some of these improvements in the markup of \ntheir water resources bill and it is my hope that these improvements \ncan be considered in the conference. We in the Wisconsin delegation are \nall concerned about the fiscal implications of WRDA projects. I believe \nthat these improvement projects are a financial win for both Wisconsin \nand the Federal Government. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that \nif the La Farge Dam were to be completed today, the total cost would be \n$102 million.\n  In conclusion, this effort should truly be dedicated to the people of \nthe Kickapoo Valley. It is their hopeful vision of renewal of this \narea, and their tenacity that should be recognized today. This \nlegislation marks the starting point of the work that is to come, which \nI know they will pursue with grace and fortitude.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today's passage by the Senate of S. 640, \nthe Water Resources Development Act [WRDA], represents a continuing \nFederal commitment to the water resources of our country. Passage of \nthis important measure is a direct result of the leadership and \ndiligent efforts of my colleagues Senator John Chafee and Senator Max \nBaucus and I would like to thank them for all their hard work. Their \nefforts have resulted in an excellent bill that has not only my whole-\nhearted support, but the solid backing of this body. This strong \nsupport is unsurprising. This bill has much to recommend it. Our \nwaterways and ports, which funnel billions of dollars of products \nthroughout the Nation and generate hundreds of thousands of jobs across \nthe country, will be better served by this bill. For those Americans \nwho live in areas of the country that are prone to flooding, this bill \nprovides for flood-control projects that protect their homes and the \nbillions of dollars that their property represents. I know that my \ncolleagues understand the important navigation and flood control \nprojects provided for in this measure, but I would like to take a \nmoment to call their attention to another significant provision in this \nbill.\n  S. 640 includes important language that provides for a continuing \nFederal role in protecting a valuable national resource--our Nation's \ncoastline. This language states clearly that the Federal Government has \nan obligation to provide the necessary support for projects that \npromote the protection, restoration, and enhancement of sandy beaches \nand shorelines in cooperation with States and localities. Mr. \nPresident, before I detail the significance of this language, I would \nagain like to acknowledge and thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus \nfor working with me on this issue as they readied WRDA for \nconsideration by the full Senate. Their thoughtful consideration and \nleadership has been instrumental in achieving constructive progress on \nthis\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nissue and I look forward to continuing to work with them as the bill \nmoves forward.\n  To understand the significance of the inclusion of this shore \nprotection language in this bill, it is necessary to understand the \nhistory that has led to today's congressional action on this subject. \nAs many of my colleagues know, in 1995, the administration proposed an \nend to the Federal role in shore protection projects. Citing budgetary \nconcerns, the administration proposal called for Federal involvement in \nprojects that were of ``national significance'' only. This short-\nsighted policy ignores the fact that beach, shore, and coastal \nresources are critical to our economy and quality of life, but that \nthey are fragile and must be protected, conserved, and restored.\n  As a coastal State senator, who walks the beaches of the Jersey shore \nevery year, I know first hand the economic and recreational benefits \nthat are derived from healthy beaches. This is why on May 23, 1996, I \njoined with my colleague and co-chair of the Senate Coastal Coalition, \nSenator Connie Mack of Florida, to introduce S. 1811, the Shore \nProtection Act of 1996. This bill would provide for a Federal role in \nshore protection projects, including those projects involving the \nplacement of sand, for which the economic and ecological benefits to \nthe locality, region or Nation exceed the costs.\n\n  I am pleased that Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus have agreed to \ninclude elements of the Shore Protection Act of 1996 in the Water \nResources Development Act, which is the vehicle that authorizes the \nFederal involvement in civil works projects like shore protection. The \nhistory of Federal involvement in water resource projects dates back \nalmost 200 years and includes a long history of involvement in shore \nprotection projects. The role of the Federal Government in beach \nrestoration projects was reaffirmed as recently as 1986 with passage of \nWRDA '86, the largest and most comprehensive authorization of the Corps \nCivil Works Program since the 1940's. The passage of WRDA '86 included \ncost-sharing requirements that made States a partner in the funding of \nthese programs. For the past decade, the protection of our Nation's \nshoreline has continued to be a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States. Despite the Clinton administration's new \npolicy of eliminating Federal participation in beach restoration \nprojects, the Environment and Public Works Committee continues to \nauthorize new projects and the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee continues to appropriate funds for these projects. \nHowever, these measures address shore protection projects on an ad hoc, \nrather than comprehensive and coordinated, basis.\n  The language included in WRDA from the Shore Protection Act of 1996 \nchallenges the administration's new policy and reaffirms a Federal role \nin shore protection. The language included states that one of the goals \nof WRDA is to ``promote shore protection projects and related research \nthat encourage the protection, restoration and enhancement of sandy \nbeaches, including beach restoration and periodic beach nourishment, on \na comprehensive and coordinated basis by the Federal Government, \nStates, and localities, and private enterprises.'' This puts the Senate \non record as rejecting the Administration's policy and more clearly \ndefines the Army Corps' mandate to undertake shore protection projects, \nspecifically those projects which include the placement of sand. This \nmandate is further clarified by the adoption in WRDA of new definitions \nfrom the Shore Protection Act of 1996 that redefines ``shore,'' to \ninclude ``sandy beaches'' and expands ``shoreline protection project'' \nto include ``a project for beach renourishment, including the placement \nof sand.'' The inclusion of this language would mandate a continuing \nFederal role in shore protection projects by changing the mission of \nthe Corps from one of general authority to do beach projects to a \nspecific mandate to undertake the protection, restoration and \nenhancement of beaches in cooperation with States and local \ncommunities.\n  I am pleased that this language was included in WRDA, and look \nforward to continuing discussions on the other important provisions in \nthe Shore Protection Act that were not included in this measure at this \ntime. These provisions include the requirement that new criteria be \nused in conducting the cost-benefit analysis of a proposed project. \nCurrently, when undertaking cost-benefit analysis to determine the \nsuitability of proposed projects, the corps is only required to \nconsider the property values of property directly adjacent to the \nbeach. The corps can take into account revenues generated through \nrecreation, but is not required to do so, nor can the recreational \nvalues be weighed as anything other than an incidental benefit. The \nShore Protection Act requires that the benefits to the local, regional \nand national economy and the local, regional and national ecology be \nconsidered. This comprehensive evaluation will demonstrate that shore \nprotection projects are of national significance.\n\n  The Shoreline Protection Act also requires that the corps report \nannually to Congress on beach project priorities. The corps will be \nrequired to submit information--reports--to Congress on projects that, \nwhen evaluated with the bill's new cost-benefit criteria, are found to \nmerit Federal involvement. In current law, this authority is \ndiscretionary and has been suspended by the administration.\n  Additionally, the act encourages the corps to work with State and \nlocal authorities to develop regional plans for preservation, \nrestoration and enhancement of shorelines and coastal resources. \nFurther the corps is encouraged to work with other agencies to \ncoordinate with other projects that may have a complimentary effect on \nshoreline protection projects.\n  A network of healthy and nourished beaches is essential to our \neconomy, competitiveness in world tourism and the safety of our coastal \ncommunities. I know that many of my colleagues have heard the numbers \nbefore but they bear repeating. More than 28 million people work in \nbusinesses related to costal tourism, and healthy beaches contributed \nto a $26 billion tourism trade surplus last year. Protection of the \nNation's shoreline must be a continued Federal priority and I \nappreciate Senator Chafee's leadership on this issue. By authorizing \nnew shore protection projects in this year's WRDA and by associating \nhimself with the provisions of the Shore Protection Act that call for a \ncontinued Federal role in shore protection, he has distinguished \nhimself in the effort to preserve one of our Nation's most unique and \nvaluable resources. I want to associate myself with Senator Chafee's \nremarks that state that he ``plans to work closely with Senators Mack, \nBradley, and others to build on this provision as S. 640 advances.'' I \nlook forward to continuing this dialog as the bill continues to \nprogress.\n\n\n                 Technology To Decontaminate Sediments\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in a brief \ncolloquy regarding S. 640, the Water Resources Development Act of 1996.\n  As the chairman may know, I have been very involved in efforts to \nclean up contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes. I have long \nsupported the program for the assessment and remediation of \ncontaminated sediments. The Water Resources Development Act of 1990 \nauthorized very modest funding for the Secretary of the Army to provide \ntechnical planning and engineering assistance to States and local \ngovernments to develop contaminated sediment remediation plans. This \nhas been a joint Army Corps of Engineers--Environmental Protection \nAgency effort to develop more cost-effective technologies for cleaning \nup sediments in freshwater. This coordinated effort is very similar to \nthe one in New York/New Jersey Harbor authorized in section 405 of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1992, which is extended and expanded \nin the bill before us, except that that program primarily addresses \nsaltwater areas.\n  The Great Lakes region faces a multibillion dollar problem in \ncleaning up and preventing the deposition of more contaminated \nsediments. This overwhelming task will require cooperation and \nfinancial support from all levels of government and sectors of society. \nThe long-term environmental and economic health of the region depend on \nour ability to address this difficult problem.\n  Recently, I have communicated to the chairman and the Environment\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nCommittee about my strong interest in pursuing the Superfund as one \npossible option for cleaning up the areas of concern around the Great \nLakes. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, including the lack of \ncost-effective technology, Superfund has not adequately considered the \nrisks from or attempted to address most of these aquatic sites. \nSuperfund would be an appropriate funding source since the majority of \nthese areas are contaminated with many of the very persistent \nsubstances and chlorinated hydrocarbons that plague our ecosystem and \nare produced from the feedstocks that are taxed to fill the Superfund.\n  As a result of research and planning efforts at the Army Corps and \nEPA, we have now identified promising technologies and it is time to \nput them into practice. That is why I am seeking the Senator from Rhode \nIsland's firm commitment to accept, or recede to in conference, the \nHouse provision outlined in section 509 of H.R. 3592 or something \nsimilar.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate the interest of the the Senator from \nMichigan. I am pleased to tell him that the provision appears to be \nreasonable and consistent with the navigation mission of the Army \nCorps. As such, I can assure the Senator from Michigan that I will look \nfavorably upon the provision he refers to and will make sure all of the \nSenate conferees are aware of his interest in this matter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for his assurances and look foward to \nworking with him further on preventing and remediating contaminated \nsediments in the Great Lakes and in other areas of the country. I would \nalso like to note for my colleagues that they will likely be surprised \nat the pervasiveness of contaminated sediments in our coastal waters, \nwhich will be revealed if and when EPA finally releases its very tardy \nnational assessment of aquatic sediment quality. This was due to have \nbeen released in October 1994, pursuant to the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1992, section 503.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works in a colloquy regarding \nthe funding levels authorized in the bill for the Chesapeake & Delaware \nCanal. At the very outset, I want to commend the chairman for his \nleadership in crafting this legislation which is of vital importance to \nour Nation's water resources infrastructure.\n  I am particularly grateful for the committee's favorable \nconsideration of the Poplar Island restoration project and the \nimprovements to the Tolchester Channel and the C Canal made possible \nby this legislation. I note, however, that the project costs for the \nC Canal improvements are unfortunately inaccurate. I would stress \nthat this happened through no fault of the committee staff. The Corps \nof Engineers draft feasibility study for the project released in \nJanuary 1996, estimates the total cost of the project at $83,900,000 \nrather than the $33 million shown in the bill. Of this revised amount, \n$54,204,000 is Federal and $29,696,000 is non-Federal responsibility.\n  I ask the chairman whether it would be possible to have these numbers \ncorrected in the conference committee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would only add two points. First, that \nthe project is one of considerable importance to the Port of Baltimore \nand to the efficient passage of ships up and down the east coast. \nSecond, that the correct figures are those developed by the Corps of \nEngineers and represent the current estimates for the project in \naccordance with the cost-sharing provisions of the Water Resource \nDevelopment Act of 1986. I would also request the chairman's assistance \nin resolving this matter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski for their kind \nremarks and express my agreement that we should utilize the correct \nnumbers for this and all other projects. As such, I will look favorably \nupon the necessary modification to this project authorization during \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 640, the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1995, and the committee amendment, \nwhich provide for the development and improvement of our Nation's water \nresources infrastructure. This legislation authorizes water resource \nprojects of vital importance to our Nation's and our States' economy \nand maritime industry as well as our environment.\n  I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of \nprovisions for which I have fought to ensure the future health of the \nPort of Baltimore and of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  First, the bill authorizes the Poplar Island beneficial use of \ndredged material project. This project would take clean dredged \nmaterials from the shipping channels leading to the Port of Baltimore \nand use it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat, and restore \nwetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island \necosystems. Providing adequate and environmentally compatible dredged \nmaterial disposal capacity for the millions of cubic years of materials \nwhich must be dredged from Baltimore's shipping channels, harbors, and \nanchorages are perhaps the biggest challenge facing our State. This is \na creative solution that will not only help alleviate Maryland's \nshortage of dredge disposal capacity, but provide substantial \nenvironmental benefits for the Chesapeake Bay, creating new habitat for \nwaterfowl and other wildlife and reducing the sediment and nutrient \nproblems of the bay. The Poplar Island project would be the first large \nscale project to beneficially use dredged material and would serve as a \nnational model demonstrating that clean dredged material can be a \nresource rather than a waste. It has been a top priority of mine, of \nthe State of Maryland, and of the Chesapeake Bay community for many \nyears and I am delighted that this legislation will enable us to move \nforward with this important project.\n  Second, the legislation directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nexpedite its study of the Tolchester Channel S-turn and, if feasible \nand necessary for safe and efficient navigation, to straighten the \nchannel as part of project maintenance. The Tolchester Channel, a \nChesapeake and Delaware Canal approach channel, is a vital link in the \nBaltimore Port system. The channel has a significant S-turn which \nrequires ships to change course 5 times within 3 miles. With vessels \nnearly 1,000 feet in length, it is difficult to safely navigate the \nchannel, particularly in poor weather conditions. The Maryland Pilots \nAssociation has indicated that two groundings and a greater number of \nnear misses have occurred in the area. This legislation provides a \nmechanism for the Corps of Engineers to expedite safety-related \nimprovements to the channel.\n  Third, the bill authorizes navigation and safety improvements to the \nChesapeake and Delaware Canal and approach channels. The Chesapeake and \nDelaware Canal is a strategic and cost-effective shortcut from the Port \nof Baltimore to the North Atlantic, saving up to 12 hours of sailing \ntime for many of the world's largest vessels. Nearly one half of all \nbreakbulk and container tonnage moving through the Port of Baltimore \nutilizes the canal. Unfortunately current dimensions of the canal and \nconnecting channels present serious constraints for modern container \nships--many of which exceed 900 feet in length--seeking to use this \nshortcut. In January, after an extensive 6-year study, the Philadelphia \nDistrict of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, completed a draft \nfeasibility report and environmental impact statement which recommends \ndeepening the existing channel from 35 feet to 40 feet. The project \nalso includes enlarging the Reedy Point flare, bend widening at Sandy \nPoint, and construction of an emergency anchorage at Howell Point. \nSubject to a final favorable feasibility report, expected in September \nof this year, the corps would be able to undertake these improvements \nand make transit of the canal safer and more efficient, while allowing \nlarger ships to access the port.\n\n  The Port of Baltimore is one of the great ports of the world and one \nof Maryland's most important economic assets. The port generates $2 \nbillion in annual economic activity, provides for an estimated 87,000 \njobs, and over $500 million a year in State and local tax revenues and \ncustoms receipts. These three projects will help assure the continued \nvitality of the Port of Baltimore into the 21st century.\n  In addition to port development and improvement projects, the measure \ncontains three amendments which will\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nhelp significantly to enhance Maryland's and the Chesapeake Bay \nregion's environment.\n  It incorporates provisions of S. 934, the Chesapeake Bay \nEnvironmental Restoration and Protection Program, legislation I \nintroduced together with Senators Warner, Robb, and Mikulski to expand \nthe authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist in the \nenvironmental restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. The bill authorizes a \n$10 million pilot program for the corps to design and construct water-\nrelated projects in the Chesapeake Bay including projects for sediment \nand erosion control, wetland creation, fish passage barrier removal, \nwastewater treatment and related facilities, and other related \nprojects. As the lead Federal agency in water resource management, the \ncorps has a vital role to play in the restoration of the bay and these \nprovisions would greatly enhance the ability of the corps to actively \nparticipate in this important endeavor.\n  It also authorizes $18.8 million in funding for environmental \nrestoration of the Anacostia River. The Anacostia River is one of the \nmost degraded rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and in the Nation. \nIn July 1994 the Army Corps of Engineers completed a feasibility study \nwhich recommended 13 restoration actions, include 2 wetland restoration \nprojects, 6 stormwater management/wetland projects, and 5 stream \nrestoration projects. In total, these actions will restore 80 acres of \nwetlands, 5 miles of stream and 33 acres of bottom land habitat within \nthe Anacostia basin. This legislation would enable the Corps of \nEngineers to undertake these projects and help restore the river and \nregain what has been lost through years of neglect.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to \n$600,000 to the State of Maryland for use by the State in constructing \nan access road to Jennings Randolph Lake. The fiscal 1994 energy and \nwater appropriations bill contained a provision directing the corps to \npave the access road on the Maryland side of the Jennings Randolph Lake \nutilizing the operations and maintenance budget. The Army has indicated \nthat due to varying standards for Federal versus State road \nconstruction and the design and planning activity already undertaken by \nMaryland, the total cost of the road would be significantly lower if \nbuilt by the State. This provision would enable the corps to transfer \nto the State of Maryland the funds necessary to complete the final \nportion of the access road which traverses corps property.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished chairmen of the committee and \nthe subcommittee, Senators Chafee and Warner, and the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, for their leadership in crafting this legislation and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4445\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

NATIONAL DAM SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) dams are an essential part of the national \n     infrastructure;\n       (B) dams fail from time to time with catastrophic results; \n     and\n       (C) dam safety is a vital public concern;\n       (2) dam failures have caused, and may cause in the future, \n     loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and economic \n     and social disruption;\n       (3)(A) some dams are at or near the end of their \n     structural, useful, or operational life; and\n       (B) the loss, destruction, and disruption resulting from \n     dam failures can be substantially reduced through the \n     development and implementation of dam safety hazard reduction \n     measures, including--\n       (i) improved design and construction standards and \n     practices supported by a national dam performance resource \n     bank located at Stanford University in California;\n       (ii) safe operation and maintenance procedures;\n       (iii) early warning systems;\n       (iv) coordinated emergency preparedness plans; and\n       (v) public awareness and involvement programs;\n       (4)(A) dam safety problems persist nationwide;\n       (B) while dam safety is principally a State responsibility, \n     the diversity in Federal and State dam safety programs calls \n     for national leadership in a cooperative effort involving the \n     Federal Government, State governments, and the private \n     sector; and\n       (C) an expertly staffed and adequately financed dam safety \n     hazard reduction program, based on Federal, State, local, and \n     private research, planning, decisionmaking, and \n     contributions, would reduce the risk of the loss, \n     destruction, and disruption resulting from dam failure by an \n     amount far greater than the cost of the program;\n       (5)(A) there is a fundamental need for a national program \n     for dam safety hazards reduction, and the need will continue; \n     and\n       (B) to be effective, such a national program will require \n     input from, and review by, Federal and non-Federal experts \n     in--\n       (i) dam design, construction, operation, and maintenance; \n     and\n       (ii) the practical application of dam failure hazard \n     reduction measures;\n       (6) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) there is no national dam safety program; and\n       (B) the coordinating authority for national leadership \n     concerning dam safety is provided through the dam safety \n     program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     established under Executive Order 12148 (50 U.S.C. App. 2251 \n     note) in coordination with members of the Interagency \n     Committee on Dam Safety and with States; and\n       (7) while the dam safety program of FEMA is a proper \n     Federal undertaking, should continue, and should provide the \n     foundation for a national dam safety program, statutory \n     authority is needed--\n       (A) to meet increasing needs and to discharge Federal \n     responsibilities in dam safety;\n       (B) to strengthen the leadership role of FEMA;\n       (C) to codify the national dam safety program;\n       (D) to authorize the Director of FEMA to communicate \n     directly with Congress on authorizations and appropriations; \n     and\n       (E) to build on the hazard reduction aspects of dam safety.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to reduce the \n     risks to life and property from dam failure in the United \n     States through the establishment and maintenance of an \n     effective national dam safety program to bring together the \n     expertise and resources of the Federal and non-Federal \n     communities in achieving national dam safety hazard \n     reduction.\n       (c) Dam Safety Program.--Public Law 92-367 (33 U.S.C. 467 \n     et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the first section and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I address the Senator from Nevada? Does the Senator \nfrom Nevada seek the floor for any particular purpose on this bill?\n  Mr. REID. To speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator willing to have a time agreement on that \nstatement?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment that is pending before the \nSenate in this bill, the 1997 appropriations bill, is that we establish \na separate transfer account for contingency operations. Moving into \nthis account are the funds budgeted for the contingency operations from \nservices' operations and maintenance accounts. In addition, the \nsubcommittee added funding for emergency requirements identified by the \nDepartment of Defense. This amendment would transfer an additional \n$4,200,000 from the Army's operation and maintenance account, and seek \n$66 million from the defensewide operation and maintenance accounts. \nThe funds were identified by the department as needed in support of \ncontingency operations, but were not identified for previous transfer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be a time limit on this \namendment of 30 minutes with time equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is apparent that the Senators from \nNevada are trying to hold up the Department of Defense, the people who \nare in the field serving this country, and to delay the consideration \nof this bill, as I said, which is a critical bill, with Members wanting \nto go back to their States because of this hurricane.\n  The rules of the Senate are the rules of the Senate, and there is not \nmuch this Senator can do about it. If the Senator from Nevada is going \nto persist to put us through the same gyrations we went through \nyesterday, I might say to my friend--he is my good friend--I am \nappalled at this, and I really am at a loss to consider what to do \nabout it. Under the circumstances, it would be my intention to confer \nwith the leadership to see what they would like to do.\n  Mr. President, might I say for the information of the Senate, it was \nmy intention, and that of the Senator from Hawaii, to proceed now to a \nseries of amendments that have been cleared by all concerned, have been \nreviewed by Members on both sides and are prepared to be added to this \nbill. I do think that the problem is, how do we get this bill to a vote \ntoday. And I am still proceeding to try and find out how to do that.\n  Mr. President, let me outline these amendments that I am trying to \nget considered. Let me point out to the Senate we have an amendment by \nSenator Bingaman which would reduce the amount for the Pentagon \nrenovation fund by $100 million. We have cleared that. We have an \namendment by Senator Chafee for the Defense Technical Transfer Pilot \nProgram that has been cleared. Senators Kempthorne and Craig have an \namendment related to the Army's mobile munition assessment system that \nhas been cleared, Senator Lieberman's amendment adjusting funding \nlevels for the Corps SAM and Other Theater Missile Defense/Follow-On \nTMD Activities Program. Those have been cleared.\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\n  I have an amendment to make available $11.5 million for B-52 bomber \nmodifications. I have an amendment regarding the CAMP Program and an \namendment to provide moneys for P-3 aircraft personnel offset by a \nreduction in defense health and also provides additional money for B-52 \nsquadron personnel. We have a series of other amendments that we are in \nthe process of clearing. I tell the Senate that there are some 20 other \namendments ready to go to be debated now. We have an additional series \nhere that I believe will be cleared, and the amendment that is pending \nhas been cleared. I hope we will be able to proceed with those. It does \nseem to me however, it is just an exercise in futility to have a \nfilibuster on a defense bill. I intend to do what I can to thwart that.\n\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, this bill is the key to our being able \nto complete action on appropriations bills and get the whole subject \ncleared by the end of the fiscal year. My good friend and our chairman, \nSenator Hatfield, is retiring this year. I want to do my best to assure \nthat the key bills that we have, all the appropriations bills, are sent \nto conference before the August recess.\n  In my judgment, if we have to give up the August recess to do that, \nwe should do it. If we are going to have filibusters on every bill, \nthen so be it. We will have to break them. It seems this is an \nunfortunate circumstance.\n  Let me describe, for instance, this B-52 modification amendment. It \nprovides $11.5 million within the account that is already outlined in \nthe bill to modify the B-52 aircraft. These are required to maintain \nthe combat effectiveness of the aircraft, should they be called upon \nonce again to fly combat missions. They are going to be offset by a \ndecrease in funds available to the F-15 fighter in the same account. I \nthink we can do that because we can still proceed with the F-15. There \nhas been a delay in the projected contract award, and the fighter data \nlink program will remain fully funded for 1997, according to the \nmaximum amount that can be spent. We believe we should provide these \nmoneys. There is an initiative by the Senators from North Dakota to \nassure the current floor structure be preserved, and we are trying to \nprevent attrition of these aircraft. That is one of the amendments I \nhave, and I am seeking to get approval today at this time.\n  We are also going to add $4.9 million to the Navy's personnel account \nand $4.4 million to the Air Force personnel account to allow the Navy \nto maintain an end-strength support of the P-3 squadron, and the Air \nForce to maintain the personnel necessary to carry out the B-52 mission \nas outlined by the Senators from North Dakota.\n  We are trying to cooperate as much as possible with many people on \nthe other side of the aisle. I might say, all of these pending \namendments are to make sure that amendments to the authorization bill \nby Members of the minority would be fully funded.\n  Our leader is here, and I want to yield to the leader, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7691-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1996--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Murkowski, Conrad R. Burns, \n           Dirk Kempthorne, Hank Brown.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I simply say to my friend from Nevada \nthat we can either proceed with the Defense bill and finish it today, \nor if he wishes to try to filibuster this bill, if he will not agree to \na time agreement, it is my recommendation to the leader that we recess \nuntil Monday and have the votes on the cloture. That means we will take \nup the nuclear waste bill first and when we get cloture on that, we \nwill vote on it, and when we are finished with that, we will finish the \nDefense appropriation bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of this \nvery important legislation: Senator Stevens, who is the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Inouye, the great \nSenator from Hawaii. They always do a magnificent job on this \nlegislation. It is legislation that is very, very important to the \ndefense of our country and carrying out our commitments here in this \ncountry and around the world. We have troops in Bosnia right now that \nhave a very important role they are trying to carry out. The President \nis committed to that. They need the funds that are necessary to do \ntheir job wherever they are in the world, where sailors are steaming \ntoday. They are looking to us to provide the funds. There are very \nimportant funds in this legislation for every state that our military \nmen and women are serving in, and we need to get this done. We have 7 \nweeks left in this year. We have 12 appropriations bills to get done, \nincluding this one. We must get that done or we cannot go home. We must \nget started, and we can complete this bill, I think, very quickly.\n  Now, what has happened--I understand the concern by the Senators from \nNevada about the nuclear waste issue. By forcing my hand to do these \ncloture motions, it has speeded up the time in which this issue will \ncome to a head. I had planned on not filing a cloture motion on the \nnuclear waste issue until Friday and the vote would have occurred on \nTuesday, but now it really is bringing it up sooner than it would have \notherwise.\n  Mr. President, this is an urgent, important issue for our country. \nThere is dangerous, radioactive nuclear waste stored in cooling pools \nall over this country from Vermont to Minnesota to Idaho to South \nCarolina. This has been an issue for 10 years which the Congress and \nthe governments, the administrations, Republican and Democrat, have not \nsufficiently addressed. Countries like Sweden, France, Britain, and \nJapan have stepped up to this issue of how we deal with the temporary \nand permanent storage of nuclear waste, but in America we have not been \nable to bring ourselves to do it.\n  At the same time, the ratepayers have paid millions, in fact, \nbillions of dollars to move toward a time when we would have a \npermanent storage site for nuclear waste. Do we wish it would go away? \nOf course. We cannot wish it away. It is there. Something must be done. \nThis nuclear waste legislation is probably the most important \nenvironmental legislation this Congress or any Congress will consider.\n  (Mr. INHOFE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we cannot stick our heads in the sand. If we \ndo, we will probably be radioactive. We have to step up to this issue. \nThis is a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that Senator Murkowski has \nworked very hard on, as have Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator Bennett \nJohnston. We cannot just ignore it. Do I want to bring it up now at a \ntime when we are trying to work together to move Presidential\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nnominations, judicial appointments, appropriations bills? No. But I do \nnot have a choice. As majority leader, when I have bipartisan senior \nleaders of the Congress come to me and say we have a fundamental \nnational issue that must be addressed, I cannot ignore it.\n  Does it eat up time? Yes. We blew 4 or 5 hours yesterday. We could \nhave finished this bill last night or this morning. Are we balled up \nhere now? Yes. Do I want that? No. But can we ignore our \nresponsibility? Absolutely not.\n  Now, let me say again, I am sympathetic to how the Senators from \nNevada feel. I know they cannot accept this without a fight. But I ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada to allow us to do our work on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, give us an opportunity to \nwork with him and find any opportunity that we can to be fair and work \nwith him. But we cannot ignore this problem any further. So, again, I \nwanted to make those points. I think they are very important. I hope \nthat we can work something out. I will be glad to work with the \nDemocratic leader. I know the Democratic leader wants to proceed on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. He has assured me of that \npersonally. I know he has given the managers, Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens, that commitment and assurance. So I hope we can find a \nway to face up to this issue and also to allow the Senate to get its \nwork done.\n  We are now locked in a rolling filibuster on every issue, which is \ntotally gridlocking the U.S. Senate. That is wrong. It is wrong for \nAmerica. We cannot get the appropriations bills done. We cannot get the \ntaxpayers' bill of rights done. We cannot get the White House Travel \nOffice bill for Billy Dale done. We cannot get the gaming commission \nissue up. I do not support all of these bills, but we have an \nobligation to allow the Senate to do its work. That is not happening. I \nhope we can find a way to do it on this bill today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, that the cloture vote with respect to the pending bill, the \nDOD appropriations bill, occur at 1 p.m., and I might say that we are \nprepared to let the Senator from Nevada talk and have all the time \nbetween now and 1 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what was the consent that was asked for and \nobjected to?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I sought to accelerate the time to vote on the Defense \nappropriations bill. If we could bring that to a vote at 1 o'clock, I \nfeel certain we will get cloture, and we would have 30 hours for debate \non this bill. I believe that would expire before the time to vote on \nthe nuclear waste bill, which, under other circumstances, will come \nfirst on Monday.\n  I am prepared to state that I think we can finish the bill today or \ntomorrow. It might mean that we would stay in session tonight to do so. \nBut I would like to get this bill through. I think that there is no \ngreater issue facing the country today than the amount and level of \nsupport for our armed services and the people in Bosnia. I think the \nuncertainty involved here is going to lead to some real problems.\n  I hope that maybe we might have a chance to have a recess and let us \njust try to discuss this with the Senator from Nevada and others and \nsee if we can get to this bill. There is no question in my mind that we \nare going to vote on this bill one way or the other. If cloture is the \nonly way to get to it, we will have to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, I would like to \nfurther inquire, if I could, with the indulgence of the Senator from \nAlaska, with him retaining control of the floor. What are the wishes of \nthe Senator from Nevada? Does he wish to just talk for a period of \ntime? Can we accommodate him in some way? I do not want to cut him off, \nbut I know that he has to be also aware of the desires of the 98 other \nSenators in trying to get the work done of the Senate on the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. Would the Senator like to talk for an \nhour? What are his intentions?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friends, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and \nthe majority leader that I understand the importance of this bill. I am \na member of the committee. I think we have had the good fortune of \nhaving the other military appropriations bill, military construction, \npassed. I am very happy about that. I received the support of Senators \nStevens and Inouye on that. That bill pales in the comparison to this \nbill, and I understand that.\n  But I respectfully say to my friend, the majority leader, that I \ndisagree that S. 1936 is the most important environmental issue facing \nthis Congress. I say, respectfully, to my friend that if the majority \nfeels this is the most important environmental issue, no wonder the \nAmerican public is upset at some of the environmental stands taken by \nthis Congress.\n  Now, I say to my friends, I support this bill. I speak in favor of \nthis bill. I believe, as outlined by Senators Inouye and Stevens, that \nwe do not have an obligation--in fact, we have a contrary obligation--\nto go along with what the White House suggests as to levels of military \nspending. We are a separate, just-as-important, equal branch of \nGovernment. Therefore, I support this bill.\n  But I also have obligations to the people of the State of Nevada and \nof this country to have every opportunity that I can to speak about S. \n1936, which the President is going to veto. That is one of the points I \ntried to make yesterday. Hopefully, I did it well. I think we are \nwasting a lot of time here, when the President says he is going to veto \nthe bill anyway. So I will be happy to cooperate in any way that I can. \nIt is my understanding, as someone told me, that there might be some \nneed for a recess.\n  Even though I do not speak very loud most of the time, I have the \nopportunity and the right as a Senator to follow the rules. That is all \nI am asking to do. I am not asking that any special privilege be \nextended to this Senator. But as those Senators in this Chamber know, I \nfeel very strongly about S. 1936. I think it is a waste of our time. I \nwould like to take every possible opportunity to speak on this.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator from Nevada be willing to bring this bill \nup right now?\n  Mr. REID. I would not.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have just one reaction, if I can ask the Senator from \nAlaska to continue to yield to me. First of all, I would be amazed if \nthe President of the United States would veto this bill after it has \ngone through the House and the Senate, supported by Senators from the \ndiverse States I named, all the way from Minnesota, Idaho, Vermont, New \nHampshire, my own State, and perhaps others. But, if the Congress gets \nto the point where, just because of the mere threat from the President \nof a veto, we do not act, we might as well go ahead and leave now for \nthe year because he is talking about vetoing every bill that is moving. \nI do not think we can use that as a basis of not acting on important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7743-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7744-S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A quorum is present.\n  The distinguished majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I begin by pointing out that in order to \ncome off of a quorum call I had to use this procedure of instructing \nthe Sergeant at Arms to get the presence of the Members here. It is the \nfirst time I ever had to do that as majority leader, and I do not like \nto do it. I remember grumbling loudly when it was done by a former \nmajority leader. In fact, I usually voted no because I hated the \nprocedure. However, I had no alternative, because I was trying to come \noff of a quorum call so we could have some discussion about the \nsituation we find ourselves in. That exercise is reflective of why we \nare in this situation right now.\n  Apparently, Mr. President, there is a planned concerted effort to \nhave gridlock in the U.S. Senate. We need to do the people's business. \nI am committed to that. I still think that the best thing to do for \nourselves politically is to do what is right for the country, and for \nus to be locked down and not able to move any legislation after the \nexercise we went through to vote on the small business tax relief \npackage and the minimum wage, to sort of clear the decks and move on to \nother issues, and now I find that instead of gridlock being broken it \nis beginning to get worse every day.\n  Mr. President, we have now in this Congress had to file 73 cloture \nmotions, I presume probably the largest in history. There were 40 in \nthe 102d Congress, 51 in the 103d Congress, and already 73 in the 104th \nCongress. Now, I am new in this position. I am trying mightily to do a \ngood job by finding a way to produce, finding a way for the Senate to \nact, while honoring the needs of 100 Senators. It is not easy. It is \nvery hard. It takes cooperation. It takes communication. I have been \ndoing that. I tried to talk to my colleagues, one by one, small groups, \nrepeated meetings, and I tried doing it across the aisle.\n  I say, honestly, I found the Democratic leader open and helpful in \nmany instances, and I tried to work with others. Senator Pryor from \nArkansas has a bill that he has been working on for years. He started \nthis whole effort of having the taxpayer bill of rights. For heaven's \nsakes, we ought to have that. The taxpayers ought to have some rights \nwhen it comes to dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. Yet we have \nnot been able to get that bill cleared. Why? I do not understand.\n  As soon as I was elected to this position I said, ``Look, enough on \nthis Federal Reserve Board holdup. Let the Senators talk. Decide on a \ntime, have our say, and vote.'' They are the President's nominees. We \nmay not like them. I did not like all of them. I voted against one of \nthem. Some of you voted against one of them, maybe somebody voted \nagainst two of them, but we agreed on a time with the distinguished \nmajority leader and those that had problems--the Senator from Iowa had \nheld up these nominees from his own administration for weeks. I said, \n``Enough. Give them the time, talk about it, vote, and go on.''\n  Small business tax relief and minimum wage have been sitting in our \nlap for weeks, months, balling up everything. I could have been willing \nto just continue it that way because I did not like the way it was set \nup, but it would have wound up tying up the small business tax relief, \nminimum wage, taxpayers bill of rights, the Billy Dale White House \ntravel issue, and I do not know whatever else was balled up in the \nGordian knot. I said for the good of the Senate, for Democrats and \nRepublicans, and some of my colleagues did not like my concerted, \naggressive continuous effort to find a way to resolve that issue, but I \nstayed with it and I stayed with it. The Democratic leader and I have \nworked, and we ran into little problems. Sometimes he misunderstood \nwhat I said. Sometimes I could not carry out what I thought I could. \nSometimes he could not. We had to rework it, but we did it. We set up a \nprocess to do it.\n\n  Regular order. I remember Senator Mitchell saying what we need to do \nis the regular order. There is a way you do things around here. You \nbring up a bill reported by a committee, have debate, offer amendments, \nyou vote and win or lose, and you move on, and then it goes to \nconference.\n  Now, on both sides we are beginning to block appointments of \nconferees. This is a relatively new device--not unprecedented, but are \nwe going to start\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\ndoing it on every bill? I do not like it. We ought to go to conference \non Coast Guard authorization of conferees. Finally, we did it today \nafter being held up for, gee, 2 months.\n  I am going to try to go to appointment of conferees on health care. \nFor 80 days, it has been held up to appoint conferees on the health \ncare bill--80 days--while we have had these running negotiations. There \nhave been complaints that, ``Well, gee, we are not in on the \ndiscussions.'' How about regular order? How about we appoint conferees, \nmake sure it is a fair appointment, and go to conference.\n  I want to tell you who I recommend that we appoint on the health care \nconference: Senator Kassebaum. You know of her work in this area. She \nhas been very diligent. She voted against putting the medical savings \naccounts in the bill when it was on the floor of the Senate. She has \nsaid, standing right there, that she thinks what I have been working on \nand what we are trying to do is eminently fair and reasonable, and we \nought to go with the medical savings account compromise we have worked \nout. She wants to move this legislation. Senator Roth, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Moynihan, and myself, Senator Lott. There are five Senators \nthat are about as equally balanced as you could possibly get and allow \nthe majority party to have a one-vote edge with one of the Senators in \nthe majority certainly committed to getting the job done and certainly \nunbiased in what she wants to do and how it is achieved.\n  So we worked through that agreement and carried it out this week. I \nsaid Tuesday that, sundown Wednesday, we are back to business. Minimum \nwage, voted on. Small business tax relief, voted on. Finance Committee \nimprovements in the small business area, accepted. TEAM Act, voted on. \nRight to work, cloture motion, voted on. The decks are clear and ready \nto go.\n  Appropriations bills. DOD, Department of Defense appropriations bill. \nDo we need it? Is it the right thing for the country? Have we already \ndebated everything that is in it? Yes. The authorization bill. We spent \n2 weeks on that. Then, with a little cooperation at the end, we \nconcluded it and voted on it this week. That was clear. We have two of \nthe most effective managers of legislation in the Congress wanting to \nhandle this bill. Senator Stevens from Alaska and Senator Inouye from \nHawaii are ready to go. The truth of the matter is that if they had 40 \nminutes, they could probably finish it. They want to go to work. And \nthen it is blocked--blocked before an effort was even made on nuclear \nwaste.\n  Yesterday, we thought everything was all ready to go on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations. I am in my office and, all of a \nsudden, we are talking about nuclear waste, not on DOD. We blew 4 hours \nor more yesterday when we could have probably completed the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. But, again, in an abundance of wanting \nto be fair, I understand how important this is to the Senators from \nNevada. I am sympathetic to how they feel. But I am more sympathetic to \ndoing the job and doing what is right for all of America.\n\n  What about the Senators from Minnesota, who have nuclear waste piling \nup in their State to the limit, sitting out in cooling pools? If you \nwant to talk about the environment, this is the most dangerous issue in \nthis country--nuclear waste, sitting in open pools in Minnesota, in \nVermont, in Idaho, in South Carolina, North Carolina. It is all over \nAmerica. What about the other 48 Senators that are directly involved in \nthis nuclear waste issue and the States that are involved--sorry to get \ncarried away there. It is dangerous to be sitting here. This is worse \nthan nuclear waste.\n  I want to do it for the country's sake. Britain, France, Sweden, and \nJapan have stepped up and addressed the issue of nuclear waste. Yet, we \ncannot bring ourselves to deal with this. It is not easy. \nTransportation is a problem. Temporary storage and permanent storage. \nIt has to go somewhere. Nobody wants it. Nevada does not want it, \nnobody wants it.\n  But there are safe ways we can do this. It is the right thing to do. \nIt is right for the country. Now we found that not only did it delay us \nlast night--I thought we did the right thing to let the Senators talk \nand express their concerns; they were entitled to that. But they agreed \nthat we would close it up about 6 o'clock last night, and they agreed \nthat we would come back at 10 o'clock and we would be on the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. Lo and behold, I had a cup of coffee, \nand I woke up and, gee, we are back on nuclear waste again.\n  Now, I am trying my best, but for America's sake, I need some help on \nboth sides of this aisle so that we can move this legislation. I set up \ncampaign finance reform. I did not agree with it, did not like it, did \nnot want to waste the time of the Senate on it. I admit that. But we \nset up a fair and agreed-to process that Senator McCain of Arizona \nagreed to, Senator McConnell agreed to, and Senator Feingold, and \nothers, agreed to. We took it up, debated it, and we voted. Regular \norder.\n  On judges. You know, I do not like to not move appointments that are \nnot controversial. So I tried it. I tried four. It was objected to by a \nDemocrat because his judge was not on the list of four. So we worked on \nit and came back and said, ``Let us do the four and we will keep \ngoing.'' It was objected to by a Senator. He said, ``My judge is not on \nthe list.'' I said, ``OK, I will work on that.'' I put a lot of time \nand effort into it. I came back and said, ``How about 10?'' Then there \nwas objection to one of those that we worked out later on. So we took \none off and said, ``Here are nine; how about nine?'' That was objected \nto because there were, I guess, seven that were not on the list with \nthe nine. So if their judge was not on the list, they objected. So we \ncould not move nine. I said, ``Well, OK, I could not get four, could \nnot get 10, and could not get nine. How about one at a time?\"\n  I even, at the request of the Democratic leader--and I thought it was \na reasonable request--I gave him the list of the order for the next 2 \nweeks. We talked about it, and I told him I would keep working on it.\n  I am not interested in balling these things up. I am interested in \nmoving this place. So we lined up nine. When I brought the first one up \nthe day before yesterday, bam, objection again. But, overnight, some \nadditional consideration was given to it. Yesterday, we moved two. Yea, \ntwo. Two judges. Wonderful. I would like to do another one today and \nanother tomorrow.\n  My point in all of this is to say that I am trying. But now we find \nthat the Department of Defense appropriations bill is being held up. \nThe nuclear waste issue, which I was not going to bring up until \nFriday, lay down cloture, and vote on next Tuesday to see where we \nwere--and not a lot of cloture motions win around here. But now I had \nto file a cloture motion on nuclear waste.\n  Health insurance conferees--80 days it has been held up.\n  Taxpayer bill of rights--I mentioned that. I cannot imagine that \nanybody is going to stand up and admit they object to bringing this \nthing up.\n  White House Travel Office--we have had our fun with that. We have; \nyou have. Nobody in the end when we get to a vote is going to pass it \n98 to 2 or 100 to 0. Why not do that?\n  Gambling Impact Study Commission--I do not particularly like it. I do \nnot like national commissions. I do not like subpoena powers. My State \nis not particularly happy about it. But some are. A lot of people feel \ngambling is a problem in this country.\n  So I said, Look, it is supported by the distinguished Senators, like \nthe Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, a highly respected Senator; \nSenator Lugar from Indiana; Mr. Coats; Congressman Frank Wolf. I was \nnot going to stand in the way of bringing that up. I could not. So I \nwant to schedule it. I said let us bring it up, get UC, and move on. I \nwas told, ``Well, you know, we will probably have objection to that. \nMaybe we can work that out.'' I am ready.\n  The stalking bill--here is a bill that one night had been cleared, \nand all day. At the last minute, bam, it got stopped. I never did quite \nfigure out what the problem was with bringing up a bill that would have \nsome limit, some controls, on stalking of people and women and \nchildren. But I understand there is a little tete-a-tete thing going \non. I am willing to meet with the Senators involved and work that out. \nBut nobody in here is opposed to this stalking bill; not any of us.\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\n  So I am just beginning now to wonder what is going on here. We need \nto work together. We need to move these bills.\n  We need to move to the foreign ops appropriations bill. We need to do \nit tonight. Next week we need to do the legislative appropriations \nbill.\n  Treasury-Postal Service--we have work to do, and we are completely \nballed up. This is wrong.\n  So I have a series of unanimous-consent requests that I want to go \nthrough here now. I want to say up front to the distinguished leader \nthat this will not necessarily be the end of it for you or us. Maybe we \ncan work some of them out. I am ready. But as of right now we are \ncompletely balled up, and it is not my fault.\n  I want us all to sober up here now and get on with the business of \nthe Senate.\n  With that--and he has been very patient--I am glad to yield to the \nSenator from South Dakota who I know would like to help.\n  But we have to do it now. We cannot just keep talking about it.\n  I am beginning to feel like Charlie Brown. I keep running up to kick \nthe football, and it ``ain't'' there. I have tried one time, two times, \nand three times on the judges. I thought it was your ball. You know \nbecause it kept disappearing into your cloakroom.\n  Let us quit this stuff.\n  I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, now the majority leader knows why they \npay him much more now.\n  Mr. LOTT. They do? (Laughter.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that he has taken the \nspeech that I put in his desk from George Mitchell from about 2 years \nago and used it almost verbatim. Obviously, as leaders, we face these \nfrustrations with some frequency. I have learned that now myself over \nthe last 18 months.\n  I say to the distinguished majority leader that there are many things \nthat he has done since he has taken this office that many of us have \nfound to be very productive, and we appreciate his willingness to \ncooperate on so many things in the short time that he has been majority \nleader. I have been asked almost daily by members of the media how I \nview the first few weeks of the majority leader's tenure, and I have \ngiven him very high marks because of his determination to continue to \nfind ways to deal with the many issues that he has listed.\n\n  There have been times in this Congress when we have been able to \naccomplish a number of things. We passed the unfunded mandates bill \nlast year. We passed the line-item veto. We passed the congressional \naccountability legislation. We passed telecommunications reform. We \npassed in the Senate a couple of bills that may or may not ultimately \nbecome law, including welfare reform. We might be able to do that \nagain.\n  On those occasions where Democrats and Republicans have worked \ntogether, we have had overwhelming votes. Just this week we passed the \nminimum wage bill by an overwhelming vote in part because the \nleadership has been able to find ways to work together.\n  The majority leader made a point that he has had to file--he used the \nwords ``had to file''--a number of cloture motions. I must tell you \nthat I do not know why he and his predecessor have felt compelled so \noften to file cloture motions on the very day they lay a bill down.\n  How many times have we seen bills laid down and cloture motions filed \non the very first day? What kind of a message for bipartisanship does \nthat send? How many opportunities are we going to have to participate \nin the legislative process when that happens?\n  I would like to go through that list of all of those bills and find \nout how many times on the first or second day a cloture motion was \nfiled. That is not the way we used to do business around here. I hope \nwe can get back to the good old days when we legislated.\n  He mentioned conferences. He mentioned the fact that we have been \nreluctant to go to conference. There is one very simple reason for \nthat. We have been unable to go to conference because we do not know \nthey exist once we agree to them. There have been occasions--I cannot \ntell you how many--when we have agreed to go to conference, then \ndiscover that House and Senate Republicans find some room to meet and \nagree, and then they tell the other Democratic conferees what they have \nagreed to. That is the conference. We're not even told about it until \nit's over.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way to legislate. In the good old days \nit took Democrats and Republicans to make a conference.\n  The majority leader has at least expressed a desire to see more \nbipartisanship in conferences. I am very hopeful that happens because \nonce it does, we will be in a much better position to agree to go to \nconference.\n  Talk about kicking the ball. How about when you feel like you are the \nball? [Laughter.]\n  That is really what we are talking about here. It is not a question \nof where the ball is. The ball is here, and we are getting kicked. \n[Laughter.]\n  It is not a very advantageous position for us to be in.\n  Let me talk briefly about the health care reform conference. The \nmajority leader says conferees have been blocked for 80 days. Maybe it \nhas been so long that the majority leader has forgotten what happened \n80 days ago. Eighty days ago, the Senate voted on MSA's. The Senate \nvoted not to include MSA's in this portability bill. Why? Because we \nall agreed we wanted to keep our eye on the ball, so to speak. \n[Laughter.]\n  We wanted to be able to say, ``Look, we know that if expand this bill \nto include other kinds of things, nothing will get done.'' I had my own \nlist of thing I wish could have been added. In fact, one of the \ntoughest votes I have had to cast in a long time was against the \nmeasure offered by the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nMinnesota on mental health. I did not want to vote against that. But I \ncan recall so vividly the distinguished chair of the Labor Committee \nand the distinguished ranking member saying, ``Our plan is to oppose \nall amendments regardless of how good they may be because we know that, \nif this bill gets loaded up, nothing is going to get done.''\n\n  I do not know how much more visionary they could have been. How \nprophetic it was, because that is exactly what has happened. Eighty \ndays later, the bill languishes. Do you know what we are hung up on? We \nare hung up on the insistence of the minority that the majority accept \nits position and make sure it prevails in the conference. That is \nreally what we are talking about here.\n  They want to put MSA's back in the bill. We said, ``We are prepared \nto put MSA's back in the bill. But let us simply test it first. We have \nbeen debating about whether we can figure out a way to have a test that \nmeets with both sides' satisfaction. But why should we agree to go to \nconference with the likelihood that we would not even be in the room, \nbased on past performance? That has happened, and it is likely to \nhappen again, given the makeup of the committees.''\n  Now the leader has come up with a new MSA formula, and it is \ncertainly encouraging. But I am guessing that the Senate conferee will \nstill be in favor of MSA's.\n  In fact, I am sure that will be the conference position under the \nplan proposed by the majority leader. So if the Senate is on record in \nopposition to MSA's, again, it seems to me we feel like we are the \nfootball, and we're getting kicked again. We are just not going to do \nit.\n  If we can work out a way to ensure that we can reach an agreement in \na bipartisan fashion, I am all for it.\n  The last thing--the majority leader talked about the taxpayer bill of \nrights. Well, we may have amendments to the taxpayer bill of rights; \nthat's a matter we have been unable to work out up until today. As a \nresult of our negotiations, I think we can now work out our \ndifferences.\n  He talked about the White House Travel Office. Again, we have \namendments. We would like to be able to work out an arrangement that \nwould allow these amendments to be taken up.\n  The majority leader mentioned that he still cannot get the Gambling \nImpact Study Commission done. I want the Record to show that this is \nthe first request we have ever seen to clear the Gambling Impact Study \nCommission.\n  The distinguished majority leader mentioned the stalking bill. The \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\n[Mr. Lautenberg], proposed an amendment to the stalking bill weeks ago. \nRepublicans have that amendment for weeks. The reason the stalking bill \ndoes not come up--because they do not want that amendment added to this \nbill.\n  So that is the issue, Mr. President. We can deal with any one of \nthese bills. But it has to be in a bipartisan way.\n  That is all we are hoping we can do. We will continue to work with \nthe majority leader to make his tenure as majority leader less \nfrustrating and more productive. And I stand here ready to do it this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do feel a need to respond to some of the \nDemocrat leader's comments. First of all, after you pass a bill, you do \nnot take that proverbial ball we have been talking about and go home. \nYou go to conference. That is the way you do business around here.\n  Now, with regard to these cloture motions, about how we file them on \nthe first day that a bill is brought up, I learned that from Senator \nMitchell. He did it all the time.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident, an analysis of what has happened with regard to these \ncloture motions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        CLOTURE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE 103D AND 104TH CONGRESSES       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           103d    104th\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumber of legislative items having cloture filed against                \n them...................................................    20.0    28.0\nOf those cloture petitions, number filed on same day as                 \n legislative item is first laid before the Senate (or                   \n motion to proceed is made).............................    12.0    15.0\nThe average number of days of consideration of the                      \n remaining legislative items prior to a cloture petition                \n being filed............................................     4.6     4.6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Conclusion: The Republican majority filed 54 percent of \n     their cloture petitions on the first day a measure was \n     considered (or first motion to proceed made).\n       The Democrat majority filed 60 percent of their cloture \n     petitions on the first day.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. On this, it does compare cloture motions between the 103d \nand 104th Congress. The number of legislative items having cloture \nfiled against them in the 103d, 20, and 104th, 28. Of those cloture \nmotions, the number filed on the same day as a legislative item is \nfirst laid before the Senate or motion to proceed is made, 12 in the \n103d, and 15 in the 104th.\n  When I actually got a comparison here of first-day filings by the \nRepublican majority, I find it is 54 percent of their cloture motions \non the first day a measure was considered, the Democratic majority \nfiled 60 percent of their cloture motions on the first day.\n  So maybe we all need to do a little work on that. But our record is \nnot any worse--in fact, it is better--than the one we found from the \nprevious Congress when I believe Democrats were in charge.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. On that point, if the majority leader will yield \nbriefly, there are three categories: Amendable vehicles, motions to \nproceed, and conference reports.\n  Now, on the motions to proceed and conference reports, we will \ncompare notes here, but let us look at amendable vehicles and see what \nthe record is between Democrats and Republicans. I would like to put \nthat in the Record.\n  Mr. LOTT. My only point is we did not invent this procedure, and we \nhave not been any worse percentagewise than our predecessors.\n  Now, the next point, talking about how we have worked together, on \noccasion we have, but let us take the unfunded mandates. I remember \nthat one very well. I remember how long it took us at the beginning of \nlast year to pass a very popular bill that there should not have been \nany problem with. It took us 3 weeks--3 weeks--to get the unfunded \nmandates bill through here and then it passed 86 to 10--86 to 10.\n  Now, with regard to the conferences, I do not know what you are so \nhorrified about that maybe Republicans talk to each other when there is \na conference going on. I remember a crime bill on which Senator Simpson \nfrom Wyoming was working. I remember some sort of conference the \nDemocrats had excluded Republicans on a Sunday afternoon. I remember \nthat. We did not invent that procedure either.\n  But let me point this out. On three major issues that we have passed \nthis year and sent to the President--I was involved at the direction of \nSenator Dole in trying to help move those conferences--line-item veto, \nbipartisan effort; telecommunications, bipartisan effort--Senator \nHollings, Senator Pressler, Senator McCain, we were all there, \nbipartisan. I remember it. And again I did not like a lot of what was \ngoing on but Democrats were in that room when that final deal was made; \nsmall business regulatory relief. This Congress ought to be embarrassed \nthat we have not passed a big regulatory reform package. Fifty-eight \nSenators voted for that, and yet it languishes in the Senate because we \ncannot get 60 votes once again for cloture. But we did in a bipartisan \nway pass small business regulatory reform.\n  On the health care issue, the vote in the Senate, I remind my \ncolleagues, was a very close one, 52 to 46. And if the vote were held \ntoday in the Senate on the experiment proposal that we have offered, it \nwould pass, I would be willing to bet you, overwhelmingly. And by the \nway, the President has accepted the concept of a broad-based experiment \nfor medical savings accounts. Now, you might argue over the word \n``broad,'' but we are not talking about 2,000 or 10,000. You are \ntalking about several hundreds of thousands would be involved in this \nmedical savings account experiment.\n  My colleagues, we have won. The American people have won. Why do we \nnot declare victory? We have said we will go with an experiment. You \nhave said the President has said, ``I will accept it.'' What is the \nproblem?\n  I know, there are a lot of details that need to be ironed out; you \nhave to understand every little word, exactly how the deductibles will \nbe determined, and when would there be a vote, and how would there be a \nvote to extend it, sunset it or whatever. You know where you work those \nout? Not running up and down the hall out here and your office or my \noffice. You work it out in a conference. We can negotiate, go back and \nforth with the Senator from Massachusetts until the cows come home, but \nsooner or later we have to go to conference and work it out.\n\n  Now, talk about compromise. I wish this bill had medical malpractice \nin it. But the conferees have already agreed, the House has agreed to \nrecede, take that out. We want it. I want it. But we want legitimate \nportability, ability to carry your insurance between jobs. We want an \nopportunity to deal with preexisting illnesses. We think it is \nimportant that the self-employed be able to deduct more of the costs of \ntheir health insurance premiums. But compromise is under way.\n  The so-called MEWA's--a Washington word, but the ability of small \nbusinesses to form pools to give coverage to their workers, I do not \nunderstand--I will never understand--why the Federal Government should \nbe telling small businesses you cannot form pools to provide coverage \nto your workers. In these fast food restaurants, the majority of the \nworkers cannot get and the employers cannot provide health coverage. \nBut if they could form a pool with the restaurant association or the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, they could get it. But \nthat was dropped in an effort to show good faith and compromise. We \nhave bent over backwards, I have bent over backwards to try to be \nreasonable in coming to a compromise, and we are close enough we ought \nto go to conference with a fair group of conferees and get the job \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7745-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7748-S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1894\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like the Record to show, as a matter \nof fact, they did receive notice on this. We have been talking back and \nforth about it for days. I believe Senator Simon had indicated he \nthought it had been cleared. A couple of Senators who had earlier had \nreservations on the Democratic side had indicated they would not \nobject. You have seen it. There is no great big surprise here. There \nwas a chance, I think, 3 weeks ago, to read it and reread it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, usually we do these things leader to \nleader. I will be happy to talk to Senator\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\nThomas about the legislative calendar, or I might be able to talk to \nother Members of the Senate Republican caucus, but I prefer to deal \nwith the majority leader. I think we ought to see the reciprocal here. \nI have not had a chance to see it or check with my colleagues. Until \nthat happens, nothing is going to get done on this side.\n  Mr. LOTT. As I indicated earlier, I will be glad to try this again \nlater on today once you have a chance to talk to your colleagues. I \nwill be glad to come back to this at 4, 5, 6 o'clock, so we can deal \nwith this issue. I know there are Senators interested in it on both \nsides. So I will put you on notice, I have tried to bring it up. I will \ntry it again later. If we do not get it today, I will try it again \ntomorrow.\n  At some point, I want to say this, if the objection continues to be \nheard that would bring it up under unanimous consent, then I will want \nto schedule time for it and move to bring it up, have some debate. I am \nwilling to do that, too. I am just trying to find a way to get some of \nthese things up and get them considered.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we might want to bring it up under \nregular order. I am told, just now, we may have amendments to the \nlegislation. So that might be the most appropriate vehicle.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might say, if there are going to be a lot of amendments \nto what I thought was going to be relatively noncontroversial, that \nwill affect when it comes up, because we do have appropriations bills \nthat take priority over everything else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7749-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2980\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I had hoped that we could come to some \nagreement with regard to these numerous matters that we had taken up, \nbut it does not look like that is going to be possible; therefore, I \nintend to ask unanimous consent again on a number of items.\n  There has been a concerted effort on behalf of the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, and the \nSenator from Idaho, Senator Craig, and the Senators from Nevada to see \nif an agreement could be reached.\n  I thought we had one that was time-consuming but fair to all \nconcerned, but at the last minute it appears that that is not possible \nafter an effort to get an agreement that would have allowed the nuclear \nwaste issue to be brought up later on in July, I think the 23d, for \nlimited debate, a vote on cloture, then bringing it back up after the \nAugust recess, the first day we are back, with a vote and then 30 hours \nof debate, and then a vote on final passage, and then go to conference.\n  That is an awful lot of time when the Senate has limited time to do \nits work, but it is a way to allow the Senators from Nevada to make \ntheir point and to get this issue resolved. But then we find, no; they \nwant to reserve the ability to add three more hurdles to filibuster and \nget votes on going to conference. That was a river too far. There is a \nlimit to what we can do in terms of agreeing to what is obviously just, \nyou know, a dilatory agreement. So it was not acceptable in that \ncondition.\n  We will be in session tomorrow. Hopefully we can make some progress \nthen. If not, we will go next Tuesday to the cloture vote. But it does \ngridlock the Senate. The inability to get this agreement between the \nkey players ties up the Department of Defense appropriations bill and \nties up everything else that is pending around here. I think that is \nreally unfortunate because we need to get the agreement on these issues \nif at all possible.\n\n  Perhaps there has been some positive result of our discussions \nearlier today. At least now I do have something in writing with regard \nto the medical savings accounts. I just received it within the last 15 \nminutes. I will take a serious look at it and discuss it with the key \nSenators involved on the Republican side in the House and Senate. We \nneed to get this done.\n  I still find it indefensible that we have not appointed conferees on \nhealth insurance reform for 80 days. I have the conferees. It is a fair \ndivision. Even if we get an agreement on the medical savings accounts, \nwe still are going to need a conference to agree on the final\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\ndetails of exactly what the rest of the bill will entail even though \nalmost everybody knows what is in it. But we need to make sure that the \nSenators and the Congressmen on both sides have a chance to go over it \nand make sure that the words are as we think they are supposed to be.\n  So I am very disappointed about this. I even wondered once again if \nthere was an intent not to have any votes tonight or tomorrow from the \nvery beginning. The Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, \nassured me that is not the case, and I accept his word. But it sure \nlooks to me like maybe there was some knowledge that there were not \ngoing to be any votes tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader raises the question on the floor, so \nI think it is important that I again reiterate to him for the Record \nthat there was absolutely no desire on my part to avoid doing business, \nwhatever the business may be. There are obviously some very serious \nquestions that the distinguished Senators from Nevada have attempted to \nraise in light of their concern on nuclear waste. But at no time have I \ninstructed members of our caucus that they should feel free to leave.\n  Our desire is to get some work done, regardless of whether we make a \ngreat deal of progress or not, at least to be here to try to get the \nwork done. I have emphasized that. I cautioned them not to leave \nbecause there could be votes either tonight or tomorrow. I reiterate \nthat statement now, as I did this afternoon in our Democratic policy \ncommittee. So I think that point ought to be very clear to everybody. I \nhope we can put that rumor to rest once and for all.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that assurance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to totally confirm what the Democratic leader has \nsaid. I am one of the more senior Members on our side, and I certainly \nwould be one who would have known had there been any such plan. I can \nassure both leaders that had there been such, I would not be here \ntalking to the two Senators, I would probably be on the front porch of \nmy farm in Vermont right now planning to spend the weekend seeing \nconstituents and working from my computer connection in Vermont rather \nthan here.\n  So I can assure both my friends, who are my friends, the two leaders, \nthat had there been any such plan on this side, first, I would have \nknown about it, but, second, I would be in Vermont by now.\n  Mr. LOTT. Having been through good times and bad times with the \nSenator from Vermont, that is very comforting. I accept that, and I \nthank the Senator for that assurance.\n  Can I inquire of the Democratic leader if there is a possibility we \ncould get an agreement on the taxpayers bill of rights tonight? I \nthought we kind of worked through that. I think it could maybe be some \nsign of good faith here if we could get that done. Again, it is \nbipartisan. The American people deserve it. Why do we not do it? If it \nwould be possible, I would like to try to get that agreed to tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, responding to the distinguished majority \nleader, we have consulted with the senior Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn. It is my understanding that, on the assumption that we can \ninsert in the Record at the time of the consideration of H.R. 2337 a \ncolloquy between Senators Roth and Glenn concerning confidentiality of \nrecords, I think we would be prepared to move the taxpayers bill of \nrights. That is assuming, of course--and the distinguished majority \nleader has been very good about moving these judges and keeping them \nahead, but I would like to do that as well today if we could.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we could get this done, then we could maybe--I have \nalways maintained that the only way you get these things moving is to \nget them moving one at a time. If we get a little reciprocity, we get a \nlittle something here and something there, then we can get this \nlocomotive moving again.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me respond to the taxpayers bill of rights. It is my \nunderstanding, with regard to Senator Glenn's concerns, that the \nFinance Committee chairman has agreed to move, in a future appropriate \ntax bill, Senator Glenn's amendment to impose criminal penalties for \nthe unauthorized browsing of confidential taxpayer information by IRS \nemployees. I believe that is the assurance that he wanted. That is my \nunderstanding, and I feel sure that would be lived up to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am informed that that is the commitment he was looking \nfor. On that basis, I think we would be prepared to move to that \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. BRYAN. What is the nature of the unanimous-consent agreement that \nis being propounded?\n  Mr. LOTT. I did not actually propound one. I am asking whether it is \npossible that the concerns that have been raised have been worked out. \nI understand they have been, and this would be a unanimous-consent \nrequest to pass the taxpayers bill of rights. In view of that, let me \ngo through, then, some requests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7750-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7751-S7752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1936\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for an agreement with regard to \nnuclear waste. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1936, the nuclear waste bill, on Tuesday, July 23, \nat 12 noon, and immediately after the bill is called up, the majority \nleader be recognized for the purpose of filing a cloture motion on the \nbill, and there then be 15 minutes for debate prior to the cloture \nvote.\n  This is the latest version. The time is equally divided in the usual \nform, with the cloture vote occurring at 2:15 on Tuesday, July 23. If \ncloture is invoked, the bill will immediately be laid aside and it will \nbecome the pending business on Tuesday, September 3, 1996, at a time to \nbe determined by the two leaders; and following final passage of the \nbill, if in the affirmative, then it would be in order for the Senate \nto insist on its amendments, if applicable, request a conference with \nthe House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \nof the Senate, all without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire of the Senator from Nevada what his \nobjection is to that?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would be happy to state my objection. As you know, the \nSenators from Nevada have worked with the majority leader, with those \non the other side of the aisle who are proponents of this legislation. \nWe have had an exchange of proposals, as the majority leader knows, \nduring the course of this afternoon.\n  The latest proposal that was brought back by the other side of the \naisle had a provision in it which had not previously been discussed and \nwas unacceptable, so we could not accept it.\n  Mr. LOTT. The provision with regard to going to conference?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is the provision that had not heretofore been \ndiscussed, as the majority leader knows, and we had assumed within the \nparameters of what was being discussed all rights would be reserved \nunder rule XXII, including any options that might be available to us in \nthe event that this legislation moved to conference.\n  So it was on that basis that we interposed our objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to make sure I understood. I just note that if every \nopportunity was taken with regard to going to conference, that could \nlead to at least three more votes, three more debatable motions, and \nwould take up days, and therefore without that, we have accomplished \nalmost nothing with that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I do have the right to object. I think there has been an \nobjection. I say respectfully to my friend the majority leader and to \nthe minority leader, we have an obligation to move legislation along \nhere. We agree with the statement of the majority leader, we should \nmove legislation, but take it a step at a time.\n  What we thought we were doing, the Senators from Nevada, is moving \nthis--\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nwe were jumping two steps. We were willing to do away with those, but \nwe cannot waive all of our rights, and we know how important it is to \nmove legislation. We felt that by going directly to the Defense \nappropriations bill, getting that completed, doing other things that \nwill be able to be completed, without the two Senators from Nevada \nexercising their rights--under the rules, we felt we were doing the \ncountry and the two leaders here, in effect, a favor, but to have us \navoid three or four different procedural moves that we have, seems to \nbe a little bit too much.\n\n  We appreciate you trying to work with us. I object.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7751-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7752-S7753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1894\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent during the pendency \nof S. 1894, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, that it be \nconsidered under the following time restraints: 1 hour on the bill to \nbe equally divided in the usual form, 1 hour on all first-degree \namendments which must be relevant, 30 minutes on all relevant second-\ndegree amendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that any rollcall votes ordered with \nrespect to the DOD appropriations bill on Friday, July 12, on Monday, \nJuly 15, occur beginning at 9:30 a.m., on Tuesday, July 16, and \nfollowing the disposition of all amendments, S. 1894 be read for a \nthird time, the Senate proceed immediately to H.R. 3610, the House \ncompanion bill, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of \nS. 1894, as amended, be inserted, and H.R. 3610 be read for a third \ntime, and final passage occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, July 16, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, and that no call for the regular order serve \nto displace the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, as I state that, I want to emphasize no matter what \nhappens on the nuclear waste issue, we still have this Department of \nDefense appropriations bill awaiting action. The chairman is here ready \nto go. I am trying to get some order and some reasonable manner in \nwhich to handle this very important bill.\n  I am glad to yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is an objection heard?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is an objection? I thought that was cleared on the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is a cloture motion pending, which I understand \nwill ripen into a vote on Tuesday. We are not in session on Monday, but \nit would be Monday if we are in session.\n  I regret that very much. This will accomplish the same thing. Under \ncloture, we will have an hour on each amendment, actually have an hour \non two amendments if you wish to do so, but Mr. President, we have lost \n2 days in the defense bill already. We will have a very tough time to \ntry and conference this bill. We are trying our best to work with the \nadministration to see if we can get the bill signed once again this \nyear. The Senator from Hawaii and I have accommodated the White House \non several matters already. We are trying to work this out, but we need \ntime.\n  I think the Senator is putting us in the position where we are not \ngoing to be able to go out in August if we keep this up. I do not \nunderstand the objection to this because it is the same thing--if we \nhad voted cloture on Tuesday, by definition, we cannot get to it until \nTuesday, anyway. I do not know why we cannot proceed with this bill.\n  The alternative, as far as I am concerned, it is the pending measure \nand I am going to ask the distinguished leader that we just stay in on \nthis bill. I can guarantee the Senator we will have some votes tonight \nand tomorrow if we stay in. The bill is the pending measure, and I \nwould like to stay in and get going on this bill. I do not know what \nthe leader wants to do.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield, if the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I respectfully say to my friend from Alaska, through the \nmajority leader, that we understand the rules also--maybe not as well \nas the distinguished Senator from Alaska. We feel we know what our \nrights are. If it is the wish of the Senate to stay in tonight, that is \nfine. But I think there is going to be a lot of business conducted.\n  We have been willing to play by the rules. To hear that we are \nholding up progress in the Senate is also to understand that we feel \nthat a lot of the time being wasted, if not all the time, is based on \nthe fact that we have a bill that was brought out that is very \nselective in nature. We have all kinds of other things we need to do. \nThe President said he will veto this. We feel the waste of time is not \non the shoulders of the two Senators from Nevada. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Alaska did not mean it that way, but in fact if there is some \neffort to threaten, or the fact that we will be in late tonight, I have \nno place else to go. I will be here late tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent we have a cloture vote on the \ndefense appropriations bill at 7 o'clock tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I feel constrained to say, over the last \nrecess I had the privilege of being able to fish at home on the river, \nand the men and women from throughout the country kept asking me one \nthing: What is gridlock? Why do we have gridlock? I think the American \npublic is getting very disturbed about this. I have to say, it is \nobvious I am getting disturbed.\n  We have worked a long time to frame a bill that I think is possible \nto pass both the Senate and come out of conference, and go to the \nPresident. I think it is one of the most contentious issues facing \nAmerica today, and that is the continued funding of our defense system. \nI do not understand why we cannot get going on it. It has nothing to do \nwith nuclear waste. It has nothing to do with delay on nuclear waste. \nNuclear waste will be the subject of a cloture motion vote on Tuesday. \nI just do not understand why we have to be gridlocked on defense. Of \nall the matters that we ought to be dealing with, it is defense. Why \nshould we have a gridlock on defense? The people in this country, I \nthink, have a right to ask this Congress why should you gridlock on \ndefense? This is a gridlock, as far as I am concerned. We have tried \nfor 2 days to get this bill going and the delay has nothing to do with \ndefense, I am told, nothing at all. If it has nothing to do with \ndefense, why should anyone object to our proceeding with this bill?\n  I hope the leader will let me continue. I can show you how we will \nhave some votes tonight and tomorrow. I can guarantee you we will have \nvotes if we keep going.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I listened to the Senator from Alaska, there is a way \nto break through all this.\n  As I hear the Senators in Nevada, they will not object to moving to \nthe defense bill at all. As a matter of fact, as long as I have known \nthem, they have worked hard on those bills, as hard as anyone else \nhere. But they are saying, if this particular bill dealing with nuclear \nwaste would be pulled, they would not object. If I might ask my \nfriends, are they not saying that the reason they are objecting is \nbecause they are bringing this nuclear waste bill forward?\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield so that I may answer the \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield for the Senator to answer the question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from California, I am a supporter of \nthis bill. I am on the Appropriations Committee. One of the most \ntroubling things I have done since I have been in the Senate is to have \nmy friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, come to me and say, ``Can we \nmove this bill?'' and I say, ``No.'' There is no one in the Senate I \nhave more respect for than the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  We feel that the shoe is on the other foot. We are not the ones \nholding things up. It is being held up because they are moving on this \nbill, which the President said he is going to veto. Maybe we cannot \ncontinue this forever.\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\nBut it is going to take weeks of the Senate's time on nuclear waste.\n  We know what our rights are, and we felt that we offered a reasonable \nproposal to move this along, get the appropriations bills done before \nthe September reconvening of the Senate. But this is an issue that is \nimportant. It is important not only to the people in the State of \nNevada but for this country. And for us to say we are going to walk \naway from this would be something that we cannot do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the comments. Again, I \nhave said several times today that I understand the feelings of the \nSenators from Nevada. I am sympathetic to them. But this legislation \nhas been crafted very carefully, in a bipartisan way, by the committee \nof jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It has \nbeen in the making literally for years. I am under the impression that \n65 Senators will vote to end the debate on this, will vote for cloture.\n  How can the majority leader refuse to bring up a bill and try to pass \na bill of this consequence, which involves radioactive nuclear waste, \nwhen 65 Senators want an opportunity to vote on it? Now, I understand \nhow they feel, but two Senators are thwarting the wishes of 65 Senators \nand their constituents all across America. I have no option but to \nbring up legislation of this importance, which involves that many \nStates with that many Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the majority leader this. I understand his \npoint, but 74 or so Senators voted for the minimum wage, and we do not \nseem to get action on that. So it is a matter of priorities, I say.\n  Mr. LOTT. You got action on it because I worked with your leader and \nwe made it happen, and it is going to be acted on and wind up on the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to, sure.\n  Mr. REID. I say, respectfully, to the majority leader, with whom I \nserved in the House in a leadership position there and now in a \nleadership position here, that we know you have the right to bring this \nup. But, also, I, the Senator from Nevada, did not work out these \nrules. These rules were worked out many years ago. It started with the \nConstitution and the Senate rules that are in existence. I did not draw \nthem up. I am just playing by the rules. The majority leader knew--or \nshould have known, as we say in the law--that this would happen. You \nare--and I do not mean ``you'' in the pejorative sense--holding up the \nprogress; we are not. We could move on and we could have this bill \npassed, the one now before the body, our defense appropriations bill. \nWe could do foreign operations. This should have all been done. But \nthere is going to be a lot more delay, I say to my friends, the \nmajority and minority leaders. We have certain rights, and we have an \nobligation to protect those.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7752-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7753-S7756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS 2\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of Calendar No. 374, H.R. 2337, the taxpayer \nbill of rights legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2337) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide for increased taxpayer protections.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights 2 which provides taxpayers with added protections in their \ndealings with the Internal Revenue Service. I urge the President to \nsign this bipartisan legislation.\n  One of my longstanding concerns relates to serious complaints by \ntaxpayers that the tax laws can and are being enforced unfairly by the \nInternal Revenue Service. With the broad authority conferred on this \nagency, the Internal Revenue Service has the potential to abuse its \npower at the expense of law-abiding and well-meaning taxpayers. The \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights 2 is the taxpayers' arsenal against an often \nheavy-handed IRS.\n  When the Federal Government thinks it has more rights to your \npaycheck than you do, something is terribly wrong with the system. That \nis why this legislation, which returns power to the taxpayers, is so \nimportant. While it is not a complete solution by any means, it is a \ngood first step.\n  The Finance Committee has worked on this legislation for several \nyears on a bipartisan basis. I would like to give special recognition \nto Senators Grassley and Pryor for their tenacity in pursuing enactment \nof these taxpayer protections.\n  Let me also mention that the procedure for this is somewhat unique. \nIn the usual course, a tax bill from the House of Representatives would \nbe referred to the Senate Finance Committee for review before \nconsideration by the full Senate. However, Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 \nprovisions were previously approved by the Finance Committee and \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. The Finance Committee worked closely with the Ways \nand Means Committee on this new bill, which was unanimously passed by \nthe House of Representatives. In order to expedite passage of this \nimportant legislation, I decided that this bill should bypass the \nFinance Committee and go directly to the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, the bill provides the following provisions which \nincrease taxpayer protections:\n\n\n              1. Establish Office of The Taxpayer Advocate\n\n  The bill establishes a taxpayer advocate, which would replace the \ntaxpayer ombudsman, at the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] to assist \ntaxpayers. The taxpayer advocate must annually provide an independent \nreport to Congress without review or censure by Treasury or the IRS.\n\n\n                2. Expand Taxpayer Assistance Authority\n\n  The bill provides the taxpayer advocate with additional tools to help \ntaxpayers deal with the IRS. In order to prevent the IRS from dragging \nits feet in complying with the taxpayer advocate's orders, the bill \nrequires such matters to be resolved on a timely basis.\n\n\n     3. Notice of Reason for Termination of Installment Agreements\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to notify taxpayers 30 days before \naltering, modifying, or terminating any installment agreement for \npaying taxes. An exception is provided if collection is in jeopardy.\n\n\n    4. Administrative Review of Termination of Installment Agreement\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to establish an additional administrative \nreiew before terminating installment agreements.\n\n\n                 5. Expand Authority to Abate Interest\n\n  The bill expands the IRS's ability to abate interest due to IRS error \nor delay.\n\n\n          6. Judicial Review of IRS Failure to Abate Interest\n\n  The bill grant the Tax Court jurisdiction to review whether the IRS's \nfailure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n               7. Extend Interest-free Period to Pay Tax\n\n  The bill extends the interest-free period to pay tax from 10 to 21 \ncalendar days from noticve and demand when the total tax liability is \nless than $100,000.\n\n\n          8. Abate Penalty for Failure to Deposit Payroll Tax\n\n  The bill allows the IRS to abate penalties for certain inadvertent \nfailures to deposit payroll tax.\n\n\n          9. Studies of Joint Return Issues Must Be Conducted\n\n   10. Joint return May Be Made after Separate Returns Without Full \n                      Payment of Joint Return Tax\n\n 11. Disclosure of Collection Activities with Respect to Joint Returns\n\n  The bill requires the IRS, upon request, to disclose in writing \nwhether the IRS has attempted to collect unpaid taxes from the other \nindividual who joined in the filing of a joint return.\n\n\n                    12. Withdrawal of Notice of Lien\n\n  The bill allows the IRS to withdraw a public notice of tax lien prior \nto full payment by the indebted taxpayer. Upon request, the IRS must \nmake reasonable efforts to notify credit agencies, etc.\n\n\n                     13. return of levied property\n\n  The bill allows the IRS to return levied property without full \npayment of tax debt.\n\n\n               14. modify certain levy exemption amounts\n\n  The bill increases the amount exempt from a tax levy for personal \nproperty\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\nfrom $1,650 to $2,500 and for books and tools of a trade from $1,100 to \n$1,250. These amounts will be indexed after 1997.\n\n\n                        15. offers-in-compromise\n\n  The bill streamlines the procedure for settling tax debts under \n$50,000 by increasing from $500 to $50,000 the amount requiring a \nwritten opinion from the Office of Chief Counsel in order to settle a \ntax debt.\n\n\n     16. civil damages for fraudulent filing of information returns\n\n  The bill creates a civil cause of action by an individual against any \nperson who files a fraudulent information return with respect to \npurported payments made to the individual. The plaintiff may obtain the \ngreater of $5,000 or the actual amount of damages, costs, and \nattorney's fees.\n\n\n  17. irs must conduct reasonable investigation of information returns\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to prove that its position in court was \nsubstantially justified if a taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute with \nrespect to an information return and fully cooperates with the IRS. The \nIRS is not presumed to be correct as under current law.\n\n\n    18. awarding of costs and fees: irs must prove its position was \n                        substantially justified\n\n  The bill provides that once a taxpayer substantially prevails over \nthe IRS in a tax dispute, the IRS has the burden of proving that its \nposition was substantially justified. The taxpayer may be awarded \nattorney's fees if the IRS does not meet its burden.\n\n\n  19. increase limit on attorney's fees from $75 to $110 per hour and \n                           indexed after 1996\n\n        20. failure to agree to extension not taken into account\n\n  The bill provides that in making a determination whether a taxpayer \nis eligible for an attorney's fees award, any failure to agree to an \nextension of the statute of limitations may not be considered in \ndetermining whether a taxpayer exhausted administrative remedies.\n\n\n    21. award of litigation costs permitted in declaratory judgment \n                              proceedings\n\n  The bill eliminates the present-law restrictions on awarding \nattorney's fees in all declaratory judgment proceedings.\n\n\n   22. increase limit on recovery of civil damages for unauthorized \n                           collection actions\n\n  The bill increase--from $100,000 to $1 million--the amount a taxpayer \nmay be awarded for reckless or intentional action by an IRS officer or \nemployee.\n\n\n 23. court discretion to reduce award for litigation costs for failure \n                   to exhaust administrative remedies\n\n  The bill permits, but does not require, a court to reduce an award if \nthe taxpayer has not exhausted administrative remedies.\n\n\n                   24. preliminary notice requirement\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to issue a notice to an individual the IRS \nhas determined to be a responsible person for unpaid trust fund taxes, \ni.e., payroll taxes, at least 60 days before issuing a notice and \ndemand penalties.\n\n\n25. disclosure of certain information where more than one person liable \n                              for penalty\n\n  The bill requires the IRS, if requested in writing by a person the \nIRS believes is responsible for unpaid trust fund taxes, to disclose in \nwriting information about collection activity against others for the \nsame tax liability.\n\n\n26. right of contribution where more than one person liable for penalty\n\n  The bill creates a Federal cause of action for contribution. Persons \nwho paid an amount in excess of their proportionate share of trust fund \ntax penalties may sue other responsible persons for their proportionate \nshare. The proceeding must be separate from an IRS proceeding.\n\n\n27. volunteer board members of tax-exempt organizations are exempt from \n                                penalty\n\n  The bill clarifies that volunteer, unpaid board members serving on an \nhonorary basis are not subject to responsible person penalties for \nunpaid trust fund taxes.\n\n\n           28. enrolled agents are third-party record keepers\n\n            29. safeguards relating to designated summonses\n\n  The bill limits the issuance of designated summonses to examinations \ninvolving the largest 1600 corporate taxpayers and requires review by \nregional counsel before issuance.\n\n\n30. annual report on number of designated summonses within preceding 12 \n                                 months\n\n    31. relief from retroactive application of treasury department \n                regulations within 18 month safe-harbor\n\n  The bill generally prohibits Treasury regulations from being \neffective before publication in the Federal Register. Exceptions are \nprovided to prevent abuse or if the regulation is filed or issued \nwithin 18 months of enactment of the statute to which it relates. \nTaxpayers may elect to retroactively apply a regulation.\n\n\n 32. information returns must include the phone number of the contact \n                                 person\n\n          33. required notice to taxpayers of certain payments\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to make reasonable efforts to notify within \n60 days taxpayers who have made payments which the IRS cannot trace to \nthe taxpayer.\n\n\n34. Civil Damages for Unauthorized Enticement of Information Disclosure\n\n  The bill allows a taxpayer to sue the United States for up to \n$500,000 if any officer or employee of the United States intentionally \ncompromises collection or determination of tax due from an attorney, \ncertified public accountant, or enrolled agent representing the \ntaxpayer in exchange for information concerning the taxpayer's tax \nliability.\n\n\n      35. annual reminders to taxpayers with outstanding tax debts\n\n     36. Five-year extension of authority for undercover operations\n\n  The bill allows the IRS to churn the income earned in an undercover \noperation to pay for its expenses.\n\n\n             37. disclosure of returns on cash transactions\n\n  Any person who receives more than $10,000 in cash in one transaction, \nor two or more related transactions must file a form with the IRS. The \nbill allows the IRS to disclose information from this form to other \nFederal and State agencies.\n\n\n    38. disclosure of returns and return information to designee of \n                                taxpayer\n\n  The bill deletes the word ``written'' from the requirement that \nwritten consent from a taxpayer is required for disclosure of taxpayer \ninformation. This change facilitates development of the tax system \nmodernization projects.\n\n\n   39. report on netting of interest on overpayments and liabilities\n\n  The bill requires Treasury to conduct a study on the netting of \ninterest on overpayments and underpayment.\n\n\n 40. Use of non-postal delivery services for timely-mailing-as-timely-\n                              filing rule\n\n  Under current law, only items mailed with the U.S. Postal Service are \ndeemed filed with the IRS when they are mailed. The bill expands the \ntimely-mailing-as-timely-filing rule to designated delivery services.\n\n\n           41. annual reports on misconduct by IRS employees\n\n  The bill requires the IRS to make annual reports to the tax writing \ncommittees on all allegations of IRS employee misconduct.\n  Mr. President, passage of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 is the first \nstep in eliminating unfair enforcement of our tax laws by giving \ntaxpayers an arsenal against the IRS. I again urge my colleagues to \napprove this important legislation and urge President Clinton to sign \nit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate a few years \nback, one of the first bills I introduced was the Taxpayers' Bill of \nRights, to protect taxpayers in disputes with the Internal Revenue \nService. At that time I noted:\n\n       Oliver Wendell Holmes reasoned that ``Taxes are what we pay \n     for a civilized society.'' However, Justice Holmes did not \n     consider additional burdens imposed on taxpayers--added costs \n     and delays that result from inefficiencies and \n     inconsistencies in the administration of tax law.\n\n  That was back in 1979. And it took a while, but we finally scored a \nbig win in 1988 with the enactment of a comprehensive Taxpayer Bill of \nRights. That went a long ways toward defining taxpayer rights and \nproviding protection against arbitrary actions by the IRS.\n  The Taxpayers' Bill of Rights required the IRS to give at least 30 \ndays written notice before levying on a taxpayers' property, so that he \nor she would have time to file an appeal. It\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nexpanded the kinds of property exempt from IRS levies, and raised the \nwage total exempt from collection. It allowed taxpayers to collect \ncosts and attorney's fees from the Government if the IRS was not \nsubstantially justified in bringing an action. And it let taxpayers sue \nthe Government for damages if IRS employees acted recklessly in \ncollecting taxes or intentionally disregarded any provision of the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  These were important steps toward accountability and fairness. But \nthey did not solve all the problems. A few years ago I spent a day \nworking at Rocky Mountain Log Homes in Hamilton, MT. The business is \nowned by Mark Moreland and a couple of partners. They put together \nprefabricated log homes, which add a lot of value to the timber and \ncreate skilled, high-paying jobs. These homes sell all over the world, \nand are especially popular in Japan.\n  But then last year, Mark sent me a letter to tell me about the \ntrouble he was having with the Service on an ``independent contractor'' \nissue. The dispute goes all the way back to 1986.\n  Mark went through many meetings with the Service, including two \nmeetings in which he thought the matter had been settled. But then in \n1995--9 years later--he was told that the matter remained ``open'' and \nthat they owed the IRS a great deal of money.\n  So I wrote to the Commissioner to ask what was going on. But we did \nnot get much satisfaction. Mark wrote me a couple of months later to \nlet me know how it went. He said:\n\n       I felt you would want to know what has happened \n     subsequently. In spite of your efforts, the IRS pursued the \n     matter and we were forced to retain counsel. Our attorney was \n     able to keep the IRS from attaching our assets and challenged \n     their contentions based on the IRS' 20 point test. For \n     several months we were forced to produce documents and try to \n     refute their position.\n       Once we were on the brink of going to court on the matter, \n     we received the enclosed communication. Unbelievably, they \n     had disposed of all the pertinent records related to our case \n     back in 1986! They had absolutely no basis for attempting to \n     collect the original $28,000 let alone the additional $60,000 \n     to $70,000 in penalties and interest. Through what can only \n     be referred to as a bluff, they threatened and postured, \n     hoping we would roll over and pay. The cost to us in legal \n     fees, time lost from our businesses and practices, and mental \n     anguish is immense.\n\n  So here is a case in which the IRS, with little justification to \nbegin with, and at the end with no evidence at all, put a good business \nthrough 9 years of misery. And Mark's experience is not an isolated \nevent. I have received many letters--far too many--who have gone \nthrough experiences like his. Good, law-abiding people are fed up with \nthe means the IRS uses to resolve disputes with taxpayers. It is no \nwonder that many believe the IRS should be eliminated and the current \ntax system torn out by the roots.\n  Today we will do something to help. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights II \nbuilds off the start we made in 1989. To be specific, it creates an \nOffice of Taxpayer Advocate within the IRS to help taxpayers resolve \ntheir problems with the IRS; expands the ability of taxpayers to take \nthe IRS to court in order to abate interest; raises the damages a \ntaxpayer can collect in the event an IRS agent recklessly or \nintentionally disregards the Internal Revenue Code from $100,000 to $1 \nmillion; and eases the burden of proof a taxpayer must show in order to \ncollect attorney's fees and costs when he or she successfully \nchallenges an IRS decision.\n  These are commonsense ideas. They will help folks like Mark who are \nvictimized by reckless and irresponsible IRS procedures. So let's pass \nthis bill, and restore some fairness and accountability to tax \ncollection in this country.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend Majority \nLeader Lott for taking up the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II so that we can \nconsider and pass this necessary legislation quickly. I have worked \nwith others for a long time to finally get this done.\n  As most taxpayers have struggled to file their taxes by the deadline \nlast April 15, and we recognize Tax Freedom Day today, the issue of \ntaxpayers' rights takes on a special importance. Although most IRS \nemployees provide valuable and responsible service, taxpayer abuse by \nthe Government is an ongoing problem. With this in mind, I am very \nhappy to have joined Senator Pryor and others in reintroducing the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II in the Senate, as S. 258. This is very \nnecessary legislation that builds upon the original Taxpayer Bill of \nRights passed into law in 1988, sponsored by Senator Pryor and myself.\n  For me, the long process of trying to ensure taxpayer protections \nbegan in the early 1980's, when I was a member and then chairman of the \nFinance Subcommittee on IRS Oversight. We made progress, but it was \nonly the beginning.\n  Senator Pryor helped continue the cause when he succeeded me as \nchairman in 1987. At that time, he took the initiative and asked me to \nwork with him in pushing for a Taxpayer Bill of Rights by expanding \nlegislation I and others had introduced. It took nearly 2 years, but we \nultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n  We now have a 7-year record of implementation regarding the Taxpayer \nBill of Rights. Great strides toward taxpayer protection were achieved \nthrough this legislation.\n  However, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights of 1988 was never expected to be \nthe final chapter of the book on taxpayer protection. But, it was a \nmajor step in the continuing process of stamping out taxpayer abuse. \nAnd that process continues today, as we look into ways to improve the \ncurrent law.\n  In reviewing the record, it is clear that much more needs to be done. \nThere is no question that much more needs to be done. There is no \nquestion that breakdowns in implementing the law have occurred, and \nthere are gaps in the law that need to be filled.\n  For instance, we believe the current ombudsman position is too \nlimited and too beholden to IRS insiders. Our legislation will turn the \nombudsman into a more independent office of taxpayer advocate that will \nhave expanded powers to take the initiative in helping taxpayers who \nare being treated unfairly by the IRS.\n\n  Other important provisions include the abatement of interest with \nrespect to unreasonable errors or delays by the IRS. Taxpayers would \nalso have to be notified when and why installment agreements are \nterminated.\n  We also substantially increase the amount of civil damages taxpayers \ncan claim for unauthorized collection actions, and taxpayers will not \nhave protections against retroactive IRS regulations. And, of course, \nthere are many more taxpayer protection provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. President, we were successful in passing a similar proposal \nthrough the Congress in 1992. However, the underlying legislation that \nthe proposal was attached to was vetoed by former President Bush for \nreasons unrelated to taxpayers rights. So, we have come back again in \nthe last two Congresses, working toward final passage.\n  Since 1987, Senator Pryor and I have worked in a cooperative, \nbipartisan effort to further taxpayer rights. We have continued working \nwith the House to improve taxpayer rights. Congresswoman Johnson and \nChairman Archer are commended for their successful efforts to pass this \nbill out of the House.\n  This is truly a bipartisan effort. Even President Clinton mentioned \nto me last year that he supported our efforts.\n  And we have had quite a few meetings with IRS and Treasury officials, \nwho finally came to understand and agree that problems exist and need \nto be dealt with.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to join us in the cause to help make the IRS \nmore responsible and more accountable to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the measure appear at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2337) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask a question on this bill, the \none referred to in the unanimous-consent agreement. I wrote the first \ntaxpayer bill of rights that passed. I authored that. It was through \nthe good offices of a member of the Finance Committee, Senator Pryor, \nand his diligent work that it passed. So I am very happy that the \ntaxpayer bill of rights 2, which has been pushed through the Senate \nwith a\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\nlot of trouble by the Senator from Arkansas. He is to be commended. \nThis is a great thing to happen to him in that he has now decided not \nto run again. I appreciate the work of the two leaders in getting the \ntaxpayer bill of rights 2 passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, in that regard, the \nSenator from Nevada makes a very good point. The Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, has labored on this issue probably longer than anybody \nhere in the Senate and deserves much praise for his efforts. This is \nhis second work product, along with others. We commend him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7753-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GAMBLING IMPACT STUDY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire of the Democratic leader, what is \nthe status with regard to the gambling impact study commission we had \ntalked earlier about? You needed time to look at that and see if there \nwere any problems with it, or whether amendments are required. What has \nthe Senator been able to determine?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield. As I understand it, \nwe have three amendments that may be offered by one of the members of \nour caucus. At this point, he would like to be protected to offer those \nat the appropriate time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are these germane amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, they are germane amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to try again to do this in such a way that it \nwould not take much of the Senate's time. In fact, I do not think we \ncan do it if we cannot get it done by unanimous consent. Could we ask \nfor copies of these amendments to look at the text?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Absolutely. If the majority leader will yield. I was not \naware amendments were pending. As we tried to clear it, we were told \nthat at least one Member--I think it is only one Member--has \namendments. He said there were three. We would be happy to share them \nwith you. He may be willing to agree to time agreements in an effort to \nexpedite the situation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to say that I did advise Senators on our side \nof the aisle that if there would be amendments, we probably would not \neven be able to bring it up because we do not have the time. We have \nkilled 2 days here with these issues.\n  So I hope that Senators on both sides and Senators Lugar and Simon \nwill work with us and see if we cannot get some sort of agreement so we \ncan handle this quickly. I feel like I have fulfilled my commitment.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is a managers' amendment, I point out, that \nSenator Glenn and I have worked up. So if we get a time agreement, I \nwould like the managers to have the right to offer their amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that is in the unanimous-consent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7756-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF WALKER MILLER, OF COLORADO, TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                        THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I had planned to ask unanimous consent again \nto appoint conferees on health care reform--health insurance reform. I \nsee the Senator from Massachusetts here. I would like very much for us \nto get these conferees appointed. I know that there is still discussion \nunderway regarding medical savings accounts.\n  I now have something on paper. If we could review it, I will talk to \nSenator Roth, Senator Kassebaum, and Congressman Hastert and \nCongressman Archer. We will take a look at it. I had just about \nconcluded that there was no intent at all to get health insurance \nreform. Now we have something we can review. I think it is a big \nmistake not to appoint conferees on this bill or any bill to go to \nconference. We labored for weeks and finally got conferees with the \nCoast Guard authorization bill. We got that done this morning at 10 \no'clock, after all these weeks working on that.\n  My intent is, in short order, next week, to move to appoint conferees \non the small business tax relief package, which includes minimum wage. \nI think we need to also appoint these. I will not ask for it tonight \nbecause I want to review the proposal I have.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say two things.\n  First, reference was made to the fact that the Democratic caucus--and \nthose of us who are concerned about going to conference on health care \nalso--oppose going to conference on the minimum wage. That was not the \ncase. We do not oppose going to conference on the minimum wage. The \nunanimous consent was propounded in a way that combined the two, and, \nobviously, under those circumstances, we oppose.\n  I am pleased to hear the distinguished majority leader's comments \nthat it is his desire to go to conference next week, and I am hopeful \nthat on both these issues they can be resolved.\n  The second issue has to do again with the conferees. I do not want to \nbe any more repetitive than he is. But since we tend to be repetitive \non the floor to make our points, it is important again that I indicate \nour desire to be participants in conferences. We will be watching this \nCoast Guard conference very carefully because that will really be one \nof the prototypes. We are under new leadership now. It is my \nexpectation that with new leadership there will be a new opportunity \nfor bipartisan discussion, dialog, and resolution when it comes to the \nconference. This will be a good opportunity to demonstrate our good \nfaith. I am hopeful that with that one over, we can move to others and \nsee equal demonstrations of good faith and real bipartisanship in \nconferences. I have a feeling we will not have this conference problem \nin the future were that to be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield to me once \nagain?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to note with regard to the Coast \nGuard authorization that two of the Senators that are going to be in \ncontrol of that are Senator Stevens--once again he has been known and \nwill be a conferee I am sure--and the Senator from South Carolina is \ngoing to be a conferee; bipartisan. Both of them represent coastal \nareas. Neither one of them wants us to end this session without a Coast \nGuard authorization bill. Yet, this issue has been held up by an issue \ninvolving claimless lawsuits that are being filed in the Federal court \nsystem--an issue which I really felt certainly did not justify all of \nthe delay that has occurred here. But I believe that in conference they \nwill work it out. They never are going to work it out until they get to \nconference. It took us weeks to get to conference. But now we are in \nit. I think these two guys, working with the House counterparts, are \ngoing to find a solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the leader. I can assure the leader that we will \nfind an agreement on the Coast Guard bill. It is a very essential bill. \nI also state that there is no question about it, it has some very new \ninitiatives, good new initiatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7756-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7757-S7759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1997\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to try once again on the defense \nbill.\n  As I understand it, Mr. President, under the situation we have now, \nif we are going to be in session tomorrow, the amendments in first \ndegree on the defense bill must be filed by tomorrow. If we are in \nsession on Monday, the second-degree amendments have to be filed \nMonday.\n  I certainly hope that I will not see the day when the Senate will \nvote against cloture on a defense bill, particularly one that has total \nbipartisan support; voted out of our committee without objection.\n  I can state to my good friend and partner from Hawaii that I am \ncertain that we have personally reviewed every request made by each \nSenator and have discussed with each Senator every request made and \nhave accommodated every Senator, or explained why it could not be \naccommodated. We have had no objection raised, to my knowledge, to any \ndecision that has been made so far.\n  What I am concerned about is that means we are going into cloture on \nTuesday, which means we are not going to get through our bill until at \nleast this time next week.\n  I would like once again to see if there is not some way we can work \nout that question to come in tomorrow and handle amendments that are in \nagreement, come in Monday afternoon and handle amendments in agreement, \nand take up the amendments that are in contention on Monday and vote, \nand vote finally on our bill Tuesday afternoon.\n  That is the essence of what the request was in the unanimous consent \nproposal of the leader which we wrote.\n  Is there any way that any Senator would tell us what we could do to \naccommodate the concept of trying to move this bill forward?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I might say to the Senator from Alaska and \nto the Senator from Nevada that their situation is in the mill. They \nare protected. I do not see why we cannot get an agreement to take up \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill and deal with it, \nrecognizing your rights are still fully protected. Why can we not do \nthat? I do not quite understand that.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might respond to the majority leader, \nthe Senators on the floor currently have an understanding of the rules, \nas does the Senator from Alaska, and obviously the majority leader.\n  The Senators from Nevada are fighting for their lives. The \nlegislation that is being proposed with respect to interim nuclear \nwaste dumps is without precedent in the history of the country and the \nhistory of the Senate. Therefore, to ask the Senators from Nevada to \nsurrender any of the parliamentary rights which this body confers upon \nus is to ask us to abandon the constituents that we represent.\n  I have not been here as long as my senior colleague, but I know that \neach of the Senators on the floor are advocates and tenacious \nsupporters of their constituents. We can be no less with our own.\n  So the issue that is all important for us is the interim storage of \nnuclear waste, and there is no reason why that needs to go forward. The \ntechnical review people and scientists tell us there is no reason. It \nis only the nuclear utility lobby that puts us in this position.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, does either Senator from Alaska wish to say \nanything at this point or try anything else?\n  I thought I might propound another unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote with respect to nuclear \nwaste occur at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 16, and it be in order to \nconsider S. 1894 prior to the cloture vote regarding nuclear waste.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the leader allow me to respond to my \nfriend?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I state to my friend and colleague from \nNevada that I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I would like this \nbill to move on. But for reasons that have been explained, we cannot do \nthat. The Senator from Alaska knows that if we agree that the Defense \nbill go on before the two cloture votes on Monday or Tuesday, we give \nup certain rights, important rights that we have. And so I respectfully \nsay that I think we cannot give those rights up.\n\n  I would only say in addition to what my friend from Nevada said, we, \nwe believe, are not only protecting the rights of the people of the \nState of Nevada, but there are going to be tens of thousands of tons of \nnuclear waste transported on railroads and trucks all over the United \nStates that is unnecessary. The nuclear review board has said leave it \nwhere it is--the technical review board.\n  So we understand the importance of moving legislation. We want to \nmove legislation. But we cannot do it with this nuclear cloud hanging \nover our head.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield. In fact, Mr. President----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be brief. I would only say, if I might, Mr. \nPresident, I have been here a long time, and I have seen a lot of \nfilibusters. I have seen a lot of delaying of the Senate. I have never \nseen any Senator--and I would challenge anyone to show me--that any \nSenator filibustering has ever held up a bill that is in the interest \nof national security. This Senator never has. I know Jim Allen never \ndid. I do not remember any such parliamentary tactic being used against \na Defense bill.\n  As a matter of fact, I think this is the first time I can remember we \nhave had to file cloture to get the Defense appropriations bill passed. \nThis is not just a run-of-the-mill bill. This is the most important \nbill we pass every Congress to maintain the defenses of this country. \nThis is our second duty when we take the oath. We swear under the \nConstitution that we will maintain the defenses of this country.\n  I admire my friends from Nevada for standing up for their State. I \ntake no back seat to anyone in standing up for my State. And I have \ntaken every right that I have had on the floor to protect my State, but \nI have never held up a bill that is in the interest of national \nsecurity.\n  I do not believe the Senators from Nevada are correct in asserting \nthat somehow they would lose any rights by allowing us to proceed with \nthis bill. Their rights are protected under the rules in terms of \nhandling the issue that affects their State. Their rights are \nprotected, of course, in handling whatever they want to do with regard \nto the bill that I have the privilege to manage, but they would lose \nnone of their rights, and I would not be a party to taking rights away \nfrom them, by proceeding with the Defense bill.\n  Blocking the Defense bill has nothing to do with the national \nsecurity as far as this country is concerned. My bill, our bill does. \nAnd it means now we will probably not get finished with this bill until \nabout a week from now, and that means we will probably not be able to \nget back here, before we recess in August, with a conference report. We \nwill not be able to know whether the President agrees. And we will be \nbehind this bill that the Senators from Nevada are talking about all \nthe way. If we are delayed now, we will be delayed later when it comes \nup again. It is going to come up again in terms of the conference \nreport, in terms of appointing conferees. I say it is in the best \ninterests of this country to get this bill out of the way.\n\n  I challenge the Senators from Nevada to demonstrate what they have \nsaid. Proceeding on this bill of ours now will not harm their rights \nwith regard to the issue that affects their State in any single way.\n  Mr. REID. I would accept the challenge, if I could, through the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to have it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I will yield the floor and let \nSenators get recognition in their own right.\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS and Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I could be more explicit, I will try. The rules do \nnot provide any protection for the Senators from Nevada with regard to \ndelay of the defense bill. I would challenge them to so state, and I do \nchallenge them to so state. What they are doing today is just merely \ndelaying getting to the bill that they object to with regard to Nevada. \nIt is a timing question, until the cloture motion was filed. When the \ncloture motion was filed, we all know when we will vote on the issue \npertaining to Nevada. But to say that it must wait, the decision on \nthat must wait before we proceed on the bill--it is the pending \nbusiness. It was the pending business this morning. We tried to raise \nit yesterday. And now we have spent the day today. I will be back \ntomorrow. I will be back Monday. I will be back Tuesday. I am going to \nbe out on the floor every day. And I want to say to my good friends \nfrom Nevada, I am going to tell the world they are holding up the \ndefense of the United States.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Idaho, in working with the Senators from \nNevada, assured them the protection that they now ask that they have \nand is granted under the rules of the Senate. There was no way to \nchange their protection. The process we used to bring this bill to the \nfloor is the process of the Senate.\n  So the Senator from Alaska is absolutely right. The Senators from \nNevada, their full rights are protected. Now they use the defense bill, \ntragically enough, because I agree with the Senator from Alaska, while \nit is clearly within their rights to do what they do, and I do not \ndispute that now and I do not think the Senator from Alaska does, I \nbelieve their action is unprecedented.\n  I think it is important the Record show the Senator from Idaho has \nworked very hard to bring this national nuclear waste bill to the floor \nso that we can deal with a national problem. I dealt with the Senators \nfrom Nevada in a very forthright way to assure them that all of their \nrights would be protected and that I or any other Senator interested in \nthis legislation was not in any way going to attempt to step on their \nrights, because in the Senate we do not do that. So they were protected \nin an adequate way.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Nevada wish to----\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, could I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor. The \nSenators from Nevada are seeking the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no desire to end up today having the Senators \nfrom Nevada start filibustering my bill at this late hour. I will be \nhappy to yield to the Senators for a question, but I hope that we \neither go ahead with my bill or decide when we will go ahead with my \nbill without regard to a filibuster on the nuclear issues. I will be \nglad----\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. To have the Senators ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Nevada is recognized \nfor a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am sure the Senator from Alaska is aware that the \nSenators from Nevada are not trying to do anything that would \ncompromise or jeopardize national defense. The Senators from Nevada, \nlike the Senator from Alaska, have a strong conviction--come from a \nState in which national defense interests are of paramount \nconsideration, as they are in the State which the Senator so ably \nrepresents.\n  We are talking about an appropriations bill that will go into effect \nOctober 1 of this year for the next fiscal year, so there is no \nimminent crisis that we face at the moment.\n  If I might indirectly respond to a question in the statement made by \nthe Senator from Idaho, the Senators from Nevada have tried throughout \nthis afternoon to offer a series of proposals that would allow us to \nmove immediately not only to the defense appropriations bill but to \nother pieces of legislation that are pending as well. And we would be \nprepared to do that.\n  I think it is fair to say that some on the other side of the aisle \nwere prepared to accept the proposals the Senators from Nevada were \noffering, but the Senator from Idaho and others indicated that they \nwould be unprepared to accept the proposal which would move us \nimmediately to the consideration of this bill only if the Senators from \nNevada surrendered their parliamentary rights conferred under the rules \nwith respect to a process which might occur if the nuclear waste bill \never went to conference, something at this point we do not know for \nsure.\n  So I do not believe it is fair to characterize that the Senators from \nNevada are unwilling to try to deal with this bill, the Department of \nDefense bill. We have offered several proposals, and they have been \nrejected. I regret that because I think that would be the appropriate \ncourse of action for us to follow this evening.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me respond to this first now. I want \nto make it clear--and we stand out here and say these are our friends \nin the Chamber. The Senators from Nevada come from a small State like I \ndo in terms of population. We are friends. But I disagree. We currently \nhave an order we will vote on the cloture motion on the nuclear waste \ndisposal bill on Tuesday.\n  There is absolutely nothing that can be lost, in terms of rights of \nthe two Senators from Nevada with regard to that bill by letting our \nbill go forward. As a matter of fact, letting it be voted on before, we \ncould have it finished before that cloture vote.\n  I understand the idea of trying to delay getting to a bill in terms \nof trying to delay the bill ahead of it. But that is past, as I said. \nOnce the cloture motion was filed, the time runs under the rule from \nthen, and there is nothing that can be done to harm the position of the \nSenators from Nevada with regard to that bill by proceeding with the \npending business.\n  I respectfully say again, we have a strange situation this year with \nregard to this bill. We know we are presenting a bill that is beyond \nthe request of the President. We are working on a strategy to present \nthe President a bill we think he will sign. That will take time. In any \nevent, we need to know if the bill is to be signed. If it is not to be \nsigned, then--if he wants to veto it--then we have to go back and \nfinish that process. But we have to do it all within the period of \nSeptember in order to finish, and this year is an election year. This \nis the second year of a Congress. We will go out of session in October.\n  I am saying again to the Senators, the worst thing that could happen \nto the defense of the United States is to act under a continuing \nresolution. We must get a bill for this subject, on defense, or else we \ncannot enter into long-term contracts. We cannot enter into contracts \nthat save the taxpayers' money. We pointed out here today, on three \noccasions, what we will save by virtue of this bill; $1 billion in one \nacquisition alone, we will save. It is certified by the GAO. Everybody \nknows we are going to save money by changing the way we handle some of \nthis acquisition for our defense forces. We cannot do that under a \ncontinuing resolution. The whole Government can act, perhaps, on a \ncontinuing resolution. The Department of Defense loses money, the \ntaxpayers pay in excess for their defense every time we have to go \nthrough a continuing resolution.\n  I say to my friend, there is no way we are going to get back here and \nhave another bill for defense if the President in fact vetoes the bill \nin September and we do not get the bill again to him in September. We \ncannot get through the defense bill in 2 weeks. We are going to be \ndealing with a continuing resolution. Every single portion of the \nDepartment of Defense loses and the taxpayers lose, if we try to \noperate the Department of Defense on a continuing resolution. I am \npleading with my friend from Nevada to let go of our bill. They will \nnot lose any of their rights. Again, I will be pleased to respond to \nany question the Senators have.\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\n  I do think I do know these rules. I challenge anyone to challenge \nwhat I have just said, because there is no right the Senator from \nNevada will lose by letting us proceed with the pending business with \nregard to anything they have the right to. They do have the right to do \nwhat they are doing, I agree. But they do not lose any rights by \nletting us go ahead.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from Alaska has been here a little bit \nlonger than I have, and I compliment him for his years of service as \nwell as the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and I hope we can move \nforward with this legislation.\n  I cannot recall--I have been around when we had a few filibusters--\nbut I cannot recall in my 16 years here that anybody has filibustered a \nbill, not the bill they were opposed to, but filibustering a bill that \nis coming up prior to the bill that they were opposed to.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know Senators have objected to unanimous consent \nrequests on legislation that was preceding an issue they were concerned \nwith. I think that is done.\n  I do not know of any situation where, after a cloture motion has been \nfiled on the subject of the Senator's interest, where a Senator has \nthen tried to delay any other legislation in order to try to protect a \nright that he perceived. Because I can perceive no right in such delay \nafter the cloture motion is filed. We either get cloture or we do not \nget cloture. The Senator's rights are protected either way, under \ncloture rule or postcloture--the handling of the bill if cloture fails. \nI do not remember any such circumstance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am trying to understand the rights that might be \ngiven up. If the Senators from Nevada do not allow the Defense bill to \ncome up, will there be a cloture vote on the nuclear waste bill at 10 \no'clock on Tuesday?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If they allow the bill to come up, will there be a \ncloture vote at 10 on Tuesday on the nuclear waste bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What rights, then, do they lose if that occurs?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I perceive none once we get into the cloture motion and \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Alaska yield, with his retaining his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, it appears to me that we \nare criticizing the wrong people here. If, in fact, there is such an \nurge to go forward with this legislation, and much other legislation, \nit would seem to me it would be the right thing to do to move away from \na bill that the President said he is going to veto. Why is all the \nburden placed on us?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me answer that, respectfully. When we tried \nyesterday to get to the defense bill, nuclear waste was not on the \nscreen. We tried to get on it this morning, did get on to it, and \nimmediately we have a filibuster because of nuclear waste. The leader \ndid what he should do. He made the motion to call up nuclear waste, and \nfiled the cloture motion so there will be a cloture vote on the motion \nto proceed to that bill.\n  The Senators from Nevada not only have the right to insist on a \ncloture motion on the motion to proceed, but they also have a \nsubsequent right to a cloture motion on the final vote on the bill, \nthey then have the right to cloture motion on appointment of conferees \non that bill. I can tell the Senators, if I were the Senators I can \nguarantee the Senate would not vote on this bill you oppose this year.\n  But that has nothing to do with my bill. That has nothing to do with \nmy bill. You have every right to protect your own interests with regard \nto your bill, but you are delaying the defense interests, the basic \nconcern of the defense of the United States, in my opinion.\n\n  I am telling you, you lose no rights. I should not address the \nSenator directly. I apologize. The Senator from Nevada loses no rights, \nneither Senator, by allowing our bill to proceed. And by consenting to \nthat unanimous-consent request, we would vote either before or after \nthe cloture motion, the bill would go to conference, the defense bill, \nand we have a chance--a chance of finishing this year with a bill \nsigned and approved by the President.\n  Mr. President, I cannot deal with this much longer without displaying \nsome of what some people have called an unruly temper. It is not an \nunruly temper. I know how to use it.\n  So I would say to my friend from Nevada, I am sorry this is the case. \nIt is my understanding the distinguished assistant minority leader has \nduties. Mr. President, under the circumstances, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7757-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7759-S7760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

GEN. PAUL E. BLACKWELL\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Lt. Gen. \nPaul E. Blackwell, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans of \nthe U.S. Army, who will retire on 26 July 1996. Lieutenant General \nBlackwell's career spans 31 years in which he has given distinguished \nservice as a soldier, leader, and visionary for our military. Let me \nbriefly recount to you the career of this distinguished servant of our \nNation.\n  A native of South Carolina, Lieutenant General Blackwell graduated \nfrom Clemson University where he earned both a bachelor and masters of \nscience. He entered active duty as a second lieutenant in 1965 as an \ninfantryman. Since then, he has commanded at platoon through division \nlevel.\n  Lieutenant General Blackwell has served in every type of U.S. Army \ndivision--light, airborne, mechanized, motorized, and armor. He has \nheld an extraordinary variety of command and staff positions, including \ncommanding general, 24th Infantry Division (mechanized) and his most \nrecent assignment as deputy chief of staff for operations and plans. \nOther key assignments include commanding general, 2d Armored Division(-\n), Garlstedt, Federal Republic of Germany; commander, III Corps \n(Forward), Maastrich, The Netherlands; assistant division commander, 3d \nArmored Division and commander, Hanau Military Community, Federal \nRepublic of Germany; deputy director for operations, National Military \nCommand Center, Joint Staff, Washington, DC; commander, 1st Brigade, \n9th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, WA; chief of staff, 9th Infantry \nDivision, Fort Lewis, WA; G3 (operations officer), 9th Infantry \nDivision, Fort Lewis, WA; commander, 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry, 3d \nInfantry Division, Aschaffenburg; Brigade S3, 2d Brigade, 3d Infantry \nDivision, Kitzingen; S3, 2d Battalion, 325th Infantry, 82d Airborne \nDivision.\n  Lieutenant General Blackwell's combat experience includes two tours \nin the Republic of Vietnam and service in Saudi Arabia during Operation \nDesert Storm. During his tours in Vietnam, he served in various \npositions to include commander, Company D, 3d Battalion, 60th Infantry, \n9th Infantry Division and platoon leader of an airfield security \nplatoon. During Operation Desert Storm, Lieutenant General Blackwell \nserved as the assistant division commander of 3d Armored Division.\n  Lieutenant General Blackwell's career spanned a period of enormous \nchanges and great turmoil requiring vigilance coupled with decisiveness \nto ensure our Nation's security. He has adapted to new and diverse and \nintegrated technologies to assist the Army to change both \nintellectually and organizationally to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\n  Throughout his three decades of service, Lieutenant General Blackwell \nprovided flawless moral character and vision for our Army. He led by \nexample and significantly contributed to the transformation of the Army \nfrom a cold war, forward deployed force, into a power projection force, \nready to defend the national interest in any corner of the world, \nwhenever the Nation called. While meeting the challenges of today, he \nprepared the Army for tomorrow as well, with a farsighted and far-\nreaching vision of the conduct of future war. His determination to keep \nthe Army ``trained and ready,'' his sense of responsibility to his \nsoldiers and the Nation, and his understanding of both our history and \nthe future of armed conflict have given this Nation an Army capable of \nachieving decisive victory now and into the 21st century.\n  Lieutenant General Blackwell's career reflects selfless service to \nour Nation and the essence excellence we expect from our military \nleaders. Through the decades of service and sacrifice, he has been \nsupported by a loving family. Lieutenant General Blackwell's family is \na critical part of his success. Janet Blackwell and his son, Paul, have \nserved the Nation by providing unconditional love and support through \nnumerous deployments and countless family moves to maintain the \nhomefront for this dedicated soldier.\n  Lt. Gen. Paul E. Blackwell is the quintessential professional, loyal \nservant of the Constitution, and caring leader for America's sons and \ndaughters, on behalf of the Congress of the United States and the \npeople we represent, I offer our sincere thanks for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7759-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BILL LEE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, today, I join thousands of Americans and \nother admirers around the world in paying tribute to Bill Lee, retired \nchairman of Duke Power Co. and a personal friend, who died on July 10, \n1996, in New York at age 67.\n  To eulogize William States Lee as Duke's former chairman, while \naccurate, does not begin to do justice to the scope of Bill's talents, \nvision, and accomplishments. In a career at Duke that spanned four \ndecades, Bill presided over one of the most successful electric \nutilities in the Nation. He provided the leadership for the most \nsuccessful nuclear power program in the Nation. It was his \ndetermination to bring safe, clean, and reliable power for North and \nSouth Carolina electricity consumers that resulted in the construction \nof the Oconee, McGuire, and Catawba nuclear powerplants, which have \nadmirable served the people of the region for many years.\n  Bill Lee's achievements do not stop at the bounds of Duke's service \nterritory. He is revered as the driving force behind the national and \ninternational organizations that today do so much to ensure the safety \nof the United States and world nuclear powerplants. It is those \ncontributions, perhaps even more that his contributions at Duke Power, \nthat constitute his true legacy and assure his place in the history for \nthe electric power industry.\n  After the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island, Bill Lee, then \npresident and chief operating officer of Duke Power, was called in to \nlead the recovery effort. It was Bill who spawned the idea that the \nnuclear industry needed its own watchdog organization to assure \nexcellence in operation at every plant. He went on to create the \nInstitute for Nuclear Power Operations, headquartered in Atlanta, which \nincludes every nuclear utility in the Nation as its members. He served \nas INPO chairman from 1979 to 1982.\n  The news of the Chernobyl accident was only days old in 1986 when Lee \nlaunched a personal diplomatic crusade to bring the former East bloc \ncountries into an organization like INPO. In was his often-stated \nbelief that ``radiation knows no national boundaries.'' Thanks largely \nto his personal ability to persuade and the respect he commanded on \nboth sides of the Atlantic, the World Association of Nuclear Operators \n[WANO] was founded in 1986. Lee served as WANO president from 1989 to \n1991. Today, WANO continues to be a major force for global nuclear \nsafety, as a vehicle for sharing Western safety and performance \nexpertise throughout the world.\n  Bill Lee was a native of Charlotte, NC. He was graduated from \nPrinceton in 1951, with a degree in civil engineering, and after a \nstint in the U.S. Navy, joined Duke Power as a junior engineer in 1955. \nHe was named vice president of engineering in 1965, and a board member \n3 years later. He became chairman and president in 1989, and remained \nin that position until his retirement in 1994, when he became Duke's \nfirst chairman emeritus.\n  The business magazine Financial World named Bill a winner in its CEO \nof the Year competition for 4 consecutive years. In 1989, the magazine \nnamed him ``Utility CEO of the Decade.''\n  Bill also was active in numerous civic organizations, especially as \nan advocate for education reform. He is survived by his wife, Jan, his \nson, States, his two daughters, Helen and Lisa, his mother, Sara Toy, \nand five grandchildren. He will be greatly missed--and long \nremembered--by both family and his many admiring associates.\n  I will personally miss his boundless enthusiasm. This enthusiasm was \nalways there, whether he was raising money for charity, keeping Duke \nPower on the cutting edge of excellence, or taking up some new \nadventure-like skiing at the age of 40. I worked with Bill on some of \nthe toughest legislative issues the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee faced. He was a great ally: Tough, razor sharp, \nsophisticated, always able to see the big picture. He was a leader who \nwas a gentleman, a man with great integrity and a keen sense of the \npublic interest. In an industry obsessed with the bottom line and next \nweek's stock price, Bill was a visionary who took responsibility for \nthe future. We need more Bill Lees, but were not likely to find any \nlike him.\n  Bill Lee did it all, and he enjoyed all. I know my colleagues join me \nin paying tribute to this remarkable man and extending condolences to \nhis family and many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7760-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7760-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexempt inmates from the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements of \nsuch Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n       THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938 AMENDMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, with my colleague, Senator Reid, we \nintroduce today legislation which will clarify the Fair Labor Standards \nAct and the issue of minimum wage, as it applies to prisoners \nincarcerated in State and local institutions. I send the legislation to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the main points of this legislation are as \nfollows. No. 1, it will exempt prison workers from the minimum wage \nprovisions. No. 2, it will put an end to a cascade of lawsuits that our \nStates have been faced with by prisoners demanding back wages. It \nenables the effective prison work and employment training programs that \nhave been developed within many of our State corrections facilities to \ncontinue without the fear of these lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to cosponsor this legislation \nwith my colleague, Senator Reid, who, during\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\nthe last Congress and previously, has brought this issue so effectively \nto our attention. This legislation has engendered bipartisan support \nand today we are joined by Senators Mack, DeWine, Bryan and Dorgan in \nour efforts to correct the application of minimum wage to State \nprisons.\n  This is an issue of national concern. Class action lawsuits by \nprisoners demanding backpay at minimum wage are entangling Federal \ncourts in many sectors of the country. Florida alone has faced two such \nclass action lawsuits in the last 24 months. In 1992, 18 States asked \nCongress for clarification of this issue. Today, 4 years later, we have \nyet to answer their call for help. It seems appropriate that we should \naddress this issue in the very week that we have taken action to \nincrease the minimum wage in the law.\n  Many prisoners participate in job training and work programs which \nprovide numerous benefits. This legislation restricts its applicability \nin terms of prohibition from the application of the minimum wage to \nthose prison industry programs which are providing goods or services to \neither a local, State, or Federal governmental agency. We are not \nincluding where there might be the production of products or the \ndelivery of services that would be beneficial and therefore in \ncompetition with commercial, private-sector activities.\n  Not only are these activities beneficial in terms of providing \nservices which range, in my State, from supplies such as furniture and \nprinted materials, to the provision of services which are valuable to \nlocal, State, or Federal governments, but they also deal with one of \nthe major issues that affects recidivism, the likelihood of a person \nupon release from prison returning to a life of crime. Consistently, \none of the key factors in the likelihood of a prisoner either living a \nlife of law and order and production or returning to their previous \ncriminal behavior is whether they leave the prison prepared to hold a \njob.\n\n  These programs provide that kind of on-the-job training and \nexperience that make prisoners, upon release, more likely to be \nemployable, more likely to have the cultural skills, the understanding \nof what it means to go to work every day in order to get and hold a \njob.\n  I am very proud that in our State, the recidivism rate among those \nprisoners who have been through our prison industry program is one-\nfifth of the recidivism rate of the population as a whole. We want to \nprotect these programs by eliminating the prospect that they might be \nsubjected to the minimum wage.\n  What would happen if the minimum wage were to be made applicable to \nthese prison work programs? Again, using the State of Florida as an \nexample, it has been estimated that if the State were to lose the class \naction suit that is before it, it would cost millions of dollars in \nbackpay and an additional $24 million every year to continue the \nprograms as they are currently in place.\n  In a time of tight State budgets, there is very little likelihood \nthat there would be this $24 million forthcoming, and, therefore, the \nprospect would be that this effective program that is serving so many \nimportant interests would be terminated.\n  So, Mr. President, this legislation is beneficial to the States and \nthe communities that are the direct beneficiaries of the products and \nservices produced by these prison industries. There is even a greater \nbenefit in terms of reducing the likelihood of prisoners, upon release, \nreturning to a life of crime and, therefore, being a predator upon \nsociety.\n  But it also gives us a chance, frankly, to eliminate a provision \nwhich makes us appear to be foolish to the American public. If you were \nto tell the average citizen in New Hampshire, did you know that there \nis an interpretation of the Federal minimum wage law that requires your \nState, if a prisoner is working while they are incarcerated, doing \nsomething productive, helping prepare themselves for their post-\nincarceration life, requiring the State to pay minimum wage to that \nperson, in spite of the fact that the State is also providing them a \nplace to live, to eat, their medical services, all of the requirements, \nand then to say they have to receive the minimum wage, which is now \ngoing to be raised over the next 2 years to $5.15 an hour, you would \nfirst encounter bemusement and then, I think, public anger at what they \nwould see to be such a foolish idea.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that, albeit 4 years late, we would respond \nto the request of the States to clarify that we do not intend to apply \nthe minimum wage to those persons engaged in prison industries and \nallow the States to continue with this thoroughly rational and \nimportant part of their corrections program.\n  It is my honor to turn the remainder of the time to my colleague and \ncosponsor, Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the efforts of my \ncolleague. When this matter was first introduced in August 1992, \nSenator Graham was a steadfast supporter of this legislation. He \nindicated that I have been a good advocate of this legislation. I say, \nMr. President, not good enough. It seems that we should have this in \nlaw. We have not been able to do that.\n  I think it is fair to say that we should put the committee of \njurisdiction, or committees of jurisdiction, on notice that we are \ngoing to move forward with this legislation. It is important we do so, \nand if we do not get it done in the committees, then we are going to \nhave to do it here on the floor. We have waited too long.\n  The legislation that I introduced in 1992 was in response to the \ndecision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that all inmates working \nin correctional institutions and industries in those institutions are \ncovered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. That was stunning to me. As my \ncolleague from Florida has indicated, this decision is beyond the \nability to comprehend.\n  The decision has been overturned, and the courts around this country \nare confused on this issue, and it calls for a clarification. In fact, \nit is a pending court case in Florida that has brought Senator Graham \nand I to the floor this morning to reintroduce the prison wage bill. \nClarification is needed, not only for the direction of the courts, but \nto dissuade prisoner lawsuits to recover minimum wage payments for work \ndone while in prison.\n  If inmates were covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, they would \nnot only be eligible--listen to this--for minimum wage, but it would \nopen the door for unemployment compensation for prisoners, it would \nopen the door for worker's compensation for prisoners, it would open \nthe door for paid vacations for prisoners, it would open the door for \novertime pay for prisoners. I mean, is this ridiculous?\n  If the Federal Government or States are required to pay minimum wage, \nit would mean the end of most prison work programs. We simply would not \nbe able to afford them. State governments are already staggering from \nbudget deficits. Inmates would lose their job training, in most \ninstances, lose their opportunity to produce something during their \nincarceration and lose the incentive to reform themselves and return to \nsociety. Prisoners would sit idle in their cells. Taxpayers already pay \nfor room, board, even cable TV for prisoners. I do not believe they \nwant to pay for minimum wage as well.\n  Mr. President, I, frankly, would like to go further. I do not think \nthey should have cable television. I do not think they should have some \nof the things they have in prison that they do have, but I am going to \nlet well enough alone and see if we can move forward on this very \nmeaningful legislation.\n  We in Congress just spent months, as my colleague has indicated, \nfighting for an increase in the minimum wage. Were we fighting for a \nworker trying to raise a family on $8,500 a year--that is minimum \nwage--or were we fighting for a wage increase for prisoners? I know \nthat I was fighting for the working family and not the prisoner who has \nnot played by the rules of society and is supposed to be punished, in \nmy estimation.\n  Some opponents of this bill have raised the question of low-wage \ninmate competition with the private sector. But this issue has already \nbeen adequately explained by my colleague. This issue has already been, \nI repeat, addressed by the Ashurst-Sumners Act, as well as the Prison \nIndustry Enhancement Certification Program. This is only talk.\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\n  Further, in our bill, we provide specifically that our language does \nnot affect programs certified pursuant to the Ashurst-Sumners Act.\n  Mr. President, I asked, sometime ago, the General Accounting Office \nto look into this matter, and they rendered a very fine report on \nprison labor. I quote from this report:\n\n       If the prison systems we visited were required to pay \n     minimum wage to their inmate workers and did so without \n     reducing the number of inmate hours worked, they would have \n     to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more each year for \n     inmate labor. Consequently, these prison systems generally \n     regard minimum wage for prison work as unaffordable, even if \n     substantial user fees (e.g.: charges for room and board) were \n     imposed on the inmates.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Prison systems officials consistently identified large-\n     scale cutbacks in inmate labor as likely and, in their view, \n     a dangerous consequence of having to pay minimum wage. They \n     believed that less inmate work means more idle time and \n     increased potential for violence and misconduct.\n\n  Therefore, paying minimum wage to prisoners would not only be \nexpensive, but dangerous and counterproductive.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was enacted as a progressive \nmeasure to ensure all able-bodied working men and women a fair day's \npay for a fair day's work. It was never, never intended to cover \ncriminals in our prisons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Harkin):\n\n  S. 1944. A bill to establish a commission to be known as the Harold \nHughes Commission on Alcoholism; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n         The Harold Hughes Commission on Alcoholism Act of 1996\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my honor today, along with \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senators Grassley and Harkin, to introduce \nlegislation that will fulfill a lifetime dream. The Honorable Harold \nHughes, the ``man from Ida Grove,'' has made the struggle against \nalcoholism and its affects on individuals and their families his life \nwork. Harold Hughes vision is to combat alcoholism, not only on a \npersonal level, but on a community and national level as well. His \ndream will be fulfilled with the creation of a commission on all \nmatters related to alcoholism and its affects on America.\n  The Talmud defines a good man as, ``one who needs no monuments \nbecause their deeds are shrines.'' The Honorable Harold Hughes deeds \nare indeed shrines. My distinguished friend has devoted his life to \nhelping others. He has served as Governor of Iowa, U.S. Senator, and \nnow as a leader in the fight against the abuse of alcohol and drugs. He \nis the founder and chairman of the Hughes Foundation as well as the \nHarold Hughes Centers for Alcoholism and Drug Treatment. He has become \na front-line soldier in the war against alcohol abuse in the United \nStates.\n  Alcohol use and abuse in the United States affects all of us. \nAlthough alcohol is a legal drug, its effects are devastating. \nAlcoholism tears apart marriages, families and communities. As a \nNation, we cannot allow the devastating effects to continue.\n  Alcohol abuse and dependency affects 10 percent of Americans, 18.5 \nmillion, but we all pay the price for this addiction.\n  About 56 percent of American families are affected by alcoholism.\n  If alcohol were never carelessly used in our society, 105,000 fewer \npeople would die each year.\n  Alcohol is a factor in one-half of all homicides, suicides, and motor \nvehicle fatalities.\n  Treatment, support, direct health care costs, as well as lost work \ntime and premature death cost the public $98.6 billion in 1990.\n  The Harold Hughes Commission on Alcoholism will provide the \nPresident, Congress, and the American people with the tools that are \nnecessary to address the effects of this disease. Unlike commissions of \nthe past, which studied the affects of alcoholism on our society, the \nwork of this Commission will be uniquely narrowly tailored. The focus \nwill not be on the big picture of alcoholism in the United States, \nrather it will be on the limited, practical, and cost-effective \nsolutions to our growing crisis with alcoholism. The Commission will \nexamine better ways to coordinate existing Government programs, improve \neducation on the affects of alcohol, improve alcoholism research, and \nincrease public/private sector cooperation in combating this disease. \nThis work will be carried out by small working groups that will include \nacademics, business executives and alcoholism experts. These working \ngroups will focus on single policy issues in order to produce \nrecommendations that will lead to tangible solutions to alcoholism.\n\n  Currently, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \nunder the National Institutes of Health is the leading research and \nfunding organization for issues dealing with alcohol abuse. NIAAA \nconducts 90 percent of all research in these areas. Current research in \nthe area of alcoholism includes: Searching for the genome for genetic \nmarkers that are linked to alcoholism; developing and approving a new \ndrug, Naltexone, for the treatment of alcoholism; educating mothers on \nthe risks drinking poses during pregnancy; preventing alcoholism \nthrough educational programs developed for schools, the workplace, and \nthe community. This research and programming will greatly reduce the \noverall cost of alcohol abuse to society.\n  The Harold Hughes Commission will be a vehicle for existing programs \nlike NIAAA as well as other research programs and Government agencies \nto increase their effectiveness. The coordination of exsisting programs \nwill increase the success rate of all the programs.\n  This legislation marks the beginning of a renewed congressional \ncommitment to fighting alcoholism in America. It also pays tribute to a \nman who made a similar commitment in his own life for himself, his \ncommunity, and others who are fighting the battle against \nalcoholism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1945. A bill to broaden the scope of certain firearms offenses; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         Gun Crimes Legislation\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, prosecutions of gun criminals are \ndown 20 percent under the Clinton administration. At a time when 10 \nmillion Americans every year become victims of violent crime, the \nadministration is not making the prosecution of armed criminals a major \npriority.\n  I think that's a mistake. I think we have to do more to get violent \nfelons off the streets. And I am introducing a bill that will help make \nsure this happens.\n  Recently, the Supreme Court handled down a unanimous decision that \nessentially disarmed a very effective weapon that Federal prosecutors \nuse to combat violence and drug abuse. The bill I am introducing will \nrearm Federal prosecutors--and it will do so in a way that it will not \nbe open to reinterpretation by the courts. Congress must leave no doubt \nthat when a criminal commits a violent crime or completes a drug deal, \nand a gun is around, the gun is a part of the offense, and the criminal \nwill get 5 years added to his prison sentence.\n  Prior to December 6, 1995, Federal prosecutors used title 18, section \n924(c)(1) to impose an additional mandatory 5 years in prison for those \ncriminals who use or carry a firearm during or in relation to a violent \ncrime or a drug trafficking crime.\n  The purpose of this statute was to send violent criminals and drug \ntraffickers to jail--where they belong. And this provision was an \neffective law enforcement tool because the lower courts defined ``use'' \nvery broadly. In fact, if the defendant simply had a gun nearby, it was \nsufficient to convict under section 924(c)(1)--because the courts ruled \nthat the proximity of the gun served to ``embolden'' the defendant.\n  According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in 1994 alone, over \n2,000 defendants were sentenced to longer terms under section \n924(c)(1).\n  The Supreme Court's ruling last year ended the effectiveness of this \nstatute as a crime-fighting tool. The court ruled that, in order to \ncharge a defendant under section 924(c)(1), the Government must show \nthat the defendant actively employed a firearm during or in relation to \na violent or drug trafficking crime. Therefore, if a firearm merely \nserved to embolden a criminal, the court said, it was not being \n``used''\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\nwithin the meaning of section 924(c)(1), and the criminal would not \nreceive the additional 5 years in prison.\n  When Congress passed this statute, it was sending a clear message to \ndrug dealers and violent criminals--Guns and drugs are a recipe for \ndisaster. And, if you mix them, you are going to pay a price. I believe \nthat this Congress should act to restore this crime fighting tool, and \nwe should do it in a way that leaves nothing to the reckoning of the \ncourts.\n  My legislation would do just that. It would amend section 924(c)(1) \nto cover all circumstances in which a drug dealer or violent criminal \nis caught with a firearm that is being used to further his drug \ntrafficking or violent enterprise. Under this legislation, a drug \ndealer, for example, would be subject to a mandatory additional 5-year \nprison sentence for drug trafficking, if he ``uses or carries a \nfirearm, or has a firearm in close proximity to illegal drugs or drug \nproceeds, or has a firearm in close proximity at the time of arrest or \nat the point of sale of illegal drugs.''\n  I believe that this legislation will do a great deal to help the law \nenforcement officials on the front lines of the war on drugs. It makes \nour law stronger--and helps get these felons off the streets, out of \nour communities, and into prison.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1946. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to insert a \ngeneral provision for criminal attempt; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                           crime legislation\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I spoke on the \nfloor about the current administration's record on crime. The facts \nclearly demonstrate that the administration's actions do not fulfill \nits rhetoric on this issue.\n  I think it is time to give law enforcement officers the tools they \nneed to do their jobs--protecting American families. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation aimed at doing just that, in one significant \nway.\n  The bill I am introducing today would establish, for the first time \nin the Federal Criminal Code, a general attempt provision. Thankfully, \ncriminals do not succeed every time they set out to commit a crime. We \nneed to take advantage of these failed crimes to get criminals off the \nstreets.\n  Mr. President, under current Federal law, there is no general attempt \nprovision applicable to all Federal offenses. This has forced Congress \nto enact separate legislation to cover specific circumstances. This \napproach to the law has led to a patchwork of attempt statutes--leaving \ngaps in coverage, and failing to adequately define exactly what \nconstitutes an attempt in all circumstances.\n  Since statutes include attempt language within the substantive \noffense, but don't bother to define exactly what an attempt is. Others \ndefine, as a separate crime, conduct which is only a step toward \ncommission of a more serious offense. Moreover, there is no offense of \nattempt for still other serious crimes, such as disclosing classified \ninformation to an unauthorized person.\n  This ad hoc approach to attempt statutes is causing problems for law \nenforcement officials. At what point is it OK for law enforcement \nofficials to step in to prevent the completion of a crime? If someone \nis seriously dedicated to committing a crime, law enforcement must be \nable to intervene and prevent it--without having to worry whether doing \nso would cause a criminal to walk. In the absence of a statutory \ndefinition of an attempt, the courts have been called upon to decide \nwhether specific actions fit within existing statutory language.\n  When a criminal is attempting to commit a crime where attempt is not \nan offense, then law enforcement must wait until the crime is \ncompleted, or find some other charge to fit the criminal's actions. Law \nenforcement should never be placed in either of these positions.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will solve these problems in the \ncurrent law. As I mentioned earlier, this legislation will add a \ngeneral attempt provision to the U.S. Criminal Code. It provides \ncongressional direction in defining what constitutes an attempt in all \ncircumstances. And, it will serve to fill in the irrational gaps in \nattempt coverage.\n  In my view, it is time for the American people--acting through the \nCongress--to clarify their intention when it comes to this area of the \nlaw.\n  Millions of Americans work hard every day to make ends meet and raise \ntheir families and provide a better life for their children.\n  But, there are some people who choose a different approach to life--a \nlife of crime. We as Americans need to leave no doubt where we stand on \nthat choice. If you even try to commit a crime, we're going to \nprosecute you and convict you. This bill will make it easier for our \nlaw enforcement officers to protect our families and our \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1947. A bill to provide for a process to authorize the use of \nclone pagers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               the clone pager authorization act of 1996\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I recently made some remarks on the \nSenate floor about the current administration's record on crime. The \nfacts are clear: The administration's actions on crime do not meet its \nrhetoric.\n  To stop crime, we have to do more. That doesn't mean another \nrhetorical assault on crime--or even a flashy 10-point program. Rather, \nwe have to do more of the little things that--when you put them all \ntogether--make a big difference.\n  The most important of these is giving law enforcement officials the \ntools they need to do their jobs. Today, I am introducing legislation \nthat will help us do that.\n  The bill I am introducing today would simply rectify an imbalance in \ncurrent Federal law which makes it more difficult for law enforcement \nofficials to fight drug trafficking. Today, drug traffickers have taken \nadvantage of technological advances to advance their own criminal \ninterests.\n  Drug traffickers--on a regular basis--use digital display paging \ndevices--better known as beepers--in transacting their business. They \ndo this because it gives them the freedom to run their criminal \nenterprise out of any available phone booth, and to avoid police \nsurveillance. If law enforcement officials knew from whom they were \nreceiving the calls to their beepers it would certainly aid efforts in \ntracking down drug traffickers.\n  The technology now exists to allow law enforcement to receive the \ndigital display message, without intercepting the content of any \nconversation or message. It is called a clone pager. This clone pager \nis programmed identically to the suspect's pager and allows law \nenforcement to receive the digital displays at the same time as the \nsuspect.\n  This device functions identically to a pen register. Mr. President, \nas you may know, a pen register is a device which law enforcement \nattaches to a phone line to decode the numbers which have called a \nspecific telephone. Like a clone pager, the pen register only \nintercepts phone numbers, not the content of any conversation or \nmessage.\n  Since both devices serve the same purpose, a reasonable person would \nconclude that both the system for receiving authorization to use these \ndevices, and the procedures mandated by the courts once the \nauthorization was granted would be the same. However, in both cases it \nis not.\n  Under current law, the requirements for obtaining authorization to \nuse a clone pager are much more stringent than they are for using a pen \nregister. I would like to briefly outline the differences.\n  In order to obtain authorization to use a pen register, a Federal \nprosecutor must certify to a district court judge the phone number to \nwhich the pen register will be attached, the phone company that \ndelivers service to that number, and that the pen register serves a \nlegitimate law enforcement purpose. In other words, the prosecutor must \nshow only that the use of the pen register is based on an ongoing \ninvestigation. The district court judge may then grant the \nauthorization on a mere finding that the prosecutor has made the \nrequired certification. The pen register can then be used for a period \nof 60 days--with no requirement that law enforcement report pen \nregister activity to the court.\n  In contrast, the U.S. attorney for a particular district must sign \noff on a request for clone pager authorization. Once this occurs, a \nprosecutor may\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nthen go before a district court judge where he must show that there is \nprobable cause to suspect an individual has committed a crime--a much \nhigher standard than what is required for a pen register authorization. \nHe must also detail what other investigative techniques have been used, \nwhy they have not been successful, and why they will continue to be \nunsuccessful. Moreover, the prosecutor must disclose other available \ninvestigative techniques and why they are unlikely to be successful. \nOnly after all of this is done can authorization to use a clone pager \nbe granted.\n  But these are not the only differences in treatment. After the \nauthorization is granted, it can only be used for 30 days. During that \n30 days, the prosecutor must report activity from the clone pager to \nthe issuing judge at least once every 2 weeks.\n  I do not believe that the authorization disparity in authorization \nfor these two devices is warranted.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would simply amend the \nFederal code to end this disparity. This bill would give law \nenforcement agents ready access, with warranted limitations, to the \ntools they need to do their jobs. This bill will bring Federal law \nenforcement into the 21st century. The drug traffickers are already \nthere. It's time for law and order to catch up with them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1948. A bill to amend section 2241 of title 18, United States \nCode, to provide for Federal jurisdiction over sexual predators; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           Crime Legislation\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I offer a bill, originally \nsponsored in the House by my colleague from New York, Representative \nSlaughter. The bill will allow local district attorneys the option to \nfederally prosecute repeat sexual offenders. Authorizing local district \nattorneys the opportunity to pursue Federal prosecution of habitual \nsexual offenders ensures that the toughest penalties will be imposed on \nthese predators. They deserve nothing less.\n  It is horrendous that a rapist's average sentence is only 10\\1/2\\ \nyears, with even less time being served. The sentence for child sex \noffenders is no better. Too often, these monsters are on the street \nready to prey on their next victim.\n  In addition, repeat offenders convicted under this section of the \nbill will be sentenced to life for their second offense. Criminals \nrepeatedly convicted of rape and serious sexual assaults must be taken \noff our streets and removed from our communities forever.\n  I urge my colleagues to review the merits of this bill, join as \ncosponsors and urge its immediate passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Exon, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Heflin):\n  S. 1949. A bill to ensure the continued viability of livestock \nproducers and the livestock industry in the United States; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              The Cattle Industry Improvement Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I are \nintroducing the Cattle Industry Improvement Act of 1996. This \nlegislation addresses the deep concern of cattle, hog, and sheep \nproducers across the Nation that the livestock industry does not \noperate in a free and open market. Livestock producers, especially \ncattle producers, are receiving the lowest prices in recent memory. \nProducers can barely make ends meet, let alone make a profit. The \nCattle Industry Improvement Act is a fair, substantive bill which \noffers commonsense solutions to problems that have plagued the \nlivestock industry for a long time.\n  For the last 2 years the issue of livestock concentration has been \nthe No. 1 agricultural issue in South Dakota, even exceeding interest \nin the farm bill. Livestock concentration and low cattle prices do not \njust affect farmers and ranchers in my State. The impact is felt by the \nentire economy of South Dakota, affecting people who live in cities, \ntowns, and rural communities alike. A recession in the cattle industry \nhas a ripple effect throughout the entire State the consequences of \nwhich are potentially devastating. Farm foreclosures, job layoffs by \nagriculture related businesses and bank failures are all likely if \ncattle prices do not rebound in the immediate future.\n  I began the effort to address the issue of livestock concentration \nlast year with the introduction of legislation creating a livestock \ncommission to review the impact of packer concentration. This bill was \na bipartisan effort that passed the Senate but was blocked in the \nHouse.\n  Fortunately, Secretary Glickman rescued the effort by creating the \nUSDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Concentration. This advisory \ncommittee, which included livestock producers, has served a vital role \nin addressing concentration in agriculture. The advisory committee \nsubmitted its findings and recommendations to Secretary Glickman on \nJune 6. Some of its recommendations can be implemented administratively \nand are currently under review by Department of Agriculture officials \nto determine their feasibility. Others require legislative action. The \nconclusion the committee reached is unequivocal: the status quo is \nunacceptable. Modern livestock production has changed, the USDA must \nkeep pace, and Congress must give the Department of Agriculture the \ntools necessary to respond to these changes in a way that gives \nproducers a chance to make an honest living and compete fairly in the \nmarketplace.\n  The Cattle Industry Improvement Act of 1996 gives the Department \nthose tools. The bill requires the Secretary to define and prohibit \nnoncompetitive practices. It mandates price reporting for all sales \ntransactions conducted by any entity who has greater than 5 percent of \nthe national slaughter business, and requires timely reporting of \nquantity and price of all imports and exports of meat and meat by \nproducts. Livestock producers will be able to count on Federal \nprotection against packers and buyers who retaliate against them for \npublic comments made regarding industry practices. Federal agriculture \ncredit policies will be reviewed to determine if they are adequate to \naddress the cyclical nature of modern livestock production.\n  The bill also calls for the review of Federal lending practices to \ndetermine if the Government is contributing to packer concentration, \nand directs the President and the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health \nand Human Services to formulate a plan consolidating and streamlining \nthe entire food inspection system.\n  Finally the bill requires the USDA to develop a system for labeling \nU.S. meat and meat products.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Cattle Industry Improvement Act, which addresses an issue that \nis critical to our livestock and dairy industries--the concentration of \neconomic\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\npower. I want to applaud the Minority Leader [Senator Daschle] for his \nextraordinary leadership on this issue. Last year he led the effort to \nestablish a commission to investigate concentration in meat packing and \nprocessing, introducing legislation that passed in the Senate. That \nlegislation ultimately led to the report Concentration in Agriculture--\nA Report of the USDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Concentration--\nissued this June, which confirmed the extensive concentration occurring \nthrough the entire livestock marketing chain. The report warned that \nconcentration in processing and manufacturing is likely to harm farmers \nmore than anyone else in the marketing chain given their already low \nmarket power in the face of a few large corporate buyers. That report \nmade a number of recommendations to Congress, the administration and \nthe livestock industry for steps that could be taken to address these \nproblems. The legislation Senator Daschle is introducing today takes \naction on a number of those recommendations.\n  The trend towards concentration in the livestock industry is \nparticularly disturbing in light of the current record low prices in \ncattle markets and record high prices for feed--the most important and \ncostly input to livestock production. In Wisconsin, low cattle prices \nhave hit our dairy farmers hard as they obtain a substantial portion of \ntheir income from the sale of cull cows and veal calves. When beef \nprices are low, Wisconsin's 27,000 dairy farmers are equally hard hit.\n  According to the USDA report, while prices are distressingly low for \nproducers, returns for meat packers are still quite high. As some of my \ncolleagues have pointed out, with four firms slaughtering 80 percent of \nthe cattle in this country, it is no wonder that producers in Wisconsin \nand elsewhere are concerned about the disparate economic health of \nlivestock producers and livestock packing and processing industry. \nWhile it isn't clear that concentration has caused the low prices, the \nUSDA report confirmed that given the circumstances in the livestock \nindustry, market manipulation for large packers and processors is \ncertainly possible.\n  The Cattle Industry Improvement Act includes provisions designed to \nimprove market information in the cattle industry which suffers from \ninadequate market information. Less than 2 percent of fed cattle are \nsold through an open ``price discovery'' process, providing producers \nwith very little information about what other cattle producers are \nreceiving for their cattle and what buyers are paying for cattle. The \nmarket information provisions of this bill will allow producers to deal \nwith their buyers on a more level playing field.\n  In addition, this bill provides additional flexibility and authority \nfor the Secretary of Agriculture to aggressively target noncompetitive \nactivities in livestock markets under the Packers and Stockyards Act. \nAnother extremely important provision in this bill is the mandated \nreview of Federal agriculture credit policies to determine whether or \nnot our lending practices are facilitating the growth of larger \nlivestock and dairy operations. Many dairy farmers have complained to \nme that they have a difficult time getting credit for both operating \npurposes and for capital investments because lenders insist that \nfarmers greatly expanding their herd size in order to be credit worthy. \nMany small farmers simply cannot get credit for minor herd expansion. \nThat is neither fair to our family sized farmers nor is it sound \npolicy. Such practices create self-fulfilling prophecies--forcing small \nfarms to grow significantly larger or to exit the industry. I am \nlooking forward to reviewing the results of the study required by this \nlegislation.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Daschle for his \ncooperation in including a provision in this bill which I proposed to \naddress concentration concerns and market information inadequacies in \ndairy markets. The cheese industry operates in a market that suffers \nfrom a lack of pricing information that is even more extreme than in \nthe cattle industry. While less than 2 percent of the cattle in the \nUnited States are sold on markets with open and competitive bidding, \nless than one-half of one percent of the cheese in the United States is \nsold on an open cash market--the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, \nWI.\n  Even so, the price opinion of the National Cheese Exchange directly \nand decisively affects the price that farmers throughout the nation \nreceive for their milk. Milk prices are tied directly to that price \nthrough the Basic Formula Price, calculated by USDA. The BFP determines \nthe class III price for milk under the Federal milk marketing order \nsystem. Even if that linkage did not exist, however, milk prices would \nstill be dramatically affected by the exchange opinion because it is \nused as the benchmark in virtually all forward contracts for bulk \ncheese. Ninety to ninety-five percent of bulk cheese in the United \nStates is sold through forward contracts. In other words, virtually all \ncheese sold in the country is priced based on the opinion price at the \ncheese exchange. Additionally, concentration in cheese processing is \nhigh and increasing. The top four manufacturers and marketers of \nprocessed cheese market 69 percent of the tonnage of processed cheese \nnationally. Most if not all of those manufacturers are traders on the \nexchange.\n  The National Cheese exchange has been the subject of great \ncontroversy among dairy farmers because the small amount of trading on \nthe exchange has such a substantial impact on farmers. A recently \nreleased report by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the \nWisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection \nconcluded that characteristics of the Green Bay cheese exchange make it \nvulnerable to price manipulation by the most powerful member-firms of \nthe exchange. While such behavior may or may not violate antitrust \nlaws, it is certainly not good policy to rely solely on this type of \nthin cash market to determine milk prices or cheese prices for the \nNation.\n  Like cattle producers, dairy farmers suspect that the price they \nreceive for their product may be controlled by a few large processors \nthat trade on the National Cheese Exchange. A one cent change in the \nopinion price at the exchange translates into a 10 cent change in the \nprice of milk to farmers. When prices on the exchange drop suddenly and \nprecipitously, dairy farmers nationally lose millions of dollars in \nproducer receipts and begin to wonder whether the price decline was \ntruly reflective of market conditions. Others suspect that in times of \nrising milk prices, such as today, traders on the exchange are able to \nprevent prices from rising as high as they might given the market \nconditions.\n\n  Unfortunately, no alternative to the National Cheese Exchange exist \nfor cheese price discovery. It is the only cash market in the country \nfor bulk cheese. While there is a futures market for cheese and other \ndairy products, trading of futures contracts have been weak making the \nfutures prices unreliable benchmarks. Furthermore, there is little or \nno market information on prices for spot transactions of cheese \ncollected by the Department of Agriculture. What little information \nthat is collected is not considered extensive enough to be reliable.\n  Section 4 of the Cattle Industry Improvement Act includes a provision \nrequiring the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and report weekly \nstatistically reliable prices and terms of trade for spot transactions \nof bulk cheese from all cheese manufacturing areas of the country. The \nintent of this provision is straight forward--to increase the amount of \nmarket information on cheese prices that is available to producers and \nprocessors.\n  This provision is not the end solution to the policy challenges \nimposed by the National Cheese Exchange. Those solutions will be \nconsidered by the Department of Agriculture through their Federal milk \nmarketing order reform process and by the regulators of the exchange. \nThis provision is a first step towards solving a complicated and multi-\nfaceted problem. This market data collection effort may only collect 5-\n10 percent of bulk cheese transactions nationally. However, even if the \ndata captures only 5 percent of the transactions, it will still \nrepresent a 10-fold increase in the amount of market information \navailable to producers and processors today.\n  As the USDA advisory report concluded ``It is of the utmost \nimportance that information about market conditions and trends be \nwidely available to sellers and buyers at all levels of the\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\nindustry. . . It is widely agreed that equal and accurate market \ninformation improves the price discovery and determination process.'' \nWhile that report was referring to cattle, not cheese, the principle \nthat more market information is always better holds true for cheese as \nwell.\n  USDA collection of prices for spot transaction of bulk cheese was \nrecommended by the joint UW-Madison/Wisconsin Department of Agriculture \nreport as a possible solution to the thin market problem at the Cheese \nExchange. During a recent House Livestock, Dairy and Poultry \nSubcommittee hearing on the National Cheese Exchange, the Department of \nAgriculture also suggested an approach similar to that described in \nSection 4 of this legislation as a way to improve cheese market \ninformation. Other witnesses, such as the National Farmers Union and \nKraft General Foods, also suggested increased reporting of spot \ntransactions of cheese as a method of improving price discovery in \ncheese markets.\n  Mr. President, this is a very modest data collection effort. This is \na first step towards improving market information in the dairy industry \nand lessening the influence of the exchange. It will not and is not \nintended to replace the National Cheese Exchange. The data collection \nrequired in the bill will merely supplement existing market information \nand hopefully, improve price discovery.\n  There is much more work to be done at both the State and Federal \nlevel to address the challenges posed by the National Cheese Exchange. \nBut I think this is a logical first step forward.\n  Once again, I thank the minority leader for his recognition of the \nimportance of the cheese price reporting provision in addressing \nconcentration and market information concerns in the dairy industry and \nfor his cooperation in including this provision in his important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7762-4", "month":

NATIONAL DAM SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) dams are an essential part of the national \n     infrastructure;\n       (B) dams fail from time to time with catastrophic results; \n     and\n       (C) dam safety is a vital public concern;\n       (2) dam failures have caused, and may cause in the future, \n     loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and economic \n     and social disruption;\n       (3)(A) some dams are at or near the end of their \n     structural, useful, or operational life; and\n       (B) the loss, destruction, and disruption resulting from \n     dam failures can be substantially reduced through the \n     development and implementation of dam safety hazard reduction \n     measures, including--\n       (i) improved design and construction standards and \n     practices supported by a national dam performance resource \n     bank located at Stanford University in California;\n       (ii) safe operation and maintenance procedures;\n       (iii) early warning systems;\n       (iv) coordinated emergency preparedness plans; and\n       (v) public awareness and involvement programs;\n       (4)(A) dam safety problems persist nationwide;\n       (B) while dam safety is principally a State responsibility, \n     the diversity in Federal and State dam safety programs calls \n     for national leadership in a cooperative effort involving the \n     Federal Government, State governments, and the private \n     sector; and\n       (C) an expertly staffed and adequately financed dam safety \n     hazard reduction program, based on Federal, State, local, and \n     private research, planning, decisionmaking, and \n     contributions, would reduce the risk of the loss, \n     destruction, and disruption resulting from dam failure by an \n     amount far greater than the cost of the program;\n       (5)(A) there is a fundamental need for a national program \n     for dam safety hazards reduction, and the need will continue; \n     and\n       (B) to be effective, such a national program will require \n     input from, and review by, Federal and non-Federal experts \n     in--\n       (i) dam design, construction, operation, and maintenance; \n     and\n       (ii) the practical application of dam failure hazard \n     reduction measures;\n       (6) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) there is no national dam safety program; and\n       (B) the coordinating authority for national leadership \n     concerning dam safety is provided through the dam safety \n     program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     established under Executive Order 12148 (50 U.S.C.

JOHN R. BOURGEOIS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \ndedication, public service, and patriotism that has personified the \ncareer of Col. John R. Bourgeois, U.S. Marine Corps. Colonel Bourgeois \nwill be retiring on July 11, after nearly 40 years in the Marine Corps \nand after 17 years as director of the U.S. Marine Band. On July 11, \nwhich marks the 198th birthday of the Marine Band, he will conduct his \nfinal concert as director of ``The President's Own'' at a change of \ncommand ceremony at Constitution Hall.\n  Colonel Bourgeois entered the Marine Corps in 1956 and after his \nrecruit training was stationed in San Francisco as principal French \nhornist with the Department of the Pacific Marine Band. In 1958, he \njoined the U.S. Marine Band here in Washington, both as a French \nhornist and as an arranger.\n  He became the U.S. Marine Band operations chief in 1968; assistant \ndirector in 1974; and director in 1979. John Bourgeois was promoted to \nthe rank of colonel in June 1983.\n  Col. John Bourgeois's career has spanned nine Presidential \nadministrations, and he has regularly conducted both the Marine Band \nand the Marine Chamber Orchestra at the Executive Mansion. He has also \nselected the musical program and directed the band at the U.S. Capitol \nfor four Presidential inaugurations.\n  As the 25th director of the Marine Band, Colonel Bourgeois has held \nthe traditional post of music director of Washington's prestigious \nGridiron Club, and composed the ``Gridiron Centennial'' march to honor \nthe club's centenary in 1985. He is also the producer of the annual \nsatirical productions of the Military Order of the Carabao, a \ndistinguished organization of past and present members of our armed \nservices who served in the Far East.\n  In recognition of his outstanding contributions to bands and band \nmusic, both in the United States and abroad, Colonel Bourgeois has been \nawarded the Medal of Sudler Order of Merit, and the Star of the Sudler \nOrder of Merit from the John Phillip Sousa Foundation. He has also \nreceived the Phi Mu Alpha National Citation for service and dedication \nto music and country.\n  Colonel Bourgeois is president of the National Band Association and \nof the John Phillip Sousa Foundation. He is the past president of the \nAmerican Bandmasters Association and the American vice president of the \nInternational Military Music Society. He is also a member of \nWashington's celebrated Alfalfa Club.\n  Under the colonel's leadership the Marine Band presented its first \noverseas performances in history, visiting the Netherlands, Ireland, \nNorway, England, and, in 1990, performing an historic 18 day concert \ntour of the former Soviet Union.\n  A Louisianan by birth, I am proud to say that John Bourgeois is a \nVirginian by choice. He resides for much of the year at his home in the \nbeautiful Shenandoah area of Little Washington.\n  John Bourgeois is a man of great musical achievement and outstanding \nintellectual qualities. I am honored to call attention to his \ndistinguished career and to wish him well in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7785-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ARMY BREAST CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past 4 years, I have \nstood on the floor of the Senate many times to express my strong \ncommittment for Federal support of breast cancer research. I have been \njoined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, many whose lives \nhave been personally touched by this deadly disease. Our voices have \njoined the millions of American families who have known all too well \nthe real consequences of this indiscriminate killer.\n  In 1992, the Members of this Chamber heeded the message we sent about \nthe inadequacies of Federal dollars provided to researchers to find the \ncauses and cure of breast cancer. It was then that Senator Harkin and I \nsuccessfully transfered $210 million from star wars to the Army Breast \nCancer Research Program at the Department of Defense. Despite some \nformidable forces, an additional $250 million has been appropriated for \nthis successful program in the 4 years since that time.\n  This year, I rise to thank my colleagues for their continued support \nof the Army Breast Cancer Research Program, particularly Senator \nStevens for his leadership as the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense. When we first began circulating the letter of \nsupport for the Army Breast Cancer Program to Members of the Senate, we \nwere encouraged by the number of Senators who supported the program. \nBut when we completed the process, we were extremely excited by the \nextraordinary support expressed by 54 Senators, the largest number \nsince the birth of this program.\n  Continued funding for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Program \nis more critical now than ever. Over the past 2 years, there have been \nincredible discoveries at a very rapid rate that offer fascinating \ninsights into the biology of breast cancer, such as the isolation of \nbreast cancer susceptibility genes, and discoveries about the basic \nmechanism of cancer cells. These discoveries have brought into sharp \nfocus the areas of research that hold promise and will build on the \nknowledge and investment we have made. The Army Breast Cancer Research \nProgram has provided researchers with the tools to make these \ntremendous breakthroughs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7785-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MERLE E. WOOD\n\n Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \noutstanding Kansan, Merle Wood, who passed away earlier this week. \nMerle was a resident of Olathe, KS.\n  Merle spent the first 24 years of his career as a petty officer in \nthe U.S. Navy, serving in both World War II and the Korean Conflict. He \nretired as the Navy's chief hospital corpsman.\n  After his first retirement, Merle served as a government relations \nrepresentative for American Home Products. In 1972 he went to work for \nMarion Laboratories as director and then vice president of government \naffairs. In 1985 he was elected to Marion's board of directors. He \nretired from his second career in 1989 and embarked on his third career \nas vice president of government and consumer affairs for the Kansas \nCity Royals.\n  Merle held leadership positions in many national organizations, \nincluding the American Quarter Horse Foundation, the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, and the League of the United Latin American \nCitizens. He received the Legion of Merit and Lifetime Membership Award \nfrom the Military Society of Anesthesiology and was a member of the \nAssociation of Military Surgeons. He also belonged to the Andrew G. \nMorrow Society of Cardiovascular Surgeons, which created the Merle E. \nWood Scholar Fellowship in his honor.\n  Mr. President, no one could meet Merle Wood without being charmed by \nhis open personality and impressed by his wide-ranging knowledge. I \nextend my condolences to his wife, Ellen, and their children. Merle \nwill be greatly missed by the Greater Kansas City community and all who \nknew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7785-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7785-S7786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            JUNK GUN PROLIFERATION THREATENS POLICE OFFICERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in March, I introduced legislation \nto prohibit the sale and manufacture of junk guns, or as they are also \ncalled, Saturday night specials. The importation of these cheap, easily \nconcealable, and\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nunsafe weapons has been prohibited since 1968, but their domestic \nproduction continues to soar.\n  In 1995, 8 of the 10 firearms most frequently traced at crime scenes \nwere junk guns.\n  My bill has received strong support from California's law enforcement \nleaders. The California Police Chiefs Association has endorsed my bill \nalong with more than two dozen individual police chiefs and sheriffs \nrepresenting some of California's largest cities and counties.\n  Law enforcement leaders support my bill because of the terrible \nthreat that junk guns present to police officers. Today, I want to \nspeak about that threat and share with my colleagues a letter I \nreceived from Janice Rogers, the wife of a California highway patrolman \nshot with one of the most common junk gun models.\n  Janice's husband, Officer Ronald Rogers, was on duty last March, when \nhe stopped to assist a pedestrian walking on a freeway shoulder near \nLivermore, CA. Before giving him a ride to a phone off the freeway, Ron \nhad to check the pedestrian for weapons. As Ron approached, the man \npulled out a junk gun concealed in his pocket and shot Officer Rogers \nin the face at point blank range. The bullet entered the left side of \nhis face and exited out the right side of his neck. It was a miracle, \nthe doctors later told Ron and Janice, that the bullet missed all vital \nstructures.\n  The force of the gunshot knocked Officer Rogers down. He tried to \ndraw his weapon but nerve damage caused by the gunshot rendered his \nright arm useless. The attacker pinned him to the ground and prepared \nto shoot him in the head a second time, but the gun jammed. He began \nbeating Officer Rogers mercilessly, hitting him in the head repeatedly \nwith the jammed pistol. By the time help arrived, Officer Rogers had \nnot only been shot in the face, but had also been pistol whipped 30 \ntimes, fracturing his skull and every bone in his face.\n  The firearm used in this horrible assault was a Davis Industries P-\n380. It is the second most frequently traced firearm at crime scenes. \nThis gun is so small that criminals can simply hide it in a pocket, as \nRon Rogers' assailant did.\n  If this firearm were made overseas, it could not be imported legally. \nIt is so small that it would fail the import test on the basis of size \nalone. However, because of the junk gun double standard--a loophole in \nthe law accidentally created by Congress in 1968--an estimated 100,000 \nof these guns are produced legally every year. It makes absolutely no \nsense. If a firearm is such a threat to public safety that its \nimportation should be restricted, its domestic production should also \nbe prohibited. A gun's point of origin is irrelevant.\n  Ron and Janice Rogers are courageous people. They worked together \nthrough months of grueling physical therapy and four reconstructive \nsurgeries. Last month, Officer Ron Rogers resumed full active duty in \nthe California Highway Patrol. The citizens of the bay area are \nfortunate to have law enforcement officers like Ron Rogers patroling \ntheir communities.\n  Janice Rogers wants to make sure that what happened to her husband \nnever happens to anyone else. That is why she has joined me in calling \nfor a ban on junk guns. I want to read what she wrote to me about my \nbill:\n\n       Opponents of your legislation might claim that banning \n     these types of weapons won't stop criminals who choose to use \n     weapons. We believe that it is the mass production of these \n     poor quality weapons which effectively place these guns into \n     the hands of criminals.\n\n  Janice Rogers is absolutely right. Each year, the companies that \ndominate the junk gun industry produce more than half a million \nhandguns. Many of those guns find their way into criminals' hands and \nare used in brutal assaults like the attempted murder of Officer Ron \nRogers.\n  To protect our families, our children, our communities, and our law \nenforcement officers, we must act now. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor the Junk Gun Violence Protection Act. I ask that the letter I \nreceived from Janice Rogers be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                     May 15, 1996.\n     Re Banning ``Junk Guns.''\n\n     Barbara Boxer, U.S. Senator, 1700 Montgomery Street, Suite \n         240, San Francisco, California 94111.\n     From: Ron & Janice Rogers.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We read with great interest about your \n     co-sponsoring legislation to prohibit the domestic \n     manufacture, transfer, and possession of Saturday Night \n     Specials. We would like to applaud your efforts to get these \n     weapons off of our streets. This topic holds very special \n     interest to us.\n       My husband, Ron has been an officer with the California \n     Highway Patrol for thirteen years. On March 11, 1995, while \n     on duty, Ron stopped to assist a pedestrian waling on the \n     shoulder of a freeway in the city of Livermore. The 19-year-\n     old pedestrian asked for a ride and Ron agreed to give him a \n     ride off of the freeway to a phone. Ron told him that he \n     would first have to check him for weapons prior to allowing \n     him to get in the patrol car. At this time, without warning, \n     the 19 year old pulled a Davis P-380 Auto Pistol he had \n     concealed in his pocket and shot Ron point-blank in the face. \n     The bullet entered the left side of Ron's face and exited the \n     right side of his neck. The trauma surgeons described the \n     bullet's path as miraculous in that it narrowly missed all \n     vital structures.\n       The force of the gunshot knocked Ron down an embankment. \n     His assailant came down after him. Ron was not aware at that \n     time that he had been shot, but he knew that he had been \n     severely injured. Ron attempted to draw him duty weapon as \n     his assailant came down the embankment after him, but due to \n     nerve damage caused by the bullet's path, his right arm and \n     hand would not function. A struggle ensued as they tumbled to \n     the bottom of the embankment. His assailant straddled him and \n     as he pulled the slide back he told Ron he was going to kill \n     him. His assailant fired a second shot but fortunately the \n     barrel of the gun had become plugged with mud from the \n     struggle and the bullet lodged in the barrel. When the Davis \n     P-380 Auto Pistol malfunctioned, his assailant then began \n     striking Ron in the head and face with the handgun while \n     attempting to remove Ron's gun from its holster. As Ron \n     struggled to keep his assailant from gaining access to his \n     gun, he was struck over 30 times with the handgun, inflicting \n     severe lacerations and fracturing Ron's skull and all of his \n     facial bones.\n       If it were not for the miraculous intervention of three \n     off-duty peace officers who stopped the assault and summoned \n     medical aid Ron would not be here today. The suspect, Larry \n     White is still in custody awaiting trial for attempted murder \n     of a peace officer. He has plead not guilty.\n       Opponents to your legislation might claim that banning \n     these types of weapons won't stop criminal who choose to use \n     weapons. We believe that it is the mass production of these \n     poor quality weapons which effectively places these guns into \n     the hands of criminals. Criminals find these weapons \n     particularly appealing in that they are cheap and easy to \n     conceal. It is a well known fact that these junk guns need to \n     be used at close range in order to ensure accuracy and that \n     basically ensures severe if not fatal injuries.\n       We are extremely concerned about the lack of responsibility \n     on the part of the gun's manufacturer for producing and \n     distributing a handgun which is clearly of insufficient \n     quality to be used for any sporting purpose, leaving its only \n     conceivable purpose to be for injuring or killing human being \n     at close range.\n       We discussed the possibility of a lawsuit with our \n     attorney, but he and his associates were unprepared to \n     undertake such a novel case on a contingent fee basis and \n     believed that financing such litigation would be costly and \n     would likely carry and appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. We \n     also contacted several of the lobbying organizations--Center \n     to Prevent Handgun Violence and Coalition to Stop Gun \n     Violence. Neither were willing to assist us in legal remedy \n     against Davis Industries after they discovered that the \n     serial numbers had been drilled off of the handgun.\n       Over a year has passed since Ron's assault. Ron has endured \n     four reconstructive surgeries and months of agonizing \n     physical therapy. Just this week he was released back to full \n     duty. We would like to think that in surviving such an ordeal \n     that we could in some way make a difference. Our opportunity \n     to pursue legal action passed us by, but if there is anything \n     that we can do to further your cause, please don't hesitate \n     to contact us. We would like to assist you in anyway that we \n     can.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janice L. Rogers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7785-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7786-S7787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

To receive the \naward, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career \nExploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior \nGirl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold \nAward project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by \nthe senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation \nbetween the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to these outstanding young ladies.

Mr. President, the FBI and the Office of Personnel \nManagement are making a terrible move that is not in the national \ninterest, that may save a few dollars temporarily, but will cost us in \nthe long run. They are privatizing many of our background checks.\n  Not only is this questionable from a security point of view, it will \nresult in a massive invasion of privacy.\n  Those of us in public life are on a big ``privatizing'' kick. The \nreason is rarely to save money. The main reason is so that people who \nare in executive positions can go out and say ``When I took office, \nthere were so many Federal employees or State employees or city \nemployees, but now there are fewer.'' The decrease makes it appear that \na great job is being done.\n  The reality is while that kind of talk goes on, the budgets tend to \ngo up.\n  Frequently, those who are adversely affected by privatization are \npeople at the very bottom of the economic ladder.\n  For example, we have privatized custodial services at some of the \nFederal buildings in Chicago. The already low wages for these people \nare being depressed more, and they lose the benefits of retirement pay \nand other things.\n  Privatizing background checks for those who either are coming into \ngovernment or who may be given greater responsibilities is simply \nfoolish.\n  Prof. Stephen Gillers of the New York University School of Law had an \nop-ed piece in the New York Times about this that should be creating \nsome concerns among Federal officials, as well as people at the State \nand local level.\n  I ask that the New York Times op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  The op-ed follows:\n\n                   Filegate Was Bad Enough. Now This?\n\n                          (By Stephen Gillers)\n\n       The F.B.I. called again last month. It phones several times \n     a year to ask me about former students who are seeking \n     sensitive Government jobs. I could verify that indeed it was \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation calling. The voice-mail \n     message had the bureau's telephone exchange, and the agent \n     talked the way agents do, unfailingly polite and right to the \n     point.\n       I answered all his questions. I trusted the confidentiality \n     of my answers, even though Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. \n     director, had recently acknowledged that the White House had \n     managed to ``victimize'' the bureau by getting its secret \n     files on prominent Republicans and others. I figure that two \n     ``Filegates'' in a generation is not something the bureau \n     will permit.\n       It seems that my next call may come not from the F.B.I., or \n     from the Office of Federal Investigations, which also checks \n     out Government personnel. It may instead come from a private \n     company, which under a Clinton Administration plan will \n     conduct 40 percent of Government security clearances. And I \n     may be questioned not by a G-Person (formerly G-Man), but by \n     a private investigator whose employer submitted a winning \n     bid. The decision to privatize this work, rash in the best of \n     times, needs a close second look after Filegate.\n       Take quality. Privatizing will dilute it. The company will \n     be free to accept other customers, including private ones. \n     Can I be confident that what I say will not be shared with \n     those customers? I'm not going to be as candid if my answers \n     can find their way into private files.\n       What about subpoenas? I doubt the courts will protect \n     private records as jealously as they do F.B.I. files. And \n     whom will I be talking to? I have a pretty good idea of \n     what's required to become a Government investigator, the \n     quality of supervision, and the length of time people hold \n     that job. But who will the private investigators be, who will \n     check their work, and where will they be working tomorrow?\n       The need to earn a profit will also compromise quality. \n     Under the plan, a private company owned by former Government \n     employees will have an exclusive contract for three years. \n     Then the work will be put up for bid. Whether payment is a \n     fixed sum for all investigations, or like piecework, a flat \n     fee per investigation, profitability will encourage companies \n     to do the minimum and not pursue the last elusive detail.\n       Abuse will also be easier. The F.B.I. has many ways to \n     protect itself. Its director cannot easily be fired, it \n     enjoys broad public support, and it has excellent media \n     contacts. Yet it did not stand up to a White House that, by \n     accident or design, easily obtained files for no lawful \n     reason. Will a private company, dependent on Government \n     officials for renewal of a lucrative contract, be able to \n     challenge an improper request? Don't count on it.\n       The only defense offered for this misguided plan is that it \n     may save $25 million yearly. But even that is unsure. While \n     the General Accounting Office cautiously concluded that \n     ``privatization would be likely to produce a net savings to \n     the Government in the long term,'' it added that ``any new \n     business faces many uncertainties that affect \n     profitability.''\n       One hidden cost will be duplication of work. Certain law-\n     enforcement records will be unavailable to private \n     investigators. So Government personnel will have to complete \n     the assignments, inevitably requiring them to retrace some \n     steps. This time must be added in figuring the true cost.\n       In any event, the savings are not worth it. As one Federal \n     investigator put it, this work is ``inherently \n     governmental.'' Some tasks should not be privatized because \n     the value of having the Government do them is priceless. \n     Enforcing the law and approving new drugs are two examples. \n     Security investigations for public jobs are a third. No \n     business, especially one with other customers, should be \n     authorized to routinely collect sensitive information on \n     American citizens in the name of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7787-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7787-S7788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL BOFINGER\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul \nBofinger from Concord, NH, as he retires as president of the Society \nfor the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Paul ends a distinguished \n35-year career with this organization, serving as its president for the \nlast 23 years. This exceptionally hard-working man has long been \nrecognized as one of the top conservationists in our State.\n  The last 35 years have seen a steady period of growth and awareness \nof conservation issues in New Hampshire, and Paul has played a large \nrole in this development. In the last three and a half decades, New \nHampshire became the first State to establish statewide control over \nseptic systems, and the first to take steps toward preserving wetlands. \nPaul is justly proud of his record and the fact that the number of New \nHampshire residents who are concerned about protecting the environment \nis increasing each year.\n  Paul is described by many as a master of negotiations. During the \nstruggle over the Wilderness Protection Act, he negotiated a balanced \nagreement which set aside 77,000 acres as national forest land while \npreserving land for timber as well. He demonstrated understanding for \nboth sides but always urged what was best for the land. Another of \nPaul's brilliant negotiations involved the construction of the \nFranconia Notch Parkway, a compromise between the preservation of \nforest lands and the construction of a four-lane interstate highway. \nPaul had a rare intuition for politics and policy and his heart was \nalways in the right place when it came to protecting our State.\n  Paul's many projects, from the Trust for New Hampshire Lands and the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council to the fight against acid rain and his \nsupport of current use legislation, have earned him numerous awards. \nSome of his more prestigious awards include: the John Aston Warner \nMedal for American Forests, the President's Conservation Achievement \nAward from the Nature Conservancy, and the Tudor Richards Award from \nthe Audubon Society of New Hampshire.\n  As Paul leaves the field of nature conservation, he will be sorely \nmissed, but his memory and work will endure. It is he and others like \nhim whom we should credit for preserving our beautiful New Hampshire \nwilderness for the next generation of Granite-staters. I thank Paul for \nhis 35 years of service\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nand commend him for an extraordinary job.

The bill \ncontains several provisions that I have strongly advocated and worked \nhard to advance.\n  First and foremost, the bill authorizes funds for three military \nconstruction projects in my home State of Delaware that will add to our \nmilitary preparedness. The first of these is a C-5 aerial delivery \nfacility at Dover Air Force Base that will allow the base to fulfill \nthe strategic brigade airdrop mission, enhancing Dover's leading role \nin meeting our new military requirements in the post-cold war era. \nSecond, $12 million for new visiting officers quarters will ease a \nsevere housing shortage at Dover and also allow for a much-needed \ntransportation upgrade at the base. Third, an operations and training \ncomplex for the Air National Guard will improve readiness by replacing \nseveral outdated and dilapidated facilities at the Air Guard's \nheadquarters at the New Castle County Airport. I am grateful to my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee for including these \nprojects, which I had requested.\n  I am also pleased that the bill provides for the transfer of the last \nparcel of military-controlled land at Cap Henlopen to the Delaware \nState Park System, completing a long-standing project I began when I \nfirst arrived in the Senate.\n  In addition, the bill restores two important provisions that I fought \nhard to include in the antiterrorism act, but were removed by the \nconference committee. First, the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor, gives authority to the Armed Forces \nto assist local law enforcement, should we ever face an emergency \ninvolving a chemical or biological weapon. The Armed Forces alone have \nthe capacity and equipment to respond to such an incident. In addition, \nthis amendment will improve our ability to interdict weapons of mass \ndestruction before they reach American soil. It will help ensure the \nsecurity of all Americans by expanding programs to safeguard nuclear \nmaterial in the former Soviet Union.\n  The second antiterrorism provision is a Feinstein-Biden amendment to \nprohibit the distribution of bomb-making information on the Internet. \nThe Senate had overwhelmingly approved this amendment to the \nantiterrorism bill, but it was not included in the final conference \nreport.\n  I am pleased that these two crucial antiterrorism provisions are \nincluded in the Defense authorization bill.\n  Another important amendment to this bill calls for a study of the \nbenefits and costs of enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nto include the new democracies of Central Europe.\n  While I believe that the addition of Poland, Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, and Slovenia may well strengthen our own security, that or \nour allies, and that of Europe as a whole, we must understand in detail \nwhat we are undertaking before asking these countries to shoulder the \nburdens of NATO membership. The mandated study will answer the relevant \nquestions.\n  Despite these significant achievements, Mr. President, I cannot \nsupport a bill that is fiscally irresponsible. If we are serious about \nbalancing the budget, no area of Government--including defense--should \nbe immune to a critical review of spending.\n  Between 1981 and 1992, the annual Federal deficit quadrupled--from \n$74 billion to $290 billion. Since 1992, the deficit has been cut by \nmore than half--the Congressional Budget Office now projects that the \nFederal deficit will be about $140 billion this year, down from $290 \nbillion at the end of the Bush administration.\n  This marks the first time in modern budget history--since we \ndemobilized at the end of WWII--that the deficit has gone down 4 years \nin a row.\n  The deficit is now less than 2 percent of our Nation's output--we \nhave the best budget record of any of the advanced industrial \neconomies. Today, Federal spending as a share of the economy is the \nlowest it has been since 1979.\n  This is a record that owes a lot to the hard choices we made in 1993 \nand to the discipline it has taken to stick with those decisions. We \ncannot--we must not--put this record in jeopardy. We certainly should \nnot throw more money at the Pentagon than it says it needs.\n  For every dollar wasted on exotic weapons systems that the Department \nof Defense is not asking for, there is less for crime prevention, for \nthe infrastructure that underpins our economy, and for education and \nresearch that will be the key to tomorrow's productivity growth.\n  We have to balance our priorities carefully and to use our scarce \nresources efficiently. The Defense budget should not become the new way \nto keep old habits alive.\n  The overwhelming majority of the money added to the President's \nDefense authorization request would go toward procurement and \ndevelopment of weapons systems that the Pentagon does not believe are \nnecessary to ensure the security of the United States. In fact, $3.8 \nbillion of the additional money is for programs that are not even in \nthe Pentagon's long-range plan to defend our country.\n  Mr. President, my distinguished colleagues argued for this \nunnecessary spending on the grounds that the readiness of our military \nwas at stake. This ignores the fact that American military readiness \ntoday is at an all-time high.\n  We cannot take an additional $11.4 billion our of the pockets of the \ntaxpaying American people to buy airplanes and ships we don't need. We \ncannot continue to borrow from our grandchildren's future to pay for \nadditional weapons at a time we face no major military threat. In \nshort, we cannot afford this bill.\n  Mr. President, I could not in good conscience vote to spend $11.4 \nbillion more than the military itself believes is necessary to defend \nour Nation. It is my hope that the conferees will work to bring down \nthe spending in this bill to an acceptable and responsible level, so \nthat at time, I can support the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7788-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7788-S7789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PASSING OF ALEX MANOOGIAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great personal sadness \nthat I note the passing of Alex Manoogian, a highly respected community \nleader and businessman from Detroit, MI. Mr. Manoogian was revered as \nthe most influential leader in the Armenian-American community in \nDetroit and throughout the United States.\n  Mr. Manoogian came to the United States from his native Armenia in \nthe 1920's, and settled in Detroit shortly thereafter. He soon founded \nthe Masco Corp., a small venture which by 1936 became the first company \nowned by an Armenian to be listed on the stock exchange. He married the \nformer Marie Tatian, who passed away in 1992, and was the father of a \ndaughter, Louise, and a son, Richard.\n  Mr. Manoogian was a member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union \n[AGBU] and the Knights of Vartan. By the 1940's he had been elected the \nnational commander of the Knights and director on the central board and \nthen president of the AGBU. In 1970, the AGBU voted him life president, \nand then in 1989 honorary life president, for his tremendous \ncontributions.\n  Under Mr. Manoogian's leadership, the Knights of Vartan Brotherhood \nestablished an endowment fund through which it donated services to the \nchurch and other charitable, educational, and cultural organizations. \nAlso under his leadership, the AGBU established the Alex and Marie \nManoogian Cultural Foundation, which has supported the publication and \ntranslation of many scholarly and literary works, funded cultural \nactivities and provided assistance to needy Armenian intellectuals and \neducators throughout the world.\n  Mr. Manoogian was a generous man who contributed to various \nhospitals, museums, libraries, universities, schools, and other \ncharitable and cultural organizations in the United States and around \nthe globe. He leaves us with many institutions throughout the world \nbearing his family name.\n  In recognition of his international philanthropy, Mr. Manoogian was\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\nawarded the Ellis Island Award, the Knight of Charity Award, the \nPresidential Medal from Argentina, the Cross of St. Gregory the \nIlluminator by His Holiness Vasken I, the Catholicos of all Armenians, \nthe First Order of the Cedars by the President of Lebanon, the Cross of \nSt. James by his Beatitude the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and the 50th \nAnniversary Medal by the Prime Minister of Armenia. The President of \nthe Republic of Armenia awarded him the honor of National Hero, and the \nPresident of Nagorno-Karabagh bestowed upon him the Medal of Honor of \nArtzakh.\n  He was a fine man, whom I personally shall miss. I extend my deep \ncondolences to the Manoogian family. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7788-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BUDDY BEARS FOR ABUSED CHILDREN\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure today to \nrecognize the Buddy Bears for Abused Children Program. This program is \na volunteer effort coordinated with Oregon law enforcement agencies \nthat donates teddy bears to abused children. The growth and popularity \nof this program serves as an example of its success in promoting a very \nspecial cause.\n  The Buddy Bear program provides a simple but immediate gift to \nchildren who are often at their most vulnerable. In many cases these \nchildren are being taken from the trauma of an abusive or drug addicted \nhome life or have been completely abandoned by their parents. At a \nconfusing and frightening moment in their young lives, this gift, \npresented to them by an officer, serves as an important signal of \ncaring and trust.\n  The driving force behind this program for the last 5 years has been \nLeonard H. Odom of Salem, OR. Mr. Odom is a member of the Marion County \nSheriff's Office and has spent hundreds of volunteer hours each year \ncollecting donations from individuals and businesses in the community. \nAs a result of his tireless efforts with the Buddy Bear program, he was \nawarded a letter of commendation from the Marion County Sheriff's \nOffice at an awards ceremony on May 17, of this year.\n  As an example of the impact of the Buddy Bear program, I would like \nto share a letter that Mr. Odom received. It reads:\n\n       Dear Mr. Buddy Bear,\n       An unusual and touching incident arose when I went to buy \n     the Buddy Bears, and I thought you might find it interesting. \n     A young, black girl, 18 or 19 waited on me. When she saw the \n     bears she picked one up and said, ``Hi Mr. Bear,'' and gave \n     him a hug. I said, ``Now don't get too attached to those \n     bears, they are for a very special purpose.''\n       I then proceeded to tell her that we have a friend who \n     works with the Sheriffs department and he collects bears to \n     give to children who have been in a traumatic situation. The \n     girl stopped what she was doing and she had this very \n     startled look on her face. She said, ``I got one of those \n     bears when I was a little girl. My Step-Dad tried to kill my \n     Mother. He went after her with a machete, he beat her, he hit \n     us, and when the police got there they gave me and my sister \n     a teddy bear to hug. I remember it to this day. I think your \n     friend is doing a wonderful thing.''\n       So now you know first hand how appreciated your work is to \n     the victims.\n       Elcena\n\n  It is programs like the Buddy Bears for Abused Children, and the \nenergy and commitment of people like Mr. Odom, that make volunteer \nefforts in Oregon and across the country so successful. I am honored \ntoday to recognize this program and individual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7789-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING TWO RIVERS LANDING VISITOR CENTER\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention \nto the recently completed Two Rivers Landing Visitor Center located in \nEaston, PA.\n  On July 16, 1996 a new state-of-the-art cultural visitor center will \nopen its doors to the public permitting visitors to experience the \nunique wonders of Easton and its surrounding communities. The visitor \ncenter embodies a highly successful public-private partnership between \nthe Federal Government, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, private industry, \ncommunity leaders and local lenders. The Two Rivers Landing Visitor \nCenter represents the anchor project in the Easton Economic Development \nCorporation's strategic plan for revitalizing Easton.\n  Primarily, the visitor center will celebrate the historic \naccomplishments of Binney & Smith, Inc., makers of Crayola crayons \nthrough a Crayola Factory display. In addition, the visitor center will \nhighlight the natural beauty and assets of the Easton region through a \nNational Canal Museum and National Heritage Corridor and State Heritage \nParks Center.\n  Unquestionably, the highlight of the Two Rivers Landing Visitor \nCenter will be the Crayola factory. The factory will allow visitors the \nopportunity to experience first-hand how a Crayola crayon is molded, \nlabeled, and packaged. The Crayola factory component will allow \nvisitors the opportunity to creatively interact with Crayola products \nin a range of different mediums.\n  Mr. President, for generations Americans of all ages have experienced \nthe joy and magic of Crayola crayons. Crayola crayons have become a \npart of our lives not only as children, but also as parents and \ngrandparents. It is estimated that 20,000 visitors travel to the Binney \n& Smith, Inc. Forks Township, PA manufacturing facility each year to \nwitness the creation of these crayons. The number of visitors is even \nmore astounding when one realizes that the current manufacturing plant \ntour uses no advertising or promotions whatsoever. With these facts in \nmind, I hope my colleagues will join me in observing a National Day of \nColor in honor of this opening.\n  I hope that the visitors center will also act as a local hub to \ndirect tourists to the region's other enriching attractions--children's \nshows and performances at the nearby State Theater, the canal boat ride \nand locktender's house located at Huge Moore Park, the fish ladder on \nthe Delaware River, activities occurring at Lafayette College, local \nrestaurants, local retailers, other regional events, and Bushkill Park.\n  Mr. President, it has been 3 years since proposals were unveiled to \ncreate a visitor center that would help revitalize downtown Easton. \nThose who have had the privilege to tour the facility prior to its \ngrand opening indicate that the facility has successfully captured the \nspirit and history of the Easton region.\n  The Two Rivers Landing Visitor Center will expose many new visitors \nto the rich heritage of Easton, while at the same time, stimulating the \neconomy of the region. I would like to congratulate the parties \ninvolved in this undertaking on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/11/senate-section/article/S7789-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JULY 12, 1996, AND TUESDAY, JULY 16, 1996\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
