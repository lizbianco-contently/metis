Mr. President, we will have morning business until the hour \nof 3 p.m., with Senators to speak for up to 5 minutes each. Senator \nDaschle, or his designee, is in control of the first 90 minutes; \nSenator Coverdell, or his designee, is in control of the next 90 \nminutes. If there are no requests for morning business, then we may \nstand in recess during part of that period until 3 o'clock.\n  At 3 o'clock, we will resume consideration of H.R. 2937. We will have \nno rollcall votes. There will be a cloture vote on H.R. 2937, the White \nHouse Travel Office legislation at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. Under the \nprovisions of rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. today to file \nfirst-degree amendments to H.R. 2937. Hopefully, we can complete action \non the Travel Office bill on Tuesday.\n  Other items possible for consideration this week, if we can work them \nout, are: Amtrak authorization; the firefighters age discrimination \nbill; and the balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I hope we might be able to pass the balanced budget constitutional \namendment early this week or next week. It is supported by 80 percent \nof the American people. We addressed some of the concerns that some of \nmy colleagues who voted against the amendment expressed last year about \nprotecting Social Security. We believe we will have language that \nshould satisfy real concerns--if somebody is playing games, we will not \nsatisfy them--if they have real concerns. We are also concerned about \nprotecting Social Security.\n\n  In our balanced budget, which we sent to the President, which he \nvetoed, we did not touch Social Security. We believe we can overcome \nsome of the objections that some have if they are real concerns. \nOtherwise, we will not be able to do that.\n  Tomorrow is tax freedom day. That is when people can take a break \nfrom taxes. Starting on the 8th of May, they start working for \nthemselves instead of the governments who impose taxes. It will be a \ngood day to pass the gas tax repeal. It seems to me it might have a \nnice ring to it.\n  Mr. President, 4.3 cents may not seem like a lot per gallon, but it \nadds up to about $4.8 billion a year, and it does not go into any fund \nto build highways. It goes into what we call deficit reduction, which \nhas only been done one other time. That was on a very temporary basis \nbetween 1990 and 1993, when 2.5 cents went into tax reduction. That was \nnecessary to get an agreement on the 1993 budget. Normally, gas taxes \nare used for highways, bridges, and other structures, and mass transit \nto help improve travel conditions for people to make the highways \nsafer, mass transit safer.\n  But this gas tax by President Clinton for deficit reduction is \npermanent. We think it should be repealed. We can find ways to cut \nspending or some other way to offset it if we are not going to add to \nthe deficit. We think we can do that.\n  There is a bill at the desk, Calendar No. 374, H.R. 2337, the \ntaxpayer bill of rights. Sometime before the day is out, I will ask \nconsent that we be able to take up that bill and offer one amendment--\nthat would be the gas tax repeal--and send it back to the House. I am \ncertain they will pass it very quickly. As I understand, there is \nbipartisan support now for repealing the gas tax. Maybe we can \naccomplish it on that revenue bill.\n  I have also asked Senator Lott and Senator Lott has reported to me he \nhad a good discussion on Friday with Senator Daschle with reference to \nscheduling the minimum wage. We believe we have made a fair proposal. \nWe hope it might be accepted.\n  Otherwise, I think the matter people are really concerned about in \nAmerica is a balanced budget and whether we have the will to amend or \nat least send a constitutional amendment to the States and see if \nthree-fourths of the States will ratify it. If that happens,\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nthe constitutional amendment, if it is ratified, of course, becomes \npart of the Constitution. Then we will have more discipline in the \nCongress when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and when it comes \nto ordering priorities.\n  Beyond that, anything else that should occur, we will make an \nannouncement on the Senate floor this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4697-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I wish you a good morning. I ask you to \nimagine the following situation: You are stricken with bone cancer. \nUnfortunately, your doctor informs you that radiation therapy is no \nlonger an option because it creates low-level radioactive waste and \nthey simply cannot store any more.\n  Or another one: A loved one tests HIV positive. Sadly, we learn that \nbreakthrough research using radioactive materials to find a cure for \nAIDS is being suspended. Why? Because we cannot store any more waste.\n  Finally, imagine this: You are the parent of a student at the \nUniversity of California. You're informed that a fire occurred in a \nradioactive storage waste building on campus and exposed your son or \ndaughter to radiation released by the fire.\n  These are not farfetched situations, Mr. President. In fact, \nradioactive waste is piling up on college campuses, hospitals, and \nbusinesses at some 800 sites in California alone.\n  This chart tries to depict the distribution of low-level radioactive \nwaste that is stored today in California. The current situation shows \nthat it is virtually all over--in the bay area, the Sacramento area, \nsouthern California, Los Angeles, San Diego, and so forth. There are \n2,254 material licensees who store waste at some 800 sites in populated \nareas, endangered by the threat of fires, earthquakes, and floods. It \nis an extraordinary expense and duplication of effort.\n  Over 2,000 colleges, hospitals, and businesses in California alone \nare licensed to use radioactive materials. I have a list of them. There \nare radioactive materials or waste in San Francisco, as a matter of \nfact, at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco; in Chinatown, at 845 \nJackson Street, to be specific; the University of San Francisco at 2130 \nFulton Street; in Santa Monica at 2200 Santa Monica Boulevard; in \nBeverly Hills at 9400 Brighton Way.\n  These are just a few of the research centers, the hospitals, the \nbiotechnical firms, and the cancer treatment centers that use \nradioactive materials. These materials are needed and used to improve \nand prolong our lives.\n  But we endanger our opportunity to enjoy these benefits when we do \nnot allow the State of California to carry out the radioactive trash \nfor proper disposal. That is exactly what is happening today because \nour Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, will not allow the State of \nCalifornia to dispose of its low-level waste at Ward Valley, which is \nthe site California has licensed for this waste.\n  Mr. President, let me show you the second chart. This is California \nwithout those 800-plus sites, with 1 site designated as a repository \nfor low-level waste, 1 site in a remote area away from the populated \nareas, away from the area of southern California, away from the bay \narea. This was a site selected after a 7-year process of scientific \nstudy and public input. It is a site secure from fires, earthquakes, \nand floods. It is carefully monitored and regulated, meeting all \nFederal and State health and safety protection standards.\n  Is it not better, Mr. President, to just have 1 site for low-level \nradioactivity instead of over 800 sites? Certainly it is. Soon we could \nreach a point where advanced medical treatment for cancers and other \nmedical research will be curtailed or even halted due to a failure to \ndeal with the waste problem.\n  Is this a sane situation? Certainly not. Unfortunately, many of the \ntemporary sites used for storage of radioactive waste across California \nare vulnerable to exposure such as fires, earthquakes, or floods, which \ncould cause an accidental release of radioactivity in urban or suburban \nneighborhoods. Doctors are worried that the storage problem will \nimpact, if you will, future cancer treatment. Researchers are worried \nthat it will impact medical research. Educators are wondering how they \nwill explain to the parents of students that their children live on \ncampus that stores low-level radioactive waste.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, California has an environmental problem. But \nto California's credit, California has acted in good faith to address \nthis problem.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, which has the oversight for this matter of both low-level \nand high-level radioactive waste, I commend the Governor and the State \nof California for the manner in which they have attempted to live under \nthe Federal law which has given the States the authority to address \nlow-level waste.\n  Acting in accordance with the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act \nand all applicable environmental laws and regulations, California has \nfound a solution. California wants this radioactive waste, used, again, \nby more than 2,200 licensees in California, they want it to be removed \nfrom those 800 suburban and urban locations to a safe, licensed \nmonitoring location at Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert, which I have \nshown on the chart here.\n  Let us go back and look at a little of the history. After an 8-year \neffort under the NRC guidelines, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nguidelines, and the expenditure of over $45 million, the California \nDepartment of Health Services issued a license for a low-level waste \nsite at Ward Valley. The California Department of Health had the \nauthority to issue the license. The Federal Government gave them the \nauthority. They issued it.\n  But even with that license in hand, the operator of the site has been \nunable to begin construction and operation because radical antinuclear \nactivists have launched a crusade to stop Ward Valley. Those activists \nhave used every conceivable method. They have sued. They have \ndemonstrated. They have occupied the site. They have made outrageous \nand scientifically indefensible claims.\n\n  But these groups are wrong. They have been proven wrong. All of their \nradical lawsuits challenging the licenses have been heard, and they \nhave been dismissed. Their legal challenges have been exhausted.\n  Two environmental impact statements have shown their radical claims \nabout Ward Valley's environmental impacts to be absolutely inaccurate, \njust plain wrong. The two biological opinions from the Endangered \nSpecies Act have shown their radical claims about Ward Valley's impact \non the desert tortoise are simply wrong. They have reached out under \nevery conceivable avenue in an attempt to find an excuse to stop going \nahead with Ward Valley.\n  In a special scientific report which was prepared for Secretary of \nthe Interior Babbitt, the National Academy of Sciences concluded, on \nthe issue of ground water contamination which was certainly a \nlegitimate consideration, that there is a highly unlikely prospect of \nany potential threat of ground water contamination in this area with so \nlittle rainfall out in the Mojave Desert.\n  They further stated that there is no health threat posed to Colorado \nRiver drinking water as some of the radical opponents continue to \nerroneously claim. They claim that somehow this is going to seep down \ninto the ground water and get into the Colorado River. They will reach \nout and conclude almost anything, Mr. President.\n  As the chairman of the National Academy's committee recently wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\n\n       . . . none of the data reviewed by the Committee support \n     further delay or opposition to construction of this facility, \n     provided the oversight and monitoring recommendations of the \n     Committee are in place.\n\n  On the merits, the radical antinuclear activists have been slam-\ndunked. But merits are not enough in this process, Mr. President, as we \nboth know. As the Senator from Wyoming and myself, the Senator from \nAlaska, have seen time and time again, you can win on the merits and \nyou can lose on the emotional arguments.\n  But on this issue, the activists have lost every battle. They have \nbeen proven wrong again and again and again.\n  But the BLM land for the Ward Valley site has not been transferred to \nthe State of California. This is BLM, Bureau of Land Management, land \nin California. It has not been transferred. Why? The waste still sits \nin the neighborhoods, still sits in the schools, still sits in the \nhospitals.\n  Why has it not been done? It has not been done because the \nantinuclear activists have convinced the Interior Department to stand \nin the way of the transfer. At each opportunity they present a new \ntwist, a new obstacle. The latest twist involves the discovery of \nelevated levels of tritium gas at an old low-level waste site in \nBeatty, NV. Opponents of Ward Valley claim that this somehow proves \nthat the same thing will happen at Ward Valley. The Interior Department \nis now using this as an excuse for further delay at Ward Valley.\n  It is interesting to note what Secretary Babbitt's own Director of \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, in a memorandum dated February 14, had to \nsay about the supposed links between the Beatty site and Ward Valley:\n\n       . . . the observed tritium distribution at Beatty is \n     probably the result of the burial of liquid wastes and the \n     fact that some disposal trenches at Beatty were left open for \n     years until filled, allowing accumulation and infiltration of \n     precipitation. . . . The [Ward Valley] license does not \n     permit disposal of radioactive waste in liquid form and \n     requires that only the minimum amount of open trench \n     necessary for the safe and efficient operation shall be \n     excavated at any one time. Because of the differences in \n     waste burial practices at the Beatty site compared to those \n     intended for the Ward Valley site . . . extrapolations of the \n     results from Beatty to Ward Valley are too trenuous to have \n     much scientific value.\n\n  The day after receiving this memo, the Deputy Secretary of the \nInterior called for further tests, further delays, even though the \nscientific advice he received was to the contrary.\n  Now, what you have here is a rather interesting situation. You have \nthe State of California, who has gone through a process of expending \nover $40 million on the evaluation, the application, and the licensing. \nWho has a greater responsibility to the health and welfare of the \npeople of California than the Governor and the California Department of \nHealth that have approved this site? They are certainly competent in \ndetermining whether or not the recommendations by the scientific \ncommunity are carried out, all Federal and State laws are mandated in \ncompliance with regulations. The Secretary somehow seems to dismiss \nthis.\n  Why would the Interior Department want to take this attitude? Some \nsuggest they made a political calculation that Ward Valley can yet be \nanother environment issue that can be shaped to make perhaps Congress \nlook bad with respect to protecting the environment.\n  I am here to say that their political calculation is wrong, Mr. \nPresident. On the issue of Ward Valley, the radical and antinuclear \nactivists and their friends in the administration have simply gone too \nfar. I think they have crossed the line, because they are jeopardizing \nthe environment, because they are jeopardizing human health and safety, \nbecause they evidently would rather keep radioactive waste near the \nschools and the neighborhoods than at a licensed site in the remote \ndesert, a remote area where people are far away, where children do not \nplay and people do not work.\n  Put simply, they have gone too far because their radicalism has \nreached the point where it will start harming the safety of the people. \nThey think they can get away with that, because they believe Ward \nValley can be spun as an issue where the so-called environmentalists \nare keeping Congress from thrashing the environment. Sooner or later, \neven in this town, even with the media perception being what it is with \nrespect to radioactivity, I have to believe that the plain and simple \ntruth will eventually defeat this misinformation.\n  The plain and simple truth is this, Mr. President: We have an \nobligation to protect the environment. We want to protect the \nenvironment. If you want to maintain important medical research, \nadvance treatment, and so forth, if you want to get stored \nradioactivity waste out of schools, hospitals, and neighborhoods to a \nsite that the National Academy of Sciences and the State of California \nsays is best, opening Ward Valley is the right thing to do.\n  Just do not take my word for it, Mr. President. Take the word of the \nNational Association of Cancer Patients; the Association of American \nMedical Colleges; the American College of Nuclear Physicians; the \nCalifornia Medical Association; the American Medical Association; the \nSouthwestern Low-Level Radioactivity Waste Commission, representing \nCalifornia, Arizona, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Southeast \nCompact Commission, representing Alabama, Florida, Georgia, \nMississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia; the Midwest \nInterstate Low-Level radioactivity Waste Commission, representing \nIndiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin; the Northwest \nInterstate Low-Level Radioactivity Commission, representing Alaska, \nHawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming; the \nState of California Department of Health; University of California at \nLos Angeles, UCLA; University of Southern California; Stanford \nUniversity--and more, Mr. President, too numerous to name, who all \nsupport Ward Valley.\n  Mr. President, this should not be a partisan issue. We have not \nsought to make it a partisan issue. Senate bill 1596, a bill to \ntransfer the land to the Ward Valley site, was introduced by both a \nDemocrat and Republican. It was voted out of committee by bipartisan \nvoice vote.\n  Let me warn those who attempt to make this a partisan issue. If you \noppose the bill for partisan political purposes, you are on the wrong \nside of science. You will be on the wrong side of the environment. You \nwill be on the wrong side of human health and safety. You will endanger \nthe viability of the Low-Level Radioactivity Waste Policy Act. The \nresult of that might mean that the next low-level waste will be in your \nState. I invite any and all my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nSenate bill 1596.\n  Mr. President, the point I want to make here--and I think it is very \nimportant--this is an issue that is in the interest not just of the \nState of California but of the entire Nation. It is going to set the \nthreshold for just what we do with low-level waste, whether we \ncontinue, like the ostrich, to bury our head in the sand and simply \nignore it.\n  We have seen, in this chart, in the State of California we have over \n800 sites. If those critics propose no other alternative, or whether we \nhave one site that is approved by the State, supported by the Governor, \naddressed by the National Academy of Science, then we can proceed with \nthis. That will set, if you will, policy in other States where we have \nthe same set of circumstances, perhaps not as acute in California. I \nsuggest New York and other areas where we have a concentration of \npopulation and advanced medical and technical experiments going on. It \nis not a partisan issue.\n  It is an environmental issue. It is a responsible environmental \nissue. And this administration and this Secretary of the Interior by \nnot coming up with an alternative that is better than that proposed by \nthe State of California after the Federal Government has given the \nStates the authority to proceed with disposing the low-level waste is \nacting irresponsibly.\n  What has happened here? I do not criticize President Clinton. But I \ncriticize the bad advice that he has been given by Secretary Babbitt \nbecause the White House, in following the advice of the Secretary of \nthe Interior, has made this a partisan political issue, and they should \nnot have done so. The issue is science. Science is on our side. The \npublic health and the safety arguments are on our side.\n  Ward Valley is the legitimate site. If we are going to give the \nStates the responsibility, as we have done, and then\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\nturn around and not let them exercise that responsibility, then the \nenemy, as is often the case, is us.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about it, Mr. President. \nSenate bill 1596 is just that. It would legislate because the Secretary \nof the Interior refuses to proceed the land exchange mandating that the \nFederal Government make this site available to the State of California.\n  Mr. President, I could not be more outspoken in my frustration, and \njoining with the State of California in a matter in which this issue--\nwhich affects the health and the welfare, and sets the precedent for \nthe manner in which we are going to address the eventual disposition of \nlow-level nuclear waste--is to be addressed.\n  How can we, Mr. President, think we will resolve the issue of \nmanaging the high-level radioactive waste that has been generated \naround this country by our national defense facilities as well as our \nnuclear powerplants if we cannot even agree on what to do with low-\nlevel waste? That is the situation we are facing today.\n  We have a proposal before this body to designate the Nevada test site \nas the site for a temporary high-level nuclear waste storage facility. \nWhat is this all about, Mr. President?\n  What we have done over the last 15 years or so is expend over $5 \nbillion to investigate the suitability of Yucca Mountain, NV, as a site \nfor a permanent geologic repository for high-level nuclear waste. Yucca \nMountain is adjacent to the Nevada test site, which, for the last 50 \nyears or so, has been used for a series of above and below ground tests \nof atomic bombs. The Nevada test site is an area of Nevada that is \nstill off limits to the public because of the activities that have \ntaken place there. I have been there. I have been in the tunnel that is \nbeing dug into Yucca Mountain to evaluate the permanent repository \nsite. Currently the test tunnel is nearly 3 miles long. However, the \nprospect of the geologic repository being the answer to our immediate \nhigh-level waste storage problem is fraught with the same bureaucratic \ninefficiencies associated with the Ward Valley low-level waste facility \nthat I just discussed.\n  The crux of the current situation is that we have waste stored \nthroughout the Nation adjacent to our nuclear powerplants. About 20 \npercent of our country's power generation comes from nuclear \npowerplants. This waste is stored at the plant sites. On-site storage \nis licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But the fact is that \nthe Federal Government made a contractual commitment to take that waste \naway from the reactor sites by the year 1998. Under those contracts, \nthe Federal Government has collected about $11 billion from America's \nratepayers to pay for a government facility to store the nuclear fuel. \nUnder the existing program, we are not going to be able to meet the \nGovernment's commitment to take waste in 1998 or anytime in the near \nfuture. Already, there are lawsuits that have been filed against the \nFederal Government for nonperformance.\n  So here we sit, with a program that is continuing to pursue a \npermanent geologic repository with no other alternatives in sight. We \nwill spend perhaps another $4 to $5 billion before the Department of \nEnergy will make a decision as to whether or not it should apply for a \nlicense for Yucca Mountain for use as a permanent repository. Then we \nhave to actually get it licensed. Although the odds on the site being \nfound suitable by the Department of Energy have been set at 80 percent, \nthe odds on actually getting a license from the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission have been set at 50-50. This gives you some idea of the \ngamble we are taking with the ratepayer's money.\n\n  So what many of us have proposed is that the Nevada test site be used \nfor an interim storage site for spent nuclear fuel until there is a \ndetermination of whether or not Yucca Mountain can be licensed for \npermanent storage.\n  There are some interesting things going on in the area of nuclear \nwaste disposal. Japan, France, and England operate under an entirely \ndifferent theory. Legitimate concerns over nuclear weapons \nproliferation arise because nuclear reactors generate small amounts of \nplutonium mixed into their spent nuclear fuel. It is a policy in the \nUnited States that we take this high-level waste and bury it. In France \nand Japan the practice is to recover it, and through a MOx fuel \nprocess, put it back into the nuclear reactors, burn it, and thereby \nreduce the proliferation risk. Each country's ultimate disposition of \nits high-level waste is an interesting comparison, to say the least. \nThe French and the Japanese, of course, have the theory of burning \nplutonium by injecting it into the reactor with depleted uranium. This \ndisposes of the proliferation threat because the high-level waste that \nresult does not contain plutonium. You have a residue that is a glass-\nlike substance. The point is that this kind of material cannot be \nreprocessed and an explosive device made out of it.\n  So while it is a rather complex concept, Mr. President, the theory is \nthat you can either choose to bury your high-level waste permanently in \nthe belief that you can build a site that can be proven to withstand \nearthquakes, that will withstand flooding, if it ever should occur, or \nsome other natural event that might interfere with the storage site, or \nwhether you use an advanced technical process and burn the plutonium \nand, therefore, eliminate the threat of proliferation.\n  Although other countries have chosen this different approach, I would \nlike to point out that, in S. 1271, we are proposing that a temporary \nstorage site be built in Nevada, and that the plan to build a permanent \nrepository facility continue. Why Nevada, Mr. President? As I have \nsaid, the site would be in that portion of Nevada that has been used \nfor tests of atomic bombs over the last 50 years. It is a site that \nobviously carries a great deal of experience with radioactive materials \nand seems to meet--at least as far as we can tell after 5 billion \ndollars' worth of research--the test as a viable site for a permanent \nrepository. Having one interim storage facility would remove this \nmaterial from the areas where it is currently stored near the nuclear \npower stations in some 41 States. We have over 80 storage areas in \nthose 41 States. Illinois, for example, has several in their State. \nCentralizing all of that spent fuel in one location is really what we \nare talking about in designating the Nevada test site as a temporary \nstorage site.\n  My good friends from Nevada are opposed to this. Why are they opposed \nto this? Well, unfortunately, we only have 50 States, Mr. President. \nYou have to put nuclear waste somewhere. Where is the best place to put \nit? Well, in my mind, it seems to me that Nevada is the best place \nbecause the Nevada test site, used for nuclear materials testing for so \nlong, is remote and is because of its use in the past, must be secured \nby the Government for the foreseeable future.\n  So why not use this site as a temporary repository until we can \ndetermine where our permanent repository will be? If the permanent \nrepository site at Yucca Mountain is found to be suitable and the \nDepartment of Energy decides to go forward to try to get a license, we \nwill need an interim storage facility at that site. Even after a \nsuitability decision is made, we are going to have to spend another \n$4.5 or $5 billion to determine whether that site meets our licensing \nrequirements for a permanent repository. That decision will be years \ndown the line.\n  There is another activity going on here that I want to point out to \nmy colleagues. Some groups see this as a way to terminate, if you will, \nthe operations of many of our nuclear power generating reactors around \nthe country because the spent fuel storage at those sites is almost \nfilled to capacity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses them to \na specific capacity, and when they are filled, why, obviously, they \ncannot add more spent fuel without violating their license. Building \nadditional on-site storage requires State approval. Because the Federal \nGovernment is not able to fulfill its promise to take the fuel away, \ngetting that approval usually becomes a very contentious process.\n  Of course, the utilities' plans to store spent nuclear fuel on-site \nwere dependent on the Federal Government meeting its commitment to take \nthat high-level nuclear waste from the power generators at those sites \nby the year 1998. However, we do not have the ability to meet that \ncommitment; we do not have a permanent site licensed or\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\nbuilt. So temporary storage is an interim alternative that makes a lot \nof sense.\n  My colleagues from Nevada have suggested that interim storage is an \nimpractical alternative because you are moving spent nuclear fuel from \nareas around the country where it is currently stored to one site in \nthe State of Nevada. They have suggested that if it is decided that the \npermanent storage site will be somewhere else, you will have to move it \nagain.\n  That is a bit presumptuous, because the site at Yucca Mountain is the \nbest site that we have been able to come up with so far in all the 50 \nStates. There is every reason to believe that ultimately Yucca Mountain \nwill be determined the permanent site. In any case, we must move the \nspent nuclear fuel out of the other 80 sites where it is stored now and \nput it in one concentrated area until such time as a final decision is \nmade about a permanent site. The Nevada test site is the best site. It \nwill go across the country in casks that are engineered in such a way \nas to withstand any imaginable accident, including railroad \nderailments. These are very highly engineered containers. A great deal \nof expertise has gone into their design. So the exposure to the public \nfrom the standpoint of transportation is virtually nil. The risk can be \nalmost eliminated. We can, therefore, safely take this waste that is in \nthe 41 affected States, move it to Nevada, and temporarily store it \nuntil we have a permanent repository. That is what the legislation is \nall about.\n  As time goes on, I will urge the leadership to take up the \nlegislation designating the Nevada test site as the site for a \ntemporary storage facility, and I will proceed with extensive floor \nstatements describing the sites around the United States where we have \nnuclear powerplants, the concentration of nuclear waste that is stored, \nand the merits of why the Nevada test site is the most logical and \npractical site and why we should do it now.\n  As I indicated earlier with my discussion of the Ward Valley low-\nlevel waste situation, this is yet another serious environmental issue \nwhere we are being urged by some to put our head in the sand rather \nthan address a critical problem. This waste already exists. Further, we \nneed the 20-percent electricity that is generated by the nuclear power \nindustry. If we are to shut down those reactors, what are we going to \nreplace it with? Are we going to replace it with coal or oil? That \nenergy must come from some other source.\n  We need the nuclear power generating industry and its contribution to \nthe electric supply of the United States. We cannot do without it. But \nwhether or not we continue to have nuclear power, the question is how \nwe can responsibly relieve the existing spent nuclear fuel that has \naccumulated over an extended period of time. How can we meet the \nFederal Government's obligation? The Federal Government has been paid \n$11 billion by ratepayers to take this waste by 1998, and we will not \nable to do it under the existing program.\n  The only responsible alternative is to proceed and designate the \nNevada test site as a temporary repository site until such time as a \npermanent repository can be licensed. So it is my hope we can schedule \nthis legislation in the not too distant future and proceed with \nlegislation that presents a responsible alternative to the current \nirresponsible policy of simply avoiding a decision on this critical \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I have editorials from newspapers including the Oregon \nStatesman Journal, the Washington Post, the Denver Post, the St. \nJoseph, MO Herald Palladium, and the Harrisburg, PA Patriot-News, as \nwell as many others, in support of naming Yucca Mountain a temporary \nrepository for nuclear waste. I ask unanimous consent that a sample of \nthese editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Patriot-News, Jan. 26, 1996]\n\nHigh-Level Risk: Federal Foot-Dragging Leaves N-Plants No Option But To \n                          Store Waste on-Site\n\n       Two of the three nuclear power stations along the \n     Susquehanna River may soon begin storing highly radioactive \n     spent fuel in steel-and-concrete casks in on-site facilities \n     specially built for the purpose.\n       This nuclear material, one of the most dangerous substances \n     known to science, was never intended to be stored on a long-\n     term basis at nuclear power plants. Under a law passed in \n     1982 by Congress, the Federal Government was assigned \n     responsibility to take permanent custody of spent fuel from \n     commercial nuclear reactors.\n       A long-term storage facility for the waste was to be opened \n     by 1988, by the Energy Department, still conducting studies \n     of the proposed Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, says it \n     doesn't expect the facility to be ready until at least 2010.\n       This high-level radioactive waste is so lethal that it must \n     be stored in a manner that will shield it from the \n     environment for thousands of years, a period longer than \n     mankind's recorded history. Not surprisingly, no state wants \n     to serve as permanent host for the waste, but the end result \n     of the failure of the government to move decisively to build \n     a storage facility is that nuclear power stations around the \n     country are fulfilling that role by default.\n       Under ordinary circumstances, spent fuel is removed from \n     the reactor and held in nearby pools of water for several \n     months to cool and to allow some of the radiation to \n     dissipate. Utilities have gone to great lengths to devise \n     ways to increase the capacity of the cooling ponds, but a \n     growing number have run out of options and are moving to \n     construct new facilities in which the waste is stored in \n     dry steel-and-concrete canisters.\n       Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. plans to begin construction \n     this year of a $10 million on-site spent-fuel storage \n     facility at its Susquehanna nuclear power station at Berwick. \n     PECO Energy Co. is contemplating a similar move at its Peach \n     Bottom nuclear power facility in York County.\n       Three Mile Island is expected to have sufficient storage \n     capacity to last through the expected life of that nuclear \n     plant, according to owner GPU Nuclear Corp.\n       A lawsuit, in which GPU, other utilities and the state \n     Public Utility Commission are participants, is seeking to \n     force the federal government to speed up the process of \n     establishing a high-level radioactive waste repository. A \n     federal appeals court in Washington recently heard arguments \n     in the case.\n       Meanwhile, there is legislation in Congress to establish an \n     interim storage site near Yucca Mountain until a permanent \n     facility is completed. In our view, this offers the most \n     sensible answer to the nuclear-storage dilemma.\n       The country is courting catastrophe by permitting this \n     highly dangerous waste to be stored in dozens of areas of the \n     country, usually along waterways, and unnecessarily creating \n     more radioactive-conaminated facilities, as well as expense \n     for ratepayers.\n       Congress needs to end its dithering on this serious issue \n     and move to bring this waste under federal control in a \n     single facility until a permanent one can be built.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Statesman Journal, Feb. 11, 1996]\n\n                    Congress Stalls on Nuclear Waste\n\n       Congress seems to be stalled on a bill to find a home for \n     tons of waste from the nation's nuclear power plants.\n       Measures to establish a temporary nuclear repository at \n     Yucca Mountain in Nevada have had strong support in both \n     chambers, but nothing has happened. House Resolution 1020 \n     needs to be enacted promptly.\n       It will rectify two financial problems. It will give \n     residential and business customers of power generated by \n     nuclear power plants something for their money. Oregonians \n     and others have paid nearly $12 billion into a fund to build \n     a repository for nuclear waste. The money has done nothing \n     but help the government make the budget deficit look a little \n     smaller.\n       And it will save utilities from having to build temporary \n     storage facilities at their nuclear power plants to hold \n     spent fuel rods that by now should have found a permanent \n     national repository. At the now-closed Trojan plant, the rods \n     are kept in pools of water. But dry storage will have to be \n     built--at ratepayers' expense--if the Yucca Mountain site is \n     not approved. Other nuclear power plants are running out of \n     storage space. They either will shut down or, more likely, \n     build expensive temporary storage.\n       The measure also will move the nation toward a permanent \n     repository in Yucca Mountain. The temporary site will hold \n     nuclear wastes until the final scientific studies of Yucca \n     are completed.\n       Although the measures have strong support, controversy \n     remains. Some in Nevada and elsewhere are not convinced the \n     Yucca Mountain site is safe for centuries-long storage of \n     radioactive wastes. Reputable scientific studies discount the \n     risk.\n       Other people worry about transporting nuclear fuel rods to \n     Nevada from throughout the country. This, too, is a needless \n     worry. The casks that would hold the wastes were engineered--\n     and tested--to withstand a head-on train crash and the \n     hottest fires.\n       This country must take the decisive step and finally \n     provide--after 13 years of political indecision--a safe place \n     for its nuclear wastes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 12, 1996]\n\n                  The One Best Place for Nuclear Waste\n\n                           (By Luther Carter)\n\n       Despite continuing controversy and hand-wringing analysis, \n     the nuclear waste problem has for early two decades grown as \n     a political issue while seeming every more confused and \n     opaque. Curt Suplee's recent article in The Post [Dec. 31] \n     ably described the quagmire in which the waste issue is \n     stuck.\n\n[[Page S4702]]\n\n       But political consensus won't come on this issue until we \n     begin looking at the waste problem as actually one of the \n     more manageable aspects of a far larger question. With the \n     Cold War and nuclear arms race of a bipolar world now behind \n     us, we can address what to do about the entire atomic legacy \n     we began creating more than a half-century ago.\n       This awesome issue raises two questions: What to do about \n     nuclear weapons, and what to do about nuclear power?\n       It's time now for a national and global debate about the \n     weapons and the elaborate industrial complexes established to \n     produce them. The nuclear forces and production \n     establishments of the nuclear weapons states were created \n     through great human ingenuity and national sacrifice. So \n     whether over the next generation we might summon the will and \n     ingenuity to abolish all (or nearly all-- these weapons and \n     complexes is not a possibility to be ignored and decided by \n     inaction or default.\n       It's time, too, for a debate about whether we wish to rid \n     ourselves of civil nuclear power or, if we think it might be \n     needed, to give this politically besieged enterprise a fair \n     chance to rise or fall on its merits.\n       But however these larger questions ultimately might be \n     decided, there will be no escaping the need for a solution to \n     the nuclear waste problem, and this almost inescapably means \n     establishing a national storage center at the Nevada Test \n     Site (NTS).\n       Coming to this conclusion does not require sophisticated \n     research and analysis. The country needs such a storage \n     center for four surprisingly diverse reasons:\n       Relief for the electric utilities. The center would relieve \n     the utilities' growing fear that the federal government will \n     be unable to honor its obligation, effective three years \n     hence, to begin accepting the spent fuel now accumulating at \n     more than 100 power reactors in 34 states. This grievance is \n     particularly rancorous in light of the billions in federal \n     nuclear waste funds already collected by utility companies \n     from their rate-payers.\n       Reactor decommissioning. The center would support the safe \n     decommissioning of nuclear reactors that utilities shut down \n     either for financial or safety reasons or in response to \n     public mandate. Without such a national center, spent fuel \n     must remain indefinitely in storage pools and dry vaults at \n     reactor sites.\n       Cleaning up the nuclear weapons production complex. The \n     center would offer a timely and needed place to send high-\n     level waste and spent naval reactor fuel from Savannah River \n     and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, and ultimately \n     the high-level waste from the Hanford reservation in \n     Washington state.\n       Strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime. The \n     center, if placed under International Atomic Energy Agency \n     inspection, could become a model of close accountability for \n     large amounts of weapons-usable plutonium.\n       Most of this plutonium would come to the NTS in commercial \n     spent fuel from routine reactor operations. But some of it \n     would be plutonium recovered from weapons production sites \n     and dismantled warheads, and (for security reasons) made \n     highly radioactive either by mixing with high-level waste or \n     burning in specially designated reactors. Secure \n     but retrievable storage of plutonium could continue \n     indefinitely at the center, given the chance that this \n     fissionable material might eventually be recovered for its \n     energy value.\n       There simply is no place other than the Nevada Test site to \n     store all these various radioactive and proliferation-\n     sensitive nuclear materials. The NTS is uniquely fitted for \n     this role by its remoteness, its tradition of tight security \n     from four decades of nuclear weapons testing, and its very \n     real (though much disputed) potential for safe storage and \n     disposal--a potential based on the exceptionally dry climate, \n     great depth to the water table and location inside a closed \n     desert basin that drains to Death Valley. The ongoing \n     investigation of Yucca Mountain for a geologic repository \n     shows promise but is now hampered by severe budget cuts.\n       The state of Nevada is, for its part, opposed to any \n     national waste repository or storage center coming to the \n     NTS. But that state alone could not prevent broad acceptance \n     of a national waste policy that rests on long-term interim \n     and possibly permanent storage at the test site.\n       Nevada's main hope at the moment may lie with the Clinton \n     White House, where the president's senior advisers have \n     favored a veto of any legislation calling for interim storage \n     of spent fuel at a specific site. They would have the site \n     determined by ``scientific analyses.'' But the reality is \n     that while technically, just about any site is acceptable for \n     interim surface storage, politically the affected state, \n     whatever it is, will be opposed.\n       Antinuclear activists and many environmental groups back \n     Nevada's contention that spent fuel can safely remain on site \n     at the reactors for up to a century. But this view obscures \n     larger environmental concerns and the need now, without more \n     years of delay, to start facing up to the dangerous legacy \n     from a half-century of use and misuse of the atom.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Herald-Palladium, Nov. 28, 1995]\n\n                 Getting Closer to Nuke Waste Solution\n\n       The lethal nuclear waste sitting in Southwest Michigan and \n     dozens of other sites across the United States may be headed \n     to a new--and safer--home.\n       A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, \n     would open up a temporary storage site in the Nevada desert \n     and would push the opening of a permanent site deep beneath \n     the desert surface.\n       We're glad to see that his bill, approved earlier this year \n     by committee, is headed for a House vote. We urge its \n     passage. A similar bill is expected to come up for a Senate \n     vote next year.\n       The question of what to do with high-level nuclear waste \n     has been looming ever since the first nuclear power plant \n     opened in this country three decades ago. From the beginning, \n     the federal government committed itself to the eventual \n     disposal of the waste. It recognized the danger in having \n     high-level nuclear waste disposal sites scattered in various \n     places across the country near populated areas.\n       In 1982, Congress tried to light a fire under the feet of \n     the Department of Energy by passing a bill requiring the \n     government to have a waste site ready by 1998. There's no \n     chance now of meeting that deadline. The earliest a waste \n     site will be ready is 2010, and even that won't happen at \n     the current pace of development.\n       That's why Upton's bill is so important. It not only pushes \n     DOE into selecting a waste site--probably at Yucca Mountain, \n     Nevada--but also allows the government to store the waste \n     temporarily above ground in an unpopulated desert location.\n       The chief opponents of Upton's bill--besides Nevada \n     residents who don't want the waste site in their back yard, \n     even though the remote desert isn't really anybody's yard--\n     are people who are opposed to nuclear power in general. They \n     know that settling the waste issue will open the door for the \n     construction of more nuclear power plants and allow those \n     that are running out of storage room to keep operating.\n       But closing down the nation's nuclear power plants not only \n     would have a devastating effect on the energy production--and \n     therefore, the economy--but would do nothing to solve the \n     problem of nuclear waste disposal.\n       Upton's bill moves the process forward, and we hope \n     Congress approves it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, May 1, 1996]\n\n              Politics, Not Science, Delays Yucca Mountain\n\n                           (By Linda Seebach)\n\n       The question of what to do with America's spent nuclear \n     fuel and other detritus from the atomic era is more political \n     than scientific. Progress toward the permanent storage \n     facility proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nev., is slowed by \n     endless debate about all the things that could possibly go \n     wrong centuries from now.\n       I was inside Yucca Mountain last week. The Valley Study \n     Group, an organization of people in and around Livermore, \n     Calif., who are interested in the activities of Lawrence \n     Livermore and Sandia national laboratories, organized a tour \n     to the site, which is on the western edge of the Nevada Test \n     Site about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas.\n       As part of the years-long process to determine whether the \n     site is suitable for keeping nuclear waste isolated from the \n     environment for millennia, the project is boring a 5-mile \n     tunnel in a loop inside the mountain. They're about 3 miles \n     along now, and our group put on hard hats and safety belts \n     and hiked along in for a few hundred meters to see how the \n     tunnel is constructed and where the scientific studies are \n     done. Project scientists sample the rock, air and water \n     because the crucial fact that determines how long the storage \n     is safe is whether water percolating through the rock will \n     eventually corrode the canisters containing the wastes, and \n     then (even more eventually) carry radionuclides through the \n     rock to ground water.\n       Yucca Mountain was chosen as a potential site because there \n     isn't much water anywhere near it, and in particular because \n     the groundwater level is hundreds of meters below where the \n     waste canisters would be placed.\n       Seeing the site and the tunnel doesn't imply anything about \n     the quality of the science, but I already knew about that, \n     having been reading about this project for years. Being there \n     did impress me simultaneously with the huge sale of the \n     project in human terms, and its insignificance in the vast \n     and desolate landscape around Yucca Mountain.\n       Even the desert tortoise, a threatened species that is \n     treated with respectful deference by tortoise-trained \n     personnel, is at much greater risk from ravens who think \n     soft-shell tortoise is a treat than from anything humans are \n     doing around the project site.\n       The safety expectations for Yucca Mountain, or any other \n     potential site if that one turns out to be unsatisfactory, \n     are unreasonable, not so much because they can't be met but \n     because they are more stringent than those applied to the \n     alternatives. At present, spent fuel is stored in cooling \n     ponds near the plants that used it. There's no evidence it's \n     unsafe there now, but for the next 10,000 years? That's \n     longer than humanity's written history.\n       Non-nuclear alternatives aren't clearly better. Extracting \n     and burning coal and oil is not environmentally benign, \n     though the effects can be mitigated, but we can't plan on \n     doing it for millennia. There's not that much to burn.\n       Freezing in the dark is not healthy for children and other \n     living things, either.\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\n       It's true that radioactive material takes a long time to \n     decay, but the consequences of deforesting a continent are \n     pretty permanent, too. It makes sense to store spent nuclear \n     fuel in the safest place available, rather than leaving it \n     where it is, but trying to plan for thousands of years in the \n     future is wasted energy.\n       A civilization that maintains our current modest level of \n     technology should have no more difficulty coping with the \n     consequences of using nuclear energy than it does with any \n     other kind. And without that much technology, the human \n     species will have far more serious things to worry about than \n     what its forebears buried deep under a mountain in Nevada.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, the weekend before last, I had the \nprivilege of responding to the President's Saturday radio address.\n  Some of my colleagues may not have heard my remarks. For their \nbenefit, I would like to paraphrase and expand upon what I said.\n  A few of my colleagues or their family members have had a brush with \nviolent crime here in our Nation's Capital. Some assaults occurred in \nthe streets nearby the Capitol Grounds, which are patroled by our own \nCapitol Hill Police Force. This reinforces to us that, if it can happen \nhere, it can happen anywhere.\n  Imagine, Mr. President, that you are driving home from work after a \nbusy day in the Senate. All of a sudden, young kids pass you by in \ntheir cars. A gunfight breaks out just as they pass. A stray bullet \ncomes crashing through your car window. Suddenly, you are slumped over \nyour steering wheel, dead. You were caught in the crossfire of a \nsenseless gun battle.\n  Although an unpleasant thought, it is not hard for us in this body to \nrelate to the possibility of such a tragedy happening here in \nWashington--the murder capital of the country. But a similar tragedy \nhappened just over 3 weeks ago in Des Moines, IA, the capital city of \nmiddle America.\n  The victim's name was Phyllis Davis. She was 42.\n  Phyllis was driving in Des Moines in broad daylight, on her way home \nfrom work. She was suddenly the victim of a gunfight between two gangs \nof kids. A stray bullet lodged in her body and killed her. These punks \nhad no regard for her innocent life, let alone their own.\n  This tragedy stunned Des Moines. It drove home two points:\n  First, you cannot hide from crime, nowadays. No one and no place is \nsafe. It could be you next, or someone you love. And second, dangerous \ncriminals are getting younger and younger. Respect for life and \nproperty is diminishing earlier in the lives of our citizens.\n  The obvious question is, Why? Why is it that there is no place to \nhide from crime? Why is it that perpetrators of violent crimes are \ngetting younger and younger?\n  Much of the reason, I have observed, is this:\n  We have created a culture in our society that coddles the criminal. \nWe talk the tough talk, we throw money and resources at the problem, we \nthrow 30,000 cops on the street. After we've done all that, what do we \nget? Violent criminals are getting younger and younger, and the \nviolence can happen to you or your loved ones anywhere, anytime.\n  A culture that coddles the criminal, Mr. President. That is what we \nhave got. In plain terms, we have got a bad criminal justice system. It \nis upside down. It seems that criminals have more rights than victims. \nWe handcuff justice instead of crime. How can this happen in America.\n  One reason younger people are committing more crimes may be that \nword's getting out that the system will be easy on them.\n  Juveniles now account for nearly 20 percent of all violent crime \narrests. If the trend continues, that figure will double in 15 years. \nThis is outrageous.\n  When tragedies occur like what happen to Phyllis Davis, communities \npull together to respond. But they get hamstrung. The system undercuts \nthem: Too many bad laws; too many soft-on-crime judges; not enough \nmoral leadership.\n  That is the problem, Mr. President. That is what causes the culture \nof coddling criminals. First, liberal judges let dangerous offenders \nback on the streets; second, the Clinton Justice Department has \nfrustrated efforts to enforce the death penalty. And more often than \nany previous administration, the Department intervenes in cases on the \nside of convicted criminals.\n  Third, our leaders in the White House have abandoned the bully pulpit \nin the war or drugs. In the absence of moral leadership, drug use among \nAmerica's youth is up dramatically. In fact, there has been a 52-\npercent increase in drug use by teenagers since President Clinton took \noffice.\n  Republicans have waged a long battle against a legal system that \ncoddles criminals. Instead, this Republican Congress has done much to \nstrengthen the criminal justice system on behalf of victims instead. We \npassed major reforms, clamping down on frivolous prisoner lawsuits. \nThis was in the budget bill signed 2 weeks ago. One result is that \nprisons will again be more like prisons, and less like Marriott Hotels.\n  And the antiterrorism bill signed 2 week ago will make it easier to \ndeport criminal aliens. It also provides effective death penalty \nmeasures, for a change. This is a provision President Clinton initially \nopposed and worked against. But he was finally forced to accept it. His \nlieutenants went kicking and screaming.\n  Mr. President, this was the gist of my comments in response to the \nPresident's Saturday address. Following my remarks, the White House \nresponded in turn. I will now address the White House response to me.\n  The Associated Press quoted a White House deputy press secretary, \nGinny Terzano, as saying the following:\n\n       The President has fought long and hard to get a tough crime \n     bill and to place 100,000 more police officers on the \n     streets.\n\n  Mr. President, the problem is a culture of coddling criminals. How \ndoes this statement by the White House reassure the American people? \nHow does it reassure them that they won't be next to get caught in the \ncrossfire of a senseless gun battle, or some equally senseless, violent \nact?\n  For one thing, the Clinton administration worked to soften the crime \nbill, not make it tough. Remember? It was larded up with social \nprograms to coddle the criminal. Remember midnight basketball? Second, \nmore cops on the street is only part of the solution. What good do more \ncops do if the system keeps handcuffing the cops instead of the bad \nguys? You just have more cops with handcuffs on them, That is all.\n  Meanwhile, yesterday's Washington Post had a story showing that the \nnumber of Federal criminal cases in this administration have not gone \nup. This, despite billings of dollars of increases in funding for the \nFBI, DEA, and U.S. attorneys.\n  The article also suggests that the caseload has lacked effective \nmanagement within the law enforcement community. You can put all the \ncops you want in the streets. But if criminals are not being prosecuted \nand kept in jail, how effective is your crimefighting?\n  What the President should be doing is addressing the real, underlying \ncause of crime. He needs to attack the culture that coddles criminals. \nFor starters, he could get a solicitor general who intervenes in cases \non the side of victims, rather than using technicalities to help out \nconvicted criminals. President Clinton's solicitor did this in United \nStates versus Davis and again in Cheely versus United States, to cite \njust two examples.\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n  Second, he should pick judges that do not let criminals back on the \nstreets who should not be there;\n  Third, he should crack the whip with his Justice Department and find \nout why large budget increases for the FBI, DEA, and U.S. attorneys \nhave not produced more criminal prosecutions.\n  Fourth, and most important, he should use the bully pulpit of the \nWhite House to show moral authority in the war on drugs.\n  Mr. President, this last point is the most crucial of all. So much of \ncrime--especially violent crime--is a function of drug use and \ntrafficking. Yet, the President has been silent on the drug issue until \nrecently. He has said more about drugs the last 2 months than he did \nthe last 3 years. It is a coincidence, I am sure, that this is an \nelection year.\n  But when you look behind the rhetoric, and look instead at the \nrecord, the President has a lot of explaining to do. Why has the number \nof high school seniors using drugs frequently increased by 52 percent \nsince this President took office? Why did he cut the drug office staff \nby 83 percent, and decimate its budget?\n  I would argue it is because he abandoned the bully pulpit. He \ndeclared a time-out in the war on drugs while the bad guys kept on \nplaying. In short, he created a void in moral leadership on this issue.\n  And now, all the progress we made during the 1980's in fighting drug \nuse are being reversed. It is just mind-boggling.\n  When it comes to fighting crime, the President seems to be playing in \nthe wrong arena. He is not playing in the same arena that he talks \nabout. People are out there driving in their cars, wondering if they \ncould be next. And the moral leadership on this issue that the People \nare looking for from their leader in Washington is absent.\n  In my view, Congress will have to continue playing the lead role in \nturning our criminal justice system right-side up. We need to protect \nthe victims of crime once again, instead of coddling criminals.\n  We could build a strong partnership in this effort, if only the \nPresident would joint us. Until then, this Congress will continue to \nbattle the system that handcuffs justice rather than crime.\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I rise to address the majority leader's \nannounced intention to introduce legislation that would repeal the 4.3-\ncents-a-gallon tax on gasoline that this body passed as part of the \n1993 budget bill. I have a very high personal and professional regard \nfor our majority leader and I am certainly not unmindful of the \npolitical season that is upon us. Repealing a tax--any tax--and \nparticularly a tax consumers are reminded of every time they fill up \ntheir cars at the pump, is unarguably attractive as a matter of raw \npolitics, but it is terrible as a matter of public policy. Just when we \nare beginning to make sustained progress on bringing down the deficit, \njust when we are within reach of actually balancing the budget in 7 \nyears and making a serious and principled commitment to real fiscal \nresponsibility, we blink. We cannot take the political heat. On \nsomething this important to our Nation and our children's future, if we \ntake the heat we ought to take President Truman's advice and get out of \nthe kitchen.\n  We talk about a market economy, but we won't let the market work. The \nFederal Government has an important role to play in our lives, but it \ncannot and should not attempt to solve every problem we confront--\nparticularly when to save the average motorist $27 per year we move in \nprecisely the wrong direction on the more important challenges of \nenergy independence, national security, and fiscal responsibility--and \nsend the wrong signals to our allies and others around the world about \nwhether we are serious.\n  I hope a majority of our colleagues will have the political courage \nto resist what will undoubtedly be an extremely popular bill. If we do \nnot, that the President will be willing to demonstrate the intestinal \nfortitude we lack--as he did in proposing the tax in the first place.\n  In my view, a $30 billion tax repeal shouldn't even be considered in \nthe absence of meaningful action on our long-term budget problems. The \n1993 deficit reduction package, which contained this modest gas tax, \nand had no support on the other side of the aisle, has made a \nsubstantial dent in our annual deficits, making balance in 7 years \npossible. In the absence of that deficit reduction effort, we probably \nwould not be discussing seriously the idea of actually reaching balance \nin such a relatively short period.\n  Even with that 1993 effort, however, trying to reach balance has been \na monumental task. A number of us in the bipartisan group of Senators \nreferred to as the Centrist Coalition have been working for months to \nfind a balanced budget compromise, and a repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-\ngallon tax will only complicate our efforts to balance the Federal \nbudget by sometime early in the next century.\n  Not only would the repeal move us in the wrong direction as far as \nbalancing the budget is concerned, it would not solve the problem of \nhigher gasoline prices. If the energy companies are culpable, I have no \ndesire to take them off the hook, but prices have been rising because \nthe demand for fuel has been rising while production has fallen short \nof this need. Quite simply, the evidence suggests that demand is rising \nas Americans are driving further, at higher speeds, in less fuel \nefficient vehicles. Supplies have been curtailed because of a longer \nwinter that kept refiners producing heating oil longer than expected \nand delayed their shift to gasoline, and fuel inventories were also \nallowed to remain low because of an anticipated release of oil from \nIraq that has not come to pass.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that the recent price \nincreases are not due to a 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax increase that was put \ninto law 3 years ago. That 4.3-cents-a-gallon is no more responsible \nfor the recent increase in gas prices than it was responsible for the \nlow gasoline prices we have enjoyed for the previous 2 years when the \nmeasure was also in effect.\n  If we take the oil companies at their word that recent gas prices are \nthe result of demand outstripping supply, then the last thing that we \nshould be considering is a repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax, \nfurther pushing up demand. For those of us who believe that a higher \ngasoline tax is a necessary element of sound public policy because it \nencourages conservation and reduces our dependence on foreign oil, a \nrepeal of this tax would be totally inappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I was one of several colleagues recently recognized by \nthe Concord Coalition as being willing to make the tough choices, and I \nintend to continue making them, despite the political downside. I fully \nunderstand that rejecting politically popular tax cuts in an election \nyear represents a tough choice for legislators, even if this tax repeal \nwould involve less than $30 a year for the average motorist. But if \nthere is a good public policy reason for the tax in the first place and \na repeal will not be likely to dramatically affect the perceived \nproblem, it should not be that tough a choice. For these reasons, I \nwould encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing the proposed \nrepeal of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there was an item in the morning paper \nthat caused me to come to the Senate floor to speak briefly and alert \nmy colleagues to a serious concern which I have. The article was \nentitled ``Armey: Cheap Fuel Via Education Cuts.'' ``House Leader \nSuggests Way To Offset Cost of Gasoline Tax Repeal.''\n  The first three short paragraphs say:\n\n       House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, Republican from \n     Texas, yesterday suggested that the revenue lost from a \n     repeal of the 1993 gasoline tax could be offset by cutting \n     spending on education. ``Maybe we ought to take another look \n     at the amount of money we are spending on education,'' Armey \n     said on the NBC's ``Meet the Press:'' ``There is a place \n     where we are getting a declining value for an increased \n     dollar. It's in education. If in fact we can get some \n     discipline in the use of our education dollar, I think we can \n     make up the difference,'' Armey said.\n\n  Mr. President, my reaction to this article when I read it was, ``Here \nthey go again.''\n  We spent much of last year in this Congress trying to hold off \nproposed cuts in the education budget. The budget resolution as first \npresented here called for $18.6 billion being cut from student aid over \na 7-year period, and $26 billion being cut from K through 12 levels of \neducation over that 7-year period.\n  There was a proposal to zero out funding for direct student loans, \nand proposals to zero out funding for School to Work, for Goals 2000, \nand for national service.\n  Mr. President, those fights are now behind us. But unfortunately, \neven today, we see that to some extent the efforts to cut back on \neducation have succeeded. In the final appropriations bill that was \nsigned into law 10 days ago by the President, there are still cuts in \neducation.\n  There is a 6-percent cut in the Goals 2000 funding. There is a 9-\npercent cut in telecommunications for math funding. There is an 8-\npercent cut in library construction funding. There is a 15-percent cut \nin the funds for magnet schools, a 27-percent cut in technical \nassistance center funding, a 7-percent cut in adult education budgets. \nIn Perkins loans there is a 41-percent cut, and in State student \nincentive grants there is a 50-percent cut.\n  Mr. President, my own view is that this is a very, very mistaken set \nof priorities that this Congress and that the majority leader in the \nHouse, Richard Armey, are talking about when the first place they look \nto try to make up revenue is to further cut education.\n  I think in the long term our country is only as strong as the next \ngeneration, and we are only as smart as the next generation. If we cut \nout the funds needed to educate that next generation, I am persuaded \nthat we are going against the will of the American people, we are going \nagainst our own best interests, and we are showing very serious \nshortsightedness, which I think we will come to regret.\n\n  Mr. President, I contrast this article, which, as I say, was in this \nmorning's paper here in Washington, with an article that came out a \nlittle over a week ago, on April 27, also in the Washington Post. It \nwas entitled, ``Latinos Want D.C. School To Stay Open.''\n  Let me just read a little bit of that article for my colleagues. It \nsaid:\n\n       About 400 people picketed the District of Columbia Board of \n     Education offices yesterday, protesting a recommendation by \n     School Superintendent Franklin L. Smith to close the Carlos \n     Rosario Adult Education Center.\n       The demonstrators circled the block in front of the \n     Presidential building . . . chanting ``We want to learn \n     English!'' Some held bullhorns, others carried signs asking \n     drivers to honk in support of the program.\n       ``We see it as an issue of discrimination against Latin \n     immigrants,'' said Arnoldo Ramos, Director of the Council of \n     Latino Agencies. ``This is the only adult education center \n     serving Latinos. By closing this program, they are sending a \n     message that Latinos don't matter and that we should continue \n     serving tables, continue picking up garbage and having the \n     lowest positions in society.''\n       Several students said that without Rosario, it would be \n     difficult to continue to learn English, which they say is \n     their only ticket to a better life.\n\n  Mr. President, this article should bring home to us the importance \nthat education has for the average people of this country. Education is \nnot only their only ticket to a better life; it is the ticket that our \nchildren have to a better life as well.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the recommendation of \nthe House majority leader in looking first at education as a place to \nfurther cut the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4705-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4705-S4716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I was glad I had an opportunity to be \nhere for at least the last portion of the presentation by my good \ncolleague and friend from Virginia where he was admonishing us to be \ncourageous and to avoid the proposal to repeal the gas tax.\n  It is my intention to support the repeal of the gas tax, and, \nfrankly, I believe America is looking for a very different kind of \ncourage today.\n  I do not think they are looking for courage to keep adding another \nburden, another tax burden, another regulatory burden on the backs of \nthe working families.\n  Most Americans--in fact, in survey data every social strata of our \ncountry--feel that the appropriate tax burden should be 25 percent. It \ndoes not matter whether you ask the very wealthy family or the poorest \nfamily. It is fascinating; they all come to the same number, that the \nburden of government, their willingness to contribute, is about 25 \npercent.\n  Tomorrow is May 7. It is an important day in America, because May 7, \nbelieve it or not--I would never have believed I would be in the Senate \ntalking about this kind of crisis, but May 7 is the first day for which \nan American family can earn money and resources for its own dreams. \nEvery other day from January 1 through March 15, April, you name it, \nall of those wages that were earned on all of those working days are \ntaken from the family. They are taken by the Federal Government at \nabout 25 percent, some much higher, they are taken by the State and \nlocal government 10 to 12 percent, and I might add May 7 does not \ninclude the regulatory costs to every American family, which is now \nabout $6,800 a year.\n  I think of that fellow who gets up, his wife who gets up, and they \nget the kids; they take them to school; they get to their two jobs, \nwhich are necessary now primarily because of the new tax burden on the \nAmerican family; they go day after day like that working through the \nstruggles of life, and until May 7 not a dime is available to house \nthat family, to buy the home, to transport the family, to feed the \nfamily, to educate the family --all the things we ask the American \nfamily to do for America: Raise the country. Raise the country. But \nuntil May 7, they do not have a dime for their own dreams. They are \nsending all of those wages between January 1 and May 7 to some policy \nwonk somewhere with the task of rededicating where that money ought to \ngo and what its priorities ought to be.\n  We just heard a presentation by my colleague on the other side of the \naisle that it would be the opposite of courageous if we were to repeal \nthis tax. We have a long way to go to get tax freedom day back from May \n7 to where it appropriately ought to be. Every opportunity we have to \nlower that burden, in my judgment, is appropriate. That gas tax costs \nthe average family of four about $100--$100 a year.\n  More importantly, the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers pay over 7 \npercent of their income on gasoline. If we are concerned about those \nwho are disadvantaged, we ought to be concerned about lowering the \nburden on them, letting them keep those resources to do the things they \nneed to do. The wealthy only pay 1.6 percent of their income on \ngasoline. This repeal of that gas tax\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\nprimarily helps the more disadvantaged in our society. It has some \nauxiliary effect on those who have more resources. But we have such a \nlong way to go, Mr. President, to get this economic burden down. It is \nalready double what it ought to be when you add in the reg reforms.\n\n  A family should not be working until May 7 or June or July --\nofficially it is May 7--for the Government. So I take exception to the \nsuggestion that you lack some courage if you come to the floor and \nfight for lowering the economic pressure on American families, American \ncommunities, and American businesses. That is exactly what America is \nasking us to do, to have the courage to shrink up this Federal \nGovernment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I should like to yield up to 10 minutes to \nmy colleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as my distinguished friend from Georgia \nhas said, tomorrow, May 7, 1996, is tax freedom day.\n  What is tax freedom day? Stated simply, it is the day on which the \naverage American taxpayer stops working for the Government and begins \nworking for himself or herself. It is a dramatic way of pointing out \nthat if we divide the share of the income of each one of us as an \naverage American into parts, the share that goes to Government will \ntake us from January 1 to May 7 to earn and to pay to those governments \nand that only after May 7 are we working for ourselves.\n  Again, this is an average. For some, tax freedom day comes a little \nearlier; for others it comes a little later. I regret to say for the \ncitizens of Washington State whom I represent, it comes a little later. \nIt comes on May 10. Why? Because, of course, we are talking about the \nburden imposed on the people of this country by all levels of our \nGovernment, here in Washington, DC, and our State and local governments \nas well.\n\n  Mr. President, does it not boggle the mind to think that governments \ntake this much of what we earn by our hard work for its own purposes?\n  It is vitally important that people learn we are already well through \nthe spring of 1996 before we have earned that portion of our income \nwhich goes to our governments.\n  As my distinguished friend from Georgia also said, if we add the very \nreal burdens caused by higher interest rates, which are themselves the \nresult in part of our huge national debt and all the interest we must \npay on that national debt, and the cost of regulation, we go into early \nJuly before we have discharged the real burden imposed on us by \nGovernment and begin to work for ourselves.\n  This is a burden that is too great, even if we ignore interest and \nregulation. The average citizen of the United States does not believe \nhe or she is getting his or her money's worth out of the money earned \nuntil May 7 and turned over to Government.\n  That citizen is correct. Our citizens are not getting their money's \nworth from this investment in Government, and the great struggle here \nin the Congress of the United States and with this administration is \nover whether or not those burdens, both from the perspective of taxes \nand regulation, should be increased or decreased. This administration, \nfor all of its rhetoric about smaller Government, is a liberal \nadministration which believes that its judgments as to how we should \nspend our money are better than our own; that Government bureaucrats \ncan set priorities for spending better than can individual citizens of \nthe United States. And I am convinced that that thought is perhaps the \nsingle most important reason that people resent Government and do not \ntrust those whom they elect to govern them. People do not believe that \nWashington, DC, bureaucrats are smarter than they are and know more \nthan they do about how their money ought to be spent. And the people \nare right. The people are right. They do not.\n\n  There are, of course, many appropriate functions of Government. There \nare a few functions, especially the closer Government gets to the \npeople, the more it is localized, that in fact are run effectively. But \nthe people do not believe that Washington, DC, is run efficiently and \neffectively, and the people are right.\n  So, as we did last year, in spite of the frustrations of vetoes from \nthe President of the United States--we on this side of the aisle and \nthinking Members on the other side of the aisle this year will attempt \nto lower that burden of taxation on the American people. Whether \nthrough a lowered gas tax or a family income tax credit or better \ntreatment of investments which create new jobs, we will attempt to \nlower that burden. We will act on the philosophy that, by and large, \npeople as individuals know better how their money should be spent than \ndo the bureaucrats here in Washington, DC.\n  If we are able to come back to this floor next year, even to say that \ntax freedom day is on the 3d of May rather than the 7th of May, or the \n4th of May rather than the 7th of May, we will have done what the \nAmerican people want. We will have acted correctly. We will, not at all \nincidentally, have overcome the objections of the President of the \nUnited States, and we will at least be on the road toward an \nappropriate balance between the impact of government on our pocketbooks \nand on our day-to-day lives, in exactly the fashion that we were meant \nto be when the people of the United States elected us to these offices.\n  May 7 is tax freedom day. May 7 is far too late a date in the year \nfor that notable event to take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nWashington for his remarks. I particularly agree with his context that \nit had been the theory of this administration--and we saw this all too \nclearly when they tried to federalize or create Government-run \nmedicine--that they believe that they know better how to manage the \nrelationship between an employer and employee; they know better how to \nset the priorities for the local mayor or county commissioner. Now it \nhas gotten to the point that they know better how to manage the \nfinancial resources of the American family. It is a very elitist point \nof view, in my judgment. This country was founded on the belief in the \nindividual and the entrepreneurial spirit that comes from a free \nindividual. That is what made this country.\n  Look at countries around the world that have had central or statist \ngovernments, like we have been working our way to here, and it is never \na pretty picture. I was Director of the U.S. Peace Corps for a \nconsiderable period of time, during the Bush administration, and was \none of the first Americans over the wall. It was not a pretty picture. \nIt was a classic example of what central and statist governments do for \npeople.\n  I remember one night in particular I was in Sophia, Bulgaria. The \nAmbassador asked if we wanted to go to a local opera, and I passed and \ndecided to walk through the city. They had been operating under this \ncentral government for, I guess, nearly half a century. It is such a \nvivid memory. First of all, when I went through the department store I \nsaw they had a shelf and it would have one glass on it, on the entire \nshelf. And then I would move to the next display and it would have one \nitem on the entire shelf. They had no goods.\n  I walked probably 5 miles, and this is the key, I never saw a single \nadult smile--not one. There was not a smile on the face of a single \nperson. They had a flea market, or a food market, and they had three \nvegetables; and they had a line that was 4 blocks long so you could \nline up and get the same piece of meat when you got to the window.\n  A planned government planned for everything. They planned for all \ntheir businesses, all their communities, and they had gotten to the \npoint where they literally ran everybody's family. It was not a pretty \npicture.\n  The American people are the most entrepreneurial, flexible, energetic \nof any in the world. But we have lost some of our edge, because we have \nbeen piling up one burden after another, to the point that we are now \nasking these families that work from January 1 to May 7--it is actually \nJuly 3, if you add in the regulatory costs they have to pay. Again, I \nthank the Senator from Washington. It is actually July 3, but we take \ndeep note of May 7 because that is the actual day that you start \nearning resources for your own family\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\nand not the government, which takes me back to the snapshot of a \nGeorgia family.\n\n  I was curious, in all this debate we have, with regard to the \neconomic pressures on an average family, just what was the situation in \nmy own State. I have alluded to this several times. It is certainly \nappropriate to talk about that family here today, when we are talking \nabout tax freedom day being May 7. That Georgia family earns about \n$45,000--$45,093. Both parents work and they have a couple of children. \nTheir total Federal tax on that income, direct and indirect, is $9,511. \nThe total State and local taxes are $5,234, or $14,745 right off the \ntop of the $45,000 they are paying out in taxes.\n  The estimated cost of Federal regulation on that family is $6,615; \nover $500 a month. That is more than a car payment or a student loan. \nYou are paying for your share of the growing regulatory apparatus.\n  This family in Georgia is paying excess family interest payments, \nwhich are caused by excessive Federal borrowing. We have just lifted \nthe Federal debt ceiling to $5.5 trillion, so that pushes interest \nrates up on everyone--the interest on their home, the interest on their \ncar, the student loan: $2,011.\n  So the net effect is, of the $45,000, $23,371 has been removed from \nthat family, taken by government or government action, leaving them \nabout 50 percent of the gross income to do all the things, as I said, \nwe ask them to do. It is no wonder that American families all across \nour land, therefore, are saying this government spending and government \ndebt and government management has gotten out of hand. Indeed, it has.\n  I am going to yield to my colleague from Oklahoma in 1 second. I \nwould just say what is particularly important about this is this \nadministration has added about $200 to $225 a month in additional \neconomic burden on this Georgia family, and families all across the \ncountry, which is why I find it very difficult to understand the \npresentation that says you are courageous if you reinforce this burden \non the American family, as my colleague from Virginia said a moment \nago.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Georgia for \nhis leadership on this and many other issues.\n  Today, we are announcing to the American people that tomorrow, May 7, \nis tax freedom day. That means that the average American worker had to \nwork from January 1 through May 7 for government--for the Federal \nGovernment, State government, and local government. May 7 is the latest \ntax freedom day ever.\n  For the average American worker, 34.8 percent of their income goes to \ngovernment. I do not make this point to say that all government is \nevil. Not all government is evil, but if workers are working for \ngovernment, they are not working for themselves. As government power \ngrows and increases, that means their freedom is diminished. If you \nhave individuals working a third of the time for government, then they \nare not working for their families, and they are not able to take care \nof their families.\n  It is a very important and, in my opinion, kind of a sad fact that as \ngovernment power continues to increase, people's freedom continues to \ndecrease. We need to reverse that.\n  Unfortunately, this President has made it worse. This President has \nmade tax freedom day later and later in the year because he vetoed a \ntax reduction effort that Congress passed. But even more important than \nthat, he signed the largest tax increase in history. In 1993, President \nClinton signed a tax bill that increased taxes and user fees $265 \nbillion over 5 years, the largest tax increase in history.\n  Keep in mind, President Clinton as a candidate said he was going to \ncut taxes. I remember when he was campaigning in New Hampshire. He said \nsomething like, ``Yes, we're going to have a tax reduction for \nfamilies; we're going to have a per-child tax credit.'' He did not \ndeliver.\n  He never said anything on the campaign trail in 1992 about increasing \ngasoline taxes, but that is exactly what he did. As a matter of fact, \nduring his first year in office, not only did he pass the largest tax \nincrease in history, but passed a tax increase that hit all American \nfamilies. At the time they were playing class warfare and saying this \nwas just going to hit the rich--and it did, they hit the rich pretty \nhard, but they also raised taxes on all Americans.\n  But also there is a gasoline tax. A gasoline tax is not just for the \nwealthy; that is for anybody who drives a car. I have four kids, all of \nwhom are driving and paying that 4.3 cents a gallon. It is not \ninexpensive. It makes a difference.\n  My point being, President Clinton's tax increase hit all American \nfamilies. He increased taxes on couples who receive Social Security. \nTheir Social Security used to be taxed at 50 percent. He increased it \nto 85 percent, a big hit for individuals who had incomes above $34,000. \nA big tax increase.\n  I remember listening to my father-in-law, who was adversely affected \nby this. It cost him well over $1,000 a year. Thank you very much, \nPresident Clinton. He did not ask for that with his vote, and he was \nnot told during the campaign that he was going to have a big tax \nincrease, and certainly he was middle-income America.\n  My point being, President Clinton, instead of reducing the tax burden \non American families, has increased the tax burden. Now today total tax \nreceipts will hit a record 19.4 percent of the gross domestic product, \nthe highest level of taxation since 1982. Ronald Reagan brought it \ndown. His tax cuts did not go into effect really until 1983. So now we \nhave taxes going up because of President Clinton, because of his tax \nincrease.\n  A lot of us believe President Clinton was right in Houston when he \nsaid, ``You know, I think I raised taxes too much,'' or ``You might be \nsurprised to find I agree with you, I think I raised taxes too much.'' \nA lot of us agreed with him, and so we wanted to help correct that.\n  Last year, we did pass a balanced budget package that not only \nbalanced the budget but offered modest tax relief for American \nfamilies. We delivered on our promise. We said, ``We're going to give \ntax relief to children. We're going to give a $500 tax credit for \nfamilies with children under the age of 18.''\n\n  President Clinton said he was going to do the same thing in 1992, but \nhe did not deliver. In his proposal before Congress, he said, ``I have \na children's tax credit too,'' but what he does not tell people is the \nchildren only get the tax credit if they are up to age 12, not if they \nare 13, 14, 15, 16. I hate to tell the President this, but they cost a \nlot of money at those ages, too. As a matter of fact, it is at those \nages that you may start getting ready for college.\n  The Republican budget allowed individuals, if they have kids, to save \n$500 per child, and the families get to keep it. So the families get to \nmake decisions on education. If the families want to, they can take the \n$500 and put it into a savings account to save for that child's \neducation. President Clinton vetoed it.\n  President Clinton vetoed a tax bill that would have helped the \neconomy. We would have reduced the tax on capital gains, because we \nknow that not only will that raise more money for the Federal \nGovernment, but it will help stimulate the economy. The capital gains \ntax is really a tax on a capital transaction. If it is reduced--and the \nUnited States has one of the highest taxes on capital gains of any of \nthe industrialized countries--if we reduce it, we are going to have \nmore transactions, more capital moving throughout the economy, more \ncapital going where it can be used most efficiently, most effectively \nand it will help stimulate the economy.\n  President Kennedy did that in the early sixties, and it helped. It \nraised more money. President Kennedy was right when he said a rising \ntide will lift all boats, and the Republican majority wanted to do \nthat. But President Clinton vetoed it, and he was wrong in vetoing it.\n  Congress passed a reduction in the inheritance tax for farmers and \nfamily business owners, and others, so they could keep more of their \nhard-earned money, so they would not have to sell their estate to pay \nan inheritance tax, a very positive provision, supported overwhelmingly \nby this Congress.\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\n President Clinton vetoed it, and he was wrong in doing so.\n  Congress passed enhanced IRA's, individual retirement accounts, so we \ncould encourage people to save. We would use the Tax Code to help \npeople start saving for their retirement: ``Don't depend solely on \nSocial Security; don't depend solely on a company retirement account; \nsave for your retirement.'' We enhanced that.\n  We doubled, basically, the income at which people would be eligible \nto receive a tax deduction for their IRA contribution. This was really \na family benefit, and it was really a family benefit for middle-income \nworkers. The benefit right now applies to people with incomes of about \nsome $20,000. We doubled that amount. It would not help the very \nwealthy, but it certainly would have helped the hard-working wage \nearner who wanted to start saving more, and we do not save near enough \nin this country.\n  Congress passed medical savings accounts, because we recognized that \na lot of people do not get benefits from the Tax Code to encourage \nhealth care, and medical savings accounts would have allowed \nindividuals the opportunity to put in some before-tax dollars to help \npay for health care costs.\n  If you work for a big corporation, you do not need it because maybe \nthe big corporation pays for all your health care and the individual \ngets it tax free.\n  Congress helped the self-employed. We increased the self-employed \ndeduction from 30 to 50 percent. Recently, we just passed legislation \nto increase that to 80 percent.\n  But under our bill, we had medical savings accounts that also would \nhave helped the individual who does not work. They need some help too. \nThis would have helped them pay for their health care. It was good \npolicy. Unfortunately, the President vetoed it.\n  Congress passed a provision that would have phased out and eliminated \nthe so-called marriage penalty, where right now it is financially to a \ncouple's detriment, if you have two wage earners, to file a joint \nreturn, to file as a married couple. It makes no sense. It is wrong. It \nis inequitable. The Tax Code should not be encouraging divorce or \nseparate filings. Congress phased the penalty out. Unfortunately, the \nPresident vetoed it.\n  Congress passed spousal IRA's, recognizing that spouses work, whether \nit is at a job or at home--we know that they are working. So we had \nspousal IRA's so the spouse could also accumulate some money and \nsavings in their own name, a very positive provision that would have \nhelped a lot of people all across the country. Unfortunately, President \nClinton vetoed it. Well, he was wrong in vetoing that.\n  Mr. President, taxes are too high. Government does spend too much \nmoney. People should not have to work 34.8 percent of their time for \ngovernment. So we do need tax relief. We need to balance the budget.\n\n  Some people say, those are in contrary positions to each other. I do \nnot think so. Certainly not. If you take a position that we have to \nbalance the budget before we have any tax cuts you will never pass any \ntax cuts because people in this Congress will keep spending more money. \nThere is no limit to the appetite of some people in Congress and this \nadministration for spending money. You are a lot more popular spending \nmoney than you are taking it away.\n  So I do not agree with that philosophy--and I am probably as frugal \nor as fiscally conservative as anybody--but I think we should give tax \nrelief and balance the budget and do it simultaneously. Let us balance \nthe budget. Let us limit the revenue of the Government. Let us pass a \nconstitutional amendment that says you cannot spend any more than you \ntake in. That makes sense. That is what most Americans do.\n  The House passed a balanced budget constitutional amendment last \nyear. The Senate came one vote short. I hope that soon, maybe this \nweek, we will again be considering a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I hope some of my colleagues who voted against that \nbalanced budget amendment will reconsider. Some of our colleagues on \nthe Democrat side of the aisle said, ``Well, I'm not going to vote for \nthe balanced budget amendment until I see a real balanced budget \nplan.'' I think we ought to do it anyway. We did it anyway in Congress, \nbut unfortunately the President vetoed it. I hope now they realize it \ncan be done.\n  I have heard President Clinton now say that he supports a balanced \nbudget. I hope that my colleagues on the Democrat side, most all of \nwhom voted against a balanced budget amendment, will reconsider. I want \nto compliment Senator Simon, and others, who are working to try and \nmake that happen. It has to be a bipartisan vote to make it happen. We \nhave to have 67 votes. I hope my colleagues realize the gravity of the \nsituation. We cannot continue to pile up debt after debt.\n  We passed entitlement reform last year, but the President vetoed it. \nI think he was wrong in doing so. I am afraid it is going to take a \nconstitutional mandate to tell us we cannot spend any more than we take \nin and that we have sound fiscal policies in this country. I think at \nthe same time, we need to be cognizant of the fact that taxpayers are \ntaking it on the chin.\n  Taxpayers need relief. Taxpayers are kind of bothered by the fact \nthat they have to work over a third of the time, an average American \nfamily has to work over a third of the year for Government; not for \nthemselves, not for their family and not for their family's future, but \nfor Uncle Sam and for State government and for local government. We \nneed to reverse that.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put a couple of tables into the Record \nbecause I think a lot of times people are not aware of how fast \nGovernment spending and taxation is growing. One of them that I am \ngoing to allude to maybe surprises people, but it deals with payroll \ntaxes. Payroll taxes have been skyrocketing.\n  I heard some people say maybe it should be exempt from the \nconstitutional amendment or maybe we should not count Social Security \nor Medicare because those are trust funds. Mr. President, those \nprograms are funded by payroll taxes. If you work, and you get your W-\n2, you find Uncle Sam takes out individual income taxes, and he also \ntakes out payroll taxes for Social Security and for Medicare's hospital \nfund.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield another 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge my colleagues to just look at the growth in these \ntaxes. The payroll taxes alone have just exploded. If I put in the \nmaximum total contribution under payroll taxes, in 1960 that total for \nSocial Security--this includes hospital or Medicare taxes--the maximum \ntax that anybody put in 1960 was $144. Keep in mind, the system started \nquite a bit earlier, but the maximum tax was $144.\n\n  In 1970, the maximum tax was $374. This is just for the employee. The \nemployer has to match this. In 1980, it really increased substantially \nand went from $374 in 1970 to $1,588 in 1980. Wow, it went up about \nfour, five times. Between 1980 and 1990 it went from $1,588 to almost \n$4,000--$3,924. Keep in mind, your employer is matching that. So for an \nindividual--that is maximum; in that case somebody was making $135,000, \nI think--they were paying almost $4,000 and the employer was paying \nalmost $4,000. That is $8,000, a big increase.\n  It continues to explode. By the year 2000, for that person still \nmaking $135,000 it goes up to $6,496, almost $6,500, with a total cost \nof $13,000 put in for a person to pay these Social Security taxes. My \npoint being, this is just a payroll tax. But this tables shows, if you \nlook at it on a curve, that Social Security taxes have gone up \ntremendously. The same thing for Medicare taxes, they just exploded. \nYet, the Medicare fund is still going broke. Yet, Social Security still \nhas a real funding problem. In the year 2013 it is estimated to pay out \nmore than it takes in.\n  So my point is, Mr. President, some people want to ignore payroll \ntaxes. I disagree. Ask any wage earner--ask my son; ask my daughter--\nwho are paying these taxes. These taxes are high and they are getting \nhigher. That means people have to work longer before they can take \nenough home to take care of their needs and their family and their \nfuture.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have to be cognizant of the American \nworking\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\nfamily. I am very critical of President Clinton for vetoing our tax \nreduction effort and for pushing through the largest tax increase in \nhistory. He is responsible for the fact that a lot of people have to \nwork a lot longer for Government instead of themselves. We need to \nreverse that. I hope that Congress this year, soon, will pass tax \nreduction for American families. I thank my colleague from Georgia and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator ask unanimous consent to have \nmaterial printed in the Record?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a couple \nof charts printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, follows:\n\n

                                                           \n\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nhis remarks and his expertise on this subject. He made a very, very \neloquent statement on the burden of taxation.\n  At this time I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow is tax freedom day. It is an artificial \ncalculation, but it serves to focus our attention on how much of the \ntime we spend working as a Nation to pay our taxes, because on the 7th \nof May, finally, if we had paid everything we had earned to the Federal \nGovernment, we could begin taking something home.\n  As I say, that is an artificial calculation. We do it because it \nfocuses our attention on one question. This is the fundamental question \nwhen you address the whole issue of taxes. Whom do you trust to spend \nyour money? Do you trust the people in Washington? Do you trust the \nFederal Government to spend your money more wisely than you can or do \nyou decide in a free society that you want to hang on to more of it to \nspend for yourself?\n  Obviously, we have to trust the Federal Government to spend some of \nour\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nmoney. There are some things the Federal Government does that we cannot \ndo for ourselves.\n  The most obvious example that I can think of is the Interstate \nHighway System. We could not go out as individuals and contract to \nbuild the roads, to make the plans, to lay out the routes. All of those \nthings are appropriate activity of the Federal Government.\n  When the Interstate Highway System was first proposed back in Dwight \nEisenhower's time it was a Member of this body, Senator Harry Byrd of \nVirginia, who made the decision that we would not pay for the \ninterstate highway system with debt. He said, we will pay as we go, and \nthat was the beginning of Federal gasoline taxes going into the \nnational highway trust fund to pay for the Interstate Highway System. \nAnd it worked.\n  We trusted the Federal Government to spend our money more wisely on \nhighways than if we had spent it ourselves. We gave the Federal \nGovernment that money, and the Interstate Highway System was created. I \nfind it interesting, Mr. President, to know that now the tax increase \nthat was pushed through by President Clinton 2\\1/2\\ years ago is a tax \non gasoline that does not get spent on our roads or on the interstate \nhighways. President Clinton is spending that money for something else.\n  I am supporting the repeal of the increase in the gas tax because I \nthink in this area I trust myself more than I trust the Government to \nspend those extra few cents on gas. If I could be sure the Government \nwas going to spend it on roads, I would not be so anxious to be for \nrepeal of the gas tax. But we have broken away from that concept that \nwas established here in this Chamber by a Member of this body that said \nthe money that gets paid for gasoline taxes, gets spent on roads and \nhighways and bridges.\n  President Clinton has broken that link and said, ``No. Let's tax \ngasoline, but let's trust the Federal Government more than we trust the \nindividuals on the issue of how that should be spent.''\n  Now, we have heard in this debate the whole discussion of tax rates \ngoing up. The justification for tax rates going up is that we need more \ntax revenue in order to pay down the deficit. That sounds fine, Mr. \nPresident, but as Members of this body know--I come from a business \nbackground and was a businessman until I ran for the Senate, and I \ndiscovered very quickly what every businessman knows--raising prices \ndoes not mean increased sales. Raising tax rates does not mean \nincreased tax revenue.\n  We have all seen the example where Ford Motor has brought out a new \nversion of its best-selling automobile, the Ford Taurus. The Ford \ndesigners were so enthusiastic about how beautiful the Taurus was that \nthey raised the price on the Taurus. It stayed at that higher level for \nsomething like 3 weeks when they discovered that people were not \nwilling to pay the higher price. What did they do to get sales moving? \nThey lowered the price. Lo and behold, when they lowered the price, \nsales started going up. That is exactly the same principle that applies \nto the Federal Government. If you lower the tax, we can see revenues \nbegin to go up.\n  Let me be personal about this, Mr. President. During the 1980's, I \nwas CEO of a company that started out literally in a basement in a \nsuburban town in Utah. It had four employees. Today that company is \nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market value \napproaching three quarters of a billion dollars. It has 2,700 \nemployees. We built that business at a time when our effective tax rate \nwas 28 percent. That meant we were able to make our choices as to how \nthe money would be spent in buying inventory, building buildings, \nhiring new people, instead of having the Federal Government make the \nchoices as to how that money would be spent.\n  Today if we were to start that business again, the effective rate on \nthe money we would earn would not be 28 percent as it was in the \n1980's, it would be 42 percent--a 50-percent increase. I say, Mr. \nPresident, we would not have created those 2,700 jobs if we had been \nfacing a 42-percent effective tax rate.\n  Now, a study has been done on the impact of the tax increase that \nPresident Clinton gave us in 1993. President Clinton talks about all \nthe new jobs that have been created since he has been President. \nAccording to the study by the Heritage Foundation, that number would be \n1.2 million higher than it is if President Clinton had not given us \nthat tax increase. Yes, we have had some increased jobs because we were \ncoming out of a recession. We would have 1.2 million more. From my \npersonal experience, the difference between paying 26 percent and 42 \npercent can account for that.\n\n  What it boils down to is this, Mr. President: Americans all want to \nearn more, and they want to keep more of what they earn so that they \ncan do more with that money they are allowed to keep. In my own \npersonal experience, I saw that happen. We earned more as our business \nwas successful. We were able to keep more because we had a lower tax \nrate, and we were able to do more, reflected in those 2,700 jobs that \nwe created.\n  Every one of the people that holds one of those jobs, Mr. President, \npays taxes. Every one of them is adding to the revenue of the Federal \nGovernment by virtue of what we did creating that business. The Federal \nGovernment was a winner all across the board when they allowed us to \nearn more and then keep more that we earned so we could go out and do \nmore in creating those additional jobs.\n  It comes down, again, Mr. President, to the fundamental question that \nI asked at the beginning. When you address the question of tax freedom \nday, you are asking this fundamental issue: Whom do you trust to spend \nyour money? Do you trust the bureaucrats? Do you trust the regulators? \nDo you trust the planners in Washington? Or do you trust individual \nAmericans all over this country, taking their money and making the \ndecisions as to where it will be invested, where it will be channeled, \nwhere it will be spent, in a way to build the economy?\n  I, for one, Mr. President, think that government does many good \nthings. I think I can trust the Federal Government with a good chunk of \nmy money to do things like build roads and bridges, defend the country, \nand take care of the other challenges that we have as a nation. But \nwhen it comes to making the fundamental economic decisions as to what \nwill make this country grow, I trust individual Americans more than I \ntrust the planners in Washington.\n  For that reason, I am hoping that we can move the date back toward \nthe 1st of January when Americans can say, ``I have stopped working for \nthe government and now I am working for the growth of this country as a \nwhole.''\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nremarks from a business perspective on these economic issues. I yield \nup to 10 minutes to my good colleague from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to talk about \nthe tax burden on American families, especially because tomorrow is a \nred-letter day. Tomorrow we call national tax freedom day because \ntomorrow is the day that Americans stop working for the government and \nstart working for their families. They will pay their taxes tomorrow, \nand all of the work they have done between January 1 and May 7 will be \nmoney that goes to the Federal, State, or local government. That is \nabout 40 cents of every dollar earned by the American family. To put it \nanother way, 3 hours of every working day goes to pay Federal, State, \nand local taxes.\n\n  For most American families, making ends meet is getting harder and \nharder. After paying the basics--food, clothing, shelter, and taxes--\nthere is not much left. With ever-higher costs for education, for \nhealth insurance, and for retirement, most people have to work today. \nMany families would like to have mom or dad at home taking care of \nchildren, being home when they get home from school, but they cannot \nafford it because they have to do the extra things to get the extras \nbeyond the taxes, the food, and the shelter.\n  President Clinton has not eased the burden on working families. He \nraised taxes on seniors who depend on Social Security, on the self-\nemployed, and on everyone who drives a car. His tax increases in 1993 \nand the resulting slower economic growth has cost Americans $227 a \nmonth in earnings.\n  Last year, the Republican Congress tried to do something unusual for \nfamilies. We tried to let them keep their\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\nown money. We believe that with lower taxes, Americans will earn more \nand they will most certainly keep the money they worked so hard to \nearn.\n  The Republican Congress did the following things. We cut taxes for \nfamilies with children by providing a $500-per-child tax credit to help \nparents raise their children and to offset the erosion of personal \nexemption from inflation. With this tax cut, 28 million families would \npay fewer taxes. In my home State of Texas, 2 million families would \npay fewer taxes under the bill we passed last year.\n  We encouraged families in that bill to save for retirement, with my \nhomemaker IRA proposal that I have been working for 2 years to get put \nforward, and other expanded individual retirement accounts. This \nCongress believes in the expansion of IRA's because that is people \ntaking responsibility for their own retirement. It is our encouragement \nfor them to do so.\n  I want the homemakers of this country, Mr. President, to also have \nthe ability for their retirement security because I believe the work \ndone inside the home is every bit as important, and probably more so, \nthan the work done outside the home. We should not penalize the hard-\nworking family that has the ability for the mother to stay home and \nraise the children or the family, if that is the choice. Many people \nstretch to make that happen. The current Tax Code prevents married \ncouples who rely on the one income from equitably providing for their \nretirement security by limiting homemaker deductions to $250.\n\n  I think it is an outrage in this country. In fact, here is what the \nnumbers show. If you work outside the home, you can set aside $2,000 a \nyear. If you work inside the home, you set aside $250 a year.\n  What this means is that under current law, a single-income married \ncouple saving $2,250 a year for 30 years will have $188,000 for their \nretirement nest egg. With the bill we passed in Congress so that both \nspouses are able to set aside $2,000 a year, after 30 years they would \nhave a nest egg of $335,000--$335,000, an increase in $150,000 for that \nworking family.\n  We also helped families by permitting tax-deferred savings in an IRA \nfor education costs, for medical expenses, for first-time home \npurchases, and allowing penalty-free withdrawals during times of \nunemployment. That encourages savings, and it also helps people with \nemergency needs that they may have so that they know, if they do set \naside for their retirement security but they need a little bit extra to \neducate their children, or if they become unemployed, or if they have a \nbigger medical expense than they can afford, or to buy their first \nhome, they can take from that tax-free income that has built up without \nthe huge penalty that discourages them from providing for their \nretirement.\n  That is what we do in the bill that we passed. And we stopped \npenalizing young couples for getting married. We increased the standard \ndeduction for married couples filing jointly. In other words, by the \nyear 2005, under the bill we passed, the marriage penalty would be \neliminated for couples that do not itemize their deductions.\n  So we encouraged marriage and family rather than discouraging it by \nsaying you are going to pay more if you get married than you would have \nto pay if you stay single.\n  We cut capital gains taxes to encourage and reward investment. We \nwanted to create new businesses that create new jobs because we \nunderstand that the small businesses create the jobs in this country. \nIt is not the giant corporations; it is the small businesses. A capital \ngains tax reduction helps them to be able to buy that piece of \nequipment or make that capital investment that will create the jobs \nthat will get this economy going again.\n  We cut estate taxes. We cut estate taxes so that years of hard work \nwould not be wiped out in a generation so that a family that inherits a \nsmall family business or a small family farm will not have to sell \nthese unreadily salable assets in order to pay taxes to the Government.\n\n  Our tax cuts would reduce the tax burden on the people who actually \npay taxes, Mr. President. More than three-quarters of the cuts in the \nfirst year in the bill we passed go to the middle class making under \n$75,000 a year.\n  Who are those people? They are mothers and fathers who will get help \nraising their children with a $500 child tax credit.\n  They are homemakers who will get the opportunity to contribute the \nmaximum amount to an IRA for retirement security so that, if the \nhomemaker loses her spouse, she will be able to have something that is \nher own, that will help her in her retirement years.\n  They are married couples who will have the Tax Code's marriage \npenalty reduced.\n  They are savers who are trying to buy a first home or pay for college \nfor their kids.\n  They are small business owners who have spent their lives building a \nbusiness and want to pass it to their children without the huge taxes \nthat sometimes require the sale of that small business by the heirs \nbecause they do not have the cash to pay taxes.\n  They are investors who provide the capital to start businesses and \ncreate jobs.\n  Our tax cuts helped all Americans. It would put more money in \npeople's pockets, and it would increase jobs. Together with a balanced \nbudget, it would lower interest rates and increase the standard of \nliving for millions of Americans.\n  So why do I keep talking about what the proposals would have done? I \ntalk about it as if it did not happen because it did not happen. \nCongress passed everything I have talked about, and President Clinton \nvetoed it. That is why I am still talking about it.\n  After running for President in 1992 on a middle-class tax cut, in \n1993 President Clinton raised taxes on middle-class Americans while he \nclaimed to only hit the rich. His taxes took what could have been a \nrobust recovery and made it a weak, lackluster recovery.\n  The economic reports came out last week, and they said the economy is \ngetting better. I cannot remember a time when the economic reports were \ncoming out saying things were better when people do not feel it. If you \nask someone what their major concern is, they say job security. That is \nwhat they say. I do not care what the numbers are showing. It is what \nis in somebody's gut. They do not feel secure because they sense more \ntaxes, more regulation, and more encroachment on their freedom and \nindependence. They know things are not the way they used to be.\n\n  So why, Mr. President, do people not feel so good when all the \nnumbers say things are getting better? Big government. Big government. \nBig government is costing jobs for the American people.\n  A report from the Rochester Institute of Technology estimates the \ndirect cost of complying with Federal regulations to be about $668 \nbillion in 1995.\n  The bottom line is, Mr. President, tomorrow Americans are going to \nstop working full time to pay taxes. But we have not even talked about \nthe hidden cost of regulations. They are going to work until July 3 to \nfinish their obligation for all of the cost of government--regulations, \nas well as taxes.\n  So, hopefully, on July 3, we can talk about the cost of government. \nBut today we are just talking about the cost of taxes.\n  I do not think that Americans in general object to taxes. In fact, \nthe Reader's Digest poll taken recently shows that Americans believe \nthey should pay taxes to live in this great country for what this \ncountry gives them back in services and freedom. But, Mr. President, \nthey believe about 25 percent for a family of four is the maximum that \ngovernment should take from them. They believe they should be able to \nkeep 75 percent of what they work every day to earn. In fact, however, \nthey are paying about 40 percent.\n  We are working every day in Congress to bring that number down. If we \ncould just get the President to work with us instead of just talking \nabout it, we could make a difference for the American family. We could \nput government in the role that it should have, and we could give the \npeople of this country their buying power back. They work for this \ncountry. They work for their families. We want them to keep what they \nearn.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her \nremarks on the economic aspect of taxes on the American family.\n  I now yield up to 10 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas just gave a very \ngood explanation of what was in the bill that the President vetoed. I \nthink it is a good exercise once in a while to remind ourselves and the \npublic--because the public is cynical about whether or not we ever kept \nour commitments of the last 15 years to pass a balanced budget--that we \npassed a bill, a 1,800-page bill. This balanced budget legislation was \nthe product of 8 months of work by 13 different committees in this body \nto balance the budget; not only balance the budget but to help lower \nmortgage interest rates down by $2,300 a year, student loan interest \nrates by $603 a year, and interest rates on a car loan by $150 a year. \nYou can go on and on about the benefits of balancing the budget by \nreducing the interest rates by 2 percent, according to Greenspan, but \nCongress also offered all of the things that the Senator from Texas \nreferred to--IRA's for homemakers, expanding IRA's for everybody, a \n$1,000 tax cut for a family of four, and estate tax reductions, and \nwelfare reform that turns welfare over from the Federal bureaucracy to \nthe States to administer because the States are doing a better job of \nit than we are in Washington, saving the taxpayers $58 billion, and \nsaving Medicare from bankruptcy in 6 years. Medicare is going to be \nbankrupt in 6 years. We knew that a year ago. That is why we addressed \nthe issue in this bill. This is the bill that President Clinton vetoed. \nIt has been referred to by Senator Nickles and Senator Hutchison. I \nthink we ought to think of this as a document that people do not think \nwe passed because the President is on TV saying he is for balancing the \nbudget and making some citizens ask: Where are the Republicans?\n\n  Well, where was the President last year when we were balancing the \nbudget? Now, I will tell you that he was passing the buck. We do not \nwant to pass the buck. We just want to get down and get the job done \nagain.\n  Part of the issue that we are dealing with today, as everybody has \nbeen hearing, is that we are recognizing tomorrow as national tax \nfreedom day. It is a sad commentary that we are to May 7 before people \nare done paying their taxes and can start working for themselves and \ntheir families. But also it is beneficial to remind people that this is \na day when they can start working for themselves, if they are average \nAmericans, because I think most people feel that Congress is so \nirresponsible that average Americans never get done paying taxes. But \nwe have tax freedom day to bring people's attention to the fact that an \nannual point arrives where our people stop toiling away to fund big \nGovernment and begin toiling away to fund their families and their ways \nof life.\n  I am happy to say that in my State of Iowa, our citizens are slight \nwinners in this year's tax freedom day lottery. For the people of my \nState, tax freedom day was Saturday, May 4, instead of tomorrow, May 7. \nAs you can imagine, the people in my State find this 3-day victory to \nbe somewhat shallow in comparison to what others, including the Federal \nGovernment, expect of them. The fact that we have 3 days more of tax \nfreedom than most people, I suppose, is a tribute to Iowa officials \nbeing more fiscally responsible on State and local spending than we are \nat the Federal level as opposed to other States. For Iowans, it took \n125 days this year, including weekends, to make it to this mock Federal \nholiday. For the first 18 weeks of 1996, working Iowans gave up their \nhard-earned money to fund Federal, State and local coffers. Finally, on \nMay 4, Iowans began to keep what they might earn for the remainder of \n1996. They only now begin to work to pay for the things that they must \nto do and what their families want to do and what they have a \nresponsibility to do.\n  If you remember back to the 1992 Presidential campaign, Vice \nPresident Gore traveled the country giving his now famous economic \nspeech in which he said:\n\n       Everything that should be up is down, and everything that \n     should be down is up.\n\n  I think this theme can also be applied to President Clinton's \nbudgetary policy.\n  Common sense tells us that when things go up, something else comes \ndown. So when the Government's budget for spending grows, obviously, \nthe family budget shrinks. Another way to describe this bloated \neconomic policy is by means of the Washington tax-and-spend syndrome. \nSome folks in Washington fail to understand that most Americans are not \nsatisfied with the way their tax dollars are spent. Again, I should \nlike to remind my tax-and-spend colleagues that money does not grow on \ntrees.\n  Unlike the retail and service sectors of our private economy, the \ndissatisfied taxpayer, in dealing with the Federal Government, cannot \ndemand a Government refund for poor services rendered. Many Americans \nfeel shortchanged for helping to support programs that they do not \nbelieve in or use. When it comes to spending money on families, the \nchoice should belong to taxpayers, not to the Federal bureaucrats.\n  Washington deficit spending is the public's greatest outrage of all. \nTaxpayers want to know why the Federal Government has spent more money \nthan it has collected for each of the last 27 years. Ending this trend \nof 27 years of spending more than we take in is what balancing the \nbudget last year was all about--the budget that the President vetoed. \nBecause unlike the Federal Government, working families live on limited \nbudgets and balance a checkbook. Not the Federal Government. But those \nsame working families expect the same of Uncle Sam, to balance the \ncheckbook and to be in the business of life and operating profitably.\n\n  Because Iowans are economically conservative by nature, most of my \ncitizens are outraged by the fact that Washington cannot get its fiscal \nhouse in order. The willingness to pay their share of Government \nservices becomes harder to swallow when wasteful and inefficient \nGovernment programs continue to expand.\n  I should like to give you an example that I had something to do with \nbringing to the public's attention last year. Consider the estimated \n$200,000 expense for a flight from Naples, Italy, to Colorado Springs, \nCO, U.S.A., last year by an Air Force general. About 36 taxpaying \nfamilies in Iowa worked all of last year just to pay for General Ashy, \nan aide, and his cat to jet nonstop across the Atlantic with two \ninflight refuelings. He could have taken a commercial airline flight \nfor $1,500.\n  This disconnect between elected officials and the public will \ncontinue to widen if Washington clings to the fiscally irresponsible \nstatus quo. Last fall, Republicans made many tough decisions in order \nto pass the first Balanced Budget Act since 1969.\n  And again, I do not think we can hold this up too often to say, \n``Here it is. We passed it.'' One person stands in the way of this \nbeing law or not, and that is the President of the United States, Bill \nClinton, because he vetoed it.\n  When the smoke from last year's budget battle cleared, it was obvious \nthat no one won. We passed it, but we did not win. The President vetoed \nit, and you might say he won the public relations battle because he is \non television having everybody believe that he thought of the balanced \nbudget. It was 6 months past the last election when we won an election \non a promise to balance the budget that the President said, ``Well, I \nam for a balanced budget, but we will do it in 10 years.'' It has only \nbeen since January 13 that he came around to doing it in 7 years as we \nare doing it with this legislation that he vetoed.\n  The President still leaves about 87 percent of his expenditures to be \nmade in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002. That is a long way off and is \ndifficult to plan for.\n  The American people do not have a balanced budget, so I still have to \nsay even though we passed it, the public has not won yet. In fact, they \nare losing every day that we do not balance it for next year. More \nimportantly, faith in Government suffers yet another setback.\n  As the Senator from Texas said, we have to work to restore the $500-\nper-child tax credit. In addition, we are going to repeal Clinton's \n1993 gas tax, and we are going to do that because the President ran on \na platform in 1992 in which he stated so often that an increase in the \ngas tax is sticking it to the low- and middle-income working people of \nAmerica and the retirees. The President said that he is not for doing\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\nthat, and yet he did it within 6 months. We voted against it, so \nobviously we are still sticking by our convictions not to be for the \nPresident's gas tax increase because it is regressive. We have a chance \nnow with high gasoline prices to make the point and to repeal something \nthe President said in 1992 he was not going to do anyway. So that is \nwhy we are doing it. But we are also in the process of trying to free \nworking poor and middle-income families from excessive tax burdens.\n  So Iowans, the people of my State, marked tax freedom day on May 4, \n1996, and the rest of the country tomorrow, May 7.\n  During this period, and especially today, I believe it is the duty of \nthe President to agree with Congress to cut spending and to provide tax \nrelief so that Iowans, and their friends in every other State in the \nUnion, can commemorate this day earlier next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. He reminds me of what I said in my opening remarks when I \nwas rebutting the statement by the Senator from Virginia, who thought \nthe courageous thing to do was to keep the gas tax in place. And he \nreminds us that the President himself came to the American people in \n1992 and said, as you just heard from the Senator from Iowa, that a gas \ntax is not the thing to do and it is particularly harmful to people \nwith low income, the middle class, and seniors. That whole episode is \ninteresting to me because it was such a center point of the President's \ncampaign, that he would lower taxes on America's middle class. The bags \nwere not unpacked before that promise was forgotten. Then, by August \n1993, as the Senator from Iowa has alluded to, we were confronted with \nthe largest tax increase in American history.\n  So you go to the American people and say I am going to lower your \ntaxes. Then you come up here and raise them the highest they have ever \nbeen raised. And no wonder a cynicism begins to set in across the land \nabout the way Washington works. The bottom line here is that Americans \nare working 40 to 50-plus percent of a work year for a government. I \nknow Thomas Jefferson, if he were here today, would be astounded. If \nyou read back through his remarks, time and time again he warns and \npoints to the egregious behavior of governments when they consume too \nmuch of the fruits of labor. He said it throughout his life and \nthroughout his working in the founding of the Government. He also \nwarned us that governments by their nature do just that. I do not \nbelieve a single Founder could ever conceive that our Government would \nbe a government that sweeps half the earnings away from an American \nfamily.\n  I have spent a good bit of my time talking about this average family \nand what the burden of taxes does to them. I would like to visit on \nthis just a little bit more. I often refer to Ozzie and Harriet as the \nquintessential family of the 1950's. When Ozzie and Harriet were \nworking in the workplace, Ozzie sent 2 cents out of every dollar he \nearned to Washington. But if he were here today, he would send up to 24 \ncents; from 2 cents up to 24 cents out of every dollar of his wages \nbeing sent to Washington.\n  That fact raised several questions in my mind. All of us in the \ncountry are very concerned, deeply concerned about the behavior of our \nfamilies and the changes that have occurred. It created a deep worry. \nWe have heard Senators say here: If you ask parents today if they are \nbetter off than their parents, they say yes. But for the first time in \nAmerican history if you ask them do you think your children will be \nbetter off than you, they say no. That is the first time that has ever \nhappened in America.\n\n  What has been the force that created this sense of pessimism? My \nargument is that there is no single institution or structure or force \non the American family that has so profoundly affected the way they \nlive and function as has had their government; more than Hollywood, \nmore than pop music stars--government. What other force sweeps through \nthe family and takes half of everything those bread earners earn?\n  When I was a kid I was told the largest single investment I would \never make is my home. My guess is the Presiding Officer was told the \nsame thing. But that is not true anymore. We have to change the \nrhetoric. We now have to tell America's children the single largest \ninvestment you will ever make is government. It now surpasses housing; \nyour home, clothing, education, and transportation combined. So no \ninstitution has had a more profound effect on the way the American \nfamily functions than the government.\n  There is a lot of discussion in today's workplace about both parents \nhaving to work and not, therefore, having the opportunity to spend \nenough time with the family in setting the standards, in monitoring \nwhat is going on in the family. I would allege that the single greatest \nforce in our country that has caused families to have both parents in \nthe workplace is the government, too. In fact, I was so curious I \nwanted to know, from 1950--Ozzie and Harriet--to now, the increasing \nnumber for which both parents work each succeeding year. Then I tracked \nthat scale or growth against the increased tax burden. Mr. President, \nyou will not be surprised, nor would anybody else, that those two lines \non a graph track each other almost simultaneously. In other words, \nevery year, as the Government added yet another gas tax or raised the \nincome tax or some other scheme to get more of the revenue of that \nworking family, each time they did that another so many thousands of \nAmerican families were forced to make the decision that both spouses \nhad to work.\n  In fact, both parents today work on each day longer earning taxes to \ngive to the government than they spend with their own family. They are \nnow investing more of their workday working to pay off this tax burden \nand the debt and the interest on the debt and all the commensurate \neffects of taxation and regulatory burdens--they are spending more time \ndoing that than they are raising their own families. Is there any \nwonder, then, that the behavior of that family is changed? It should \nnot be a surprise to any of us.\n\n  If you ask the second spouses today if they are working on their own, \nvoluntarily, 85 percent say no. Mr. President, 85 percent would do \nsomething differently. A third of them would stay home. If they had \ntheir option, they would stay home. They cannot. They cannot make ends \nmeet without both of them being in the workplace. A third of them would \nvolunteer, they would like to be in the workplace as volunteers. And \nanother third would modify the amount of time that they are in the \nworkplace.\n  So I wonder, you almost wish that we could cause the Federal \nGovernment or all governments to put on the tax form: ``This is how \nmany days your family has to work to meet this obligation,'' because I \nam convinced that there are not many families who think they are \nworking from January 1 to May 7--or, as the Senator from Texas pointed \nout, to July 3, if you add the regulatory burden in--that they work \nuntil midyear before they have the opportunity to keep one dime for \nthemselves, one dime to pay for what they are responsible for \naccomplishing for the country. This is a sad state of affairs and I \nbelieve all of us need to be engaged in absolutely sound, fundamental \npolicy to push that burden back.\n  If America were picking the date, they would pick March 1; that they \nwould have worked from January 1 to March 1, and that is a fair deal \nbetween that family and the Government: March 1. But, instead, because \nof all these pressures--I guess courage has been alluded to by the \nSenator from Virginia--they now work until May 7 instead.\n  Mr. President, we have just received a white paper from the \nManufacturing Institute called ``Improving the Economic Condition of \nthe American Worker.''\n  I would like to read just a small piece of what this report says. It \nis entitled: ``Government Obstacles to Wage Growth and Job Creation.''\n\n       Taxes, particularly payroll taxes, account for much of the \n     slowdown in compensation growth.\n\n  We read every day articles concerning the anxiety in the American \nfamily from economic pressures in the family. But this report says:\n\n       Taxes, particularly payroll taxes, account for the slowdown \n     in compensation growth.\n\n  It says:\n\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\n\n       Had the relative tax burden remained at the level of 40 \n     years ago, today's typical family would have an extra $8,847 \n     in disposable income each year.\n\n  Eight-thousand dollars. Now remember, Mr. President, a moment ago I \nsaid that average family is earning about $40,000 a year. This is the \nequivalent of a 20-percent pay increase, $8,847 in additional income.\n\n       Based on an analysis of Census Bureau figures by the Tax \n     Foundation, the median two-earner family paid about 20 \n     percent of its income in 1955. In 1995, taxes took an \n     estimated 37 percent. The change is even more apparent when \n     it comes to payroll taxes which represent the largest tax on \n     many employees. Social Security and Medicare taxes are 45\\1/\n     2\\ times higher today than in 1955.\n\n  These are the reasons Ozzie was only sending 2 cents to Washington \nand today he is sending 24 cents.\n\n       Median income, on the other hand, is only 10 times higher. \n     Companies today are burdened by heavy, nonproduction costs \n     largely created by government--\n\n  Just as we have been saying all afternoon.\n\n       The major ones are government regulations, legal services \n     and taxes. If these costs could be reduced significantly, \n     companies would have more resources available to expand and \n     hire more workers and pay higher wages. The current \n     regulatory system is too costly.\n\n  The Senator from Utah was talking about this very point.\n  In my closing minutes, I want to point out that elections have \nconsequences. President Clinton's efforts on the economy in 1993 really \nhad a major effect on the American family.\n  It is important to note that since this administration came to office \nin January 1993, virtually everything they have done has pushed and \nmounted the economic burden on the American family and American \nbusiness. In other words, with all the American people saying, ``We're \nbeing taxed twice what we should be, we should be free to earn our own \nmoney on March 1, not May 7,'' but this administration came here and \nhas pushed the tax burden higher, blocked regulatory reform by arguing \nagainst it here on the floor, so the regulatory burden is mounting.\n\n  Since Clinton has been President, regulatory costs to the American \nfamily have risen about $300 per year. Their taxes have gone up. They \nare working even more for the government than they were when this \nadministration came to office, even though this administration said, \n``You will be working less for the government. That's our promise to \nyou. You'll work less. It won't be May 7; we're going to go back the \nother way.''\n  Wrong. Wrong. That promise was left at the doorstep of the White \nHouse, Mr. President, and they work more than when this administration \ncame to office and they have more regulatory burden today than they had \nthen. As we said earlier, the largest tax increase in history--$255 \nbillion in higher taxes--gas taxes, Social Security taxes, a $31 \nbillion increase in the gas tax, and, as we have all alluded, that has \na particularly regressive effect on low-income Americans; less family \nincome.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, after-tax median family \nincome for a single-earner family has fallen $803 during the Clinton \nPresidency. If real after-tax incomes had grown at the average rate of \nthe Reagan expansion, 1983 to 1989, single-earner median family income \nwould be $1,274 per year higher.\n  People are spending less time at home with their families and more \ntime working to pay for big Government. According to the Tax \nFoundation, Americans will spend 2 hours, 47 minutes--3 hours--of each \nworking day laboring to pay taxes, and they will work this year until \ntomorrow, May 7, just to pay Federal, State, and local taxes.\n  Mr. President, the 1993 budget has cost America dearly. It has cost \nher 1.2 million in additional private sector jobs between 1993 and \n1996; a total of $2,600 in after-tax income for every household in \nAmerica between 1993 and the end of 1996; roughly $465 in wages and \nsalaries in 1996 alone. The list goes on.\n  The point we are making is that American families work too long for \nthe government and not enough for themselves, and this administration \nhas made that situation worse, not better. They promised to make it \nbetter. They did not. Worse yet, they made it worse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am sure there will be more conversations \ntoday, as there should, about the fact that this is tax freedom day. \nThis is the day that has been determined that each of us on the average \nhas worked since the first of the year until now to pay our taxes to \nthis country.\n  A typical family of four pays 38.2 percent of their income in taxes. \nThat is for all governments.\n  In Wyoming, and this is the U.S. Census estimate, the median income \nfor families is about $47,000. Federal taxes are about $10,000; local \nand State taxes are another $5,000 or $6,000, for a total of $16,000 in \ndirect taxes. The estimated cost of Federal regulation for a family is \nabout $6,600. Excess family interest payments caused by Federal \nborrowing are approximately $2,000 for a total of $24,000 that goes to \ntaxation.\n  So, Mr. President, it is an appropriate day for us to take a look at \nwhat we do with taxes. I would like to approach it from just a little \ndifferent angle. Of course, taxes are dollars, taxes are numbers when \nwe talk about those, but I think also there is a concern that we ought \nto have that taxes also are related to the size of Government. They are \nmore than money. They have to do with the kind of Government we have. \nThey have to do with the number of Government programs that we expect, \nand there is a relationship between spending and taxes.\n  Of course, we ought to be willing to pay for the programs that we \nwant. We have not done this. For 40 years, we have not balanced the \nbudget. What we have done is said, ``Yes, we want more programs, but we \nare going to charge them to our kids; we're not going to pay for \nthem.'' We ought to be willing to pay for the programs that we want.\n  I think that the message in the election of 1994, and we are coming \nup to another one in 1996, the message was, ``government is too big, \nthe Federal Government is too big, it costs too much and we are \noverregulated.''\n\n  Too often in the past 40 years, we have said, ``Well, we have all \nthese programs. The question is, how do we pay for it,'' instead of \ntaking a look each time at what programs we have, how effective those \nprograms are, where should those programs be cared for, do they, \nindeed, need to be there at all.\n  One of the problems is we have been sort of distanced from the idea \nof paying for them. The best relationship between a taxpayer and his or \nher Government is that as a taxpayer in a school district where the \nproposition is we need a new school or we need a new science lab, we \nsay, ``All right, it costs x amount of dollars to have this new science \nlab. It is going to cost you this much on your taxes next year,'' and \nyou make the decision whether or not you are willing to pay a cost-\nbenefit ratio. Is it worth it to you to pay for that program?\n  The Federal Government removes us from that. It removes us in several \nways. That is, most of us have our taxes withheld, and so we talk about \nafter-tax dollars, and for some it is really hard to understand how \nmany dollars we do pay in taxes.\n  I think it is great to have a tax day and say we have worked this \nyear until now with nothing for ourselves, paid entirely for taxes. \nThat is part of the problem.\n  The other, of course, is the Federal Government is removed to the \nextent that seldom do we have a chance as taxpayers to say, ``Here's \nthe program, here's what it costs. Is it worth it to me? Am I willing \nto pay what it costs?'' We do not have that same kind of cost-benefit \nratio opportunity that we have on the local level.\n  So I think it is appropriate that when we talk about taxes and we \ntalk about the burden and we talk about the debt and we talk about the \nfuture, that we also take a look at government; take a basic, long \nlook, some introspection of you and me as taxpayers and citizens, \nsaying, ``I suspect in our form of government, those who put together \nthe Constitution did not envision that 40 percent of our earnings, of \neveryone's earnings, on average, would go to pay taxes for government \nfunctions.'' Do you think? I do not think so.\n  They so clearly defined in the Constitution those things that the \nFederal Government should do, and there are many things, indeed, that \nthe Federal Government should do. There are many things that only the \nFederal Government can do--defense, interstate commerce, highways--many \nthings.\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\n  They also put in the Constitution the 10th amendment which says that \nonly those things enumerated in the Constitution would, in fact, be \ncarried out by the Federal Government and others would be reserved to \nthe States and to the people. So we find ourselves with a great \nrelationship between the taxes we pay and the amount of Government that \nwe have.\n\n  Big spending and big taxes go together. We have done a number of \nthings this year to seek to work at this. When the Republicans came in \nand took control of the House and Senate, they changed the debate. We \nhave changed the debate from talking about how do we get more money to \ncontinue to grow, to taking a look at the programs that are there.\n  We have changed the debate to one of examining programs instead of \nsimply saying they are going to grow some more, how do you charge it or \nhow do you put it on the debt or how do you get some more taxes.\n  We have changed the debate to balancing the budget. The budget has \nnot been balanced in 25 years. For the first time, the conversation now \nis toward balancing the budget. We presented a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution which says, as it does in almost all \nState constitutions, that you cannot spend more than you take in. It \nlost by one vote. I hope we get another chance, Mr. President, to take \na look at that issue, and I think perhaps we will this week.\n  In that debate, frankly, we forced the President to deal with \nbalancing the budget. The President did not send up any balanced \nbudgets until this year. Now, of course, we do not agree with the way \nit has been balanced. It does not do anything about those things that \ndrive it. But nevertheless, the discussion now is how do you balance \nthe budget, not if you are going to balance the budget. We have reduced \nthe number of programs in Government. We have to do that if we are \ngoing to do anything about taxes. We sought to reduce taxes in a couple \nof instances. We had regulatory reform.\n  Mr. President, I guess what I want to emphasize is we do pay a great \ndeal of taxes. I think we pay too many taxes. I think we expect too \nmuch from the Federal Government; that there are other ways to \naccomplish those things more efficiently either through local \ngovernment, State government, the private sector, that we ought to take \nour taxes and orient them, direct them toward those things that only \nthe Federal Government can do.\n  But I hope that we do not simply talk about the amount, because taxes \nhave a great deal to do with the concept, with the principle of what \nyou do in the Federal Government. I think that is a legitimate debate \nthat each of us ought to undertake as we move into this election \nseason. Each of us ought to evaluate in our judgment what role we think \nthe Government ought to have at the Federal level, what role should the \ncentralized Government have, how much money should we spend, how do we \nbecome responsible morally, physically to balance the budget, and that \nseems to me is what tax day is about. I am delighted that there will be \ndiscussions about it, there will be considerable interest in it.\n\n  I think one of the things sometimes we do not even recognize \nourselves is the amount that taxes have increased. Corporate tax \nincreases between 1992 and 1995 have gone up 55 percent. Who pays \ncorporate taxes? Corporations? I do not think so. It is the people who \nuse their products, of course. They are passed on.\n  Personal taxes have gone up 25 percent. Total receipts have gone up \n23 percent. At the same time total receipts and taxes have gone up 23 \npercent, the GDP has only gone up 16 percent.\n  So tax increases have outstripped our growth by at least 1.5 times. \nPayroll taxes have gone up 15 percent, and indirect taxes up 11 \npercent.\n  I am not opposed to taxes. Taxes are how we fund our Government. We \nhave to pay taxes, should pay taxes. We should pay them fairly. The \nreal issue is, what do you want to pay for? What are you willing to \npay? What should we pay for? How do we do it efficiently? Tax day ought \nto cause us to consider those things and consider them as we come into \nthis election cycle. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize tax freedom \nday; a day marking the people's emancipation from government taxation; \na day after which the American people begin working for themselves and \ntheir families instead of for the Government; a day which continues to \nrecede further and further every year.\n  This year, Mr. President, America's tax freedom day arrives on May 7. \nIn my own State of Michigan it arrives even later--on May 9. Michigan, \nthanks to its friendly atmosphere for economic growth and investment, \nis relatively affluent. Thus Michigan pays a significantly higher \nportion of its income in Federal taxes than do other States. We are \n13th in the Nation in total taxes paid, again in large measure because \nthe Federal Government takes more from our citizens' paychecks than \nfrom those of citizens of other States.\n  But let us look at the overall tax picture.\n  As tax freedom day approaches, Mr. President, I believe it is \nappropriate for us to ask ourselves how much of their time, what \nproportion of their paychecks the American people feel it is fair for \nthem to be asked to pay to the government.\n  When I first saw the results of the Roper Poll on this subject I was \nsurprised to note that Americans of all stripes--whatever their race, \nsex, income level, or political persuasion--felt it was fair for them \nto pay a full 25 percent or one quarter of their income taxes. More \nastounding, however, is the proportion they actually must pay in \ntaxes--over 38 percent.\n  Americans are willing to pay a quarter of their incomes in taxes, Mr. \nPresident, but that is not enough for our government. No, our \ngovernment taxes away over 38 percent of the income of the average \nAmerican family.\n  And the trend is toward more, not less. The government imposes ever-\nhigher taxes on America's working families. Commerce Department data \nreveal that in 1995 total taxes as a share of the gross domestic \nproduct were the highest in U.S. history. Federal, State, and local \ngovernment receipts consumed a record 31.3 percent of GDP.\n  Mr. President, this figure is simply astounding. Even at the height \nof World War II, with America fighting for her very existence, total \ntaxes only consumed 25 percent of GDP. In 1992, only 4 years ago, taxes \nconsumed 30 percent of GDP.\n  What does this mean? It means that taxes have risen by 1.3 percent of \nGDP--of the size of our entire domestic economy--since Bill Clinton \nbecame President.\n  And what does our President propose to do about this deplorable \nsituation, in which our economy is operating under the highest tax \nburden in history?\n  Recent experience does not provide much hope for relief. In 1993 \nPresident Clinton signed into law the largest tax increase in history: \n$241 billion. The President raised taxes on gasoline. He raised taxes \non Social Security recipients. He also hit our senior citizens by \nreinstating the highest estate and gift tax rate of 55 percent. He \nraised taxes on small business owners. And he passed a retroactive tax \nincrease on the incomes of America's working families--not only \nincreasing taxes on their future incomes, but actually taking a portion \nof the incomes they already had earned.\n  The President's tax hikes directly and indirectly increased the tax \nburden on millions of middle-class taxpayers. Small wonder he recently \nadmitted that he ``may have'' raised taxes too much.\n  But President Clinton's contribution to higher taxes does not end \nthere. When we Republicans sought to emancipate American families from \nsome of their tax burden--to make their tax freedom come earlier in the \nyear--President Clinton was ready, with his veto.\n  Americans should judge for themselves the effects of Clinton tax \npolicies on their ability to keep what they earn for themselves and \ntheir families. They should ask themselves a few simple questions.\n  First, do you have children?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto of our Balanced Budget Act is costing \nyou $500 per child in tax savings--the amount of the tax credit we \nattempted to give you.\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n  Second, are you married?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto is denying you tax savings from a \nhigher joint standard deduction. Married couples with average incomes \nof $50,000 who claim the standard deduction are paying $217 more than \nthey would otherwise, because of the President's veto.\n  Third, are you trying to save for your retirement?\n  If so, and you earn more than $40,000 a year or have a nonworking \nspouse, President Clinton's veto cost you $1,120 in IRA tax savings.\n  Fourth, are you planning to adopt a child?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto cost you a credit of up to $5,000 to \ndefray adoption expenses.\n  Fifth, do you care for an elderly parent at home?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto is denying you savings from a $1,000 \neldercare deduction--that's between $150 and $280 out of your pocket \nand into the Government's.\n  Sixth, do you plan to earn taxable capital gains--for example by \nselling your house when you retire?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto is preventing you from keeping more \nof your profits. The GOP reforms would have seen that you were taxed on \nonly half of your net capital gain.\n  And finally, are you paying off a student loan?\n  If so, President Clinton's veto is costing you savings from a maximum \n$2,500 deduction on the interest paid for the first 5 years of \nrepayment.\n  This veto delayed tax freedom day to May 7--the latest date ever. \nThis veto extended to 3 hours, out of the typical 8-hour workday, the \ntime Americans must work just to pay taxes, the longest ever. This veto \nmeans that the value of the dependent exemption continues to decline. \nOur families are having a harder time supporting their children, in \npart because the exemption has lost much of its value. For the \ndependent exemption to be worth the same it was worth in 1960, it would \nhave to be $3,800 today--$1,300 more than the current $2,500.\n  In short, President Clinton's policies have chained America's working \nfamilies to ever-higher taxes, making it harder and harder for them to \nsupport themselves.\n  His policies have cut the growth of Americans' real personal \ndisposable income. They have hurt the economy, increased taxes and \nreduced by nearly $2,600 the amount of money every American household \ncan use to support itself. They have contributed to a situation in \nwhich more and more families have two working parents not out of choice \nbut out of economic necessity. At the same time these policies have \nreduced the size of parents' paychecks--even as parents face increased \ncosts for their children's education, worries over their own retirement \nand concern that they are spending enough time with their kids.\n  Americans today are, and have every right to be worried about their \njobs, concerned about their future, and angry that the American Dream \nof moving up through hard work seems to be slipping out of reach.\n  In one generation, Mr. President, the Government has doubled the \namount of money it takes from the American people. It has severely \nrestricted our freedom from taxation. And what have we gotten in \nreturn? Certainly not safer and better schools. Certainly not safer and \ncleaner streets. Certainly not reduced drug-use and juvenile crime. \nCertainly not lower levels of welfare dependency and hopelessness.\n  No, Mr. President, what Americans have bought with their tax freedom \nis nothing more than increased Government control over their lives. And \nthis must end.\n  We must free our people from the chains of overtaxation and \noverregulation.\n  We must see to it that Americans earn more and keep more of what they \nearn so that they can do more for their families and communities.\n  We must institute reforms that will encourage economic growth, lower \ntax burdens, and empower America's working families to once again take \ncharge of their own lives, helping themselves and their neighbors.\n  What does this mean in practice?\n  To begin with, Mr. President, it means relieving American families of \nthe burden imposed by the Clinton tax increases. This is why we must \npass the $500 exemption for all children under the age of 18.\n  It also means reducing the amount Americans must pay for gasoline by \nrolling back the 1993 Clinton gas tax increase that unfairly burdens \nlower income working families.\n  It also means we must create more and better paying jobs through \nincentives like a capital gains tax cut that will encourage businesses \nto invest in resources that create jobs.\n  And it means helping people save for the future by encouraging \nretirement savings and portability.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it means balancing the budget and stopping \nGovernment from overspending. It means regaining control over the cost \nand size of Government so that the tax burden and regulatory burden \nboth may be lifted from the shoulders of the American people.\n  America always has been the land of freedom and opportunity. In large \nmeasure this has been true because we have recognized that \nopportunity--the chance to build a decent and rewarding life for \nyourself and your family--depends on freedom.\n  Only with the freedom to work, move, and invest as we see fit can we \nmake the most of our capacities.\n  It is our job, Mr. President, to restore Americans' opportunity by \nfreeing them from a Government that taxes too much and prevents them \nfrom pursuing their own good, and the good of their families and \nneighbors.\n  Tax cuts, growth incentives, and renewed responsibility in government \nspending and regulation will emancipate the American people from the \nchains of taxation and overregulation.\n  More than this government cannot provide. Less than this, Mr. \nPresident, we dare not provide.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before we get into the Billy Dale bill, \nbecause it is a very important piece of legislation, as far as I am \nconcerned, I thought I would spend a few minutes, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, talking about habeas corpus reform because of the \nextraordinary action taken by the Supreme Court last Friday, and then I \nwill launch into the Billy Dale legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4705-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4716-S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE SUPREME COURT AND HABEAS CORPUS REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last Friday, the Supreme Court decided to \nhear a challenge to the constitutionality of the habeas provisions in \nthe Anti-Terrorism Act. To examine this issue, the Court chose the \nvehicle of Felker versus Turpin, a case in which the prisoner, Ellis \nFelker, kidnaped, robbed, raped, sodomized, and then killed Evelyn Joy \nLudlam, a 19-year-old college student who was working as a waitress. \nThe Court ordered an expedited briefing and argument schedule, with the \nlikely result that the Justices will decide the issues involved by the \nbeginning of July.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Clinton administration, and in particular, \nits Solicitor General, Drew Days, to vigorously defend the \nconstitutionality of our habeas reform. Habeas reform was the heart and \nsoul of the Anti-Terrorism Act, and it is the only thing in the act \nthat will directly affect the perpetrators of the heinous bombing in \nOklahoma. Without habeas reform, those who murdered in Oklahoma, like \nother convicted murderers throughout our Nation, will be able to use \nfrivolous petitions and appeals to prevent the imposition of their \njustly deserved punishments.\n  It is a sad day when we in the Senate must ask the Justice Department \nto vigorously side with the State in a death penalty case. But I am \nafraid to say that we must because of the Clinton administration's \ndemonstrated reluctance to support habeas reform and the death penalty. \nThrough its Solicitor General, the Clinton administration has failed to \nsupport State efforts to impose capital sentences--a 180-degree \nturnaround from the policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations. \nFor example, in Judiciary Committee hearings led by myself and Senator \nThompson, we learned that, during the 1994 Supreme Court term, the \nSolicitor General under the Clinton administration failed to file even \none brief on the side of the State in death penalty cases. As this \nchart makes clear, this is a sharp drop off from the practice\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\nunder the Reagan and Bush administrations, when that number was 42.9 \npercent in 1991 and 37.5 percent in 1992.\n  The Clinton Solicitor General's failure to defend the death penalty \nis only part of the administration's soft-on-crime litigating \npositions. In case after case, the Solicitor General has refused to \nappeal cases in which the lower courts have overruled the Government, \nhave overturned convictions, or have made it difficult to prosecute the \ndefendant. Take, for example, the decision in United States versus \nCheely, in which a panel of Carter judges in the ninth circuit struck \ndown the Federal death penalty as unconstitutional. The Clinton \nadministration's Solicitor General refused to appeal that case to the \nfull ninth circuit or to the Supreme Court. When asked by Senator \nThompson why no appeal was filed, Drew Days responded that he felt that \nthe case did not raise large enough concerns to justify a rehearing.\n  Another example is the case of United States versus Hamrick. This is \nthe case in which a prisoner sent a mail bomb to a U.S. attorney. \nLuckily, the bomb did not go off. Unluckily, a panel of judges on the \nfourth circuit overturned his conviction for assault with a deadly or \ndangerous weapon because those judges felt the bomb was an incomplete \nbomb and could not go off. Again, President Clinton's Solicitor General \nfailed to appeal that decision, and the fourth circuit had to sua \nsponte order a rehearing to reverse that activist decision.\n  I could go on. I could describe the Solicitor General's effort to \nnarrow the Federal child pornography laws. I could describe the \nSolicitor General's support for lawsuits by prisoners against the \nArizona prisons. I could describe the drop-off in the Solicitor \nGeneral's support for the State in all criminal cases before the Court. \nI have discussed these cases elsewhere, and I think that the point is \nclear. If the administration were truly serious about fighting crime, \nmore than 90 percent of which is prosecuted in State court, then it \nshould work harder to toughen the judicially created criminal rules \nthat bind both Federal and State law enforcement, prosecutors, and \ncourts.\n  The Solicitor General's conduct follows the rest of the \nadministration's opposition to habeas reform and the death penalty. For \nexample, on the eve of House debate on the antiterrorism bill, the \nWhite House sent emissaries to the Hill to lobby for weakening changes \nto the habeas reform package. Abner Mikva, the former White House \ncounsel, lobbied to restore the de novo standard of review in habeas \npetitions, which would allow Federal judges to reopen issues that had \nbeen lawfully and correctly resolved years earlier.\n  Before that, the Clinton Justice Department in 1994 lobbied the House \nfor passage of the so-called Racial Justice Act. This provision, in the \nguise of protecting against race-based discrimination, would have \nimposed a quota on the imposition of the death penalty. It would have \neffectively abolished the death penalty. When the Senate refused to \naccept this death penalty abolition proposal, the Clinton \nadministration issued a directive implementing its substance to require \na racial review of all Justice Department death penalty decisions.\n  The weaknesses of the Clinton administration and of the Solicitor \nGeneral to combat crime and to support the vigorous enforcement of the \ndeath penalty concern me in this case. The importance of winning this \ncase cannot be overstated. One of the keys to winning the war on crime \nis to make clear society's determination to mete out swift, effective \njustice to those who are found guilty of violating its laws. Our habeas \nreform bill will prevent murderers from abusing our procedural system \nto forestall their punishments.\n  Because of my concerns about President Clinton's Solicitor General \nand the death penalty, let me announce today that I plan to file an \namicus brief before the Supreme Court defending the constitutionality \nof habeas reform. I invite all interested Members of both the Senate \nand the House to join my brief. We cannot take the chance that the \nClinton administration will pull another Cheely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4716-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4717-S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE LEGISLATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 2937, involving the \nreimbursement to the former White House Travel Office employees, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2937) for the reimbursement of attorney fees \n     and costs incurred by former employees of the White House \n     Travel Office with respect to the termination of their \n     employment in that Office on May 19, 1993.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 3952, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dole amendment No. 3953 (to amendment No. 3952), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n       Dole amendment No. 3954 (to amendment No. 3953), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n       Dole Motion to refer the bill to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary with instructions to report back forthwith.\n       Dole amendment No. 3955 (to the instructions to the motion \n     to refer), to provide for an effective date for the \n     settlement of certain claims against the United States.\n       Dole amendment No. 3956 (to amendment No. 3955), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we turn to H.R. 2937. This is a bill \nto provide for the legal expenses of Billy Dale and other former White \nHouse Travel Office employees.\n  Mr. President, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \npending legislation to reimburse the legal expenses incurred by Billy \nDale and the other White House Travel Office employees who were \nsummarily discharged from their jobs on May 19, 1993. This is a bill \nthat I believe remedies the grave miscarriage of justice that resulted \nin the wrongful investigation and prosecution of Mr. Billy Dale and \nother former White House Travel Office employees.\n  President Clinton has said that he supports reimbursement of legal \nfees for Mr. Dale. I take him at his word. I am counting on him to make \nsure that people on the other side do not delay this bill, that cloture \nwill be invoked tomorrow. It is surprising to me, however, that we are \nhere trying to move this simple measure that the President supports, \nthat had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, but that some of \nmy Democratic friends continue to seek to derail.\n\n  It is time to act on this measure and put to rest the years of \nunnecessary expense and inconvenience suffered by Mr. Billy Dale and \nhis former colleagues of the White House Travel Office. To do anything \nless, in my opinion, would be to deny justice to those wrongfully \nprosecuted by the Government.\n  The issue is simple: Mr. Dale served his country, at the pleasure of \neight Presidents, as the director of the White House Travel Office. He \nfaithfully served both Democratic and Republican Presidents. He \nprovided years of service that involved the thankless task of ensuring \nthat the national and international media were in a position to cover \nand report the movements of the President to the public. For that, Mr. \nDale and the entire White House Travel Office staff were fired on May \n19, 1993, and fired in what really could be nothing less than a \nsurreptitious manner.\n  As if that humiliation were not enough, Mr. Dale was thereafter \nindicted and prosecuted for embezzlement. On December 1, 1995, after \n2\\1/2\\ years of being investigated by the FBI and IRS and incurring \ntremendous legal expenses, Mr. Dale was tried before a jury of his \npeers and, after fewer than 2 hours of deliberation, found not guilty \nof all charges.\n  The travesty in this story is that the White House Travel Office \nemployees simply got caught in the political crossfire of the new \nadministration. They had served both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, but found themselves in jobs that apparently were an \nimpediment to the ambitious money-making schemes of some of the new \nPresident's friends.\n  President Clinton certainly had the authority to dismiss the White \nHouse Travel Office staff without cause. I do not begrudge the \nPresident his right to control White House staff. But subsequent to the \nfirings, the Clinton White House may have felt the need to justify\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\nits actions, given the tremendous media interest in this dismissal. \nUnfortunately, in justifying its own actions, the White House ruined \nthe reputations of Mr. Dale and his colleagues. The White House' \nactions went well beyond routine termination of jobs at the President's \npleasure. What happened is simply unconscionable, and we have to right \nthese wrongs.\n  In May 1993, the Travel Office employees were fired and told to \nvacate the premises. In fact, two staff members learned of their \ntermination on the nightly news. That is how this White House handled \nit. In an attempt to justify firing these loyal public servants, the \nWhite House met with and urged the FBI to investigate the Travel \nOffice. Usually that is done solely by calling anything they think is \nwrong to the attention of the Justice Department, who then can, if it \nis deemed necessary, call in the FBI. That was not the case here. They \nactually tried to influence the FBI to get involved in what really was \na political matter. They used allegations concocted by those who had a \nvested interest in running the office themselves. Curiously, the FBI \nhelped craft the White House' press release about the firings.\n  The accounting firm Peat Marwick was hired to do an audit of the \noffice. The firm's report, however, did not substantiate the \nallegations of mismanagement asserted by the White House. The firm \nfound only modest financial irregularities, which are certainly not the \nsame thing as embezzlement.\n  Now, this story would indeed be tragic enough if it ended here. But \nit does not. The Department of Justice then proceeded to indict Mr. \nDale, seemingly without concern for the weakness of its case. The case \nwas so weak that the citizens sitting on the jury who heard all the \nevidence exonerated Mr. Dale in fewer than 2 hours. For those who have \ntried a lot of lawsuits, it takes that long to organize the jury. This \nquestion of use of the Federal criminal justice system created a \nsituation for Mr. Dale where he had to spend some $500,000, and even \nconsidered taking a plea, when he had committed no crime, just to end \nit--just to end this tremendous fiscal abuse of him and his family.\n\n  Indeed, after the jury dismissed the allegations, someone leaked the \nexistence of the plea negotiations to the public in an attempt to \nfurther discredit Mr. Dale's reputation. The Clinton administration \njust could not let it end with Mr. Dale's acquittal. It had to take one \nmore swipe at Mr. Dale. Not only are plea negotiations a necessary part \nof our judicial system, they are intended to remain confidential and \nare not to be used against a criminal defendant. Mr. Dale likely \nconsidered a plea agreement because he was faced with a crushing \nfinancial problem and burden, an uncertain future, and wanted to put an \nend to a trial that had become too much of a strain to his family and \nreputation.\n  No one should ever have to be put through this. No citizen of this \ncountry should be treated in this fashion. I have to say there have \nbeen a number of innocent citizens through the years who have had to \nmake pleas just to get the Government off their back because the \nGovernment has a never-ending source of funds, where they, of course, \ncan lose their whole lives and their whole life's work. In Mr. Dale's \ncase, that is what was happening.\n  Even so, he was maligned by these leaks after his acquittal. It has \nnow been nearly 3 years since the termination of the White House Travel \nOffice employees, and they are still in the unfair position of \ndefending their reputations. It is time to close this chapter in their \nlives, and it is time to allow them to have their reputations back. I \ncannot, in good conscience, sit quiet when I believe an arrogant use of \npower has taken place. The power of the White House was used to \nvictimize the innocent for a President's political gains. The targeting \nof dedicated public servants, apparently because they held positions \ncoveted by political profiteers, demand an appropriate response. \nAlthough their muddied personal and smeared personal reputations may \nnever be fully restored, it is only just that the Congress do what it \ncan to rectify these wrongs.\n  Accordingly, this bill will make Mr. Dale and the other former White \nHouse Travel Office employees whole, at least financially. It will \nnever make up for what they have lost otherwise. But it will \nfinancially, by providing for attorney's fees and expenses related to \nthe criminal investigation. This is the very least we can do. After \nall, we can do nothing to restore their reputations, their dignity, or \ntheir faith in this White House.\n\n  Let me briefly explain to my colleagues what this bill does for the \nformer White House Travel Office employees. This legislation provides \nfor payment of the legal expenses incurred by Billy Dale, Barney \nBrasseaux, John Dreylinger, Ralph Maughan, John McSweeney, and Gary \nWright in connection with the wrongful criminal investigation launched \nagainst them subsequent to their firings. Though Mr. Dale suffered the \ngreatest financial losses, the remaining six employees collectively \nincurred approximately $200,000 in their own defense. These six \ninnocent--let me repeat that, innocent--employees were unjustly \ndismissed so that rich White House cronies could snap up their jobs. \nWhile this bill does not provide for compensation of all expenses \nassociated with the investigation into the Travel Office matters, such \nas costs incurred while appearing before Congress, it will provide for \nattorney's fees and costs that resulted from defending themselves \nagainst criminal investigations.\n  I thank my colleagues for considering this piece of legislation and, \nabove all, the Members of the House for passing H.R. 2937 with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. This is an important and long overdue \nmeasure. I find it a great breach of trust with the American people \nthat the awesome prosecutorial powers of the Federal Government will be \nbrought to bear on innocent persons for political motives. Even the \nWhite House in hindsight recognized that justice in this matter needs \nto be done. Indeed, when White House spokesman McCurry stated, ``Yes, \nand he signed it,'' referring to President Clinton's intentions to sign \nthis bill reimbursing Mr. Dale, this was our call to enact this \nmeasure. We should all keep this in mind when voting to pass this bill.\n  I strongly urge support for the passage of this legislation.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Christina \nRios, of my staff, be given privileges of the floor for the pendency of \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is one of the most unjust things I have seen in all \nthe time I have been here. It is just a shame that the awesome power of \nthe White House could be utilized in this fashion. I am pleased that \nthe President basically stands behind this bill and will not veto this \nbill. I am pleased he said he would support this bill. I hope our \ncolleagues on the other side will support it, as I hope our colleagues \non our side will support it.\n  There is no reason in this world why we do not rectify this kind of \nwrong caused by the Federal Government. My only problem is I wonder how \nmany other wrongs like this there are in our system today? I think by \nand large our system is as honest and good and decent as it can be, but \noccasionally we do find people who play politics with the law. You \nshould never play politics with criminal laws. People's lives, \nreputations, their very inner psyches can be completely destroyed when \nput through these types of embarrassing, despicable approaches. I am \nvery upset about it.\n  I would like to see this passed without event and without a lot of \nscreaming and shouting. It ought to be done in a dignified way. Every \none of us in this body ought to be proud to do it and send this \nmessage, not only to this White House but future White Houses and \nfuture Justice Departments, that we will not tolerate this kind of \naction in the future. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I, as you know, have made some arguments \nhere that this is a bill that everybody ought to be for. It is to right \ninjustices that\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\nwere created by certain people at the White House which the President \neven acknowledges in the sense that he said he would support this \nlegislation. He does support this legislation. He thinks an injustice \nwas done, and he thinks that Billy Dale and the other former employees \nought to be reimbursed their legal expenses. The President is behind \nthis.\n  This is not a partisan issue. But I just have been informed that the \nDemocrats on the cloture vote tomorrow are going to vote against \ncloture on something this bipartisan. Not one of them is going to speak \nagainst it. I do not think anybody in this body can speak against this \nbill. But they are going to filibuster this bill because they cannot \nadd the minimum wage to this bill, or they cannot add any number of \nother liberal wish lists to this bill.\n  Talk about an unjust situation confounding an unjust situation. I \ncannot believe that my colleagues are going to do that on the other \nside. They ought to be the first to say, get this bill through and do \nit and right this wrong.\n  When I was a Democrat we were concerned about people's feelings. We \nwere concerned about compassion. We were concerned about injustice. We \nwould move heaven and Earth to try to do something about it. But that \nis one reason I left the party. Politics is more important than \nanything else, I guess.\n  I am calling on my colleagues on the other side to do something about \nthis. This is a wrong that ought to be righted. This man has been \nmistreated, and so have his colleagues. His reputation has been smeared \nand besmirched. And everybody in this body knows it, and everybody in \nthe other body. The other body acted with dispatch and reason and \ndignity and in a bipartisan way and passed this legislation. We are \ngoing to correct the legislation with Senate legislation and send it \nback. And it will pass overwhelmingly over there. And if we play a two-\nbit game of not invoking cloture tomorrow I think that is pathetic.\n  I challenge my colleagues to wake up and quit playing politics with \nstuff like this. There is a place and a time to filibuster. There is a \nplace and a time to bring up the minimum wage. This is not one of them. \nI would be ashamed not to see this bill just pass right through \nespecially since nobody over there is going to speak against it, or if \nthey are I would like to hear what they have to say because I am \nprepared to rebut anything they say. And I mean I am really prepared. \nAnd they better expect a rough time if somebody came on this floor and \nsaid that Billy Dale should not be reimbursed.\n  Where is the compassion the Democrats say they have? Where is the \nfairness? Where is the care for somebody who has been besmirched, and \neverybody admits it, who had to go through 2\\1/2\\ years of being \nbrutalized in a full-fledged criminal trial where it got so bad and his \nexpenses were so high and his family was going down the drain that the \nfellow was ready to even take a guilty plea or a plea to a minor \noffense in order to get the doggone ordeal over, which happens from \ntime to time to innocent people. Fortunately, it went to the jury, and \nin this country, having tried hundreds of jury cases, hundreds of them, \nI have to tell you, I believe in that jury system.\n  After the O.J. Simpson vote, I was interrogated on that, and I said I \nwill go with the jury. I may have my own opinions, but I am going to go \nwith the jury. In this case there is no question about it, and \neverybody pretty much admits it.\n  If we are going to play games with this type of stuff--I do not mind \nmy friends on the other side finding fault and hustling against \nlegislation they despise or think is wrong. I do mind it on this \nlegislation.\n  Let me tell you something. There are two sides to the minimum wage. \nThere are two sides to abortion. There are two sides to all these buzz \nissues. There are not two sides to this issue. There is one side. And I \ndo not know anybody who could rebut it or who would have the temerity \nto come out here and try to rebut it.\n  So I think it is time to quit playing games with something like this.\n  Surely, the tree was tied up. I was not here, but it was tied up \nbecause we did not want any games played on something that will right \nthe injustices of the past like this bill does.\n  I am calling on my colleagues on the other side to give some \nconsideration to not just me as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwho has tried to work with them in so many ways, but to their own \nPresident who said he supports this legislation and get it over with. \nIt is to their advantage to get it over with rather than have to beat \nthis to death over the next few days. I do not want to stand here and \njust keep pointing out the White House deficiencies on it. I wish to \nright this wrong, get it over with and then not talk about it anymore.\n\n  So I am calling on my friends on the other side to give some \nconsideration to the work that some of us are doing. I know they feel \ndeeply about the minimum wage. Some on our side feel deeply on the \nother side, and there is going to be a battle on minimum wage sooner or \nlater around here. This is just not the right vehicle to bring the \ncomplaint about, have someone to bring up their special amendments on \nthis. I think this is the time to do what is right.\n  If the President said he opposed it, OK, I can accept it. But I am \ncalling on the President of the United States to get with it as my \nfriend and the friend of every Democrat over here and to talk to our \ncolleagues on the other side and to say look, fellows, men and women on \nthe Democratic side of the floor, this is something that has to be done \nand it should not be delayed and it ought to be done now.\n  I am calling on the President of the United States to see that this \ngets done. I expect to do my very best to get it done, and I hope this \nrumor that I am hearing is not true. If it is, I have to say that the \ncomity in this body is just breaking down. I do not want to see that \nhappen because there are a few of us who want to see things resolved. A \nfew of us want to resolve some of these problems. Where we have head-\nbutting things where both sides feel very deeply, that is another \nmatter. But on most matters around here we will resolve them, and this \nmatter should not even be in question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I heard the statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, and I did not even have my television \nmonitor on.\n  I wish to begin in my response in agreement with what the Senator has \njust articulated. I believe as he believes, and there is no one who \ncares more deeply about comity in this body than does the distinguished \nSenator from Utah--about the need for comity, about the need for ways \nin which to resolve our differences in a reasonable way, in a \nbipartisan or nonpartisan way, and that ought to extend to legislation \nthat may divide us as well. As he has indicated, this bill does not \ndivide us. I do not know that there will be a vote against this \nparticular piece of legislation when we get to that point.\n\n  I think the Senator from Utah understandably underestimates the \nextraordinary frustration that Democrats are feeling given the current \ncircumstances. We were told that the so-called Presidio bill was not \nthe bill with which to offer the minimum wage amendment, and it was \ndropped. We were told then that the term limits bill was not the bill \nwith which to offer the minimum wage amendment, and it was dropped. We \nwere told that the immigration bill was not the bill with which to \noffer the minimum wage amendment, and again it was dropped.\n  On bill after bill after bill after bill after bill, the Republicans \nhave said this is not the bill, this is not the legislation, and in \nfact in most cases, whether it was the Presidio legislation or \nimmigration, in many of those cases we then voted for cloture in an \neffort to move this process along in the name of comity, in the name of \ntrying to resolve the pending issue because, as the distinguished \nSenator from Utah said, we ought to be able to do that.\n  And we have also said, look, we will agree to a time certain. We will \nagree not only to a time certain with regard to how much time is \nactually devoted to the debate on minimum wage, we will take a half \nhour and a vote; we will do it this afternoon, tonight, tomorrow. If \nthat cannot be done as part of an amendment to a bill, we will take it \nstanding alone any time in the next\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nfew weeks. Tell us when. And that too has been denied us.\n  So, Mr. President, I have to ask, what does a guy do? How do you \nresolve this with comity? How do you resolve this in a way to try as \nbest we can to work through these issues and yet be sure that we as \nDemocrats are given an opportunity to address a very important issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. When I finish, I will be happy to yield. I would be more \nthan pleased to enter into a dialog with my colleague from Utah but let \nme just finish some thoughts here.\n  I am disappointed, frankly, after all these weeks and with all of \nthese good-faith efforts made, as amendments have come up, as bills \nhave been considered, that we have not been able to resolve this \nmatter. I do not know how much longer it will take, but I do know this. \nIt appears more and more that many of our Republican colleagues \nsecretly desire to be in the House of Representatives. I would urge \nthem to run for the House of Representatives if that is their desire. \nIf they want the luxury of eliminating the opportunity for the minority \nto offer amendments, if they want the luxury of saying we are not going \nto have a debate about an issue that we do not want to debate, then run \nfor the House. I still think there may be some seats open this year. \nThey could try it even this year. My heavens, if you want to be in the \nSenate, if you want all the opportunities that the Senate provides us \nfor good, unlimited, open debate, then let us not act like the House of \nRepresentatives. Let us not foreclose every single option that Senators \nare supposed to have, to be able to consider and vote, consider \namendments and consider issues in a bona fide way, trying to work \nthrough our differences. That is what this is all about.\n\n  But to be shut off, bill after bill after bill after bill, and to be \ntold now this is not the bill either, in spite of the fact that we have \nunanimity on it, I ask the President, what should we do? We have no \nchoice, Mr. President. We have no choice but to make our colleagues \nunderstand that this is the U.S. Senate and in the U.S. Senate you \nought to be given opportunities.\n  I have a list here. I do not know, I do not think I will go through \nthem because it really does not serve any useful purpose, but I can \ngive you a list of Domenici amendments, Helms amendments, McCain \namendments, Roth amendments, Gramm amendments, Hatch amendments--you \nname it. We have amendments with just about every Republican name on \nthem that were not relevant to a bill in past years, in past \nCongresses, offered on that side and not precluded by the Democratic \nmajority at the time, because they thought it was important. They \nthought it was important.\n  So here we are. The roles are reversed. We are the minority. Now we \nare supposed to offer amendments in those situations where we are not \nable to get a bill to the floor, and what happens? It is becoming a \npattern. What happens is a bill is presented to the Senate floor and \nthe tree is filled. There are so many leaves on this tree it looks like \na forest in this place. I must tell you, it gets frustrating when we \nare not given the same opportunity we gave the minority when we were in \nthe majority.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Utah is frustrated. He is beginning to \nsense a little of the frustration we feel on our side. This minimum \nwage vote will happen. It is just too bad that it has not happened \nalready. There will be other votes that may not be comfortable votes. \nBut, my heavens, this is the U.S. Senate, and we ought to have an \nopportunity to debate them, vote them, have our differences and work \nthrough them. We ought to allow debates to take place.\n  Indeed, let me end where I began and where the Senator from Utah \nended: Let there be comity. Let there be a way in which to resolve \nthese matters in a good-faith manner. I am prepared to do that. I know \nhe is prepared to do that. The sooner it happens the better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to do that. I believe in \ncomity, and I have worked hard with my colleagues on the other side for \ncomity. There have been innumerable bills where the Democrats have \nbrought up not-relevant amendments throughout this process.\n\n  What has happened here is they think they have a good political issue \nin the minimum wage. There will be a vote on the minimum wage before \nthis year is out, there is no question. I do not blame the majority \nleader, who is acting no differently than the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Dakota when he was majority leader. I do not blame the \nmajority leader for wanting to be able to schedule that at the \nappropriate time, not on every bill.\n  Also, in my whole time in the Senate I do not remember a period of \ntime like the last 2 years where almost everything is filibustered, \nwhere it takes a cloture vote to be able to end the debate. I think \npart of that came because our friends on the other side did not like \nthe Contract With America. They did not want it to succeed. They have a \nright to fight against it, and they have a right to filibuster against \nthese--but not everything. I have to admit, as somebody who has \nutilized the filibuster in the past and is known as somebody who can \nutilize it, I have used it very sparingly, only on major issues where \nthere are clear-cut differences and where it is justified. But we have \nhad a virtual slowdown on everything.\n  Having said that, my colleagues on the other side have a right to do \nthat. I am not going to take that right away. In fact, I would fight to \nmy death for the filibuster rule. It is what makes us different from \nthe House of Representatives. I might also add, I do not know a Senator \nwho wants to go to the House of Representatives. I know a lot of \nMembers of the House who would like to come here, especially Democrats. \nI have to say I guess Republicans have that desire as well.\n  But to make a long story short, I do not believe that every bill has \nto be a bill where you cannot debate nonrelevant amendments, but this \nis one that passed 350 yeas to 43 nays in the House. It is a truly \nbipartisan bill, one that rights a terrific wrong that the White House \nbasically admits was done, one of which the President said, ``I support \nit. It is the right thing to do.'' And which I think my friends on the \nother side ought to accept.\n  Since nobody opposes this, why make this the cause celebre with \nregard to the minimum wage or any other special interest legislation \nthat either side would like to bring up? Both sides have their peculiar \nspecial interests. We all know that. Both sides are sincere on these \nspecial desires. But this is one where the President said he would \nsupport it. This is one where 350 Members of the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans, said they would support it, and only 43 were against it.\n\n  This is one where I think 100 Senators will support it, at least I \nbelieve 100 Senators would, because I think every Senator here knows \nthis is a terrific injustice. This bill is one that literally will not \nrepair the reputations and the lives of those who went through this \nhorrendous experience but will at least say to the public at large, and \nto them, that we in the Senate have some consideration for them, we \nhave some compassion, that we care for them, that we are sorry for what \nhappened, and what we can do, we will have done.\n  I happen to have a great deal of friendship for my friend from South \nDakota, the Democrat leader on the floor. There is no question that we \nare close friends. I cannot imagine, knowing him as well as I do, that \nhe would allow his party, his side to be so crass as to filibuster this \nbill or to even require a cloture vote. This side would be just a voice \nvote, although I would like to see everybody stand up and vote 100 to \nzip to support this bill. I really believe--I am just counseling my \ncolleague, whom I care for and he knows it--I really believe it is the \nright thing. We ought to get it over with, get it done, not spend a lot \nof time on it, let these people know Democrats and Republicans are \ntogether on this and not get involved in the quagmire of the minimum \nwage or anything else.\n  I know that is going to come up. I know it has to come up. I know our \nfriends in the minority have a right, have many rights, and there will \nbe many tough votes, as the distinguished Senator says, for both sides. \nThat is just the way it is, not only in a normal year but in a \nPresidential year in particular. But there are some things we\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\nshould do in a bipartisan way. We should not elevate it to the level of \nfilibuster. We should not elevate it to the level of trying to get one \nor the other side's own personal preferences, especially when the \nPresident supports it.\n  So I am calling on the President. I am calling on my colleagues on \nthe other side. I am calling on my friend, the minority leader, to \nthink this through and let us get this over with and do what is right \nand give these people a chance to walk away with at least some measure \nof dignity, even though they will never get their full reputations back \nin the eyes of some people. They have been scarred for life. The least \nwe can do is try to do some plastic surgery here to make the scars a \nlittle less reprehensible to them. I think we all ought to have the \ncompassion to do that.\n  That is all I am asking for. I can live with whatever the minority \nwants to do. I caution the minority to not do what I have heard might \nbe done and to really think this through and help me, as Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, to get this matter over and done with; get it over \nfor the White House and done. Once it is done, it will not be mentioned \nagain, to my knowledge, on the floor. Just go from there. I just think \nit makes sense to do that.\n  But I can live with anything. I have been around here a long time, \nand I have seen a lot of injustices before. But I think, if we delay \nthis and play games with this bill, then we will play games with \nanything. I think this would be a tremendous, manifest injustice. That \nis my opinion, but I think it is shared by a wide variety of people on \nboth sides of the aisle. I think really we ought to. There will be \nplenty of chances on other legislation, there will be plenty of chances \nto get the will of the minority done. I think, just work with the \nmajority leader. I think it will get done because I guarantee there is \ngoing to be a bill on it, but it is going to satisfy both sides if it \nhappens. It is not just going to be a one-sided bill.\n  I think there will be an appropriate time to do that. I just believe, \nand I think most people who look at this fairly believe, this is not \nthe bill you should be playing games with. Having said that, I respect \nmy dear colleague, I still love and appreciate him, and I know he has a \ntough job. I know he has to handle his side. But I hope he will urge \nthem to err on the side of caution, err on the side of doing what is \nright, err on the side of compassion, err on the side of rectifying \nwrongs that are clear-cut wrongs, err on the side of supporting the \nPresident.\n  I think if you do that, you will win a lot of respect from some \npeople who need to respect the minority as much as I do.\n  I just wanted to say those things. I feel deeply about it. I hope my \ncolleague can help me on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, once again, I commend the distinguished \nSenator from Utah for appealing to reason and calm. I was thinking just \nas I was listening to his thoughtful remarks about how easy it would be \nto easily insert the minimum wage as he made an appeal for compassion, \nfor doing what is right, for bipartisanship, for some appreciation of \nthe magnitude of this problem as it affects those people who are \ndirectly going to be the beneficiaries, should the legislation pass.\n  Indeed, one could make that case, that it is time for us to put aside \nour partisan differences and do what is right, recognize that it has \nbeen a long, long time--5 years--since we passed the minimum wage. The \npurchasing power is the lowest it has been now in 40 years.\n  I would be willing to commit this afternoon to the chairman of the \ncommittee that we will vote for cloture, we will vote for final passage \nif he can work with me this afternoon to get a commitment for an up-or-\ndown vote on minimum wage immediately following the vote on this \nparticular bill.\n  If we can do that, we have exactly what the two Senators currently on \nthe floor both want: Passage unanimously perhaps for this legislation, \na bill to provide for the expenses of those who were victimized by the \nunfortunate circumstances in the travel office, and then send a clear \nmessage to more than 14 million Americans, most of whom are heads of \nhousehold, that at long last we are going to give you a little more \nempowerment, we are going to give you a little more purchasing power. \nThat is really what this is all about. This is an effort to try to find \na way to address our mutual agendas, the majority's and the minority's.\n  I agree with so much of what he said, but I will disagree with one \npoint. He made the comment that he has never seen so many filibusters. \nLet me tell you, as one who served in the majority in the last few \nCongresses, this side in the 102d and the 103d Congress, our Republican \ncolleagues were the Babe Ruths of filibusters. We are still in the \nminor leagues when it comes to filibusters, when it comes to shutting \nthis place down.\n  At one point, there were 60 filibusters pending in a Congress. It was \nunbelievable. There was nothing we could do. There was no legislation \nwe could advance. And so we learned, hopefully well, and we will keep \ntrying to learn better, we will keep trying to apply the lessons given \nus in past Congresses to be effective as Members of the minority, but \nwe are not in that league yet. It is not even close.\n\n  When we have insisted on a filibuster in large measure is when we \nhave been prevented from being equal partners in the legislative \nprocess, when we have not been given an opportunity to offer \namendments, to participate in the debate, to have our say, to have some \nbalance here in striking this legislative comity that we do want.\n  So I hope we can resolve it. I hope we can find a way to work through \nthis. I hope that maybe this problem can be resolved in the next day. I \nwould like to see in the next 24 hours a way to resolve it once and for \nall. It is within our grasp. We need to do it. The sooner we do it, the \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague, and I have \nto tell you that I remember the days when Majority Leader Mitchell was \naccusing us of filibustering all the time. He would call up a bill and \nthen he would file cloture that very minute and accuse us of \nfilibustering where there was no intention to filibuster whatsoever.\n  Be that as it may, I think both sides have misused the filibuster \nfrom time to time. I think that is one of the points I made--it can be \noverused. I would still fight to my death to keep it alive, because it \nmakes this the freest legislative body in the world and it is a great \nprotection for the minority. I believe in that because I have been in \nthe minority and I know how tough it is to be in the minority. I have \nno qualms about saying to the minority leader that it is a tool that he \ncan use.\n  I am just suggesting, citing the minimum wage to show compassion \nright now is not the same as citing the Billy Dale matter where 100 \npeople here know he and his colleagues were very badly treated. There \nis not the same bipartisan support for the minimum wage.\n  There is a tremendous set of arguments against the minimum wage. I \nfeel very deeply myself. For instance, it is ridiculous to tell people \nwe have to give them a living wage when, in fact, people who are heads \nof families who are on the minimum wage have all kinds of other Federal \nbenefits that are added to get them way above the approximately $8,000 \nor $9,000 the minimum wage gives them, and we are paying for it as \ntaxpayers. So it is not like they are bereft and limited only to \nwhatever the minimum wage is.\n\n  There is the other argument, and a whole raft of arguments, about \nloss of youth jobs for especially impoverished youth and uneducated \nyouth; their opportunities for working are gone. We can go into that ad \ninfinitum. There are legitimate arguments against it, and there is a, \nalmost even, set of viewpoints concerning whether it should or should \nnot be enacted.\n  I can live with it one way or the other, to be honest with you, but I \nthink it is a mistake to keep raising the minimum wage and raising all \nthe other social benefits as well and, basically, decreasing youth jobs \nby the hundreds of thousands.\n  Be that as it may, that is an argument. There is not the same \nbipartisan belief in the minimum wage that there is in the Billy Dale \nbill. There are\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\nmany vehicles whereby the Democrats can raise cane about it and can \nfilibuster with regard to the minimum wage, but this should not be one \nof them. If the President was against the Billy Dale matter, I could \nunderstand it, but he is for it.\n  If the distinguished minority leader was against rectifying the \nwrongs done to Billy Dale and his associates, then I could understand \nthis, but he is for it. Are the other Democrats against the Billy Dale \nmatter? Of course not. They are for it, and the reason they are is \nbecause it is right.\n  I think there are things to raise filibusters about and things to \nvote against cloture on, and I certainly would fight to my death for \nthe minority's right to do that. But there are also things that are \nright and wrong, and the wrongs against Billy Dale and the way he was \ntreated by this White House ought to be rectified, and we could do it \nlike that.\n  We can do it by doing what we all know is right and not playing \naround with his reputation one more day. I find it unseemly that \nbecause of the difficulties over the minimum wage that our colleagues \non the other side might consider not letting this bill pass and getting \nit over with and doing what is right. What really makes it unseemly, in \nmy eyes, is that they had the majority for 2 years, between 1992 and \n1994. They had the majority. Where was the minimum wage then when they \nhad the majority? Why did they not pass it then? They not only had the \nSenate, they had the House. Where were all these compassionate minimum \nwage advocates in those 2 years?\n  Why is it suddenly in a Presidential year that our distinguished \nfriend from Massachusetts comes on, waving his arms, saying, ``Oh, we \nhave to do something about the minimum wage\"? Because he knew that 89 \npercent of the major media in this country who support Clinton were \ngoing to get excited and say, ``Oh, Bob Dole looks bad because he is \nnot for minimum wage.''\n  Come on, the people are not stupid. We know doggone well this is a \ngame to push up from the bottom so those in organized labor can make \ndemands at the top. They know that. It is a game that has been played \nfor years, and one reason we are going to get back into the \ninflationary cycle if we get suckered into doing that again.\n  But even if the minimum wage is right, if it is so right today, why \nwas it not right between 1992 and 1994? If I am shouting here, I hope \nthey can hear me outside the Chamber. Where were all the Democrats \nthen, these great saviors of the little people? Why, it was not \npolitically a great thing to do then because we would have pointed out \nhow many jobs would be lost for these disadvantaged young people that \ncannot get that first inception job. History shows that if they get \nthat inception job, it will not be long until they will be making a lot \nmore than the minimum wage.\n  But they have to get the job. I might add, that people who do not get \nthe job stay in poverty and on welfare. It is very insensitive to play \npolitics with the minimum wage. But if it seems important, if it is one \nof these absolute things that we have to have--I have listened now for \nweeks to the Senator from Massachusetts and others who are advocates \nfor the minimum wage.\n  It is easy to be advocates, boy, when you have the major media behind \nyou because of the recent polls that show who they do back--90 percent \nfor President Clinton. Where were they, these wonderful Democrats, \nthese wonderful liberals who are so concerned about all the little \npeople out there who think the minimum wage is such a tragedy? Where \nwere they between 1992 and 1994--tell me--when they had control of this \nbody, when they had control of the other body? Where were they?\n  Why all of a sudden in an election year to come out here and play \ngames with the minimum wage? Why would they use that gameplaying to \ndisrupt a bill to correct an absolute legal injustice that all of us \nadmit is a legal injustice caused by White House staff, caused by pure \nbrazen politics, caused by greed of people who supported the President?\n  Why would they want to continue to talk about this for days on end? \nYou would think they would have sense enough to get it over with, \nespecially since the President says, in the most sincere fashion \npossible, ``You were done wrong, Mr. Dale. And I support the efforts to \ntry and resolve that wrong.'' Let the President retire in dignity from \nthe Billy Dale fiasco.\n  The minimum wage--we can live to fight that another day. But even \nso--I am not going to call it hypocritical--but where were these \nwonderful saviors of the minimum wage in 1992, 1993, 1994? In fact, \nwhere were they when they took over the Senate in 1986, 1987, 1988? We \ndid pass one then, I guess. But where were they in 1992 and 1994 when \nthey controlled the Senate, they controlled the House? They could have \ndone anything they wanted to do. I guess it was not an election \nyear then. I guess because this President had won the heat was off, and \nthey could wait to take care of these people during an election year so \nthat they could score some political points.\n\n  That may be a little harsh. I will retract a little bit by saying \nthere are literally those who have never studied economics in this body \nwho really believe that the minimum wage needs to be raised because \nthey really believe that they are going to help people to support their \nfamilies with that extra 90 cents over 2 years.\n  Give me a break. It will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs for \ndisadvantaged youth who will never get a job after that, who, if they \nhad gotten a minimum wage job because they were not priced out of the \nmarketplace, would go on to make more money, get trained, have the \ndignity that comes from working, and so forth.\n  It really bothers me that that battle would be used to defeat or to \nstop or to deter resolving a gross manifest of injustice like what \nhappened to Billy Dale and his companions, which happened from this \nWhite House. It really is amazing to me, absolutely amazing.\n  The Democrats on the other side, who are so anxious to do something \nabout the minimum wage, did not do anything in 1993. They did not do \nanything in 1994. Why? Because they knew it was bad for the country. \nThey knew it was bad for the country. But today raising the minimum \nwage, they think, is good for Democrats, especially with their help in \nthe media. But you know there are articles starting to come out by \nthose who are thoughtful and reflecting on this, saying, with caution, \n``Be cautious with regard to raising the minimum wage. You may cause \nmore problems than you fix.''\n  Keep in mind for those out there who buy off on this language that \nyou cannot live on whatever the minimum wage is-- $4.25, $4.35 an \nhour--I agree, you cannot support a family on that. But this country is \nnot uncompassionate. When you add food stamps, and you add the earned-\nincome tax credit, and you add a whole raft of other social spending \nprograms, including Medicare and Medicaid, when you add all kinds of \nsocial welfare benefits that they are entitled to under our current \nbudget, nobody who runs a family lives on the minimum wage.\n  The fact of the matter is, they are entitled to these even if they \nwork for the minimum wage. You are talking about an average family \nincome of well over $13,000 a year that is well above what an increase \nin the minimum wage, this 90-cent increase, would do at $5.25. Where \nwere these people in 1992, 1993, and 1994? Where were they over the \nlast 5 years, if it is so important? Why were they not out here getting \nit done since they controlled both Houses of Congress, and in 1993 and \n1994 controlled the Presidency too?\n\n  Where were the unions at that time demanding the minimum wage to be \nincreased? I did not hear any real ruffling by the unions or anybody \nelse. The reason was, they know doggone well that increasing the \nminimum wage is no panacea, that it does not solve the problems. You \nare still going to have to face the problems. And the best way to do \nthat is straight up, and with opportunity, economic opportunity, not \nfalse mandating, further mandates on the backs of the American people.\n  If we had not passed the unfunded mandates bill, I would say, well, \nmaybe there is a better logical argument for the minimum wage. The fact \nis, we passed it, and this is a mandate on the backs of American \nbusiness of $1 billion annually. That is something to think about. Why \nwould we do that if we think the unfunded mandates bill is so \nimportant, which passed overwhelmingly here in the United States? I \ncould go on and on. But my point is, I hope\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\nour colleagues on the other side will think better by tomorrow morning.\n  This ought to pass on a voice vote. I would prefer to have a vote on \nit just so everybody will know there are 100 Senators who want to right \nthis injustice or the series of injustices and these wrongs and who \nwant to support the President. And in doing so, the President had the \nguts to stand up and say, ``Yes. The White House did wrong here. And we \nshould rectify this.'' I respect him for that. I think we all should.\n  But if we have a filibuster tomorrow, I am going to have a rough time \nrespecting anybody who participates in that under these circumstances, \nespecially since it passed the House 250 to 43. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate an \ninnovative and dedicated New Hampshire elementary school principal, Jay \nRoy, on receiving the prestigious 1996 Cablevision Educator Award. Each \nyear Continental Cablevision sponsors the Educator\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nAwards Program to recognize teachers, librarians, media specialists, \nand administrators for their innovative use of Cable in the Classroom \nprogramming and the development of successful technology-based \nprojects.\n  Jay was specifically recognized for his role in the development of a \nvideo-yearbook program at Rollinsford Grade School in Rollinsford, NH. \nFifth and sixth grade students at Rollinsford Grade School use the \ndaily CNN Newsroom program and Continental's original ``Master \nControl'' show to analyze and understand the elements of television \nproductions. The students then use the skills they have mastered to \nproduce a video-yearbook, which is sold to students, parents, and \nschool staff. Proceeds from the video-yearbook sales enable the school \nto purchase technology related products.\n  Continental Cablevision's director of government and public affairs, \nTom O'Rourke, praised Jay's project because it addressed both \ntelevision production techniques and media literary skills. O'Rourke \nalso added that the judges were especially impressed with Jay's \ninnovative use of the project as a fundraiser, and the subsequent \nreinvestment of those funds in technology. In addition to Jay's \nEducator Award, Continental Cablevision will present the Rollinsford \nGrade School with a $500 grant for video equipment.\n  As a former teacher myself, I understand the personal dedication, \nhard work, and innovation necessary to better prepare the most valuable \nresource we have in America today--our children. I am proud to honor \nJay for donating his time and talents to help New Hampshire's best and \nbrightest students learn how to use technology in their lives. I \ncongratulate Jay for this prestigious recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4724-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEROES IN MONTANA\n\n   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor three \nindividuals who are heroes in my State of Montana. They live in eastern \nMontana, an open spread of plains and rolling prairie. They vary in \nage, background, and experience. But they do have one thing in common: \nEach person merits recognition for extraordinary acts of courage.\n  Shirl Pinto of Lame Deer was recognized in April by Attorney General \nJanet Reno, who presented her with the Crime Victim Service Award, 1 of \nonly 13 in the Nation, for her work as a victim's advocate. I know \nShirl's family--she and her husband Rick Robinson, who heads up the \nLame Deer Boys and Girls Club, and their children, are dedicated to \nproviding safe haven for women and children. Shirl is on call 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week, directing Healing Hearts, which is a shelter for \nvictims of domestic violence. Her family knows she is devoted to her \ncommunity--she has managed to make a big difference in the lives of so \nmany people with few resources and great barriers to overcome.\n  Candice Rush is a 15-year-old from Sidney who rescued Lindsay Clayton \nof Glendive from a near-fatal drowning in a reservoir last summer. In \nher nomination statement of Candice for an American Red Cross \nCertificate of Merit, Lindsay related how she panicked after cramping \nup while swimming halfway across a reservoir. She grabbed onto a friend \nwho was also in danger of being pulled under. Candice, who had received \ntraining as a lifeguard, swam to Lindsay, cleared away other swimmers \nwho were trying to help, gripped Lindsay from the back and swam to the \nshore. Lindsay recounted how she was so scared and weak that she \nliterally could not stand up on the shore. Candice displayed a cool \nhead and used her training to save Lindsay's life--something neither \nLindsay nor her family will ever forget. This kind of courage should be \nrecognized.\n  Dakota Taylor, a 7-year-old, stopped by his friend's house in \nWhitewater, a small town near the Canadian border, and noticed \nsomething smoking in the fireplace. Dakota made sure that his clothing \nwould not catch fire and then put out the smoldering material with \nwater--one glass at a time. He then notified the family. Without his \nquick action, it is very likely his friend and his family would not \nhave a house to live in today.\n  I am inspired by knowing of people like Shirl, Candice, and Dakota \nwho have displayed courage, thoughtfulness, and leadership--qualities \nthat we all seek in our daily lives. On behalf of myself and the rest \nof Montana, I am proud to recognize these individuals on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4725-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4725-S4726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 85TH BIRTHDAY OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on the occasion of President Ronald \nReagan's 85th birthday, the Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed piece by \nTrude Feldman, which payed tribute to this extraordinary man and his \nlifetime of achievements. As a great admirer and friend of President \nReagan, I am pleased to bring this article to the attention of my \ncolleagues. I ask that the op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  The op-ed follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 5, 1996]\n\n                Ronald Reagan at 85: A Birthday Tribute\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       Tomorrow Ronald Reagan celebrates his 85th birthday, thus \n     becoming the fifth American president to reach that \n     milestone. ``The anniversaries of my birth aren't \n     important,'' he once told me. ``What is important is that \n     I've tried to lead a meaningful life, and I think I have.''\n       The meaning of his extraordinary life goes beyond his \n     various achievements as our 40th president. Those \n     achievements would not have been possible were it not for a \n     moral fiber and affability that most Americans expect but \n     seldom get from their presidents. While Ronald Reagan's \n     ethics and principles played a major role in his efforts to \n     balance economic growth with true human needs, his courage \n     and steadfast convictions helped set a new, positive \n     direction for America--lifting it from a feeling of \n     discouragement, and giving the people renewed confidence and \n     pride in their nation. His commitment also served as the \n     necessary catalyst in developments that led to the end of the \n     Cold War.\n       In an era of cynicism about the character and veracity of \n     political leaders, Mr. Reagan's integrity and vision warrant \n     particular attention on this, the 85th anniversary of his \n     birth.\n\n\n                       the ``great communicator''\n\n       His courage as the ``Great Communicator'' was evident in \n     his dramatic open letter 15 months ago in which he revealed \n     that he had been diagnosed with the early stages of \n     Alzheimer's disease. His handwritten letter was poignant, and \n     vintage Reagan. Afflicted with the irreversible neurological \n     disorder, he wrote that ``In sharing the news it might \n     promote greater awareness of this condition . . . I intend to \n     live the remainder of the years God gives me, doing the \n     things I've always done. I now begin the journey that will \n     lead me into the sunset of my life.''\n       Colin Powell is among the millions who were moved by Mr. \n     Reagan's gesture. ``It was a beautiful personal letter to \n     everyone,'' Gen. Powell told me. ``Frankly, that action made \n     it easier for me to deal with my wife's depression when it \n     became public.''\n       During a conversation I had with Ronald Reagan last year, \n     he wondered aloud whether he had inherited the illness from \n     his mother. Alzheimer's may have somewhat diminished his \n     spark, but Mr. Reagan's genuineness and charisma still shine \n     through. Away from the Oval Office for seven years now, he \n     still looks presidential. Routinely working in his office, he \n     continues to captivate visitors with his inimitable \n     personality and attentiveness.\n       His dark brown hair is now tinged with a bit of gray, and \n     he remains the model of good grooming and fashion. One day \n     last week, he was his old handsome self attired in a blue \n     pinstripe suit and blue tie, accentuated by a gold tie \n     clip in the shape of the state of California, where he \n     served eight years as governor. ``The reason I'm doing as \n     well as I am,'' he says, ``is because of loving support \n     from Nancy [his wife of 44 years]. She is my comfort, and \n     has enhanced my life just by being a part of it. She has \n     made it so natural for us to be as one that we never face \n     anything alone.''\n       Mr. Reagan's close brush with death 15 years ago changed \n     his attitude toward life and death. It was on his 69th day as \n     president when, from a distance of 13 feet, I saw him shot by \n     a would-be assassin. Mr. Reagan told me the traumatic \n     experience had given him a greater appreciation of life that \n     he had previously taken for granted. ``My survival was a \n     miracle,'' he said. ``The ordeal strengthened my belief in \n     God and made me realize anew that His hand was on my \n     shoulder, that He has the say-so over my life. I often feel \n     as though I'm living on the extra time God has given me.''\n       When Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in Tampico, Ill., his \n     delivery was so complicated that his mother was cautioned not \n     to bear more children. So she doted on him and soon became \n     the primary influence in his life. From her, he acquired the \n     stability and confidence that later enabled him to weather \n     personal and political storms with equanimity. She fostered \n     in him and his brother an incentive to work hard, and to live \n     by the Ten Commandments and by the Golden Rule.\n       ``My parents were rich in their live and wisdom, and \n     endowed us with spiritual strength and the confidence that \n     comes with a parent's affection and guidance,'' the\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\n     former president told me. ``The Reagans of Illinois had \n     little in material terms, but we were emotionally healthy.''\n       The Rev. Billy Graham describes Ronald Reagan as a man of \n     compassion and devotion, a president whom America will \n     remember with pride. ``He is one of the cleanest, most moral \n     and spiritual men I know,'' Mr. Graham told me. ``In the \n     scores of times we were together, he has always wanted to \n     talk about spiritual things.''\n       On many occasions over the past 21 years, Mr. Reagan shared \n     with me his philosophies and his views on politics, foreign \n     affairs, religion and human nature. ``I believe that each \n     person is innately good,'' he observed. ``But those who act \n     immorally do so because they allow greed and ambition to \n     overtake their basic goodness.''\n       These beliefs, while the source of many of his greatest \n     triumphs, also set the stage for some of his disappointments. \n     One regret was that he did not demand greater accountability \n     from his a staff--``especially those who abused their power \n     with arrogance.'' He acknowledged that the tendency not to \n     fire anyone had serious ramifications. ``For instance, any \n     errors in our dialogues with Iran resulted because some of my \n     subordinates exceeded their instructions without reporting \n     back to me,'' he stressed. ``When I read the Tower Commission \n     Report, it looked as if some staff members had taken off on \n     their own.''\n       Another issue that troubled him was the public perception \n     that he was prejudiced against minority groups and not \n     concerned about the poor. He maintains that he had fought for \n     legislation that would make welfare programs more effective. \n     ``My economic program was based on encouraging businessmen to \n     create more jobs and to better the conditions of their \n     employees,'' he noted. ``I think I succeeded.''\n       On the day before his presidency ended, Mr. Reagan granted \n     me his last interview in the Oval Office. He told me that the \n     saddest day of his eight-year tenure was on Oct. 23, 1983, \n     when 241 U.S. servicemen died in a terrorist bombing in \n     Beirut, Lebanon. ``To save our men from being killed by \n     sniper from private armies that were causing trouble in \n     Lebanon, it was decided to shelter them in a concrete-\n     reinforced building,'' he recalled. ``But no one foresaw \n     that a suicide driver with a truck load of explosives \n     would drive into the building and blow it up.''\n       At the close of that Oval Office interview, I asked him to \n     describe his presidency in one line. ``We won the Cold War,'' \n     he said without hesitation. ``That phrase didn't originate \n     with me, but I'll settle form it. What counts is that there \n     is an end to the Cold War, and I now feel justified in my \n     theme of `Peace Through Strength.'\n       Former President George Bush adds: ``Ronald Reagan's \n     foresight put us in a position to change our relationship \n     with the Soviet Union and to make it possible for the changes \n     that took place in Eastern Europe. And he certainly helped \n     bring democracy to our hemisphere.''\n       Mr. Bush, having worked closely with Mr. Reagan as his vice \n     president, also told me: ``True, he was a man of principle on \n     the issues. But, even more than that, the American people \n     loved him for his genuine decency, his unfailing kindness and \n     his great sense of humor. He is a true believer in the \n     goodness of America.''\n\n\n                            The finest gift\n\n       Edwin Meese III, former attorney general, notes that Mr. \n     Reagan's legacy to America continues to this day. ``Many are \n     calling the congressional leadership's agenda the Second \n     Reagan Revolution,'' he says. ``More importantly, Mr. Reagan \n     continues to inspire Americans of all ages to value the \n     patriotism and leadership which he so splendidly \n     demonstrated.''\n       Longtime Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger concurs, adding: History \n     will surely record that the finest birthday gift already \n     given to Mr. Reagan by Americans is a Republican House and \n     Senate that are determined to carry on the Reagan \n     Revolution.''\n       Yet Mr. Reagan says that the best birthday gift for him \n     this year would be that scientists receive the support they \n     need to fund a treatment and a cure for Alzheimer's so that \n     others will be spared the anguish that the illness causes.\n       Ever the altruist, Ronald Reagan--even for his birthday \n     wish--places the welfare of others above his own. It is a \n     characteristic that has served him faithfully until now, and \n     is one that will sustain him on his ``journey into the \n     sunset'' of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4725-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WARD VALLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, spoke on the \nfloor earlier today in favor of S. 1596, which would transfer federally \nowned land in Ward Valley, CA, to the State of California for the \npurpose of building a low-level radioactive waste dump. I want to set \nthe record straight and briefly explain why S. 1596 is not in the best \ninterest of the people my State of California.\n  I am opposed to S. 1596 because it circumvents the efforts of many \nCalifornians and the administration to put safety first and to ensure \nthe safety of the drinking water supply of over 12 million California \ncitizens.\n  S. 1596 amounts to an unconditional transfer of Federal land in \nviolation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 which \nrequires the Secretary of Interior to include ``such terms, covenants, \nconditions and reservations as he deems necessary to ensure * * * \nprotection of the public interest.''\n  In May 1995 the administration announced its commitment to transfer \nthe Federal land to the State subject to receiving a binding commitment \nfrom the State of California that the additional safeguards recommended \nby a National Academy of Sciences panel be carried out; that the total \nvolume and radioactivity of the material to be disposed of at the site \nwould be limited to the amounts currently specified in the State \nlicense for the facility, and that there be a specific limit on \nplutonium deposited at Ward Valley. The State refused to enter into any \nkind of enforceable agreement.\n  Lack of cooperation from the State and the discovery of evidence that \nmay indicate radioactive leakage to groundwater at a site of similar \ncharacteristics in Beatty, NV, led the administration to announce in \nFebruary 1996 that it will carry out a supplemental environmental \nimpact statement and perform key safety tests at the Ward Valley site \nbefore proceeding with the transfer.\n  The bill transfers the land for a payment of $500,100, and a \nnonbinding, nonenforceable letter from Governor Wilson to the Chairman \nof the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the State will ``carry out \nenvironmental monitoring and protection measures based on \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.''\n  The bill is another end-run at a process that needs to put the health \nand safety of California citizens first. It undermines the safety first \napproach that we have been pursing together with the \nadministration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4726-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4726-S4730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1995                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Connie Mack:                                                                                                                                                                            \n    Ireland................................

and\n       (B) has been convicted of a criminal offense under Federal \n     or State law and who--\n       (i) is not in lawful immigration status in the United \n     States, or\n       (ii) on the basis of conviction for a criminal offense \n     under Federal or State law, or on any other basis, is subject \n     to deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n\n     for the duration of the prison term to which the alien was \n     sentenced for the offense referred to in subparagraph (B). \n     Any such agreement may provide for the release of such alien \n     pursuant to parole procedures of that country.\n       (2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the \n     President may consider providing for appropriate \n     compensation, subject to the availability of appropriations, \n     in cases where the United States is able to independently \n     verify the adequacy of the sites where aliens will be \n     imprisoned and the length of time the alien is actually \n     incarcerated in the foreign country under such a treaty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements should \n     be--\n       (A) to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the \n     United States who are (or are about to be) incarcerated in \n     United States prisons,\n       (B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the \n     balance of the sentence imposed by the United States courts,\n       (C) to eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to \n     such a transfer, and\n       (D) to allow the Federal Government or the States to keep \n     their original prison sentences in force so that transferred \n     prisoners who return to the United States prior to the \n     completion of their original United States sentences can be \n     returned to custody for the balance of their prisons \n     sentences;\n       (2) the Secretary of State should give priority to \n     concluding an agreement with any country for which the \n     President determines that the number of aliens described in \n     subsection (a) who are nationals of that country in the \n     United States represents a significant percentage of all such \n     aliens in the United States; and\n       (3) no new treaty providing for the transfer of aliens from \n     Federal, State, or local incarceration facilities to a \n     foreign incarceration facility should permit the alien to \n     refuse the transfer.\n       (c) Prisoner Consent.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, except as required by treaty, the transfer of an \n     alien from a Federal, State, or local incarceration facility \n     under an agreement of the type referred to in subsection (a) \n     shall not require consent of the alien.\n       (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the \n     Senate stating whether each prisoner transfer treaty to which \n     the United States is a party has been effective in the \n     preceding 12 months in bringing about the return of \n     deportable incarcerated aliens to the country of which they \n     are nationals and in ensuring that they serve the balance of \n     their sentences.\n       (e) Training Foreign Law Enforcement Personnel.--(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (2), the President shall direct the \n     Border Patrol Academy and the Customs Service Academy to \n     enroll for training an appropriate number of foreign law \n     enforcement personnel, and shall make appointments of foreign \n     law enforcement personnel to such academies, as necessary to \n     further the following United States law enforcement goals:\n       (A) prevention of drug smuggling and other cross-border \n     criminal activity;\n       (B) preventing illegal immigration;

MAIL-ORDER BRIDE BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) There is a substantial ``mail-order bride'' business in \n     the United States. With approximately 200 companies in the \n     United States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 American men find \n     wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year. However, \n     there are no official statistics available on the number of \n     mail-order brides entering the United States each year.\n       (2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business \n     earn substantial profits from their businesses.\n       (3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, \n     in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-\n     order brides often find themselves in abusive relationships. \n     There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number \n     of mail-order marriages constitute marriage fraud under \n     United States law.\n       (4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States \n     unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-\n     order brides who are battered spouses often think that if \n     they flee an abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often \n     the citizen spouse threatens to have them deported if they \n     report the abuse.\n       (5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates \n     the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals and \n     United States citizens or legal permanent residents as eight \n     percent. It is unclear what percent of those marriage fraud \n     cases originated as mail-order marriages.\n       (b) Information Dissemination.--Each international \n     matchmaking organization doing business in the United States \n     shall disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such \n     immigration and naturalization information as the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service deems appropriate, in the \n     recruit's native language, including information regarding \n     conditional permanent residence status, permanent resident \n     status, the battered spouse waiver of conditional permanent \n     resident status requirement, marriage fraud penalties, \n     immigrants' rights, the unregulated nature of the business, \n     and the study mandated in subsection (c).\n       (c) Study.--The Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and the \n     Violence Against Women Office of the Department of Justice, \n     shall conduct a study to determine, among other things--\n       (1) the number of mail-order marriages;\n       (2) the extent of marriage fraud arising as a result of the \n     services provided by international matchmaking organizations;\n       (3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize section \n     244(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act providing \n     for waiver of deportation in the event of abuse, or section \n     204(a)(1)(A)(iii) of such Act providing for self-petitioning \n     for permanent resident status;\n       (4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order marriages; \n     and\n       (5) the need for continued or expanded regulation and \n     education to implement the objectives of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994 in this area.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report to the Congress setting forth the results of the study \n     conducted under subsection (c).\n       (e) Civil Penalty.--(1) The Attorney General shall impose a \n     civil penalty of not to exceed $20,000 for each violation of \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Any penalty under paragraph (1) may be imposed only \n     after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the \n     record in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title \n     5, United States Code.\n       (f) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) International matchmaking organization.--The term \n     ``international matchmaking organization'' means a \n     corporation, partnership, business, or other legal entity, \n     whether or not organized under the laws of the United States \n     or any State, that does business in the United States and for \n     profit offers to United States citizens or permanent resident \n     aliens, dating, matrimonial, or social referral services to \n     nonresident, noncitizens, by--\n       (A) an exchange of names, telephone numbers, addresses, or \n     statistics;\n       (B) selection of photographs; or\n       (C) a social environment provided by the organization in a \n     country other than the United States.\n       (2) Recruit.--The term ``recruit'' means a noncitizen, \n     nonresident person, recruited by the international \n     matchmaking organization for the purpose of providing dating, \n     matrimonial, or social referral services to United States \n     citizens or permanent resident aliens.\n\n     SEC. 313.

Suit \n     on any such bonds may be brought under the terms and \n     conditions set forth in section 213 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act.\n       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall issue \n     regulations for establishing the pilot programs, including--\n       (1) criteria and procedures for--\n       (A) certifying bonding companies for participation in the \n     program, and\n       (B) debarment of any such company that fails to pay a bond, \n     and\n       (2) criteria for setting the amount of the bond to assure \n     that the bond is in an amount that is not less than the cost \n     of providing benefits under the programs described in section \n     241(a)(5)(D) for the alien and the alien's dependents for 6 \n     months.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n       (d) Annual Reporting Requirement.--The Attorney General \n     shall report annually to Congress on the effectiveness of the \n     pilot program, once within 9 months and again within 1 year \n     and 9 months after the pilot program begins operating.\n       (e) Sunset.--The pilot program shall sunset after 2 years \n     of operation.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n     SEC. 316.

Among other things, the Comptroller \n     General shall review the program to determine--\n       (1) that the program ensures that an adequate supply of \n     qualified United States workers is available at the time and \n     place needed for employers seeking such workers after the \n     date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) that the program ensures that there is timely approval \n     of applications for temporary foreign workers under the H-2A \n     nonimmigrant worker program in the event of shortages of \n     United States workers after the date of enactment of this \n     Act;\n       (3) that the program ensures that implementation of the H-\n     2A nonimmigrant worker program is not displacing United \n     States agricultural workers or diminishing the terms and \n     conditions of employment of United States agricultural \n     workers; and\n       (4) if and to what extent the H-2A nonimmigrant worker \n     program is contributing to the problem of illegal \n     immigration.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than December 31, 1996, or three \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, whichever is \n     sooner, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to \n     Congress setting forth the findings of the review conducted \n     under subsection (b).\n       (d) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``Comptroller General'' means the Comptroller \n     General of the United States; and\n       (2) the term ``H-2A nonimmigrant worker program'' means the \n     program for the admission of nonimmigrant aliens described in \n     section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act.\n\n     SEC. 322. FINDINGS RELATED TO THE ROLE OF INTERIOR BORDER \n                   PATROL STATIONS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service has drafted \n     a preliminary plan for the removal of 200 Border Patrol \n     agents from interior stations and the transfer of these \n     agents to the Southwest border.\n       (2) The INS has stated that it intends to carry out this \n     transfer without disrupting service and support to the \n     communities in which interior stations are located.\n       (3) Briefings conducted by INS personnel in communities \n     with interior Border Patrol stations have revealed that \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations, particularly those \n     located in Southwest border States, perform valuable law \n     enforcement functions that cannot be performed by other INS \n     personnel.\n       (4) The transfer of 200 Border Patrol agents from interior \n     stations to the Southwest border, which would not increase \n     the total number of law enforcement personnel at INS, would \n     cost the Federal Government approximately $12,000,000.\n       (5) The cost to the Federal Government of hiring new \n     criminal investigators and other personnel for interior \n     stations is likely to be greater than the cost of retaining \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations.\n       (6) The first recommendation of the report by the National \n     Task Force on Immigration was to increase the number of \n     Border Patrol agents at the interior stations.\n       (7) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) the United States Border Patrol plays a key role in \n     apprehending and deporting undocumented aliens throughout the \n     United States;\n       (B) interior Border Patrol stations play a unique and \n     critical role in the agency's enforcement mission and serve \n     as an invaluable second line of defense in controlling \n     illegal immigration and its penetration to the interior of \n     our country;\n       (C) a permanent redeployment of Border Patrol agents from \n     interior stations is not the most\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\n     cost-effective way to meet enforcement needs along the \n     Southwest border, and should only be done where new Border \n     Patrol agents cannot practicably be assigned to meet \n     enforcement needs along the Southwest border; and\n       (D) the INS should hire, train and assign new staff based \n     on a strong Border Patrol presence both on the Southwest \n     border and in interior stations that support border \n     enforcement.\n\n     SEC. 323.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION \n                   OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in July 1993, Canadian Customs officers began \n     collecting an 11 percent New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax \n     (PST) tax on goods purchased in the United States by New \n     Brunswick residents, an action that has caused severe \n     economic harm to United States businesses located in \n     proximity to the border with New Brunswick;\n       (2) this impediment to cross-border trade compounds the \n     damage already done from the Canadian government's imposition \n     of a 7 percent tax on all goods bought by Canadians in the \n     United States;\n       (3) collection of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     goods purchased outside of New Brunswick is collected only \n     along the United States-Canadian border--not along New \n     Brunswick's borders with other Canadian provinces--thus being \n     administered by Canadian authorities in a manner uniquely \n     discriminatory to Canadians shopping in the United States;\n       (4) in February 1994, the United States Trade \n     Representative (USTR) publicly stated an intention to seek \n     redress from the discriminatory application of the PST under \n     the dispute resolution process in chapter 20 of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States \n     Government has still not made such a claim under NAFTA \n     procedures; and\n       (5) initially, the USTR argued that filing a PST claim was \n     delayed only because the dispute mechanism under NAFTA had \n     not yet been finalized, but more than a year after such \n     mechanism has been put in place, the PST claim has still not \n     been put forward by the USTR.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Provincial Sales Tax levied by the Canadian \n     Province of New Brunswick on Canadian citizens of that \n     province who purchase goods in the United States raises \n     questions about the possible violation of the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement in its discriminatory application to \n     cross-border trade with the United States and damages good \n     relations between the United States and Canada; and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should move \n     forward without further delay in seeking redress under the \n     dispute resolution process in chapter 20 of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement for the discriminatory \n     application of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     United States-Canada cross-border trade.\n\n     SEC. 335. FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the practice of female genital mutilation is carried \n     out by members of certain cultural and religious groups \n     within the United States;\n       (2) the practice of female genital mutilation often results \n     in the occurrence of physical and psychological health \n     effects that harm the women involved;\n       (3) such mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights \n     secured by Federal and State law, both statutory and \n     constitutional;\n       (4) the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of \n     female genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any \n     single State or local jurisdiction to control;\n       (5) the practice of female genital mutilation can be \n     prohibited without abridging the exercise of any rights \n     guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution or \n     under any other law; and\n       (6) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I, the necessary and proper clause, section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, as well as under the treaty clause of \n     the Constitution to enact such legislation.\n       (b) Criminal Conduct.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 116. Female genital mutilation\n\n       ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever \n     knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or \n     any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of \n     another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall \n     be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 \n     years, or both.\n       ``(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this \n     section if the operation is--\n       ``(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is \n     performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place \n     of its performance as a medical practitioner; or\n       ``(2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given \n     birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with \n     that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is \n     performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in \n     training to become such a practitioner or midwife.\n       ``(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be \n     taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to \n     be performed of any belief on the part of that or any other \n     person that the operation is required as a matter of custom \n     or ritual.\n       ``(d) Whoever knowingly denies to any person medical care \n     or services or otherwise discriminates against any person in \n     the provision of medical care or services, because--\n       ``(1) that person has undergone female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation; or\n       ``(2) that person has requested that female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation be performed on any person;\n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``116. Female genital mutilation.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--Subsection (b) shall take effect on \n     the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4730-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 7, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, for the information of all of my colleagues, \nwe will resume consideration of the White House Travel Office \nlegislation tomorrow morning. There will be a cloture vote at 2:15 on \nthat measure, and under the rules of cloture, second-degree amendments \nmust be filed with the clerk by 12:30 on Tuesday. It is hoped the \nSenate could dispose of the White House Travel Office bill by the close \nof business Tuesday. Rollcall votes could therefore be expected \nthroughout Tuesday's session of the Senate.\n  As I understand it, there really is no objection to the underlying \nbill, the travel office bill, the reimbursement to Billy Dale and \nothers, and there should not be any objection. I guess the objection is \nwe filled up the tree, so to speak, and other additional amendments \ncannot be offered.\n  Tomorrow I will submit to the Democratic leader, my colleague, \nSenator Daschle, a proposal on gas tax. Tomorrow is tax freedom day. It \nwill be a great day to send a message, a small message but a message to \nthe American taxpayers that we are going to relieve at least some of \ntheir burden. It is about a $5 billion per year burden, a 4.3-cent gas \ntax which was made permanent in 1993 in the Clinton tax increase bill, \nwhich amounted to $265 billion. So we hope we might get consent to take \nup the gas tax, attach it to the taxpayers bill of rights, which is \npending at the desk, pass it with one amendment, send it to the House \nand the House will take action.\n  We are now working on how we pay for the repeal of the tax. Obviously \nwe want to pay for it. We are not going to add to the deficit. I will \nvisit with the Democratic leader about that tomorrow and also offer a \nproposal on minimum wage, where we might take up the minimum wage, \nunder what conditions, so that we might proceed with the business of \nthe Senate and not have to file cloture on every bill.\n  I know the Democrats feel strongly about their issues. We feel \nstrongly\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nabout some of ours. So, hopefully, we can resolve these by agreement. \nIf not, we will just have to see what happens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/06/senate-section/article/S4760-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
